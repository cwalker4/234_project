00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.177
Good afternoon.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:12.258
It's a real pleasure
to do another TED Talk.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:16.048
And today I'm going to talk
to you about you.

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.238
And share with you, hopefully,

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:22.748
an idea that's really made
a massive difference in my life

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:25.789
and hopefully could make
a massive difference in your life too.

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.809
I've spent my life, really,
studying human beings.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.470
When I was a kid,
I was the youngest of four,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.370
so I spent a lot of time
just watching my brothers and sisters

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.260
and seeing the mess
and the challenge that they got into,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.499
and trying to clock how I avoided that.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.131
Then I had the great fortune
of training as a physician,

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.091
and some of you may know

00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.941
that medical training
is the most incredible opportunity,

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:52.141
because you get up close
and personal with human suffering

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:55.271
on every single level, on a daily basis.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.792
I've been in a room where people
have died right in front of me,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.561
and it's a really profound moment.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.821
I've also been in a room
where life has come into the world;

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:09.263
I've delivered a number of children,
including three of my own four boys,

00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:11.203
one of whom is at the back -

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.213
Hi, son.

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:14.842
(Laughter)

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:17.842
(Son from the audience) Hi, dad!

00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:22.154
So medical training,
a fantastic experience.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:26.373
I became a researcher,
initially an immunologist,

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:28.974
and studied right down to the nano detail

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:33.126
of how our white blood cells
roll along the inside of our blood vessels

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.484
and with really clever adhesion molecules

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.555
stick and kind of squeeze out
between the endothelia cells

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.084
and fight infection.

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:44.125
More recently as a neuroscientist.
So right down at nano level.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:46.615
And also at a much bigger scale.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:50.815
I had the good fortune of working
with CEOs and leaders around the world

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:53.306
in some of our biggest companies
and multi-nationals,

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:56.347
looking at the hidden social dynamics
and the networks that exist

00:01:56.347 --> 00:01:59.676
that determine whether a company
succeeds or fails.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:01.277
As you heard,

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:04.618
I've worked with elite athletes,
helping them to win gold medals.

00:02:05.218 --> 00:02:07.778
I've read a lot, learned a lot.

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:11.808
And through all that time,
one question kept bothering me,

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:14.008
sort of eating away at my brain.

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.239
And that question was:

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.029
if you could teach yourself,
your children, or anybody one thing,

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.848
what would it be?

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:25.238
What would that one thing be?

00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:27.009
You can only teach one thing

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.150
of all the things
I've learned and understood,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.480
and it's that that I want
to share with you today.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.590
What is that one thing?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.510
I can tell you it's not "Eat an apple";
that's not what it is.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.641
We're going to talk about that.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.950
But before, I want to return, just,
to really the story of you.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.581
I don't know whether you remember,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.582
but there was a time
before you knew you existed.

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:51.961
For some of you that was probably
last Friday night, after a skinful.

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:52.961
(Laughter)

00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.392
But as we all grow up,
there's a moment in our life -

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:59.192
and this is a really
beautiful moment if you witness it -

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.193
where you can see, about one year old -

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:04.712
it might happen a bit sooner, a bit later,
but roughly about one year old -

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:08.253
where a child realizes they exist
as a physical entity.

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:11.733
It's that moment where they look
in the mirror, and they kind of go,

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.552
"Oh, that's me!"

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:15.484
They move their hand
and that hand moves,

00:03:15.484 --> 00:03:17.383
and they realize that that's them.

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:20.033
So they have a physical
awareness, if you will.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.244
But they haven't yet developed
an awareness of their emotional self,

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.245
which is why you get the terrible twos.

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.825
So when a two-year-old is hungry,

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:30.275
the world is hungry
and why aren't we eating?

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:34.735
So there's that kind of intensity,
that egocentricity in a two-year-old.

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:38.076
That's where they kind of get
to test the power.

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.276
So in the supermarket,

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:43.177
it's "Mom, mom, that that, me, me,
food, food, me, me, me, food,"

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:45.986
and they kind of bother you
to a great extent.

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:50.428
And then again, it's witnessable,
this moment where they suddenly realize

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.946
that not only are they
physically separate from you,

00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:55.908
but their emotions
are not your emotions.

00:03:55.908 --> 00:03:57.398
You may have witnessed this

00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:00.629
with a child walking down
the aisle in the supermarket,

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.317
eyes, streaming red,
bawling in frustration and rage

00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:07.233
that they can't get what they want,

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:10.009
and then looking at you
completely baffled,

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.479
like: "Why aren't you crying?"

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.909
"We're hungry;
we want those chocolates."

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.189
(Laughter)

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.037
There's that bafflement in their eyes,

00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:19.010
that sort of thousand yard stare.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.600
And that's the emergence
of the awareness of the emotional self,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.470
separate from the parent or the caregiver.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.210
So that's a sort of second level up,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.801
but it's not until they get
to three to six years old

00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:32.070
that they get into the "conceptual self,"

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.241
and part of that emergence
is a sense of identity.

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.380
So it's what you would know
as consciousness,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.442
is they start to become aware -

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:42.032
not only that they're physically,
emotionally separate,

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.972
but they've got an identity.

00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:46.231
And it blossoms between
three and six years old.

00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:47.692
One of the things that happens

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:49.982
in the emergence
of conceptual self is language.

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:53.983
So language is essentially a concept:
it's a noise to represent something.

00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:56.923
So the emergence
of conceptual self happens,

00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:59.303
and we start to label our universe -

00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:02.844
you know, cat, dog, bat, ball,
window, floor, and so on.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.134
So the world starts to make sense
and we start to be able to navigate.

00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:08.304
Children between the age
of three and six

00:05:08.304 --> 00:05:10.664
learn about six new words
every single day.

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.355
There's phenomenal
language acquisition going on.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.215
But only from the fourth level,

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:17.303
which is called concrete consciousness,

00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:20.955
they start to learn
the rules that govern the concepts.

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:23.126
Then it all starts to make sense:

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:25.106
why is a dog a dog and a cat a cat?

00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:27.026
Why is a mummy a mummy
and daddy a daddy?

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.315
What's the rule?

00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:31.265
It's in that between
six and nine years old

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.716
that the fun starts to happen.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:34.986
So if you speak to a seven-year-old,

00:05:34.986 --> 00:05:37.807
you can start to have fun
by playing against the rules -

00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:39.996
you know, look at that cat
going woof-woof?

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:41.018
No!

00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:45.448
Cats go meow! They don't go woof-woof.

00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:49.057
And it makes them laugh
because you're playing against the rules.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.827
There's this whole
rule emergence that occurs

00:05:51.827 --> 00:05:53.938
in a child between six and nine.

00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:57.488
And then that's where most people

00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:59.038
stay ...

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:01.818
(Laughter)

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:05.268
Most of the people
you're going to meet, 20, 30, 40,

00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:07.190
on the inside: nine!

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.059
(Laughter)

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:11.412
See it in accompanies all the time:

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.730
toys out of the pram,
behaving like children.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.070
It's very common.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.700
There is an attempt,
usually in the early teenage years,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.751
to get beyond that concrete self,
to get beyond the rules,

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.131
which is why you get teenage conflict.

00:06:23.131 --> 00:06:26.101
You'll see it, and parents
try to suppress this,

00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:27.261
like it's a bad thing.

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.562
It's a developmental stage!

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:31.701
You shouldn't be suppressing this stuff;
they're testing the rules.

00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.152
So this battle ensues:

00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:36.682
you told me to be home at ten,
I want to be home at 11.

00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:39.132
You told me to be honest;
you're not being honest,

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.572
and the fight breaks out.

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:43.013
And they have their whole
turbulent teenage years.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:47.442
Regardless of who wins that battle,
whether it's mom or dad or the child,

00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:49.693
it bubbles along for a few years.

00:06:49.693 --> 00:06:52.484
Now eventually,
regardless of who wins the battle,

00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:54.723
they leave home - hopefully.

00:06:54.723 --> 00:06:57.864
(Laughter)

00:06:57.864 --> 00:07:01.184
(Applause)

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:03.915
They go! Right?

00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:08.643
But then a much bigger parent
called society comes in

00:07:08.643 --> 00:07:10.734
and imposes its rules.

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.265
So a lot of people go back
into the concrete,

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.646
not like transferred but back
in the concrete following a set of rules,

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.376
that we start to believe
that we've got to get a degree,

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:23.295
we've got to get a job,
a relationship, a car, a house,

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:27.066
we've got to get all these things
to be a good corporate citizen.

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:29.947
So we start to follow the rules,
and we enter a company,

00:07:29.947 --> 00:07:33.037
and we start to work our way
up the career ladder,

00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:34.477
following the rules.

00:07:35.257 --> 00:07:38.256
So a lot of people you'll encounter
are back in that concrete,

00:07:38.256 --> 00:07:40.368
their life become stereotypical.

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:42.008
You'll see people talk about this:

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:44.108
"That's not how we
do things at this company.

00:07:44.108 --> 00:07:47.257
You'll be the Chief Executive,
I'll be the Chief Financial Officer.

00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:48.829
That's how we do it around here."

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:51.439
It's a set of rules
that we're all following,

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:53.789
and we're often not even
aware of those rules.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.309
And that will often happen
for the rest of your life;

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.649
you don't even realize
you're running the rules.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:01.770
By the way, these rules weren't given
to you with your permission;

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.429
they were just imposed
by parents or society.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.370
We're not even aware of it.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.470
If you're lucky, you have a crisis.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.041
At some point in your life,

00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.376
something terrible happens
to get you to question the rules.

00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:17.434
Now, most people this never happens to -

00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:20.410
or if it does, it doesn't
cause them to question.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.232
That might be the loss of a loved one,

00:08:22.232 --> 00:08:25.012
the loss of a relationship
or something terrible happens,

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.301
usually, most commonly, in midlife.

00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:30.912
Then you enter the stage
what we call "the disease of meaning,"

00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:32.260
is it starts to occur to you

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.793
there's something wrong
with the picture of your life.

00:08:34.793 --> 00:08:38.803
I've been following all these rules,
and it hasn't delivered.

00:08:38.803 --> 00:08:41.123
I thought if I was
a good corporate citizen,

00:08:41.123 --> 00:08:44.773
and I got a good job, and a good house,
and paid tax and all of that stuff,

00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:47.184
I would be happy and blissful forever;

00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:48.424
and I'm not.

00:08:48.884 --> 00:08:52.034
That's the disease of meaning,
and that is real pain.

00:08:52.034 --> 00:08:55.375
If that happens in a religious context,
people call it purgatory.

00:08:56.014 --> 00:08:58.045
I mean, literally, it's hell on earth.

00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:00.574
So people get into this state
and often they lash out,

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:03.574
they become unpleasant
and negative and so on,

00:09:03.574 --> 00:09:05.604
because they're basically in pain.

00:09:05.604 --> 00:09:08.175
Now there are two strategies to that pain.

00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:10.243
First strategy - much loved by students -

00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:11.773
anaesthetic.

00:09:11.773 --> 00:09:13.665
(Laughter)

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:17.076
Because if I can blot
out the meaning of life,

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:19.176
that kind of existential question -

00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:21.287
if I'm wasted on a Friday night,

00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:24.687
I don't have to think
about what's the meaning of all this.

00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:26.756
It just goes away as a question.

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:31.068
So then some people do this every night,
some people every weekend, getting wasted,

00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:32.698
either through alcohol and drugs.

00:09:32.698 --> 00:09:35.368
But the problem is
when the hangover wears off,

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:38.319
the question returns; it's still there.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:40.609
You can't answer it.

00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:43.229
If you're smart, you realize
anesthetics won't help you.

00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.969
So you get into the second strategy,
which is distraction.

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:49.009
There are lots of different
types of distraction.

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:52.345
That distraction can simply be
that you become a gym bunny.

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.029
Let's pump some iron.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:59.660
Because when I'm feeling the burn,
I don't have to think about the question.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.861
So I become "the body beautiful,"
stuck at the gym the whole time,

00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:07.241
getting the kick
on the endorphins and so on.

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:10.201
But you realize that, actually,
when you get away from the gym,

00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:11.801
the question is there again.

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.612
So the gym doesn't solve it.

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.392
So you might use
a very common strategy:

00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:17.961
sex ...

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:18.961
Right?

00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.972
Because while I am engaged
in the intimacy of the sexual union,

00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:25.483
I don't have to think about the question,
because I'm too busy doing this.

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:27.443
(Laughter)

00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:32.383
But you may have noticed
that when the act is over,

00:10:32.383 --> 00:10:34.614
that bloody question comes back again.

00:10:35.744 --> 00:10:38.763
So some people go even more nuts:
I'll have sex with two people,

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.764
(Laughter)

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.324
then a whole crowd -

00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:45.561
desperately trying to get away
from this question that's bothering them:

00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.235
the meaning of their life.

00:10:48.235 --> 00:10:51.555
So if sex doesn't work -
and it doesn't, ultimately -

00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:54.212
then you get into materialism: shoes!

00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:56.166
I'll go and buy some shoes.

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:59.256
Or a car, or a house, or a yacht.

00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:00.545
So we get into materialism,

00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:03.676
or some people that we see,
very common in industry, workaholism -

00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:04.976
they become work-addicted.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:07.656
Because while I am working
that hard, having to do stuff,

00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:09.617
I don't have to think about the question.

00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:11.565
None of that solves the problem.

00:11:11.565 --> 00:11:13.637
Because we mistakenly believe

00:11:13.637 --> 00:11:16.527
that the problem is out there
and the solution is out there,

00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:18.678
whereas the real problem is in here.

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:23.868
You cannot solve your sense
of emptiness, or your unrest,

00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:26.347
with an external solution
outside of yourself.

00:11:26.347 --> 00:11:29.499
So stop looking out there,
you have to look in here,

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:33.127
and particularly to look
at your own emotional experience.

00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:37.149
Now, most people go through their life
completely unaware of emotions,

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:38.689
particularly us fellows, right?

00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:42.130
If somebody mentions the word "emotions,"
we run for the hills!

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.980
Emotions are just energy in motion,
they're composite biological signals:

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.541
the signals made up
of all the pounding heart rate,

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.641
the sweaty palms,
the tension in the muscles

00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:53.891
or whatever is going on biologically,

00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.731
it's stereotypical energetic patterns -
energy in motion, they are e-motions.

00:11:58.731 --> 00:12:01.870
Now, we all have emotions,
every single second of every single day,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.231
even us fellows.

00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:05.682
Feelings, however,
are something entirely different.

00:12:05.682 --> 00:12:08.992
Feelings are the awareness
in our mind of the energy.

00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:11.953
So the energy is always there
but we don't necessarily feel it,

00:12:11.953 --> 00:12:13.633
and that's where we're stuck -

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:18.663
is we haven't really learned
to understand our own emotional life.

00:12:18.663 --> 00:12:19.883
So we go through our life

00:12:19.883 --> 00:12:22.464
believing how we're feeling
on a moment by moment basis

00:12:22.464 --> 00:12:23.824
is down to somebody else.

00:12:23.824 --> 00:12:25.044
We actually say this:

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.324
"You annoyed me,"
"You made me unhappy,"

00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:32.104
"You did it to me,"
and we point the finger at other people,

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:35.304
believing other people are
the cause of our own unhappiness.

00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:36.355
So newsflash:

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.345
nobody's doing it to you.

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:41.535
Nobody's making you feel these things.

00:12:41.535 --> 00:12:43.355
I mean, what do you think that happens

00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:46.015
when you get frustrated
with somebody else?

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.986
Did they come up to you
and inject you with frustration,

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.906
with the chemicals of frustration?

00:12:51.276 --> 00:12:53.815
Did they create the electrical
signals of frustration,

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.876
the pressure waves, the sound waves?

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.127
No. You did that.

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:02.456
You created that inside yourself
in response to their poor behavior.

00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:06.948
So, if you can accept
that you're doing it -

00:13:08.048 --> 00:13:10.038
it's not them, it's you -

00:13:10.728 --> 00:13:14.658
that simple truth takes you
from what we call the victim position,

00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:18.648
and it crosses the threshold to ownership.

00:13:19.108 --> 00:13:22.399
That's the most important transition
you'll ever make in your life.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:24.939
So to help you navigate that,

00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:28.839
first and foremost, you have to understand
where am I in the universe of emotions.

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:32.489
If I asked you to write down your current
emotions and gave you five minutes,

00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:33.870
you'd have a list of things,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.640
and then we said, OK,
put your hands up who's got how many,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.020
and we did a test of how many you got,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.051
the average in a room like this
would be about ten or twelve.

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:47.401
There are 34,000 emotions
that you can experience.

00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:49.710
Most people go through life
with ten or twelve.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.489
And just to try to help you navigate,
I'll show you an app that we've built

00:13:53.489 --> 00:13:56.811
to help people know where they are
in the universe of emotions.

00:13:56.811 --> 00:14:00.951
So we've plotted
all these emotions on a map,

00:14:00.951 --> 00:14:03.342
and this map shows you the axes.

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:08.903
So, to the top of the axis
in the universe of emotions,

00:14:08.903 --> 00:14:12.153
we've got the ones that are,
sort of, more energy, if you like,

00:14:12.153 --> 00:14:14.803
and to the bottom the ones
that are more relaxed.

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:16.844
To the left the ones
that are more positive

00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:19.144
and to the right the ones
that are more negative.

00:14:19.144 --> 00:14:22.714
So you can see that we've plotted
maybe the 20 commonest emotions there,

00:14:22.714 --> 00:14:26.365
and as I'm talking to you, right now,
you're somewhere on this grid.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:30.355
You're somewhere in the universe
experiencing one of these planets,

00:14:30.355 --> 00:14:33.685
and we can bring in the next 100 emotions,

00:14:33.685 --> 00:14:37.225
we can bring in the next
200 emotions, the next 1,000.

00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:40.786
So we've built this app to try
and crowd source with you all 34,000,

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:43.996
we've built it with
just 2,000 as a starter.

00:14:43.996 --> 00:14:49.286
And you can enter into
one of the 64 galaxies that exist

00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:51.297
and start to navigate round

00:14:51.297 --> 00:14:55.277
and see where you are in relation
to some of the other emotions,

00:14:55.277 --> 00:14:58.466
because if you don't know
where you are, you're lost.

00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:02.008
Now, you'd never get control
of your own state,

00:15:02.008 --> 00:15:05.818
and it's really important for your health,
for your well-being, for your success,

00:15:05.818 --> 00:15:06.958
whatever you're doing,

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.468
whether you're a sportsperson
or a business leader,

00:15:09.468 --> 00:15:12.129
that you can start to control
your own emotional state

00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:13.728
of what's going on for you.

00:15:13.728 --> 00:15:15.268
If you don't know where you are,

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:17.479
how can you possibly
control any of this stuff?

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:19.239
The answer is you can't.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:23.339
So the start of the journey
is even knowing which planet are you on.

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:27.310
This is designed to help you,
and you can see in the top corner there,

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.199
it shows you roughly where you are
in the universe, at any point in time.

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:35.431
Now, we can zoom in
into one of these 64 galaxies

00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:37.521
and look at a specific solar system.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:40.661
So, where do we go into? Maybe, Sociable.

00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:41.671
We can see.

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:44.542
So let's zoom in 
to the solar system of Sociable

00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:47.611
and start to see
what planets are around you.

00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:49.992
If you want to move
from Sociable to something else

00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:53.832
and then gradually navigate yourself
to a different part of the universe,

00:15:53.832 --> 00:15:55.303
you can see where you are.

00:15:56.283 --> 00:15:59.022
Most importantly,
you can track where you are,

00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:00.951
so you can enter some notes.

00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:04.413
You visit the planet of,
I don't know, Popular.

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:06.424
I felt popular today.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:09.434
People came up and gave me
various messages, and I felt popular.

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:13.415
And you could enter
how popular you felt or you didn't feel

00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:15.124
and actually keep an audit trail,

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:17.455
and you can socialize this
with your mates.

00:16:17.455 --> 00:16:23.074
You can either share it on Facebook
or tweet it or Gmail it

00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:27.535
and see, well, who else 
is in the solar system of Sociable

00:16:27.535 --> 00:16:30.465
or even on the planet Popular -
who else is out there.

00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:31.596
And I can track,

00:16:31.596 --> 00:16:34.296
as it does with these audit trails,
of where I've been.

00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:36.875
So this is your start point,
starting to get a grip

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:39.927
of do you even know
which planet you're on,

00:16:40.397 --> 00:16:43.537
which are the nearest planets
and how you can start to move around,

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:47.447
start to get some navigational capability
within that universe.

00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:51.187
So the first thing is you've got
to learn navigational potential,

00:16:51.187 --> 00:16:54.998
and this is designed to help you build
your emotional repertoire.

00:16:54.998 --> 00:16:57.358
So you're not just stuck
with twelve emotions,

00:16:57.358 --> 00:16:58.898
or in some people frankly:

00:16:58.898 --> 00:17:00.028
two!

00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:04.979
I feel "yuck" or "OK,"
the only two motions they've got.

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.749
So you've got to build a repertoire,

00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:10.429
and what you discover
as you start to build a repertoire,

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.819
some emotions are
better antidotes than others.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.590
So you can start to navigate around.

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.849
The second maneuver,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.010
once you've started
to navigate around the universe,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.489
is really, once you get
to a more constructive planet,

00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:27.931
there's no right and wrong,
but is this emotion really serving you?

00:17:27.931 --> 00:17:30.201
When you get
to a more constructive planet,

00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.649
can you stay there?

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:34.531
And that really requires you
to do a separate maneuver,

00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:35.702
it's called Mastery,

00:17:35.702 --> 00:17:40.141
where you actually take the emotion
which is subject to you -

00:17:40.141 --> 00:17:44.742
it's a subjective experience,
below the level of your real awareness,

00:17:44.742 --> 00:17:48.223
you're sort of subject to it,
i.e. it's got you.

00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:52.033
So if you've got anger,
if anger is going through your system,

00:17:52.033 --> 00:17:53.613
if you're on the planet of Anger,

00:17:53.613 --> 00:17:54.612
it's got you.

00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:57.344
You haven't got it; it's got you.

00:17:57.344 --> 00:18:00.193
The way to get control over it
is to objectify it.

00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:02.274
Like, "Oh, it is anger."

00:18:02.274 --> 00:18:04.414
So you take it out
as a subjective experience,

00:18:04.414 --> 00:18:05.734
and you objectify it.

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:08.325
And if you can objectify it,
you can get a grip of it.

00:18:08.795 --> 00:18:11.185
If you can do that
with your positive emotions,

00:18:11.185 --> 00:18:14.464
then you can move yourself
over to the positive side of the universe

00:18:14.464 --> 00:18:15.895
and stay there.

00:18:16.415 --> 00:18:20.686
So you really don't have to feel anything
you do not want to feel.

00:18:21.606 --> 00:18:24.915
Misery is optional,
you don't have to feel that.

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:27.935
But if you haven't got control,

00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:28.976
then who has?

00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:31.567
And the answer is usually
somebody outside of you.

00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:33.157
So I'd really encourage you,

00:18:33.157 --> 00:18:35.427
if you want to transform
your life forever -

00:18:35.427 --> 00:18:38.636
because, ultimately,
emotions will predict your health,

00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:42.888
they'll predict your performance,
your wellbeing, your sense of fulfillment,

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:47.658
they'll determine your ability
to make effective decisions,

00:18:47.658 --> 00:18:50.988
emotions drive all of that,
your motivation and so on.

00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:53.669
If you don't know about them
and have control over them,

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:56.479
it's a little bit of a lottery as life.

00:18:56.479 --> 00:19:00.650
So if you go away after today,
and ask yourself one question:

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.860
what planet am I on?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.880
And what planet would I like to be on?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.260
And start to work to be
on the planet that you want to be on

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.311
rather than wherever life has pushed you.

00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.910
Imagine a world where all of us

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.781
could be on the planet
we wanted to be on,

00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.870
or navigate around
that kind of solar system

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.262
or the galaxies that we
wanted to experience.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.782
Imagine a world

00:19:24.782 --> 00:19:29.512
where, when you go to the bar to chat up
that attractive person at the bar,

00:19:29.512 --> 00:19:31.512
you didn't need four pints
of Dutch courage

00:19:31.512 --> 00:19:33.363
before you could go there.

00:19:33.893 --> 00:19:36.821
Imagine you could just do that yourself.

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:37.943
Imagine a world

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:42.223
where you didn't need to feel anxious
going into an exam or a job interview,

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:45.504
where you didn't need
to feel terrified coming on stage.

00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:49.103
Imagine a world where your children,
on the receiving end of bullying,

00:19:49.103 --> 00:19:51.314
didn't feel terrified or bullied.

00:19:52.094 --> 00:19:56.943
If you could control your emotions,
you can change your life completely.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:19:58.785
So I'd really encourage you

00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:02.615
to start wondering about
what planet you're on

00:20:02.615 --> 00:20:05.434
and start putting
yourself in the universe,

00:20:05.434 --> 00:20:09.005
in that part of the universe
where you really want to live your life.

00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:10.276
Thank you very much.

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:13.316
(Applause)
