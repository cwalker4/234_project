Gad Saad teaches at the John Molson
School of Business at Concordia. He

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.349
studied at McGill and Cornell. He has
degrees in psychology and business and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.490
in math and computer science. He
does research on hormones and consumer

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.340
behavior and of course is the host of
The Saad Truth his video show. So join me

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.990
in welcoming Gad Saad.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.040
Thank you. Thank you guys. I don't know if
any of you have seen the classic movie

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.000
All About Eve (1950) with Bette Davis.
There is a scene, a classic scene where

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.430
she said - I can't remember the exact words - "Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy ride."

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.690
So fasten your seat belts. Here we go. So
what I'm planning on doing is actually

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.400
offering you some testimony of many of
the maladies that are affecting or

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.369
afflicting our universities and then
I'll offer one or two prescriptive

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.300
solutions. One of the things that my book
agent told me as I'm working on my next

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.790
book as you said you can't just be the
guy to identify the diseases you've got

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.740
to give us the cures you've got to give
people hope and so in that spirit at the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.610
end I'll had a few prescriptive comments.
Apologies to a few people who were at

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.280
the Civitas conference last week where I
also spoke a few of the slides overlap

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.990
so forgive the repetitiveness but for
most of you the repetition but for most

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.250
of you this hopefully will be new stuff
so I argue that there are two great

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.350
threats to humanity
well not argue that's reality they are

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.330
of course biological pathogens that come
in all sorts of manners sometimes there

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.590
bacterium sometimes there viruses
sometimes there parasites and they cause

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.130
more death throughout human history than
your fear of bears and sharks and so on

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.160
right but I argue that there's another
set another class of viruses these are

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.560
idea pathogens these are pathogens of
the human mind pathogens of the human

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
spirit that regrettably could
potentially be as dangerous as

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.110
biological pathogens and to kind of
further push this notion there are many

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
cases in nature where you as an
evolutionary psychologist of course I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.349
often look at analogies and homologies
in the animal kingdom and so here are

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.860
some parasitic realities in nature and
then I'll link it to some of the things

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.550
that interest a group here so the spider
wasp is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.600
much smaller organism than the spider on
which it eventually it eventually stings

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.950
it rendering it hapless dragging
it to the burrow where it then lays its

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.230
eggs and then its offspring
eat it in vivo now how is that related

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.790
to anything that we're interested in
here

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.010
well political correctness is
the spider wasp it stings us and then

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.280
haplessly leads us toward the abyss of
infinite darkness

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.730
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that
afflicts mice and when they're afflicted

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.900
with that parasite they lose their
innate fear of cats not a good

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.640
it's a maladaptive reality P. tenuis is
a brain worm that afflicts ungulates so

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.700
for example the moose and when that
moose is inflicted or afflicted with

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.020
that parasite it can do what's called
circling behavior so it just literally

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.670
goes around in a circle unable to
extricate itself from this behavior so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.320
even as the looming predators are
approaching it can't extricate itself so

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.390
now how do we take some of these notions
and apply them to the realities we're

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.500
facing so they are idea pathogens:
"radical feminism," "post-modernism," "social

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.840
constructivism," "cultural and moral
relativism," "political correctness," "echo

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.760
chambers void of intellectual diversity."
"the culture of perpetual offensive

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.790
victimhood," "identity politics coupled
with progressive self flagellation." Each

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.340
of these are really really dangerous
idea pathogens and my next book

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.230
tentatively right now the title is The
Parasitic Mind where I actually sort of

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.610
lay out where which ecosystem do these
pathogens arise from universities and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.990
then how do we try to inoculate
ourselves or free ourselves from some of

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.060
these idea pathogens and so I can break
up a lot of these

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.510
idea pathogens into three categories in
some cases we have idea pathogens that

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.320
attack basic scientific truths there is
no such thing as two phenotypes in Homo

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.020
sapiens there is no such thing as
biological sex that's a fundamental

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.190
attack on a reality that is obvious to
the average dull two-year-old but

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.630
apparently you're a Nazi bigot if you
think that biology matters then there

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.120
are attacks on the epistemology for
seeking truth right so there are

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.960
endless ways of knowing and your way of
knowing called the scientific method

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.940
should not be a privileged way post
modernism says there are no objective truths so in

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.690
this case it's not a specific truth that
you're attacking but you're attacking

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.700
the epistemology of how to go about
approaching getting to truth and then

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.630
thirdly there's a class of pathogens
that attacks the idea of what it is to

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.700
navigate through a meritocracy and 
I'll give examples of each of these for

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.290
today's talk I'll begin with all those
sort of the feeling stuff that you all

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.310
know about we can then freedom of speech
that hurts other people's feelings okay

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.390
here is the for those of you who don't
know their work but I suspect in this

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.290
room probably most of you do the Justice
Center For Constitutional Freedoms comes

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.430
out with a yearly index where they rate
all Canadian universities on four

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.350
metrics university policies, university
practices, student Union policies, and

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.720
student union practices. So in this case
they rated 60 universities on these four

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.520
metrics so there are 240 possible grades
in a perfect world you'd have 240 A's.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:59.460
There were six A's out of 240. Six A's.
Digest that. And 38 F's. Since we're at

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:06.270
Western I'm granting you the courtesy of
showing you how much you suck. Western,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.169
you scored a C,D,D,C but just so that
you don't think that I'm not going to

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.100
show how bad how poorly my university
does we're a bit better than you

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.530
actually we're B,C,F,C but again neither
scores has anything to write home to

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:27.250
your parents about some of you may have
heard of this incident that happened

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.130
last summer
Jordan Peterson, myself, Oren Amitay, and

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.180
Faith Goldy were supposed to speak at a
conference titled The Stifling of Free

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.669
Speech on University Campus it was being
held at Ryerson University that speech

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:50.199
was stifled and the the the incredible
thing is that I was accused for those of

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:55.259
you who don't know I'm from Lebanon and
we're Jewish I was accused of being a

00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:03.250
white supremacist, anti-semitic, Nazi so
when your moral compass has become so

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:10.570
broken that you actually feel emboldened
in making that accusation you suffer

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:16.900
from an idea pathogen let me just read
you this because it's very powerful

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.240
this is Edward Schlosser a professor at
a liberal some some liberal arts college

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.360
I can't remember which one if you want
to follow the sources at the bottom I

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.110
have intentionally adjusted my teaching
materials as the political winds have

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.070
shifted I also make sure all my remotely
offensive or challenging opinions such

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.589
as this article are expressed either
anonymously or pseudoanonomysly

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:41.169
most of my colleagues who 
still have jobs have done the same

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.500
hurting a student's feelings even in the
course of instruction that is absolutely

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.240
appropriate and respectful can now get a
teacher into serious trouble I'll skip

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.880
the rest but he's basically saying the
way he organizes his pedagogic material

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.470
is to is he by putting it through the
sieve of can I be sure that not a single

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:05.320
syllable that I say will offend a single
person and that's astonishing but that's

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.260
not North Korea that's not Cuba that's
here

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.390
now for those of you who think that you
only have to worry about Big Brother

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:21.260
University monitoring your speech on
campus no University of New Hampshire has

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.350
come up with the wonderful liberating
idea of monitoring students speech not

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.600
while they are under the purview of some
University function as private

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.400
citizens if they say something that
might create an environment that is

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.640
hostile then they could be sanctioned
again not under the guise of there being

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.640
you know students at a university I mean
that's astonishing you just have to read

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.930
the start of this article right so big
brother is watching you even when you're

00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:00.050
not on campus that's happened to me let
me tell you a story now this will go

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.740
into whether it is what was it honest
civility what was the term what was the

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:10.510
dichotomy on yeah let's see if it's
honest incivility or width so this

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:17.270
degenerate act cell bio Josh who's a
incredibly obnoxious haughty guy I

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.590
didn't know who he was
he started sort of trolling me 99% of

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.090
the time I ignored his stuff I'm cool
once in a while I'm bored and I feel

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.310
like taking some guy on and I do it with
complete width and with a smile on my

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.680
face I decided to take this idiot on and
at one point because he was being so

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.130
haughty I said no no the retarded
schmuck recently learned how to

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.440
pronounce vowels respect him okay I had
no idea who this guy was

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.980
I mean literally no idea he's an
anonymous guy on Twitter it could be a

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:54.310
guy a woman I don't know
he starts by tweeting to my university

00:10:54.310 --> 00:11:00.020
he's hurt he's been attacked
it's homophobia so then other people

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.660
respond to him what do you talk about
why is it homophobic what are you

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.900
talking about I don't know what his
sexual orientation is I don't know if

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.370
he's a man or a woman he says well the
use of the word degenerate which is not

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:17.390
here not in this tweet has homophobic
connotations so then he tries to rile up

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.080
my university that way it doesn't work
then he tries to rile up the social

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:27.089
justice warriors it doesn't work
he contacts my university okay this is

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:33.449
happening in the 21st century in Canada
he contacts my university to complain

00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:39.930
about this tweet by the way Twitter take
kicks me off the platform for 12 hours

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.339
right because his feelings are so
precious that me calling him retarded

00:11:44.339 --> 00:11:47.910
schmuck after he was attacking me was
something that he simply could not

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.709
handle is this someone as an adult who
could function healthily in society

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:59.449
anyways the university contacts me after
hours politely to question me about this

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:05.639
can you guess how that conversation went
I said so you contacted me your

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:10.319
contacting me
after hours because you think that it is

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:16.620
within your purview to question what I
say to whom when I'm not operating as a

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.790
professor for oh but professor Saad he's
a student I said he's a student

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.579
somewhere he's not my student it's not
it wasn't under my guys as his professor

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:31.920
it turns out that he's a graduate
student in Australia so retarded schmuck

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.040
was so hostile to him that the ten
thousand miles separating us was not

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.860
enough for him to feel protected but the
fact that the university felt

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:51.839
sufficiently embolden to not laugh him
out but to follow up tells you the state

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:58.050
that we're in continuing with sort of
the coddling and we're all special

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.740
here's a fantastic source this is the
gentleman the source that I'm showing

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.899
you that he said he used to be a
professor at Duke University showing you

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:16.019
the Great Inflation from 1983 all the
way to 2013 it's astonishing

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:21.180
the average grades used to be seized the
average grades now are hovering towards

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.860
AIDS look at the next slide professor
Matt Steffey

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.180
that's exactly right

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:34.230
as somebody who studies consumer
psychology I detest the metaphor of

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.820
students as consumers and so on and we
are service providers we're not

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.790
professors where we're providing a
service well here you see that the most

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:52.410
common grade that is now received is an
a 45% of grades of all grades assigned

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.470
are A's
it used to be seized so if any of you

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.390
graduated you know with honors or
Comelec

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:10.320
today that grade would not pass this is
an article that I wrote a while ago and

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.530
it's only gotten worse the article was
titled I'll have large fries a hamburger

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:22.440
a diet coke and an MBA hold the pickles
yeah and this is as I've obtained an MBA

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.980
but when I obtained the MBA I think it
was 67 credits it was two full years

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:35.280
four semesters of five to six courses
graduate courses a semester for you to

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.940
finish 25 years later it's roughly half
that I think now it's about 40-something

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.820
well what happened what I mean why is it
that 20 years ago you'd have to pass

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.990
through a much much larger hoop to get
the MBA well because you know market

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.870
conditions people are busy we have to
water it down you could do it on the

00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:00.530
weekend you could with that's attacking
the integrity of the academic process I

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.140
won't read this whole thing but just to
kind of give you some good news here's

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.840
the archetype of what I would consider
the ideal student this is an email that

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.430
I received just a few days ago from a
student who had done very poorly in my

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.470
course yet wrote to me to simply say I'm
sorry that I did poorly I think you're

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:22.740
great your course was fantastic I take
responsibility what for having done

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.790
poorly and this is the first time that
someone writes this I appreciate this

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.650
spiritual experience now that's some
good feedback when a student is able to

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.090
characterize your course as a spiritual
experience that's a good thing so in

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.870
this case the student is taking personal
responsibility they're being

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.260
intrinsically motivated that's
certainly the type of trace that we need

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.079
to be fostering in our students I always
tell my students when they are thinking

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:52.829
about you know whining about their
grades I give them the following analogy

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:56.910
when I go see my physician and he gives
me my cholesterol scores I don't

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:03.089
negotiate for a better cholesterol score
my cholesterol score is it and so your

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:06.420
grade is it down to the last two
decimals and usually I don't end up

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.990
having any problems with them not only
is grading racist peer review reviewed

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:19.050
research is research so the process by
which we adjudicate good ideas from bad

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:23.790
ones using the peer review process that
inherently itself is a form of white

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.050
supremacy so this is some of you would
of course know this case UBC law

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.560
professor Lorna June McHugh argued that
the peer review process is antithetical

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.120
to her oral traditions and the Human
Rights Tribunal said yeah that sounds

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.800
like a good idea let's let's talk about
it and then of course I added here and

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.160
this is because it's it's as someone
who's now been a professor for almost 25

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.800
years I see it if you go through the ten
year process rest assured you're going

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.910
to get tenure as as long as you're not a
white male and I know this from personal

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:02.639
experience I mean not not me but having
sat on tenure committees every single

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:08.069
case is overturned so I could we could
sit there we could waste tons of time it

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.760
goes through the different layers a
person has not been in the least bit

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.890
productive and then they refuse tenure
and then you show up the next year oh

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.209
look they're here and you never find out
what happened but you know that they

00:17:21.209 --> 00:17:25.380
simply filed some grievance you know
that they weren't a white male and

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.630
somehow the denial of their tenure was
overturned

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:36.140
so as I strolled hear productivity is
for suckers your identity is your CV

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.890
since of course the whole peer review
process and tenure is all part of white

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:48.809
supremacy I decided to give you a list
of things that have now been defined as

00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:55.470
being white supremacy now I won't go
through all of these sorry what is it

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:01.470
but yeah pump pumpkins lotta actually
it's it's pumpkins lotta Disney taking

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:07.049
exam meritocracy voting for Trump having
white children is white supremacy Thomas

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:10.710
Jefferson statue white marble and
artwork sciences white supremacy

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.059
capitalism mathematics free speech
medieval studies university mascots

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:19.710
Halloween costumes milk is a form of
white nationalism saying all lives

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.970
matter is white supremacy promoting
diversity of thought the US Constitution

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.690
and I don't know what that means but the
invention of the white race is a form of

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.740
white supremacy this is not this is not
satire for those of you who watch my

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.009
stuff you know that I'm pretty big on
satire and sarcasm but they're always

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:42.149
beating me reality is always ahead of my
satire this is at Trent University in

00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:48.750
Canada it's okay to be against whiteness
and look at the quote not not by Lindsey

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.129
Shepherd but by Lindsey Yeates the Trent
Central Student Association ethical

00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:58.350
standards commissioner it sounds very
ominous whiteness uphold systems of

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.149
power like capitalism and patriarchy and
as we continue accessing and not

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:06.720
acknowledging the privilege of being
white we help to uphold these oppressive

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.970
systems so capitalism as an
instantiation of white supremacy the CBC

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.409
surprise contacted me to comment on this
and of course they took the following

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:20.309
quote they were they were accurate judge
people on their individual merits and

00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:28.860
faults and let's stop with this identity
politics nonsense this is at my city one

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.730
of my alma mater McGill campus if any of
you have not watched this clip you

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:42.330
should it's a clip of a gathering of me
too you know at McGill it's it really is

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.289
astonishing it's difficult to watch it
and believe that this is truly happening

00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:52.230
at a leading world institution they
start off by so this is a me too

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.299
you know the whole sexual assaults and
so on they start off by sort of pointing

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:00.690
to white men as being the problem
because of course there is no recorded

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.350
evidence whatsoever that any other men
engage in sexual violence other than

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:09.270
white men and then they apologize for
standing on stolen land

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.340
and then they engage in what's called a
progressive stack if those of you who

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.860
don't know what that is this is where if
you're given you know the platform to

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.890
speak you speak or not as a function of
where you rank and the progressive stack

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.060
so a white woman gets up and says well
you know I'm just a white woman so I

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.770
don't think I should be speaking so I'm
willing to cede my space if there are

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.120
any transgendered indigenous or people
of color and so on and so forth and but

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.070
this is not satire this is this and and
the people are are applauding her it's a

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.090
it's a wonderful thing so whether you
have a right to speak or not is a

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:53.280
function of where you rank and
victimology poker there is an ideology

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.180
and a legal system that treats people
this way does anybody know what that

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:05.430
system is called sorry it's called
Sharia law okay it's where I come from

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:11.280
in the Middle East
Sharia law is contrary to our systems of

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.680
law where we're it's supposed to be
blind justice it recognizes that a crime

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:24.840
is more or less severe as a function of
the identity of the two participants the

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.520
victim and the perpetrator will
determine their identity will determine

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:37.560
whether I should punish you in X or Y
identity politics is just a new

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.320
instantiation of that grotesque system

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.980
here's identity politics now shaping the
highest level of chaired professorships

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.120
that the Canadian government gives so
for those of you who are academics there

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.250
is the Canada Research Chair
now the Canadian government has put with

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.510
as the as part of the metrics that they
look at when they're deciding whether

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.920
who should get the Canada Research Chair
one of the things is you know are you

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.890
from an indigenous background or a woman
and so on that of course has come to

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.030
Concordia where at my university where
we have what's called the Concordia

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.840
University Research chairs which is a
shared professorship that I've held for

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.160
10 years
and my chair professorship ends this May

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.560
and so I was applying for my next chair
now here look what they wrote the

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.640
proportion of appointments by level of
faculty and principles of equity

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.160
diversity and inclusion and also they
talk about gender equity they put the

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.290
following figure so I was applying for
what's called a tier 1 chaired

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:52.740
professorship at the John Wilson School
of Business zero women have it three men

00:22:52.740 --> 00:23:01.920
have it oh I went up against a
departmental colleague she obviates I

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:09.150
don't are those gays I'll leave it to
you to the side but I'm willing to put

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:14.450
them both up publicly and then you can
decide who should have gotten it and

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:21.930
it's not just the title it comes with
huge amounts of income stipend research

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.640
stipends course remissions so it's not
just oh gee I didn't get a nice title

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:34.020
there are real repercussions that affect
real people the good news for me though

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.760
is that the Canadian Senate taught me
that my gender can change on any given

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.810
day
and so therefore next year I plan to

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:48.960
apply with a much stronger dossier when
I'll be self identifying as a woman by

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.670
the way the gentleman in question here
you see this is me speaking in front of

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.110
the Canadian Senate regarding Bill c16
it was briefly mentioned I think earlier

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.000
today bill c16 nobody questions the fact
or at least if you truly are a

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.440
classically liberal person of course I
support the right of everybody to live

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.250
free of hate and bigotry and to have all
of the rights that are afforded to all

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.320
of us but I was in my case speaking as
an evolutionary psychologist in terms of

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.580
whether when is it going to be the case
that someone could say hey you're

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.080
talking about evolved sex differences in
your course which is sort of the

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.530
foundational mechanism natural and
sexual selection are the two mechanisms

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:34.560
they have illusionary mechanisms that
explain much of who we are well wouldn't

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.900
that be transphobic systemic violence
and quo

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.170
as Harvard said aren't eiper petting
quote fixed binaries and biological

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:47.520
essentialism so I was making a very
sober scientific argument as to the

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.840
potential dangers of vilsi 16 not
questioning the fact that all people

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.470
should live with full dignity and have
all the rights that are afforded to all

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.560
of us right
well whatever what happened to Lindsay

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.510
Shepherd is exactly what I was warning
against I mean not in those exact ways

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:10.800
that happened to her well this Senator
accused me of promulgating pro genocide

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.330
message you can go and watch it
so the Lebanese Jew who escaped

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.760
execution in Lebanon and came to Canada
to live freely here and is now trying to

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.530
protect people from all this nonsense
well as a pro genocide supporter this is

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:33.660
the discourse in the Canadian Senate you
can go all watch it now let's see if if

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.950
it is the case that the kind of the
research chairs and the Concordia

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:43.830
University Research chairs really need
to ramp up the help for women because

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:49.380
they're so marginalized in universities
we could use this thing called data to

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:55.290
try to decide whether that's true well
it turns out that the US government has

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:01.190
that data for us so they looked at five
races all the five racial breakdowns

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:07.350
across for educational attainment
associate degree bachelor's degree

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.480
master's degree and doctorate so there
are twenty cells five races by for

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.760
educational attainment and in each of
the cells you could look at what's the

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.370
ratio of male to females who obtain that
degree so if the if the victimology

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:30.600
narrative is true 20 out of 20 cells
would have men outnumbering women in

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:40.740
those cells what's the actual number 20
out of 20 cells women outnumber men so

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:47.120
so take a moment and process that every
single cell every race and every degree

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.910
women get more the
than men across the whole possible

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:58.980
landscape of data that doesn't get you
to question whether we should be having

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.360
a gender equity program well if we have
to have gender equity at this point it

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.550
should be the reverse one here is what
here's the rampant sexism of Canadian

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.950
medical schools women outnumber men now
at almost all the schools so that's why

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.420
you know we need to give them more perks
now again this is not questioning the

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.830
fact that for many many years
there was institutionalized sexism

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.850
against women no one is questioning that
and no but no one needs to lecture me

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.530
about that since I come from the Middle
East where there continues to be massive

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:36.840
endemic institutionalized sexism against
women and I speak out against it but we

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.650
need to be able to change the narrative
when the data no longer supports the

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.990
victimology narrative but apparently
you're a Nazi bigot if you do that let

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:52.140
me now give you some examples of attacks
on scientific truths and attacks on the

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.460
epistemology for generating truth some
of you may have seen the story if you

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.780
follow my work this is a story that
happened to me this is in 2002 and in a

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:07.110
second you understand what these two
images mean in 2002 one of my doctoral

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.270
students had just finished his PhD he's
actually now a Canada Research Chair

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:17.220
professor at Laurier his name is Tripp
odd Gill and we were going out to

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:23.940
celebrate his finishing his ph.d and he
told me oh I'm bringing a date with me

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.390
and it was myself and my wife and so we
were going out today

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:32.160
he said but I just want to give you a
heads up professor she's a you know

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.250
she's a radical feminist
and a post modernist and a cultural

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.590
anthropologist so can we tone it down

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:48.179
to which I said Oh mum's the word of
course I wasn't gonna keep quiet we knew

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:52.530
that that promise was going to be
violated at some point so during the

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:58.770
evening at one point I said to the lady
so I hear you're a postmodernist yes I

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:04.100
said well do you mind if I offer you so
Postma if there are no objective truths

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.299
do you mind if I offer you because as an
evolutionary psychologist I do work

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:13.140
under the assumption that there are
universal truths there are things called

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:19.559
human universals so can I pitch some
what I consider to be universal and then

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:25.159
you could tell me how I'm wrong yep go
ahead say okay well within Homo sapiens

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:33.240
only women bear children so I prophesy I
was being prophetic about the whole blue

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.130
sea sixteen way before it happened I
said only women can bear children is

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.480
that is that a universal she looked at
me with utter disgust with contempt she

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.400
huffed and puffed she rolled her eyes so
absolutely not no it's not only women

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:54.270
that bear children she goes no there is
a try a Japanese tribe off some Island

00:29:54.270 --> 00:30:00.780
where within the spiritual realm within
their spiritual doctrines it is men who

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.390
bear children by you restricting the
conversation to the biological

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:12.299
materialist realm that's how you keep us
barefoot and pregnant after I recovered

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:20.100
from my mini-stroke I then asked okay
well maybe it's too controversial for me

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.880
to argue that women bear children that's
that seems to be too taboo let's take a

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:30.929
slightly more innocuous example is it
true since time immemorial that sailors

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:38.820
have presumed that the Sun rises in the
east and sets in the west is that is

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:44.940
that true he or she used something
called deconstructionism she said what

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.500
do you mean I don't play labels what do
you mean by east and west what do you

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.590
mean by Sun that which you call Sun
I call and now you understand I call

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:00.510
dancing hyena
and there I said but fine so the dancing

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:07.230
hyena rises in the east and sets in the
west if I don't put dancing hyena lotion

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:15.060
on my skin I might get us dancing hyena
burn she said no no I don't play those

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:20.640
games now that's not she wasn't an
anomaly she wasn't an outlier she is

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.730
what is being taught to all your kids
was your hard earned money not only are

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:34.160
you losing all the money you are
infecting those children or young adults

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:39.240
with idiotic
anti science anti reason anti logic

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:46.700
nonsense so there's a real cost to
allowing these viruses to proliferate

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.030
let me just mention a few other examples
so this is the liberating lens of

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:55.050
academic feminism the list is actually
much longer but there are fields

00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:00.300
feminist science feminist mathematics
mathematics we have a mathematician here

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.860
I mean I thought that mathematics would
be the one area where we can absolutely

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:10.920
be free of identity politics no and I'll
talk about it in a second let's go down

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.720
well feminist business school is the
idea that the term profit took to profit

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:22.050
capitalism these are inherently
patriarchal ways of viewing the economy

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:26.430
and therefore we need to build business
schools that are based on a more sort of

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:32.820
inclusive feminist ethos and then
feminist biology this is not satire this

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.950
is true this paper has been cited over
1200 times published in the University

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:43.470
of Chicago Press journals so this is not
some sort of quack paper paper published

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:49.890
or whatever you know nonsense journal
she argues that the whole manner by

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:56.490
which we describe conception there is an
egg and she's passive so she's Victorian

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:01.470
and then there are these spermatozoa
that are active and adventuresome and so

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:06.530
on that whole thing that language to
describe conception

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:12.110
and that way is already starting this
you know sexist gender rules

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:17.960
she is not joking she's not being
satirical she's a very serious quote

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.810
scholar who's been cited 1200 times

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.890
prophetic satire and actually the math
there's a mathematician in this room

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:33.050
would at lunch told me oh I I watched
this clip of yours here by the way this

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.310
is when I'm doing when I'm satirizing
the social justice warriors I bring out

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:44.830
this what do you call it the wake thank
you I was thinking of the term in French

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:50.750
the first time that I brought out that
wig I called my wife I said hey do you

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:56.090
know where that red wig is and she's
like what why are you asking this don't

00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.890
worry about it and eventually that wig
has become part of the sad truth

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.270
classics so here what I did is I I had
said this was completely a satirical

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:11.570
this is kind of a SoCal hoax type of
clip I said that I had founded a new

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.240
field as someone who had studied
mathematics and someone was very

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.130
progressive and you know into social
justice I found that a new field called

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.510
social justice mathematics and so in
doing so you should really watch the

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:29.330
clip and by the way that prophetic
satire is now reality for example I

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.890
argue that irrational numbers is
absolutely bad think as it marginalizes

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:39.649
mental illness the inequality operator
creates an ableist mentality prime real

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:43.730
and perfect numbers it's all divisive
language binary numbers they perpetuate

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:50.330
fixed binaries Laplace transform uses
the trans prefix so it is transphobic

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.310
and equilateral triangles are inclusive
isosceles and scalene triangles are

00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:00.110
bigoted and actually some people wrote
to me and they actually didn't think

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:05.180
that I was being satirical and it was
like good stuff well a year later I

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:11.300
start getting calls from the media
asking me to comment about exactly what

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.370
my prophecy was which is now there was a
book that was written saying that we

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.510
need to have more social justice in
mathematics the

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:24.520
mathematics as currently taught as white
supremacy and so on and so forth so that

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.140
which I had thought no one could ever
come up with such stupidity

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:36.820
it only took ten months and it caught up
to my satire decolonized science so this

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:43.240
is really basically saying out with the
epistemology of science right now here

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.650
is a Quebec Deputy Minister who got
pushback recently because he questioned

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.250
the place of indigenous traditional
knowledge now let me let me be clear as

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:57.400
an evolutionary psychologist I
understand that people have ecological

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.390
knowledge that's specific to an
ecosystem so nobody is questioning that

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:06.460
right so you could have been in the
particular region where you've been

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.090
there for many many generations and you
could have knowledge about the fauna and

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.890
flora this is content knowledge this is
ecological knowledge that you absolutely

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:20.020
have greater knowledge than the rest of
us that doesn't mean that at the Epis

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:26.620
thermo logical level you have different
way of knowing you don't solve cancer

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.630
either through sexist Western medicine
or you dance to the Rainman doing

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:37.840
booga-booga right that's not how it
works so yes we should be respectful of

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.630
local knowledge that people may have but
there is only one epistemology there's

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.560
only one game in town it's called a
scientific method and so other ways of

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.910
knowing are not equal if they're going
to be equal then they have to be put

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:58.270
through this exact same scrutiny of the
scientific method and so University of

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:03.070
Capetown a rather prestigious university
in the African continent held a sit-in

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.780
where they said science must fall and
the people who were promulgating that

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:14.590
idea are now known as Follis the idea
that science itself all of science

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:21.100
Darwin Newton it's all built on one way
of knowing and there are other ways of

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.870
knowing and if you attack those ways of
knowing then you are engaging an episome

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.520
illogical colonialism and here's an
example of a paper published in a real

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.080
journal where they exactly argue that
so these are real cancers of the human

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:42.190
mind they're there they really are
intellectual terrorism right now now I'm

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:47.700
gonna get I'm almost done now I'm gonna
get to I guess some prescriptive stuff

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:54.370
before I do that let me talk about two
nonsensical ideas social constructivism

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:59.770
is really the idea that we're born
tabula rasa with empty minds and it is

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:04.750
only the processes of socialization that
make us who we are now as an

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.260
evolutionist I don't question the fact
that socialization is important of

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.070
course we're socialized we're socialized
by our parents and our rabbis and and

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:16.480
television if that's all true but by the
way socialization happens in its form

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.500
because of biology so it's not
antithetical it's not biology or the

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:26.320
environment nurture happens because of
nature okay but in any case we are born

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.130
with biological imperatives it's
trivially obvious to show this you show

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.910
that for example by taking children who
are too young to have been socialized

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.360
and show that they have certain
preferences that they could not have

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.100
learned I'll talk about that in a second
so the idea of hard radical social

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.100
constructivism is complete nonsense but
if it's something that's been

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:50.140
promulgated in the social sciences and
the humanities for 30 40 years bio

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:55.900
phobia is kind of a a consequence of
that bio phobia is fear of biology so

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:02.020
biology is OK in describing the behavior
of the mosquito and the rabbit and the

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.900
zebra but don't you dare apply biology
to explain human affairs somehow humans

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.070
transcend biology right that's what
makes us human according to these folks

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.440
what makes us human is that we are not
under the purview of the same biological

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.710
imperatives as the zebra
we're cultural animals and of course

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.200
we're not we're both cultural animals
and biological animals so how would you

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.940
dismantle something like this so next
what I'm going to talk about is a

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.840
epistemological tool that you could all
use when you're having these trench

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.840
ideological warfare with people so take
for example well why do you think I put

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.370
these two Tory things so Tory
preferences is sort of one of the

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.840
classic examples of
so-called social constructivism the idea

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.080
is that little boys are taught to play
aggressively with blue trucks little

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.150
girls are taught to play in a nurturing
manner with pink dolls and that starts a

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:06.490
cascade of gender specific socialization
right and a truly progressive person

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:13.150
would have their son play with dolls and
would have their daughter play with guns

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:18.010
right but if you're a toy company you
don't care about ideological dogma you

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:23.290
care about selling things and so that's
why practitioners typically never give

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.620
me grief for my theories because they
don't care about ideological dogma they

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:32.380
care about how do you describe reality
as it really exists right so let's see

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:37.210
if I could construct for you this is
called bear with me this is a bit

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:42.300
technical excuse me.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:48.700
This is called a nomological network
of cumulative evidence. What does that

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:55.090
mean? If I want to make an argument that
something is an adaptation, something is

00:40:55.090 --> 00:41:00.040
due to a biological cause, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to try... so for example

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:06.880
here are toy preferences biological base
or are they completely social

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.670
constructions? Ok? So then I would think
what would be the data that I would have

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:18.370
to show you to prove to you in an
unassailable manner that there is a

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.770
biological basis to toy preferences and
that epistemological process is what I

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.070
call nomological networks of
cumulative evidence. And I'll go through

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.390
a few. I won't go through all of them but
I'll give you a bit of an example.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:36.010
Charles Darwin himself had used
nomological networks although he didn't

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:41.950
call it that in his days when he was you
know collecting all of the data for

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:46.330
Origin of Species over a 20-plus year
period what was he effectively doing?

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:52.120
He was methodically, judiciously
collecting data from endless different

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:58.000
sources which when you put it all
together it became impossible to dispute

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.980
his theory. And if 150 years later
a lot of very motivated people have

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.240
tried to dispute it and it still stands.
And so let me show you how we could

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:12.430
apply it in the current context. Well I
could take children - look at this one

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.780
this comes from developmental psychology - 
I could take children who are in the pre

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.100
socialization stage meaning that they
don't yet have the cognitive development

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:26.620
to be socialized so by definition I'm
ruling out that possibility and I could

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:33.970
show that they exhibit sex-specific toy
preferences that boys will reach out to

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:39.790
the truck or stare at the truck more and
vice-versa for girls so already that

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:45.070
first box is casting doubt on the idea
that it's all due to social construction

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.250
but let's see if I can give you a few
more that really build sort of the

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:53.350
tsunami of evidence against that
position you could take this is called

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:59.080
comparative psychology this one here I
could look to other animals so I could

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.510
take rhesus monkeys I could take vervet
monkeys I could take chimpanzees and I

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:09.910
could show that the infant's within
those species exhibit the same sex

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:15.010
specific type references now are they
also being under the influence of

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:21.730
patriarchal sexism or might there be
some homology across the behaviors now

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.810
if that's not enough let me do one more
but if we did all of them believe me

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.540
even the one who is least convinced
would be convinced by the end of this

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.530
lecture you could take people kids who
suffer from something called congenital

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.810
adrenal hyperplasia which is an
endocrinology cool disorder if little

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:40.750
girls suffer from it they become
masculinized

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.460
they become masculinized in their
morphology and in their behavior well

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.480
you take little girls who suffer from
this under chronological disorder and

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.020
you study their toy preferences what do
you think happens to their toy

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.420
preferences they become masculinized so
if I stop the conversation right there

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.490
I'm not gonna do all of them already
that is casting huge doubt on your idea

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.710
that it's all due to the vagaries of the
evil patriarchy I didn't have to get

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:13.990
into histrionics I had to just simply be
very judicious and think about what are

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:18.190
the
variety of data that I could offer you

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:24.040
to convince you that your peddling
bullshit right and someone earlier I

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.050
won't point to them said to me you know
how is it that you carry yourself and

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:34.810
such public forums with such confidence
well part of it is the luckiness of the

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.900
random combination of genes that led to
who I am

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.220
I happen to just be confident but part
of it comes from not speaking about

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:48.220
something unless I'm fully confident
that the data fully supports me and the

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.550
way that I do that is by building these
neurological networks

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:56.050
and so all of us in this room should
certainly benefit from understanding

00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:01.870
that epistemology if you want to know if
a particular religion is peaceful or not

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:06.730
build the normal logical network there
is a wide range of data that you could

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:11.050
collect that's already been collected
for you that will unequivocally answer

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:15.460
the question of whether Islam is
peaceful or not whether Jainism is

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.820
peaceful or not you don't have to guess
you don't have to listen to your friend

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.500
you could you could build that data

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.180
there with me a bit I think we're still
okay bear with me does anybody know what

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:34.260
the hygiene hypothesis is you do oh
that's good in evolutionary medicine

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.140
evolutionary medicine is basically
applying evolutionary principles

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.000
well in medicine understanding the
adaptive processes that led to our

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.950
bodies to be able to better cure
diseases the hygiene hypothesis is a

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:51.910
beautiful idea that basically said well
it's not an idea it's been confirmed

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.840
empirically so if you take children who
suffer from respiratory ailments or

00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:01.150
those who don't it turns out that
whether they've been exposed from a

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:06.100
young age to respiratory pathogens
determines whether they're going to

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.780
suffer from ailments and it might not be
what you think intuitively if they've

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.940
grown up in very sterile environments
that's when they develop respiratory

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:22.090
ailments why because their immune system
has not received the inputs to kick in

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:28.700
their immunological defenses so if I
grow up in an OCD sterile home

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:32.630
I'm more likely to vote to develop
asthma if I grow up in an environment

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:37.099
where there are pets and a bit of dander
here and there I'm less likely to

00:46:37.099 --> 00:46:43.369
develop asthma so this brilliant
neuropsychiatry Steve I wish I had come

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:49.250
up with the idea but he beat me to it
Steve stanky vicious analogize this to

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:55.180
ideas he said that what we're doing in
universities is creating sterile

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:02.300
environments sterile echo chambers akin
to the the allergens right you need

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.280
allergens to develop your protection for
against respiratory ailments you need

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.550
contrary ideas to develop your capacity
to think to develop your capacity for

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:19.900
critical thinking it's a it's a truly
beautiful analogy so let's see how

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.410
whether we have political echo chambers
at universities or not this study just

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:30.440
came out the the author Lang bird had
actually emailed me to to tell me about

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:37.010
his paper so this is a study that was
done 51 of the top ranked liberal arts

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:41.510
colleges eight thousand six hundred and
eighty eight so this is a very big very

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:47.210
representative sample size more than
five thousand of which registered as

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.540
either Democrats or Republicans and all
I'm going to show you here I won't go

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.940
through all of them it's the ratio of
Democrats to Republicans across

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:04.520
disciplines the least lopsided the least
lopsided is one point six not now for

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.089
example in medicine if you had a one
point six odds ratio that would be a

00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:13.160
huge effect right here that's the least
one is that one point six now let's keep

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.839
going I won't do all of them very
quickly you get to eight point two to

00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:23.200
one ratio and let's keep going oh yes
sociology forty three point eight

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.760
anthropology you can't calculate the
Democrat to Republican ratio because

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:37.040
it's a unicorn he doesn't exist the
Republican it's fifty-six to zero and in

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.500
communications it's 108 to zero now you
might say and I

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.370
I receive as you might imagine endless
emails from people sometimes they write

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:50.120
to me I say well so what's the big deal
with that professors are smart so of

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.690
course they're going to be democratic
Bohr you must be part of the problem

00:48:53.690 --> 00:49:02.030
right on many issues like fiscal policy
foreign policy is the death penalty a

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:06.860
good idea for serial pedophiles or not
there is no absolute scientific truth

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.810
there are compelling arguments to be
made both pro and con any of these

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:16.190
issues now I might fit on this side you
might fit but but there really is value

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:20.420
in hearing your side of why you think
the death penalty is good or bad but

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:27.680
imagine if you grown up or been
inculcated in an ideological sterile

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.340
environment you don't build your
defenses and just to show you the next

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.410
slide it turns out that the more
prestigious university is so in this

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:42.320
case you break it up into tiers tier 1
meaning most prestigious and so on the

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.660
more prestigious the university is the
more lopsided so the most prestigious

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:53.060
universities the ratio of Democrats to
Republicans is twenty-one point five to

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.530
one
that's just breathtaking so heterodox

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.470
Academy which some of you know that's
what they're trying to do they're trying

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:05.630
to fight that incredibly politically
sterile environment that we see in

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.740
universities Canadian universities I
won't go through the whole thing but

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:16.070
it's roughly the same it's it's the same
sort of bias so last slide how do we

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:19.340
save our universities so let me just
read it for you

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:24.650
number one pursue knowledge unencumbered
by ideological activism no knowledge is

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:29.390
forbidden if gathered objectively using
the scientific method I I had a chat

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:36.290
last year with some of you may know him
Sam Harris on his show and he asked me

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.480
in your research is there anything that
you would consider forbidden to study

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.310
and my answer was a very quick
absolutely not if you study it with

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:51.050
complete objectivity and adhering as
best as you can to the scientific method

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:55.970
then you could never have the calculus
of oh but what if someone event

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.200
misuses that then physics should never
have been studied because it led to the

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.790
atomic bomb right I mean it's an endless
slippery slope

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:08.359
no more identity politics instead
promote the dignity of the individual

00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:11.660
rather than supporting oppression
Olympics and victimology poker

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.470
no more coddling of the culture of
offense and the ethos of perpetual

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:19.820
victimhood no microaggressions no
trigger warnings no safe spaces and no

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.740
cultural appropriation my personal
history is that we escaped Lebanon under

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.190
imminent threat of execution
could you imagine for someone with my

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:33.950
personal history to watch the kind of
whining that I see in the West and what

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:38.240
kind of offense you want to talk about
offense it's an offense to the endless

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.770
panoply of ways by which people truly
suffer around the world to have these

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:48.680
coddled and Fant alized folks it's it's
a it's an affront to what true suffering

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:54.980
is that just society is rooted in the
ethos of meritocracy we are not social

00:51:54.980 --> 00:52:00.170
ants and the the point I'm making here
is that social ants eat Oh Wilson the

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:05.150
famous evolutionary biologist and
entomologist said regarding socialism

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:13.130
and communism he said wonderful system
wrong species okay so so communism is

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:20.510
great and socialism is great when you're
a social ant but for a species that does

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.800
have hierarchies then maybe that's not a
great thing

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:28.910
promote an ethos of course intellectual
and political diversity all ideas

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.480
beliefs and ideologies are open to
criticism I mean here I'm preaching to

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.849
the converted no speech codes no hostile
environment and so on and so forth

00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:42.230
science reasoned logic and a commitment
to evidence based thinking Trump

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:48.920
ideology hurt feelings and fashionable
anti science full intellectual gibberish

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.940
thank you very much

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:05.720
dr. sad will Nell take questions and
comments and again this mic doesn't

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.340
amplify it merely records if I can go
back to what you said about social

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:15.590
justice math so my mom's a teacher in
elementary school at BC and there's a

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:20.390
new curriculum it's all online you can
see it and in the math section for all

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:24.859
elementary school grades
it says part of the learning outcomes is

00:53:24.859 --> 00:53:30.440
integrate indigenous world views and
perspectives on mathematical concepts so

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.619
is there any validity to this or is it
just nonsense without knowing the

00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:41.810
specific case I'm going to go with
nonsense so in other words if there were

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:47.750
true indigenous knowledge that somehow
adds to the cursus of mathematical

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:53.240
knowledge bring it on great but is there
some mathematical knowledge that exists

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.790
outside of the axioms of mathematics
that only indigenous people are you know

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:09.080
exposed to know as I say each of these
things I'm already counting the tally of

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:18.320
death threats I'll be receiving I guess
I'll it'll get a little disturbed with

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.170
the Tribune all of this to universities
like administrators aren't universities

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:28.460
you know a lot of this is going on
within certain departments and faculties

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:34.820
within universities and I think if you
find the people who are resistant to a

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:40.040
lot of these ideas they're probably more
in say science for example in other

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:47.359
sorts of areas and isn't there a danger
that we're sort of tarnishing you know

00:54:47.359 --> 00:54:55.070
the institution as a whole you know with
these particular sorts of cases I mean

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:59.119
you don't need to have every single
person at a university suffer from this

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:04.849
nonsense or every person being a
perpetrator of that nonsense for you to

00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:08.450
be concerned by it right how many
victims do we need before we sort of

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.510
stand up and
an indigent would you know what being

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:15.380
indignant right I mean think about it
and in the humanities and social

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:20.780
sciences I mean there are now 40 years
of students that have been taught you

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:26.240
know some of the most impenetrable fake
nonsense and I mean again think about

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.560
the opportunity cost every single one of
these students could have done something

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.370
unbelievably more productive with their
time and that to me is a is it

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:39.170
gargantuan injury no I'm not saying not
to be concerned but you know if you have

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:44.180
a cancer somewhere you don't assume the
whole body ain't needs to be treated and

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:49.910
so there's areas of the university a
that are cancerous and that what we

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:54.800
should be careful about is targeting
those areas rather than saying you know

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.660
the administration is the university for
exists for example or you're the

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:05.390
behavior of a group in a cultural
anthropology class is the University and

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:11.210
and so on I teach psychology and I teach
a balanced approach to a heritability

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:16.940
and you know socialization I never get
any objections from my students they

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:22.400
aren't up in arms you know because I'm
doing that and so on so again I just

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.960
think we've got something that's more of
a localized but very visible yeah sort

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:37.070
of problem Alex so I want to thank you
for coming and speaking with all of us

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:42.020
that was very unlike I'm a Concordia
graduate myself in communications in

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:46.490
cultural studies so I do appreciate you
coming here to London what I want to ask

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:51.620
you about is your thoughts on the
difference first part between Quebec

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.120
institutions so french-speaking Quebec
institutions Concordia and McGill aside

00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.030
the Yukon udm and if you see that
because Quebec is more nationalistic in

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:07.880
their culture and in their history do
you see that they are less prone to

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:12.110
these ideological viruses you speak
about and you also often give the

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:17.990
distinction between you know academic
institutions to the West versus places

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:22.790
elsewhere but do you think that this is
more of a North American issue or do you

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:25.800
see
epidemic in European schools in Asian

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:31.230
schools and so forth so I think I think
the the what I call ostrich parasitic

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:35.850
syndrome which is sort of the collection
of these maladies can afflict anybody

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:40.710
anywhere so I was I was asked is this
something that afflicts people on the

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:47.250
left more and my answer is no and in its
current manifestation yes because a lot

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:50.760
of the voices are coming from the left
in this case but it could have so for

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.980
example science denialism doesn't happen
only on the left or on the right it's a

00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:00.000
different form of science denialism that
happens right so if when it comes to for

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.720
example denying evolution it'll be the
people on the right who deny evolution

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.020
they're sort of the religious folks when
it comes to denying evolutionary

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:14.400
psychology or the fact that there's a
biological basis to our human nature it

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.500
is people on the left so I so I don't
think it is it is restricted to a

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:23.580
geographical location or a political
aisle I think what makes this so

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.200
problematic is that anybody anytime can
be and some of my very good friends some

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:33.120
of the folks that you guys all know and
respect regrettably have now fallen

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:40.140
victims to o-p-s I won't mention names
but they have Stephen I want to avoid

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:43.470
polemics from myself because this is
questions for you but I do have to

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:48.000
follow up on the previous comment I'm a
psychologist and I think psychology has

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.450
been poisoned I not as badly as
sociology obviously and not as badly as

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.560
humanities but psychology has been
poisoned my research has been stifled

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:02.730
I've been rejected for little grants
that should have been given me because I

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:06.090
asked the wrong questions
I'm constantly worried but what I say

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:10.170
but I also have a close relationship
with my colleagues in biology I've been

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:15.210
acting chair of the biology department
and I tell them repeatedly they're

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:21.570
coming for you and they're coming for
you so yes I mean humanities I mean

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:28.290
education has always been lost and but I
think it's wrong to think that it's that

00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:32.700
it's segregated to certain parts it's a
matter of how advanced the the virus is

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.870
could you comment on that well I think
so it's kind of linked both of your

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:41.300
comments
that you often hear this you know the

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.320
neighborhood where I live I don't see
that particular problem so clearly it

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:50.900
must not exist I think you have to have
a wider view you don't have a heart

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:54.470
attack and you're healthy until you drop
dead from a heart attack but three

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.910
minutes earlier you said this cannot
affect me I'm perfectly fine so I think

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:04.160
that notwithstanding the fact that you
may not have experienced it yourself I

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.910
think it is something that we should all
be very concerned about I'll just give

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.630
you one example I comment about issues
outside of what we're talking about here

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:16.850
for example whether certain religious
ideologies that might be antithetical to

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:21.230
every single liberal values that that we
hold dear anybody in this room whether

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:26.780
it's a good idea to have a increase of
those values in Canada right oftentimes

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.690
I get tons of people who write to me and
say but but I don't see any of the stuff

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:33.110
you're talking about I go buy my
tomatoes and I go to my daughters I

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:38.600
don't see it that's a myopic view sort
of open the neighborhood to outside of

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.290
your neighborhood it's it's coming it's
over there it's around the corner so I

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:48.400
think you're right I think you're
fortunate that you haven't seen it grant

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.230
an earlier and earlier commenter was
saying don't brand the whole University

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:59.180
with the same brush my problem with that
attitude is when something like this

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.400
we're talking about today happens
there's one or two there's David Haskell

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.440
and there's some times in the past Clive
who would stand up and written mark now

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.170
we rant and rave about it but but 99.9%
of the university would be silent about

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:20.420
it Oh or support him and so in that
sense yes brand the whole university

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:25.040
with that brush because they're the ones
who are sitting by idly allowing it to

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.470
happen without any objection without any
you know I'm looking at my own career

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.620
and I'm you know hunkered down and I'm
not gonna say anything about it because

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.520
I don't want it to affect me yes it is a
university-wide problem you know it's

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:43.210
thank you for saying that because I
often receive emails from professors who

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:48.710
privately say oh my god thank you so
much for what I say well why do you send

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:53.450
me a private email why don't you advert
position is it are you are you are you

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:57.350
ashamed of your soup I mean am I on the
wrong side of the issues but that's the

01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:01.730
problem there but in their silence
they're complicit so you don't have to

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:05.810
have everybody at the University be a
rabid social justice warrior if you know

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:09.350
that they exist and you do nothing about
it as far as I'm concerned you're as

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:15.320
guilty as they are Rick one thing I will
say about the as a comment to your

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.150
ostrich parasitic syndrome is this year
when I just talked about things like sex

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:24.020
differences in my introductory
psychology class just the way word

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:28.700
spread and you know students who had
been you know quite close to me in terms

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:32.030
of you know a good working relationship
just suddenly stopped talking to me it

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:37.780
was real I open you to see how quickly
it takes over in the way and just how

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.860
how intense the effect is so the guess
the question I have is the way I almost

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.120
see it is how do we actually cure the
people who have been infected it - like

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.380
the the only thing that seems to come to
mind is maybe try to do research on the

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.890
deprogramming of cult members but I
wasn't I wouldn't wanted to know what

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:58.550
your thoughts were like for the actual
people who are afflicted what we

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:02.990
actually do for them I mean I truly
think that it's a question of teaching

01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:07.520
people how to better think I mean I know
it sounds very grand but it's it's

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.790
really amazing when you when you
challenge people for example if you say

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:16.850
if someone says religion X is peaceful
okay I say okay well how did you arrive

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:21.290
at this I challenge them right so it's
kind of somewhat a Socratic process it's

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:26.660
sort of a appointed epistemological
approach it's really teaching people to

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:31.850
not be cognitively lazy you know most
people so as a consumer psychologist one

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:36.470
of the things I study is you know when
you're trying to simplify the

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:40.340
information overload and your
environment you might use a simplifying

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:45.290
heuristic like Japanese product
electronic products are great right that

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:49.400
allows me to very quickly choose a
product without having to do more search

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.700
right so most of us have a sort of an
innate desire to be cognitive misers but

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.490
for some of these issues you can't be a
cognitive misers

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:02.930
you really have to ask people to get
engaged in building these neurological

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:07.190
networks and so that's how I am
I'm sure there are many strategies I try

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:12.950
to convince people by the overwhelming
data that goes against their position

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:19.069
and usually I'm able to to be quite
successful at it I have bill and Ava and

01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:24.410
Joanne and David and maybe we'll have
some more time after that or we'll see

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:31.999
no problem that question what's driving
this as a psychologist and sex

01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:38.869
researcher I often use the metaphor of
fetish the reactions to establish

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:43.519
knowledge epistemology methodology
conversations such as the ones we're

01:04:43.519 --> 01:04:48.769
having correspond to the characteristics
of a fetish reaction to a fetish object

01:04:48.769 --> 01:04:53.349
they're highly selective they're
uncontrollable and they're exaggerated

01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:59.329
and I see people you know who are making
the pronouncements that we're talking

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:05.269
about the anti scientism the
post-modernism etc I think the dynamic

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:12.259
is some kind of nearly orgasmic pleasure
the condemning the condemning of an

01:05:12.259 --> 01:05:17.720
established knowledge somehow confers
virtue on the individual and and

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.450
pleasure what what do you think the
dynamic is well that's that's a great

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.239
question I guess I'll be talking about
some of the stuff in my book yeah let me

01:05:23.239 --> 01:05:26.410
let me go back to that slide

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:31.560
I don't I don't think there's a singular
explanation I think it's a it's a

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.960
cocktail of different pathologies so for
example when it comes to the victimology

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:43.530
mentality I've coined the term or the
malady collective Munchausen or

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:48.290
collective Munchausen by proxy
right so for those of you who don't know

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:53.369
munchausen syndrome is a psychiatric
disorder whereby someone

01:05:53.369 --> 01:05:58.550
feigns a medical illness so that they
can garner sympathy and empathy

01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:03.119
munchausen syndrome by proxy is when you
take someone who's under your care

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:07.770
typically your biological child but it
could be a pet it could be an elderly

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:14.070
parent and you harm them so that then
you can get the pleasure of the empathy

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:18.930
and the sympathy by proxy well when I
see the victimology right it's not I

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:23.070
think therefore I am it's I'm a victim
therefore I am so there is a form of

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:28.980
collective Munchausen whereby the main
currency now is I get my strokes my

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.530
pleasure
through being a victim either myself or

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:39.810
by proxy I'm the social justice warrior
who's helping those poor victims so that

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:44.640
would be that would explain the
victimology mentality the post-modernism

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:50.430
I actually think I have a not nearly as
sort of psychoanalytic explanation as

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:55.140
yours so Jacques Derrida Michel Foucault
and Jacques Lacan and the rest of the

01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:01.619
French post modernists scammers I think
simply stumbled on a way to get tons of

01:07:01.619 --> 01:07:05.880
people to actually show up and in
complete reverence listen to their

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.730
complete random gibberish and take them
seriously and as someone who studies

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:15.180
peacocking behavior
I can peacock by buying an Aston Martin

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:20.070
I can peacock by getting Harvard degrees
or I can peacock if you give me the

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:24.390
opportunity of standing up in front of
adoring undergrads and saying that the

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:29.940
transposed eigenvalue of my inner-self
right and all the rest of the bullshit

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:35.100
and there's a bunch of people who think
that because I'm engaging in what

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.180
appears to be pseudo profundity I must
be saying something important and I get

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.870
all the hot women on camp
so I think it's really as simple as that

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:50.310
they found an arbitrage profit to use an
MBA right they found a way to be worthy

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:56.880
in the ecosystem why do the chemists
sorry well no I think it's why are the

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.420
chemists and the physicists and the
biologists getting all the attention

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.830
we also are important in the humanities
right but it has to be something as

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:09.120
impenetrable as what the mathematician
is doing and what the physicist is doing

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.410
right and the way I achieve that is
instead of using mathematical symbols I

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:19.020
use impenetrable complete random prose
there must be some profundity to it in

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:26.730
the bullshit I want to come back to what
Lynn your comment Lindsey you've

01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:31.140
mentioned that this has been going on
stuff for 40 years in the years

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.980
generations of students have been
bamboozled and wasted their time an hour

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.270
long our tax money actually it's a bit
longer than that for those of us who are

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:43.140
older than you would have probably
started in the 60s I was I happen to be

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:49.170
living in Paris in the 60s at the time
and I saw all of it okay this this

01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:54.839
horrible business is now moving to our
schools and this teaching of this gender

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:59.850
stuff and now indigenous mathematics and
great 1b can teach children how to add

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:03.720
and multiply and subtract but we're
going to introduce all these extraneous

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:11.250
elements into it the danger for our
societies is now really very bad and I

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:19.170
just like you to comment on this
penetration now into the schools well in

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:25.200
in when you're trying to advertise to
children there are different countries

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:31.080
have different laws but typically one
argument is that you you shouldn't be

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.190
allowed to target children let's say
you're selling cereal I'm gonna come to

01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:39.870
your point you shouldn't be able to
target children and selling them cereals

01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:44.490
because they can't build a
counter-argument to it so only when

01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:48.540
they're able to have the cognitive
capacity to develop resistance to the

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.440
persuasive message that's when you're
allowed right but can you think of one

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.520
product that you're allowed to
get your children straight out of the

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:05.910
womb no religion right so I can't sell
chewing gum to a child when when he's

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:11.130
eight or nine because you know he's too
cognitively fragile because of my

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:15.420
persuasive message but straight out of
the womb I could sell him my nonsense

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.100
and nobody can do anything about it so
then to answer your question it exactly

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:26.040
I need to get to that child at the point
where he's got no defenses that's when

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.480
the buck is happening that's as simple
and it's not conspiratorial it really is

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:37.110
what's happening Joanna
I'd like to get back quickly to the

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:40.200
slide where you talked about we don't
necessarily have to go there but let's

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:46.470
just recapture when you were talking
about how convenient it is for it's a

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:51.870
various disciplines to say well people
act biological people act driven by

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:56.660
culture when we're trying to understand
their behavior and their sexuality but

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:02.280
then the various inconsistencies a creep
in for example when people are seen as

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.260
purely biological purely animals driven
by biology when we're considering for

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:12.090
example ecological questions so my my
quick that's my quick comment my

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:17.700
question to you is do you see a way that
we can bring a lot of these then we can

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:22.230
bring the inconsistencies out and start
bringing a discussion in which we're

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:27.450
actually considering people as as both
more holistically so that those who want

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:32.280
to condemn let's say a people's
ecological behavior don't get away with

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.990
saying well we're just like bacteria
when those who are saying well we're

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:41.940
purely social constructs get away with
it a moment before that evolutionary

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:46.680
psychologists don't argue that we are
strictly biological beings rather the

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.640
formal position is what's called
interactionism in other words no

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.650
evolutionary psychologists worth his
salt doesn't recognize that for most

01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:01.030
traits that matter we are inextricable
mix of our biology and our environment

01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:06.580
absolutely but that's not what we hear
right so evolutionists or from or from

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.750
the ideologues from philosophy so the
inconsistency that I was talking about

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:16.990
is that people who are often let's say
if we're looking at ecological arguments

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:21.490
so for example population is spreading
too quickly right so human population

01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:27.640
growth must be stopped people are seen
as multiplying like bacteria are

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.410
multiplying like other Malthusian
organisms right that are going to

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:37.420
multiply as long as there are resources
for them and then there's going to be a

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.740
population crash right well as the other
perspective that you were discussing

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:47.380
earlier is is a perspective of more more
culturally driven so all I'm trying to

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.180
say is that I wish we could build from
the Manama logical networks that would

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:58.210
be more visible that we could then apply
to problems across this so one of the

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.420
night I don't think I've ever mentioned
this publicly so maybe this is as

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.450
they're taping me maybe this will be the
time to do it so one of the projects

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:12.550
that I'm hoping to start is a website
where people can submit their

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:17.830
nomological network for some phenomenon
so that that way after a certain time

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:20.860
period
you know instead of looking at it's not

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.380
a literature review right the normal
logical network is not a literature

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.800
review it's it's a completely different
way of thinking it's what is all the

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.540
data that I need to have that would
render this argument unassailable and so

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.930
imagine now if you could go to this
website and you want to look at

01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:38.740
pornography the evolutionary roots of
pornography well there is a normal

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:42.880
optical network that exists so I'm
hoping to do exactly what you're asking

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:50.230
for and that's one of my next projects
David thanks for your talk dad what I

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:53.740
was wondering about is well first of all
just by way of background so when I

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:58.540
study religious groups and they're gonna
hire they're gonna hire a pastor they

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:02.590
have ideological conformity so it's a
board they're gonna hire a pastor

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:07.360
they're not gonna hire anybody who
doesn't have their same ideological

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.370
background and really so now I look at
your slide where you show me that in

01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:18.080
communications for example they
don't have anybody else except those who

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.370
are like-minded right so it's
inconceivable that they would ever hire

01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:25.489
somebody else outside their tribe Yeah
right

01:14:25.489 --> 01:14:29.650
so we're never going to have that
diversity of opinion so my question is

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:35.679
knowing that there are certain programs
that are ideological tribes and they are

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:42.350
absolutely hostile to outsiders how do
we ever how do we change that yeah it's

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:46.400
a tough guy mean the the sort of the the
vague response to that but it might

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.040
sound gimmicky is I tell people that to
the extent that we are innately tribal

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.960
right so we are coalitional animals we
do see the world as Blue Team and Red

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:05.420
Team you know whatever try to then
instantiate your desire to belong to the

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.520
tribe of truth now we can get into what
this truth mean but in other words don't

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.420
let me give you a specific example I
often get someone who writes to me and

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.140
says well you know I watch all your
stuff I read all your stuff I can't tell

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.710
are you conservative are you liberal are
you this are you that and my answer is

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:28.489
I'm none of those things I'm a one idea
at a time person so sometimes you'll on

01:15:28.489 --> 01:15:32.929
the death penalty for example I'm
someone who thinks we don't have to get

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:38.570
into all this now but I believe that if
you are a serial rapist of children and

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:44.690
we have ten your DNA in the the rectum
of ten children

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:50.480
I feel no moral difficulty of executing
you okay on that dimension then you

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.580
would think orgy disguise right-wing
when it comes to social issues I'm about

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.120
as liberal as they come you would think
I'm a social justice warrior I mean sort

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.910
of speak right so I'm an ideas guy
Ayelet whatever cognitive consistency

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:10.489
that exists within me allow me to take
positions I don't belong to left I don't

01:16:10.489 --> 01:16:14.270
belong to classical liberal I don't
belong a so what I would love for people

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:20.030
to do is foster that vent simply take
piecemeal ideas at a time and then using

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:24.290
whatever moral compass you have form an
opinion that's hopefully informed that's

01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:27.950
it a few more questions gather or you
okay good

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:33.350
all right well Christopher then yeah so
you talked a lot about anti science and

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:37.160
all that kind of stuff
from I'm in psychology and the vibe I

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.850
get now is that it's starting to
actually happen under the guise of

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:45.200
science with for example in personality
psychology and social psychology there's

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.570
benevolent sexism and all that kind of
stuff and so can I can I explain what

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:53.980
that is before you give you a sure and
actually I have written several articles

01:16:53.980 --> 01:17:02.030
great yeah so in the neverending desire
to find sexism everywhere it turns out

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:06.170
that the standard form of sexism that
you would all be familiar with and that

01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:10.430
you would condemn is called hostile
sexism but there's another form of

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:14.300
pernicious sexism
that's called benevolent sexism so if

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:19.100
you are got long to a woman that's
benevolent sexism if you open the door

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:24.170
to a woman that's benevolent sexism if
she is being attacked by three men and

01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:29.360
you come to save her now you're in a
real difficult position do I save her

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.610
and then I'm a sexist or do I pretend I
didn't hear her screaming and I could at

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:38.330
least avoid the appellation of being a
sexist so that's what benevolent sexism

01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:42.230
is folks go ahead yep so you talk a lot
of it like the solution to what we can

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:47.240
do as citizens and and every end as
academics and teaching but now since

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.630
it's actually gone into peer review and
I think the benevolent sexism scale has

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:54.440
like three thousand citations something
ridiculous and and a lot of it isn't

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.700
very critical I I feel like as academics
and as researchers we can actually

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.510
challenge that through science since
instead of just accepting it as accepted

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:07.700
science even though it's total crap yeah
so your question is what can we do to

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:13.100
fight against this fight against this in
other words don't you know Irish I mean

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.800
really I receive enumerable emails from
people what can I do what can I do just

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.280
you don't have to have a huge platform
your professor says something that

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.480
completely defies logic challenge them
respectfully politely with civility

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.310
right but challenge them don't be quiet
don't don't do what regrettably Lindsey

01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:35.330
had to do which is feel that she
couldn't speak your you're a professor

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:38.900
at a meeting someone says something that
is contrary to human dignity challenged

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.790
them on it everybody has a voice in this
battle its ideological trench warfare

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:47.800
just get engaged from the smallest
possible way to the biggest possible way

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:56.270
Joanne I know that this is to talk about
what's happening in the universities but

01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:00.949
it's really starting in JK it's starting
in elementary school with the

01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:06.920
victimology that everybody has to get a
trophy nobody can fail I know in 1992 I

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.180
was fighting cold language with my
children I quit my job rented a church

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.210
and ran a school for three years or my
middle child would have been illiterate

01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:19.340
now I would be doing the same thing over
the sex ed but now we have 30% of our

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:25.070
children in grade six are not competent
in math or reading there is something

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:30.940
wrong here and what we're teaching them
is you are a victim and you d you you

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:36.380
warrant being praised for everything
they teach phonics they teach the

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:40.160
initial consonant and anything you guess
for that word they tell you it's a great

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.260
job even though every word is wrong so I
think that what this all is happening

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:49.760
now is just a manifestation of what has
been going on for many many years

01:19:49.760 --> 01:20:01.430
starting with JK Daniel I have a
question I'm a PhD student computer

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:06.290
science in particular I find it
interesting with my peers often times

01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:11.270
especially with say some controversies
involving the Google memo yes I find a

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:17.060
lot of my peers don't speak out in favor
of the conclusions that were in that

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:22.219
memo but and oftentimes they're very
intelligent people but they don't speak

01:20:22.219 --> 01:20:28.010
up like on the other side but then often
I'll find that faculty within my

01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:32.390
department not necessarily my department
but in other universities that have been

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:37.880
us been a part of they oftentimes will
not like that would be the only side

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.260
you'll hear is the one against the
domore memo right now I always say I

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:48.800
don't like to come oh this is involving
sex differences and the demographics you

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.850
find within the tech industry so I can
maybe I can summarize it for the people

01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:55.550
who don't know because I actually knew
about it

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:59.540
so just to give you the background to
that story I had been invited to the

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:05.929
Google main campus to give a lecture but
what's part of what they call the talks

01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:09.949
at Google series and my talk was on how
my you know evolutionary psychology

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:15.320
stuff right and then a few days after
that the Google memo broke so the rumor

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:20.929
on the internet was it was someone who
had been at my talk who had been

01:21:20.929 --> 01:21:25.550
emboldened by it and and so then before
the whole thing breaks out I was in

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:31.520
contact with James the more it's for him
to come on my show I was in California

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.530
on vacation with my family but then the
the Google people who are who were fans

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:42.290
were invited me said if you speak to
James the more we can guarantee you

01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:46.940
what's going to happen to your lecture
meaning that it would never be posted

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:52.389
and so we took the very sort of
pragmatic decision of holding off our

01:21:52.389 --> 01:21:56.960
conversation until after Google had
posted my talk but the fact that we even

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.670
have to engage in this mental calculus
is extraordinary this is supposed to be

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:07.429
Google but they do no evil and they were
engaging in evil yes so my question is

01:22:07.429 --> 01:22:12.290
and since I'm kind of early on in my
academic career but I obviously like to

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:16.460
go to the academic route I'm one of
these theory people I love my

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:22.130
theoretical computer science do you have
any advice for any PhD students that

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:27.559
really are wanting to help fix this
problem whether fixing is the right word

01:22:27.559 --> 01:22:30.590
yeah and whether it be short term or
long term

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:36.199
any advice for save researchers and that
that want to fight in this battle any

01:22:36.199 --> 01:22:40.130
advice for them that they could use now
because right now obviously if say for

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:43.940
example if I were to be very openly
against some of the policies that are

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.770
out right now especially in CS
departments yes for example there are

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:51.920
one example now it's not usually talked
about as often as there's for example

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:58.130
women only scholarships and a lot of CSS
departments which I find yeah but

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:04.489
anyways my main point is what advice can
you give for PhD students that wants to

01:23:04.489 --> 01:23:09.199
maybe find a tenure-track position if
they're one that exists I got it well

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:12.380
too
avoid job security you know I've always

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.950
conflicted when people ask me that
question because I understand the

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:21.800
pragmatic reality of people having real
concerns but those concerns arise not

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.030
just as you as a PhD student if now I'm
an assistant professor should I speak or

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:30.140
wait till I'm tenured now when I am
tenured should I speak or wait Abdulla

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.290
half full professor
now I'm full professors should I wait or

01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:37.040
until I have my chair professorship now
I'm sure professor but I think I have a

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.700
good shot at the Nobel Prize should I
speak or wait until that well now I'm

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:46.130
dead should I speak or write so my point
is this is there's a in ecological

01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:49.400
economics some of you may be familiar
with something called tragedy of the

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.400
Commons right so let me just briefly
mention it for those of you who don't

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.290
know suppose I've got a plot of land and
they've got ten farmers and we all agree

01:23:57.290 --> 01:24:03.110
gentlemen agreement none of us is going
to use that plot of land for our cattle

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:07.370
to graze on it because we need it to
recover right now each of us thinks well

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:11.720
you know what if I cheat on that
agreement I get my cattle to graze on

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.040
the land but the other nine guys will be
super honorable that's the ideal outcome

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:20.870
because I still get to do what I want
and all the others will be good of

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:24.680
course the tragedy of the Commons is
that every single one falls under that

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.220
premise and then we all cheat and the
whole thing goes to hell how do we how

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.400
do we apply this to what you're saying
so the tragedy of the Commons you know I

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.950
don't have to speak because I worry
about my career but let him speak let

01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:37.670
God speak let Jordan Peterson speak
that's some other guy who puts his neck

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:41.150
out speak because I got to worry about
my PhD I got to worry about my sis I got

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:46.490
no if we all were able to develop the
term that you heard me use in the

01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:52.250
Canadian Senate testicular fortitude and
speak in unison the problem would be

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:56.510
resolved very quickly but because we're
all bound to our myopic careerist

01:24:56.510 --> 01:25:00.860
interests then it ends up being that the
bouncer could keep coming at you rise up

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:05.600
speak Matthew then cassia and then Phil
and I'm afraid we'll have to end it

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.930
there
Matthew two quick questions so Nick and

01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:12.260
I have tried to put the Chicago
principles into Queens and one of the

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:16.010
things I found early on is getting our
initial signers was you'd have people

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:19.010
willing to sign but they wouldn't post
about it on their Facebook so expanding

01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:23.030
on this taking a principled stance
versus the utilitarian stance up you

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:25.190
know
I'd ask the guy it's like you can you

01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:28.250
sign this great you'd sign it and then
they wouldn't post about it's like you

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:32.060
know you have to why wouldn't you sign
it but you know also your your point

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.820
about you know needing to take a
principled stance do you have any sort

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:39.350
of specific advice on identifying when
it's better to take a utilitarian stance

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:42.140
and when it's better to take a
principled stance and then the second

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:48.230
one are you and then I wake you up in
the ontario school system so you know

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:53.780
I'd say both you know I graduated high
school in 2008 but I would say is you

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.170
know you talk about being ready to
defend yourself as a child talking about

01:25:57.170 --> 01:26:01.550
the cereal analogy I would say we were
never really taught critical thinking

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:06.830
from a true like you know a true say a
first-year University logic course in in

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:10.130
high school and you say would you say
that you have any comments on the

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:16.550
sufficiency of the school system not
teaching basic logic so the second part

01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:21.170
yes there's a complete lacunae of that
so I don't know what else to add other

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:25.580
than we need to foster greater critical
thinking that's really the point in my

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.590
next book your first comment when should
you be more utilitarian versus

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:34.490
principled it really is on a case by
case you know I sometimes I'll post

01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:39.620
something where I'm really angry because
no one is rising up you know get engaged

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.860
and then someone will write say oh but
it's easy for you to say because you're

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.210
tenured but I've got two young kids and
I'm still a assistant professor right

01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.450
but I received 3,000 death threats
nobody knows you

01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:55.280
so who's suffering more right in other
words there is no way for you to get

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:01.010
engaged in war this is war this is
ideological war while being guaranteed

01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:05.630
that there'll be no harm to you right
did you go to the invasion of Normandy

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:08.450
and say but I'll only sign up if you
could absolutely again because you know

01:27:08.450 --> 01:27:12.380
I've got young kids because I've got my
uncle because I've got my PhD no you

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.040
went knowing that you might die so
that's the kind of courage we need to

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:21.050
foster if we all stood up together not
worried about our idiosyncratic concerns

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:25.820
and fought this horrible monster these
idea pathogens it will be resolved

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:29.470
quickly if not it's only going to
continue for the foreseeable future

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:34.020
cassia
I have a question I have a question

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:39.659
regarding this very interesting graph
and it's a conclusion to which I've kind

01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:43.469
of arrived on my own but I obviously
don't have the empirical data to back it

01:27:43.469 --> 01:27:49.739
up so why would you say I'm a humanities
background why would you say that

01:27:49.739 --> 01:27:53.639
there's a greater like what explanation
is given that there for the greater

01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:59.670
ratio of Democrat to Republican leaning
in those areas yes rather in the

01:27:59.670 --> 01:28:03.119
humanities and not in engineering
because yeah I've had a conversation

01:28:03.119 --> 01:28:07.380
with a math professor in which she says
what's all just you guys all you guys do

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:12.900
is opinion you guys talk about opinions
No so could you speak - yes I think it's

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:17.429
because a lot of those fields end up
being driven a lot more by an ethos of

01:28:17.429 --> 01:28:21.960
activism rather than an ethos of
knowledge right so what I mean by that

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:28.020
is sociology inherently could be
perfectly scientific right there are

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:32.610
very serious sociologists a quantitative
mathematical sociologist that do very

01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:37.530
very elaborate beautiful scientific work
they're not driven by activism there is

01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:41.010
some phenomenon that they're interested
in studying at the sociological level

01:28:41.010 --> 01:28:45.030
and they apply the weaponry of the
scientific method to study it the

01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:49.949
problem is that in many of the fear
those fields what drop the eat the

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:55.050
driving engine that his own death of the
person is not the pursuit of knowledge

01:28:55.050 --> 01:29:01.230
it's the promulgation of activism and
ideologies and therefore that's why

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:04.579
you're gonna get that lopsided stuff
it's more difficult in business or in

01:29:04.579 --> 01:29:10.290
neuroscience or in engineering to have
thus lopsidedness because the people who

01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:15.119
go into this can come in all varieties
there they're really to advance a field

01:29:15.119 --> 01:29:19.380
of knowledge if you go into sociology
you've already self selected yourself as

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.969
an activist that's the problem
I forgot the sillim was on the list so

01:29:23.969 --> 01:29:32.340
I'm not man my man thank you God your
your your slide on the various pathogens

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:36.599
on the one who had that you know yeah
that's the one the one you just repent

01:29:36.599 --> 01:29:42.980
by on this one post-modernism oh that
hurt

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:51.599
what what's up yeah this one Don what
what surprised me or or or what I found

01:29:51.599 --> 01:29:58.989
missing gap maybe you have a good reason
for it is that I would say that all the

01:29:58.989 --> 01:30:05.230
box in the circle that you put up our
particular description of the viruses

01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:12.190
but there is a metal virus afflicting
the West and the university is not

01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:17.940
outside of the society and the metal
wires afflicting the West is

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:25.809
multiculturalism yeah everything falls
in that box it's it's not on this slide

01:30:25.809 --> 01:30:31.780
just because I couldn't fit it away when
but the the little idea patches is

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:36.070
greater than this one I'm with you when
our prime minister says yes

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:42.070
soon after election to New York Time
magazine the Canada has no core culture

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:48.550
there is no mainstream the result is all
of this and much more and we the

01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:54.969
Canadian people elect him resoundingly
yes I guess the what when I put cultural

01:30:54.969 --> 01:30:58.179
relativism that's related to the
multicultural idea right because that

01:30:58.179 --> 01:31:04.420
that's how you you promulgate that yeah
and now for our final question and

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:09.340
thanks very much for your patience Phil
my pleasure I took great pride in one of

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:16.110
those graphs but are the the ratios that
yeah my question is I don't know whether

01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:22.449
is basically I well let's start I'm
finishing Martin Gilbert's book on the

01:31:22.449 --> 01:31:28.559
history of Judaism under Islam yeah and
one of the things that strikes me as

01:31:28.559 --> 01:31:37.329
that a religion is a kind of virus and
but but also it seems to be an inherent

01:31:37.329 --> 01:31:43.659
part of how humans have evolved did it
have some survival value at stage yes

01:31:43.659 --> 01:31:47.829
great question so if you if you'll
forgive me I just going to get a bit

01:31:47.829 --> 01:31:52.430
technical with your with the answer when
you're studying

01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:59.540
a cultural form let's say music art
religion from an evolutionary

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:03.350
perspective there are several ways that
you could study it one way is to argue

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:08.660
that that form has adaptive value right
so it's an adaptation I'll explain in a

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:15.590
second okay another way is to argue that
it is an exaptation and an adaptation is

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:20.720
that something confers either survival
or reproductive benefits so in the case

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:25.460
of religion an adaptive argument for
religion would be but and this is the

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.640
argument that David Sloan Wilson an
evolutionary biologist a good friend of

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:34.520
mine has made in a book called Darwin's
Cathedral if a group that is religious

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:40.490
has greater community greater cohesion
greater demarcation between us versus

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:45.710
them and if that confers survival
advantage to the group more so than a

01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:49.760
group that lacks in religiosity that
would be an adaptive argument for

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:56.960
religion others are you know there is no
adaptation to religion rather religion

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:03.650
is an exaptation the key proponent of
that idea as a anthropologist by name of

01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:09.440
Pascal ye who was on my show and the
argument there is that an exaptation

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:15.890
is a byproduct of evolution for example
the color of our the color of our

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:20.540
skeletal system whatever it is is not
due to the fact that that is an

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:24.710
adaptation it's a byproduct that's a
path dependency right so so then

01:33:24.710 --> 01:33:29.660
applying it to religion we are for
example a coalitional animal we already

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:33.050
have the neuronal system to view the
world as us-versus-them

01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:38.570
that neural system already exists
religion piggybacks on it on it right

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:44.000
right Abrahamic languages all have there
are the Jews the Gentiles the the

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.080
believers and the kafar the right they
are the ones who are going with Jesus

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.230
and the rest of us who are going to burn
in hell right so there's a very clear

01:33:51.230 --> 01:33:56.330
demarcation between us versus them so
the exaptation argument is that there is

01:33:56.330 --> 01:34:01.280
no adaptive value to religion it's just
something it uses its Mima plex it's

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.550
it's viral qualities to to latch on
systems

01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:10.230
already exist and I'm not sure where I
stand on it because both arguments are

01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:25.729
reasonably compelling to me thank you
very much
