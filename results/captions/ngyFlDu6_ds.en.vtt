Lindsay Sheppard.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.130
Thank you everyone. We're gonna conduct
this conversation similar to an

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.880
interview. We have gone over what the
questions will be but we really haven't

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.790
talked about the responses. We just
wanted to make sure we knew where we

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.560
wanted to go we have about 35 minutes
for this discussion and then we're going

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.790
to move on to the question and answer
period so if we miss something that

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.690
you're curious about then please keep it
in mind and we'll come to it at the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.130
question and answer. So to begin
Lindsay let's start with something I

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.940
know maybe people don't how did you end
up at Wilfrid Laurier in the first place?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.840
Yeah, so back in 2013 this is right
after I graduated high school really

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.860
Jordan Peterson reached out to me (Right.)
and he said I'm gonna give you an

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.690
opportunity. (Right) Would you like to be a
right wing operative? Right. Okay. So

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.070
Jordan Peterson he comes to you just
after high school (Yeah.) and he begins

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.600
grooming you. He begins grooming you? It's been years. So okay. And from the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.130
start it was Wilfred Laurier University
and I'd have to apply in 2017. Right

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.200
that's a long, that's a long con. Oh
yeah. Right. Whoa. All right obviously

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.250
that's not true and you know and and and
you know as well that somebody's going

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.900
to cut this piece from YouTube and it's
going to appear here's where Lindsay

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620
Shepherd admits that she was the
operative the confederate of Jordan

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.030
Peterson but but honestly how did you
end up at Wilfrid Laurier more simple

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.019
reasons so I did my bachelor in
communication at Simon Fraser University

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.459
in BC because I'm from Burnaby which is
just outside of Vancouver and I thought

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.090
I want to do my MA in Ontario because
I've never lived there so I just looked

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.820
at what there was I was looking at
communication but I decided sometimes

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.590
communication can be a little bit
superficial in the topics it covers so

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.250
in the alphabetical list right under
communication studies was cultural

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.810
analysis and social theory and I thought
that sounds like a little deeper right

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.760
so I applied to that instead so you
thought you were getting away from the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.449
frivolousness of communications by going
into cultural analysis and social theory

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.790
which turned out to be
worse okay I I'm not making a judgment

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:53.150
I'm just I'm now for my own part so I've
been at Laurier for 12 years and when I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.989
came in I was naive about critical
theory I didn't know what it was I kept

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.200
hearing my my colleagues talk about
critical theory and I always says I

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.629
thought it was critical thinking I
thought it was such a great thing when

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.579
they wanted to include it in every
syllabus I thought well I guess I guess

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.150
it's a good thing that we're rejecting
all those other points of interest we're

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.569
rejecting those for other courses but
let's keep doing this critical theory

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.930
thing so I was naive but then what
happened was I noticed that I was

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.710
falling out of favor with my colleagues
when Jordan Peterson came on the scene I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.940
saw that he was I didn't understand
everything that he was about and but I

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.960
did know that he was trying to say
something in a university setting and I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.449
I supported that and in fact I was at
Western when David Suzuki was having his

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.330
debate with Philippe Rushton and and so I
was aware of how beneficial it is when

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.229
there are divergent views that are able
to clash so I wrote a wrote an op-ed in

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.669
support of Jordan Peterson and suddenly
my colleagues didn't say hello to me in

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.449
the halls then about six months after
that my own university canceled a

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.990
speaker Daniel Robitaille who was one of
the defense team for Ghomeshi

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.289
they the students on campus she was
coming to speak on our campus and

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.889
students agitated until she cancelled
and my administration did nothing and my

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.720
and many of my colleagues
celebrated this so I wrote another op-ed

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.430
for the Toronto Star and I said what is
going on at my University and I made I

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.639
made the comment that I said where are
the students getting this idea and I

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.360
said it's from their from their
professors and it was at that point that

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.220
they held a special faculty meeting
where they could tell me why I was wrong

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.620
but I come to free expression honestly
but I still didn't know Lindsay but you

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.909
can see that we we have similar
interests so moving ahead let's talk

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.539
about this next question we didn't know
each other prior to the incident well

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:54.980
you have to fill in some of the gaps
it wasn't happy circumstances so

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.640
what led to this first article that
appeared in the National Post November

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.810
11th that really showed what was going
on in your situation how did you get

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.620
there and what what happened to get you
there it was Christie Blatchford's article

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.070
yes okay so as part of my grad program I
was a teaching assistant and because my

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.380
degree was in communication I TAed
communication studies 101 Canadian

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.140
communication and context and so half of
that course is content and discussion

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.880
and the other half is writing skills and
for that course there was two weeks

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.870
where you had to do grammar and so I did
I covered grammar as dry as it was and

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.130
for university students right for
university students who should maybe

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.260
already know I'm taking judgments I'm
not making judgments I mean the

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.860
suggested example outline of what we
needed to teach for grammar was I walk

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.250
you walk she walks right we walk so I
just made sure my students were all on

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.400
the same page with conjugating verbs in
the English language and then I thought

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.140
well let's instead of just looking at
grammar as something dry let's think of

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.000
it is actually something that maybe has
implications in society connect it to a

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.010
bigger picture and so I brought up the
the topical issue of gender neutral

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:24.290
pronouns and how are those going to be
integrated into the English language and

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:30.770
how does that work and so I used a clip
from Television Ontario TVO public

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.400
access public so millions of people have
watched this already it's now on YouTube

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000
available to everyone
yeah and it was on The Agenda with Steve

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.710
Paikin one of Canada's best journalists
and it was between Jordan Peterson yes I

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.490
had never met him
you really had never met that was the

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.420
first clip I'd ever seen of him and he
was in conversation with Nicolas Matte who

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.980
was a professor of transgender studies
at U of T and I just showed two short

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.300
clips of them in exchange I'm talking
specifically about you know they

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:12.169
and them pronouns "zee" and "zer" and so
obviously Matte's argument professor Matte

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:16.060
was saying well we need to use these
it's it's about human dignity and

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.530
Peterson was saying well it no it's
compelled speech and so I had like a ten

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.879
minute conversation with my students in
three different sections of twenty-five

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:30.199
students and I thought it went well
right no one no one stormed out of the

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:38.539
room no one cried it was it was civil
right but it turns out that someone had

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:45.769
a problem and so I received an email the
next week just a very vague email saying

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:50.269
you need to and this was from my
supervising professor professor Rambukkana

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:55.220
he said you need to come into a
meeting with me your master's program

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.940
director Herbert Pimlott and an official
from the diversity and equity office and

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.690
at that point I was not familiar with
all this stuff about ooh diversity and

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.100
equity it's dangerous I had no idea but
I still saw that and I thought this

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.610
could only be about the Jordan Peterson
Club that's it

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.740
and so I thought this is pretty crazy so
I called my mom and we had a discussion

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.230
and we decided that I should go to this
meeting which was in less than 24 hours

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.550
by the way and I and they never
suggested to me I could bring anybody

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.350
and for the record TAs at Laurier are
not unionized so there was no union rep

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:39.410
or anything and so I went to the meeting
and I did secretly record it right and

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.130
then the meeting was pretty outrageous
to me

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:49.130
I was accused of transphobia violating
Bill C16 which is something we talked

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.560
about in the class and bill C16 is
the bill that says you must not

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.790
prejudice against people who are gender
identify a certain way and right and a

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.750
lot of that bill is just completely
valid like you don't discriminate hiring

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.769
transgender people of course but then it
was just the compelled speech part of it

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:11.209
right and they'd also said that you had
transgressed the gendered sexual and

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:15.770
violence policy which I did yes which
because you'd made someone uncomfortable

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:21.410
yes because I learned in that meeting
that gender-neutral pronouns are not up

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:27.259
for debate and it's just something you
can't talk about and it creates a toxic

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:31.670
environment to present both arguments
for and against them those were actual

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.139
quotes yes recorded your Rambukkana
said that this is not up for debate

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:42.529
right and he also said it's like I
neutrally played speech by Hitler right

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:48.319
equating Peterson well equating TV
Ontario yeah to a speech by Hitler yes

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:53.809
so so this transpires and at one point
you were wondering who was the person

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:58.489
who had brought the charge against you
yes and I did ask multiple times in the

00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:02.749
meeting I said how many people
complained like who I don't need their

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:08.540
name but like it kind of matters was it
one person or was it like ten people but

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.259
they wouldn't give me a single you know
they wouldn't even show me the complaint

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:18.889
like I could not see it in the original
words or anything but it turns out that

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:24.829
no one actually complained right right
so we're jumping ahead a little bit but

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:28.610
after an investigation it was shown that
no one had complained yeah it was made

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:34.790
up it it seems and again I still don't
know and the thing is if I hadn't

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:40.040
recorded this and hadn't gone to the
media with it would I have ever known I

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.749
would have probably gone on forever
thinking wow I actually hurt somebody or

00:11:44.749 --> 00:11:48.799
multiple people and that could have
actually affected how I conduct my

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:53.149
entire life probably right okay so let's
take you you've got this recording now

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:58.399
yeah you've heard some crazy talk from
two professors and a representative from

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:03.350
the diversity and equity office yep and
now you've got this recording and you

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:08.329
know that potentially this is going to
damage your career academically they're

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:12.709
they're bringing this against you you
decide to take action by going to the

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:16.970
media that's right yeah so so who did
you go to and what was what we know it's

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.259
gonna be Christy Blachford hmm right
yeah so I did get some people

00:12:21.259 --> 00:12:24.919
criticizing me like why didn't you just
go to the deans or something and it's

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:29.209
like well you know and this was touched
on earlier it would have just become in

00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:32.480
a different framework like it would have
just been kind of covered up and like

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.519
yeah well the very fact that we had we
still have a university president who

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:42.139
was not willing to say from the outset
that you had done nothing wrong right

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:46.639
right she would not come to your defense
and and no one from the University came

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:55.130
to your defense as far as I know am I am
i right with that oh I did okay so so

00:12:55.130 --> 00:13:04.639
someone did thank God for him so just to
jump in then I did see I hear this is

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.880
gonna paint me I'm sure my colleagues
are gonna watch this video so I was

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:15.740
coming back from a hunting trip with a
gun oh boy now now and I probably ate

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:23.149
red meat while I was there but anyway it
was anyway so I was coming back it was

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:27.800
this Saturday the Sunday after the
Blatchford piece had come out and I said

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.170
to my wife okay well I've had fun didn't
get anything

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.130
can I read the newspapers and she said
no she said you can't read the

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:39.019
newspapers this was November 12 this 
why not she said you're not gonna like

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:43.670
what you read in the newspapers and so I
saw Christy Blatchford's piece and I saw

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.750
what had happened to Lindsay and I
thought they're at it again I mean I've

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.940
seen this on campus time and time again
but here's finally okay I didn't realize

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.640
that it was recording I saw all the
quotes and I wondered how that had

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.380
happened I but I didn't know I
immediately contacted Christy Blachford

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.810
I didn't know her I just I couldn't find
Lindsay's email so I contacted Lindsay

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.240
or I'm sorry Christy and I said can you
put me in touch with this young lady I

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.130
know what she's going through
I know the climate on my University and

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:20.959
I need to reach out to her Christy was
good enough to be the conduit for that

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:24.649
also at the same time I sent an email to
my president the president of my

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:29.980
university an email to Rambukkana an
email to Pimlott and I said is this true

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.040
you know is this true because maybe it
wasn't

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.949
I said please let me know and to my
president I said you know I about a year

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:44.300
ago when I told you that this was going
to happen when I said that we have a

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.620
real problem with free expression on our
campus that we've got a culture of

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.320
professors who are trying to shut down
free expression and telling students to

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.589
do it remember when we had that private
meeting and I said that it could happen

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:59.730
it would get worse well now it has I
didn't get any response I never have

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.850
from my university president
incidentally I didn't get any response

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.420
from Rambukkana I didn't get any
response from Pimlott so I I took that

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.829
to be that what I was reading from
Christie Blatchford was accurate I then

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:15.240
wrote my own article for the Toronto
Star because I thought well we need to

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.399
get this story out even more and then
after that Lindsay did contact me and

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:27.660
said it's true what's happened I have a
recording and we decided where do we go

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.569
from here
and it was at that point being

00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:35.370
previously in the media I have some
friends still who who are in television

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:41.519
and I was able to reach out to global
news that I was able to organize with

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:45.480
Lindsay an interview for that Friday of
the same week because I just thought

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.620
this is so important and it really did
take some convincing because at that

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.029
time the media still didn't get I mean
these people had gone to university the

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:57.300
people who are journalists think gone to
university even 10 20 years ago they

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.990
don't know what has happened on our
campuses since then they don't

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.209
appreciate it but one  national reporter
Mike troll a was kind enough to come out

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:10.709
and that's actually where we met the
first time right and it was at that

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:17.100
point mike relay does the story for
global national news and the tape the

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.560
recording goes viral right what were
your thoughts about releasing that

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.440
recording yeah so at first when Christy
Blachford broke the story I wasn't sure

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.399
about the legalities of the recording so
I just said to her can you just make a

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:37.860
seem like I have a good memory and like
these quotes and she was like okay and

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.630
later I did learn that only one person
in the room needs to know that there's a

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.740
recording going on that person was me
obviously you can't just leave a

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.839
recording a recorder in one room and
leave right as long as I was there so

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:58.589
then I realized okay it's it's okay if
this is released but yes global thing is

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:03.930
I don't actually remember
permission to release it I remember them

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:09.480
saying like can we do an excerpt to an
excerpt not knowing what that would

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.150
actually be another time but then that
what did they say what was that other

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.929
the cow was out of the barn
at that point yeah and the thing I was

00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:25.079
worried about releasing it because like
I do cry in it embarrassing well you

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.689
might not want to mention this but her
mother says I think people might think

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:33.900
that you are mentally unstable which was
really I mean if you've heard this

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.289
recording you you can see that here is a
woman of incredible intestinal fortitude

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:44.570
honestly and and and it is I mean I
would have cried with those bullies

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.090
because that's what they were and you
could hear it and the fact that she

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.559
could still keep the presence of mind
even under this incredible stress was

00:17:52.559 --> 00:18:00.690
fantastic so so okay the it goes viral
then then what happens like let's go to

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.309
the other chronology now the world is
listening and in terms of national media

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:10.500
there were was a two-week period where
almost every national newspaper and the

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.000
post media chain were running articles
about free expression and Lindsay

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.169
Shepards case so what were you seeing
happening there we've got things going

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:23.669
on like an investing investigation is
launched a bit but what else what were

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:30.780
you seeing chronologically yes so there
was the investigation I mean we can jump

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.500
ahead and there was eventually an
apology yeah

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.240
professor rhombic Anna and from the
president right right but you know yes

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.500
it was almost like overnight suddenly I
noticed like really prominent people

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.330
were following me on Twitter well you
and this was you you had never been on

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.260
Twitter right yeah you're on Twitter and
then you have fifty thousand Twitter

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.320
followers well I built out and at one
point I choked and we said well now you

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:05.730
have more Twitter followers than Laurier
University right so this investigation

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.049
though what's interesting is all the
weird things that happen before you get

00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:13.860
the apology because our president goes
on TV Oh

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.600
so what happened we agenda on the agenda
meta way yeah yeah I wonder if we can

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.210
show that clip in our classes it's still
up in the air I don't know but so what

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:29.820
happened what happened yeah so she kind
of kept repeating you know they were not

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.169
coming out in defensive free expression
bracele she kept kind of repeating the

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:38.010
line to Steve Paikin
you know I can't speak to what happened

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.149
in the classroom you know and it kind of
was a moment for me where I realized

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:45.570
like you know in university
administrators they can't take their own

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.470
position which was sad and they're not
gonna stand behind you right you

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.519
actually had to get legal counsel yes
Howard love it

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:59.250
pro bono yes comes and says I'll just be
with you on this and take a look at

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.779
what's going on and ultimately an
investigator comes in and says you've

00:20:03.779 --> 00:20:09.000
done nothing wrong right and then they
is the apology after that is it is yep

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.350
yep so I did nothing wrong but there's
still people who will contend today that

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.399
what I did was very wrong so for the
people who already thought that were

00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:22.380
they convinced by that probably not okay
let's talk about that so you are you get

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.639
the apology but who on the campus let's
not talk about administration or even

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:31.950
Pimlott and Rambo cannon but who on the
campus was hostile toward what you were

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:39.090
doing with free expression um it was the
rainbow Center so the ptq activists and

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:44.429
what was their issue so they were saying
that I was perpetuating transphobia and

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:49.200
actually any media outlet that covered
my story was also perpetuating

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.240
transphobia and that it was silencing
the voices of trans people who were

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.510
actually at the center of this whole
discussion for them it was not about

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.049
inquiry
you know classrooms or free expression

00:21:01.049 --> 00:21:07.169
it was about trans rights you know and I
just don't see that as the center of the

00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:10.950
story it could have been anything I was
discussing in my classroom it didn't

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.299
have to be gender pronouns there are
other taboo or you know topics that some

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:19.679
people are much too afraid to touch
right and what stands out to me is there

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:26.220
were people in the transgendered
community who were supporting you yes

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.700
but there and they
we had articles in the newspaper local

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.889
newspaper from from certain people and
others who came to a rally for free

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:41.429
expression and so that that to me shows
that really it was disingenuous for

00:21:41.429 --> 00:21:44.940
those groups at the rainbow Center to
say that they were the voice of the

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.999
transgendered community they weren't
they were the most vocal the most

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:54.419
hostile but they certainly weren't the
unified voice on that okay so something

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:58.589
I noticed and if we can get to this in
in the question and answer I'd love to

00:21:58.589 --> 00:22:05.820
go through it there was a really
interesting communication strategy that

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.469
was used by the forces of censorship on
my campus I don't want to get into it

00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:14.279
now because I want to keep pursuing
what's going on with Lindsay situation

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:20.099
but there was there were it was like an
organized appeal campaign that just went

00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:22.649
through one and then when that one
didn't work they went to another so if

00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:26.339
we have time in the question and answer
we can talk about how what I would call

00:22:26.339 --> 00:22:31.079
the far left and left-leaning forces on
my campus or the authoritarians if you'd

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:37.619
rather how they twisted language in
order to really get their way or tried

00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:42.629
to get their way so we can talk about
that but maybe that'll be Q&amp;A but just

00:22:42.629 --> 00:22:47.609
being mindful of the time you had
hostility from outside of your program

00:22:47.609 --> 00:22:52.499
but what we've had some conversations
about what it was like to be a master's

00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:57.450
student after this hit the wall this
because you're you didn't leave the

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:04.950
university and you're in a program that
these these professors are really

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.769
indicative of the culture in your
program and you're still in the program

00:23:07.769 --> 00:23:14.219
so what was it like to be in the cast
program as a student after that you get

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:18.839
an apology but you're still having to
finish your master's work right it was

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:24.329
still like hostile I did not have
friends in the room only two of them

00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:29.190
bothered to actually talk to me about
what had happened the rest just presumed

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:34.259
like I am a terrible person and just
disassociated I used to go for coffee

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:39.360
after class with all them just stopped
some you know some of my classmates

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.430
would tweet things like that bitch
Lindsay Shepard needs to shut the fuck

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.510
up
things like that I don't know if my

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.530
classmates were involved in this but
there was an interesting campaign all

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:57.990
around town and around the University
campus there were these black stickers

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:03.870
with white text that said: "Fucking expell
Lindsay Shepherd already." Didn't it have a

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:09.260
spelling mistake on it? It was expelled...
yeah. I mean I'm not making it up. Yeah.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:17.070
It was two L's on (They didn't take your grammar tutorial) yeah and they Sarpied out the extra

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:25.230
Ells so that yeah that you know that
gives me hope it means I don't have to

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:32.070
worry so much about my foes in this
particular battle okay so you you have

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:38.070
had some really tense times in your
program let's finish off talking about

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.840
maybe positive outcomes so as something
as something positive come from this has

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:50.910
there been a ray of sunshine in all of
this rainy gloomy um I think maybe a lot

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.080
of people woke up like especially on the
Lauria campus because this is something

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.850
that you know everyone was talking about
really and it almost kind of forced them

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:05.370
you know the students to engage with the
issue I don't want to say take aside but

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.770
like you know hear what each what
everyone has to say and so when you're

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.940
that close to what's happening in you
know a national news story international

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.110
news in a lot of cases you know it they
kind of woke up to something that

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.030
otherwise they might have not realized
as a problem because if your opinions

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:28.410
fall within the orthodoxy you might
never confront you might never think

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.130
there's a problem with freedom
expression because you never run counter

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:37.440
to it right you did and you ended up
starting a club on campus yes the Lorre

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.970
Society for open inquiry which is and
that's gone right that's that's been

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.150
just a cakewalk
oh yeah it's no problem it's not like we

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.780
had to raise like on GoFundMe like
almost six thousand dollars to bring in

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.590
a university professor to our campus
yeah Francis what is the news here today

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.080
yeah she's quite controversial she's
scary

00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.170
Oh terrifying you know why a student
group has to pay to bring a professor to

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.490
another campus is beyond me and there's
an intersection here with something else

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.600
that's happened recently if I had to
answer the question what what was

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.060
something positive that came out of the
lens

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.050
Lindsey Shepard scandal I would have
said well we did have a free expression

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:21.540
task force that that then looked at the
issue of free expression on our campus

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:28.860
and I'm one of the members or I was up
until a couple days ago and it was an

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:34.830
interesting experience because I was the
only one going into the task force who

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:40.530
was unequivocal in my support for
maximum free expression and I don't know

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:46.620
the position of all my colleagues I know
the majority were probably not I don't

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.380
want to read their mind so they weren't
they weren't saying they were free

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.250
expression supporters and certainly of
the things they'd said outside of the

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.090
committee suggested they weren't but
nonetheless we did come up with a

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.770
document that did support freedom of
expression on our campus I was actually

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:06.090
quite proud of it and I think that
everyone on that task force had come to

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:11.790
some compromises and we we had a
document that we were happy with and it

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.180
was a draft document it wasn't complete
it was still going to be opened up to

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.650
the public so that they could give their
input it wasn't a done deal

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.220
it still isn't a done deal but it was
still moving in the right direction

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.830
direction I felt but then what has just
happened this week is the administration

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:35.430
at my campus outside of the task force
completely unknown to the task force has

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:41.580
now said that is going to charge
security fees for groups or professors

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.830
or associations who want to bring a
speaker onto our campus now that might

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:52.800
sound innocuous enough except that this
really is attacks on those students or

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.440
faculty or associations who are
right-leaning

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:02.850
or libertarian or conservative because
the only people who protest at my campus

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.420
and on the majority campus are on the
and they protest people who are

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.929
right-leaning so this is actually a fee
if you want to be someone who's

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:14.160
libertarian conservative or
right-leaning and so I I looked at this

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.750
and I said we've just crafted a free
expression statement that says we will

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:24.870
support the university institutionally
will support marginalized voices well I

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.070
can show you excellent research that
shows the most marginalized voices on

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.030
university campuses are those who are
libertarian conservative or

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.000
right-leaning they are the most
marginalized voices when it comes to

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.250
free expression how much money does my
university spend to help those

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:47.040
marginalized voices zero they do spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars to give

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.710
a platform to left-leaning voices
through our diversity and equity office

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:57.650
so they're already doing that and I'm
okay with that but there is no equity

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:01.890
they're asking people of a right-leaning
persuasion libertarians conservatives

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:07.740
you need to pony up so what they've in
fact done is they've created a tax on

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.580
free expression it's not free expression
if you're coming from a conservative

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.890
position so I asked my colleagues on the
task force I said will you stand with me

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.100
just to say we will not work toward a
final draft

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.110
we won't work toward a final draft until
the university rescinds this policy at

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:30.870
least so that we can discuss it but
unfortunately I couldn't get the support

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:38.340
of my task force colleagues on this so I
had no choice because it's not a free

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.059
expression document anymore this task
force document because it doesn't do

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:47.850
what it says it will do because it
doesn't allow marginalized voices to

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:53.130
have a say so at this point I've stepped
down and I'm hoping that my university

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:58.140
will say yeah we will rescind that
policy and we can talk more about that

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.630
at the question/answer if you'd like but
just to get to the end of this then

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:11.040
what's your advice Lindsay what's your
advice to students who may be entering

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.320
university or they're already there and
they see that they're being

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.269
indoctrinated not educated
what would you say to them um I see

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:24.989
self-censorship is one of the biggest
problems and it's something I did throat

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:29.249
my entire undergrad and I would even
walk away from class and really wish I

00:30:29.249 --> 00:30:36.239
said something or challenge something
but I I barely ever did and so that's

00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:41.219
something we really need to stop so
don't self sense don't yeah we need to

00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:45.359
be able to say things even you know cuz
I was worried about looking dumb I was

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:51.749
worried about like people thinking I'm a
bad person but that's you know not an

00:30:51.749 --> 00:30:54.689
environment you can really learn in
that's not an environment you can have

00:30:54.689 --> 00:31:00.119
open conversations because there there
are kind of and these are the grad

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:04.109
students in my program they they want to
police your thought right I mean I

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:07.709
started speaking out this semester I
thought I have nothing to lose they

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:12.089
already don't like me and oh yes they
there are some students who just

00:31:12.089 --> 00:31:15.839
wouldn't come to class anymore because I
was there and stuff like that so yeah

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:23.369
yeah so if you are a student here today
take her as human beings we follow I

00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:26.399
think it's easier for us to look at
someone who's doing it already I know

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:31.289
that I'm that way we were hearing from
God sad today and back when I first

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:37.529
started being aware of free expression I
wanted is anybody else concerned about

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:43.109
this and I was really grateful to see
that GAD was very vocal and on his

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:47.099
youtube channel and I sent him an email
I said I'm grateful for what you're

00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:49.889
doing I'm grateful there's a model to
follow I'm looking forward to hearing

00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:54.929
from him today if you are a professor
here today or in some way you're still

00:31:54.929 --> 00:32:01.949
on a university campus we need to learn
to be more disagreeable we can do it

00:32:01.949 --> 00:32:10.259
civilly that's a nod to mark but we need
to be disagreeable we need to find

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:15.059
opportunities to be disagreeable we need
to create those opportunities we need to

00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:19.379
find YouTube videos we don't need to
always bring in speakers if you don't

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:24.479
have a budget to bring in speakers find
a YouTube video that you know has

00:32:24.479 --> 00:32:29.639
academic merit but also is going to
drive the left crazy or drive the

00:32:29.639 --> 00:32:33.570
authoritarians crazy because it I
I'm sorry these dichotomies have left

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:39.149
right it's not always useful I realized
that and I nodded to Francis on this

00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:46.889
because Francis is you know she's a
lefty in the best way but but it is

00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:51.480
there's an authoritarian culture on
campus that that is against free

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.169
expression so I would encourage you look
for those opportunities where you can

00:32:55.169 --> 00:33:02.940
have a showing of some kind of video
make a little bit of a stink stir the

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.139
pot because it's only by pushing back
that we're finally going to get

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:10.679
somewhere into the middle again all
right well thank you for your time

00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.919
everybody

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.690
I'd say disputatious rather than
disagreeable I don't have to be

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:34.390
disagreeable questions for Lindsay and
well James sure doctor Leegin dr. James

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.120
de Ladder
this is dr. League and we're both War

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.110
vets and when I was in Vietnam we had
this policy that you know if you're

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:49.600
attacked and surrounded and that sort of
thing that you bring down you bring down

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.500
airstrikes on your own position and
that's what I felt at some schools not

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.360
hillsdale I taught there three years but
other schools you know it was like that

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.190
it was in your face and when I think of
trans what comes to mind trans this and

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:17.440
trans that is transmogrification of of a
grammatical term that is gender I I

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.690
don't want to split but I'm sure we have
a split in this some think that and I've

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.410
already talked to them that gender is a
grammatical term those of us who are

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:32.020
trained up in Greek and Latin you know
we learned that we learn the excuse me

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:41.490
the inflections the other is X of course
and I'd be interested in I realized that

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:50.980
conservatives libertarians let's make
room for reactionaries like yay unto the

00:34:50.980 --> 00:35:01.780
Middle Ages I think Roberts and then
Clyde thank you very much I'm from the

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:07.270
University of Regina in Saskatchewan one
of the things that I one of the things

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:13.750
that I've realized being in a university
environment is if you are unorthodox or

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:20.680
heterodox in your opinions you really
have to be well thought out and really

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.210
understand your case really strongly
well if you have an Orthodox opinion you

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:31.390
can speak patent nonsense most of the
time and people never questioning

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:36.730
or critique you in that I don't know if
you've found somewhat similar and at the

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:41.980
University of Laurier alright what about
in your program I guess right I mean is

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.150
it don't they say duck speak like you
just kind of repeat the usual points

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.950
just to you know appeal to the people
who order you're on your side I suppose

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:57.940
so yes and that's why a lot of the times
when you so for example someone wrote to

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:03.720
me on social media and they said that
every time I bring in a speaker like

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:12.730
Francis with us and it takes people like
her weeks and months to heal and I'm

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:17.890
damaging entire communities and she
wrote this in a public forum so I also

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.640
replied in the public for him and I said
what do you mean like what are you

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.329
talking about I'm because my first
instinct was I felt bad for her

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:29.619
but then I read it again and I was like
I just don't get how you're not forced

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:34.269
to attend these talks you're not forced
to actually engage with the ideas at all

00:36:34.269 --> 00:36:42.309
probably um how does it take you months
to heal but yeah they they can't really

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:46.839
respond and they don't have to actually
because they'll have people on their

00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:59.740
side anyway make me work huh
first I just want to see if you can

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:06.250
confirm in the class where you showed
the clip from Peterson did you take a

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:13.480
site know the Neutrality was the problem
yes if I had denounced his views first

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.309
it would have been okay if I said oh
here are some terrible views by Jordan

00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:24.039
Peterson this is what not to have it
would have been great okay so there you

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:31.420
didn't affirmatively demean anybody at
all in that selection so how does it

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.890
come from the way you behaved which
sounds perfectly appropriate in the

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.089
university setting not to tell the
students what to think about material

00:37:40.089 --> 00:37:44.950
that you're showing them to being called
a white supremacist

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:50.380
I mean where does that come from right
no that was that was really interesting

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.820
for me is that all of a sudden yes they
were posts calling me a white

00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:01.630
supremacist and I'm perpetuating white
privilege i'm using my whiteness i'm

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:06.760
using my white tears i'm a crying white
girl people before they even knew

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.650
anything about me we're like I'm a white
F no state sympathizer things like that

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:17.920
and I I still don't really get it do you
know well it's better than making an

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.690
argument you weren't wearing a white no
there was no dad over at the time right

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:34.150
thank you and I'd like to go back for a
second and I'm from the University of

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.820
Toronto Mississauga but I'd like to go
back for a second to something that

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.830
Lyndsey said and I would also like to go
back to the idea that you brought up

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:47.110
during the discussion of how the
authoritarians and campus elites twist

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.220
their campaigns and how they're trying
to get to something well this something

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.390
I think is part of something that Thomas
Sol noticed a long time ago when he

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:01.600
wrote about elites elites these days
don't dispute us on ideas this is not

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.660
about proving a point or making making a
recent statement a lot of where they go

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.440
to and this is something that so we'll
noticed is to make us feel morally wrong

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.490
and Lindsey mentioned at some point that
one of the reasons why she didn't speak

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:20.440
in class and that is also myself I often
don't speak up why don't I speak up

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.870
because I know that whether or not I
will be judged to be stupid or

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:31.060
incoherent I will be judged to be evil I
will be judged to be morally on the

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:37.270
wrong side I'm often spoken as the wrong
side of history so I'd like you if you

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:42.910
can to speak about that and I would like
David to go back to this idea of how is

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.660
it that authoritarians are twisting that
speech and how is it that they're really

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:53.070
confirming what saul has written about
them already a long time ago

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.200
yeah the the classes I've been in they
kind of established themselves as like

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:09.760
the moral police right and it even makes
me question myself like one of the first

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.320
examples that comes to mind was a race
and media course I took in my undergrad

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:20.140
and the prof who was actually not a prop
he was just like a sessional but he said

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.330
he asked the class in a rhetorical way
he was like a social justice warrior

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.440
right
he's like why isn't Ramadan a national

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.920
holiday in Canada Christmas is so why
don't we have Ramadan and like my first

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.760
instinct was like what are you talking
but like you can't say that and so it

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.690
makes you actually think wow like why
did I have that reaction like am i a bad

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:53.560
person Rahman should be a national
holiday if I'm just gonna one thing you

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.040
made me think of something I hadn't
thought of before so I do research in

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.930
sociology of religion and you made me
think about and I don't know where this

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:07.690
will go yet but thank you so in
established religious traditions you are

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:13.420
made to feel guilty about sin but you
also have a way to propitiate that sin

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:19.240
if Christianity you asked forgiveness if
Judaism there are means these religious

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.560
isms say here feel guilty but then
here's how to propitiate that guilt but

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.390
with social justice philosophy and I'm
using that in in scare quotes they

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.810
definitely know how to make you feel
guilty

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:35.680
but they really the way to propitiate
guilt is to make other people feel

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.090
guilty which is really interesting
because I see it as a religious movement

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:44.550
right and so so that's very interesting
to me I'm gonna think more about that

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:48.280
now back to the question about how did
they twist the words I saw three

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.860
movements which was really incredible
the first movement was that when they

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:58.120
were saying why we should stop talking
about free expression on campus the

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:03.700
first movement was because it causes
harm right that that was their go-to

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:09.910
this is causing harm so
you know I look at this and I say okay

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.080
well what is the definition of harm
because you realize they are trying to

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:21.520
redefine terms so the definition of harm
is and this is sort of a legal

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.520
definition it's an infliction of long
term damage that compromises normal

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.110
appearance or function so you get this
idea long term damage

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.290
compromising something so is that
happening because what they're saying is

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:40.540
harm was offence so they're trying to
say that I'm mentally harmed but I'm

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:46.380
saying well well no no because and then
I started looking at at the

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.650
psychological data on this and there's a
really good study by Scott Lilla Feld

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.850
and it was the origins of
microaggressions is what he but he

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.450
looked at all of the literature it was a
meta-analysis and he says there's you

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:04.750
just cannot substantiate the claim that
ideas offensive ideas harm you it's just

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:09.370
not there in fact if you look at
cognitive behavioral therapy they'll

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.930
tell you that the best way to overcome
this idea of feeling harmed by ideas is

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:18.340
be exposed to those offensive ideas so
what they were saying about ideas

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.230
harming was completely wrong so then
when when other people other academics

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.950
newspapers started saying that they
moved to the next strategy and the next

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:31.030
strategy was well all this discussion of
Lindsey Shepard and free expression is

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:37.210
causing physical violence and so they
were saying there have been threats on

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:45.250
lives and I'll just cut to the chase
so Globe and Mail Global TV said okay

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.480
we're gonna go check with campus police
and we're going to check with the

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.650
Waterloo Regional Police to see if
anyone has lodged these threats against

00:43:53.650 --> 00:44:00.010
their lives there wasn't a single
complaint so unless they were just

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.700
braving them themselves I'm being
threatened my physical with this

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.390
physical violent death threats is one of
the things they said they were but they

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:13.330
weren't going to the police with them so
when that was exposed they moved to the

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:20.680
next I think this was the most clever /
diabolical they said you know what we

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.369
just need to contextualise
yes we can have debate on campus but we

00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:28.630
have to contextualise well what does it
mean to contextualize it means that we

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:34.710
must filter it through a critical theory
lens so we'll let you have both sides

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:41.020
but we'll make clear which of these
sides is bullshit and and this is what

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:44.770
we'll do for you students will filter it
for you so we'll definitely have two

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.250
sides and there were op eds from
colleagues of mine who were essentially

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.369
saying we'll just filter it through the
critical lens so this idea of

00:44:51.369 --> 00:44:56.079
contextualization was their third group
and of course one of the mousse that

00:44:56.079 --> 00:45:00.299
fits into all of these is this idea of
well hate speech isn't free speech and

00:45:00.299 --> 00:45:06.640
you continue to hear that and again it's
a redefinition of what hate speeches and

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.690
so hate speech under section 319 and
we've got lawyers here who can

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.849
articulate this better than I but really
it is a high high bar and offending

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:20.260
someone when it when you either have
truth or it's fair comment or it's done

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.990
civilly I mean that's not hate speech
it's just not but they were trying to

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.059
equate the two and of course if they can
redefine hate speech which they continue

00:45:27.059 --> 00:45:32.140
they are always trying to do that then
then they will be able to censor on our

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.829
campuses and really in society more
generally so those are the moves I saw

00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:40.000
thanks for the question but with your
second point about police complaints I

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.380
mean the police are a tool of oppression
to them so I mean that's why they

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.089
wouldn't go to the you know just arguing
their side oh they don't have to this is

00:45:49.089 --> 00:45:53.890
a quote from one of the activists they
don't have to perform their trauma for

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:59.170
us you know they don't they don't have
to it can just be within they don't have

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.710
to tell anybody but it still exists
because they don't have to perform their

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:09.520
trauma right okay just an observation or
two thank you for your remarks and for

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.529
your experiences and your sticking our
necks out as we all should do I think

00:46:14.529 --> 00:46:20.440
you know what what percolates for the
top in my mind is that we're at a very

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.670
difficult struggle because the
meta-narrative to borrow someone else's

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:31.660
phrase the benchmark for judgment of
justice is safety and comfort on our

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.690
campus
and trying to appeal to a construct of

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:41.770
disputatious free expression and
sculpting some sense of a better

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:47.230
collective truth after discussion and
argumentation almost doesn't exist

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:54.490
the automatic heuristic the the
instantaneous benchmark is comfort so

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:57.280
that's that's one thought that I
scribbled and the other thought is

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.760
something that's missing from this
discussion I spent 40 years as a

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:06.480
researcher in human sexuality and
prejudice and almost as long you know

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.100
and in civil liberties pursuits but what
is missing a little bit from the

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.440
discussion of sympathy if if an
indigenous person says you know I've had

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.370
a struggle I've had a historical
struggle you know you have a perfect

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:26.290
right to you know to raise these issues
but it does affect me you know just that

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:31.360
that's a little something if a trans
person says I've had a struggle and

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.070
you're surfacing this issue you know
brings it home to me and it doesn't mean

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.970
you know that you can't talk about so
for example when my multitude of

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.830
colleagues tell me that Jordan Peterson
is trans phobic I said no Jordan

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:50.710
Peterson is concerned about compelled
speech and you know at the same time I

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.850
express sympathy for people who are
struggling with you know with with with

00:47:54.850 --> 00:48:00.160
their struggle so I don't want to forget
the sympathy piece but what we're

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.530
confronting fundamentally is a benchmark
for acceptable speech that involves

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:12.040
comfort and any construct any mental
reach any purchase on the idea of the

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:17.500
desirability of free expression
disputation and the quaint medieval idea

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.160
of a university where people work
together to figure out you know is this

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.550
an elephant or is this a donkey we're
all blind that that almost doesn't exist

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:31.990
by the way that you know I would divorce
the distinction of attacks on on the

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:37.660
right wing it's really it's really an
instrument of sensoria sness against any

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:42.940
controversy it's easier than burning
books and less conspicuous but if it

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.809
costs me six thousand dollars to take
this book out of the live

00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:53.349
or to listen or to talk that's that's a
pox on any controversial idea just to

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:57.250
respond to this I would commend people
to take a look at a recent study

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:02.349
published on heterodox Academy where
they did look at who does the disrupting

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:10.180
and so 90.5% of disruptions 90.5% of
disruptions on University campuses in

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:14.829
the United States happen from
left-leaning protesters protesting

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:17.740
right-leaning
speakers my questions about the

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:23.440
complaint that was not nor the complaint
and the question is this I've read

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.059
somewhere online or a comment me where
it was so the the even the unofficial

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:32.410
complaint because there must have been
some filtered message that reached the

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:37.690
powers-that-be did not come from
students in in your seminar but from

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.940
somebody who had overheard two students
speaking about the seminar in a

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.770
cafeteria is it's not just a canal or
perhaps you don't know if it is that

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:52.780
it's that it's a because the students
that we're talking about your seminar

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:57.460
may have been praising the seminar and
then over her I mean it's a pure

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:05.859
speculation on my part I just wonder
what what you can tell us about that so

00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:12.190
all we know from a MacLaine's article is
that the rainbow Center did facilitate a

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:16.540
complaint so it did not come from a
student in my class it came from the

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.250
rainbow Center they were not asked to do
it they took it upon themselves so yes

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.190
how they got that information it could
be this situation

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:29.710
two students were talking favorably and
these rainbow Center people took it upon

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:34.839
themselves to you know tell the
professor of my class or maybe one

00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:39.250
student was just talking in the rainbow
Center maybe one of them uses the

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:43.630
resources there and was saying like yeah
this like kind of sucked maybe like

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:48.369
maybe they did have a problem but didn't
want to make a complaint out of it and I

00:50:48.369 --> 00:50:53.680
think I'll never know actually but it's
entirely possible that because you you

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.359
said earlier you were afraid of carrying
with you to your grave the guilt of

00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:01.240
having her
somebody it's entirely possible that you

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:07.000
didn't personally did not hurt anybody
this is trial by hearsay and and and

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.329
eavesdropping and they don't feel like
they owe me anything okay so my question

00:51:13.329 --> 00:51:18.640
is for you Lindsey and it's in regard to
what you see moving forward so you know

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.960
as having done your masters at Laurier
and progressing for that and being a TA

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.220
no I could take the assumption that you
would ultimately down the line would

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:32.020
have wanted to go to become a professor
but now with this whole ordeal I want to

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:37.059
know if you see yourself staying within
academia for a future profession if

00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:40.569
that's something that still interests
you and if not do you have any insight

00:51:40.569 --> 00:51:45.910
where you would want to go with like a
communication background it's pretty up

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:52.750
in the air for me but I've had this
discussion with Steven parrot so I think

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:57.609
I could probably find a professor to
supervise a PhD sure that's not the

00:51:57.609 --> 00:52:01.539
problem
but what I ever get hired I don't think

00:52:01.539 --> 00:52:05.020
so
so maybe best not to try who knows we'll

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:13.529
see if things change I want to come back
to the three professors the three people

00:52:13.529 --> 00:52:20.529
Rambow Connor Pimlott and the ones who
interviewed you and my might my question

00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:26.140
is this it would seem to me almost
certainly that you weren't the first

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:32.529
person to whom this kind of thing had
happened have other people come forward

00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:36.579
and spoken to you and said look don't
tell anybody but this kind of thing

00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:43.690
happened to me what can you tell us
about this manner of of affecting their

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:49.539
ideological control yes I get tons of
messages from people with similar things

00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:53.920
I think what was so I think mine is
still maybe the most extreme though just

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.420
because I was neutral a lot of the
messages I get is from people who say

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:03.069
they took a conservative standpoint they
took a right-leaning standpoint which

00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:07.690
they should still absolutely be allowed
to do but the thing with me is I didn't

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:14.829
take any stand so that's what makes it
probably still the most extreme case but

00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:19.509
yes I get messages you know at least
once a week and also from professors to

00:53:19.509 --> 00:53:28.420
not just students professors who are not
behind the scenes who are very very very

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:33.160
unhappy about the way things are going
on yes and these people should come

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.749
forward and they feel they can't but if
you come forward your marques in

00:53:37.749 --> 00:53:41.079
jeopardy
your degree is in jeopardy and and this

00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:47.859
and I have I've received many emails
from students I've had students in my

00:53:47.859 --> 00:53:53.859
office I had one fellow who came to my
office he was a mature student he'd come

00:53:53.859 --> 00:53:58.569
back to university he had a wife he had
a daughter he was he was paying for his

00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:03.009
own education and he was finishing his
fourth year of university and he came to

00:54:03.009 --> 00:54:07.839
my office in tears and he said for four
years I've been told that I'm the

00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:13.359
scourge of the earth because I'm a white
male he said he said I've been doing a

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:19.029
degree I won't say that but but he had
just and he could not say anything in

00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:25.119
his own defense because he had come from
a single mother he'd worked his way up

00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:30.849
he'd gotten married he'd he'd thought
that he had he'd performed nobly

00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:36.430
throughout his life but he was told so
many things about why he was a terrible

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:43.269
person and sadly this is routine on our
campuses now and identity politics does

00:54:43.269 --> 00:54:47.890
this because it takes away the idea of
the individual and it makes us tribal

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:51.519
and if you're part of the wrong tribe
well then unfortunately you're going to

00:54:51.519 --> 00:54:55.509
have to suffer the consequences will
give Francis the last question and then

00:54:55.509 --> 00:55:04.150
it's time for for lunch quick thank you
very much I just wanted to say first of

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:12.009
all Lindsey things have changed your
what happened to you has changed what

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:16.660
has happened on campuses and I just gave
a speech about Lindsay's case on Monday

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:21.279
to about 40 professors who were in
complete agreement with the terrible

00:55:21.279 --> 00:55:27.270
situation that exists
but at the same time we have to be very

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:32.190
careful here that we can move things
forward as a freedom of expression

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:39.390
coalition university-wide canada-wide
and there's a real danger if you see it

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:46.320
as a right wing left wing dichotomy I
have talked to people from wilfred

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:51.390
laurier who said they wanted to speak up
in favor of lindsay but they didn't

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:56.820
because they feared being labeled a
right winger that's the problem so if

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.860
you're going to say we want to crush the
left and the social justice warriors and

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:06.660
all this kind of terminology you're not
gonna get that middle that large middle

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:11.310
that really wants to support freedom of
expression but they're afraid to do so

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:15.870
because they're gonna be seen as someone
who's on the right I'm a socialist I'm

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:20.490
not a right winger cliff Christie
Blachford Speas in the National Post

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:26.850
made it sound as if I were a right-wing
speaker this is a huge problem so if

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:31.560
you're gonna start talking and and the
second thing is these people are not on

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:36.870
the left the people who are claiming to
be on the Left who are authoritarians

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:42.450
took politically correct totalitarians
they are not left wingers they are using

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:48.330
this idea of the left to get other
people to sympathize with them and to go

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:53.220
with them but they are actually
reactionaries they want privilege they

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:59.160
are privileged seeking groups that care
nothing about equality they are trying

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:03.330
to increase their own power in the
university and that really has to be

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:09.000
made clear because if we keep on saying
oh these leftists and these far leftists

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.830
you're never gonna get anyone who sees
themselves as being a left-wing person

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:20.360
to be a supporter of freedom of
expression just to comment with that

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:24.990
well I I think that what you're saying
has a lot of Merit Frances I think that

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:29.520
also the reality on the ground is
anybody who does speak up for free

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:33.480
expression regardless of their political
stand they're gonna be called right-wing

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:39.900
now right I mean I mean it's a problem
but it is not a it's not the people who

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:56.430
are on the right who are doing it you
may be right I'm just saying that if

00:57:56.430 --> 00:58:00.300
it's a matter of labeled if it's a
matter of labels it's not the people

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:05.810
Thank You Lindsay thank you David we'll
