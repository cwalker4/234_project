00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.570
I wanted to share this
little story with you.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.605 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got into a little
bit of trouble

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.974
with the French Government.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.410
(audience laughing)

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.712
I know. The French Government.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.050 align:start size:97% position:3%
So what happened was, let's
start at the beginning.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.719
France won the World Cup.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.955 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:26.926
And so on the show,
we celebrated that
and I had this joke

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:29.662 align:start size:94% position:6%
where I said, I said
Africa won the World Cup.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.972
Yeah, and I was shocked at
how angry a lot of French

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.545
people got, like genuine,
a lot of French people

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start size:97% position:3%
were angry and they were like,
"Oh Trevor how can you say

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.949
this, why would you
say these things?

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.384
(audience laughing)

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.786 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know this is horrible."
and I was like okay,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
I get it, not everyone
likes every joke

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.123 align:start size:97% position:3%
that you tell and I get that
but this was interesting.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.259
I got a letter from the
ambassador of France.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.629
And I'll read it to you,
it was about that joke.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.499
And he says, I'll try to read
it how I hope he wrote it.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.001
(audience laughing)

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.570 align:start size:97% position:3%
Which was he says, "Sir I
watched with great attention

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.239
your July 17th show when
you spoke of the victory

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.076
of the French team at the
2018 FIFA World Cup Russia

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:19.245
final which took
place last Sunday.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
I heard your words about
an African victory,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.484
nothing could be less true."

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.186
(audience laughing)

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.821
Now, first of all, I think
it could have been less,

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.156 align:start size:84% position:16%
I could have says they
were Scandinavian.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.658
(audience laughing)

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.725
That would have been less true,

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.928
that would have been less true.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.197
He says, "As many of the
players have already stated

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.432
themselves, their parents
may have come from another

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.935
country but a great
majority of them -- 

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.237
all but two out of 23
were born in France.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.906
They were educated in
France, they learned

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.742
to play soccer in France,
they are French citizens.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.679 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're proud of
their country, France.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.848 align:start size:97% position:3%
The rich and various
backgrounds of these players

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.584
is a reflection of
France's diversity.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:01.254
France is indeed..." Now that
line there was interesting.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.123 align:start size:97% position:3%
The rich and various
backgrounds of these players

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.358
is a reflection of
France's diversity.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.360
Now, I'm not trying to
be an asshole but I think

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.196
it's more a reflection
of France's colonialism.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:14.434 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.238
Because it's not like it's
just like random players,

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.807
like they all have
something in common.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.742
Like all of those players
if you trace their lineage

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're like how did
you guys become French?

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.447 align:start position:0%
Like, how did your family start
speaking French? Oh, okay.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.450
(audience laughing)

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.785 align:start position:0%
And it says here, he says,
"France is indeed a cosmopolitan

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:36.055
country but every citizen is
part of the French identity

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.591
and together they belong
to the nation of France.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.927
Unlike in the United
States of America,

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:45.431
France does not refer to its
citizens based on their race,

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.869 align:start position:0%
religion or origin. To us,
there is no hyphenated identity.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.841
Roots are an individual reality,

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.810
by calling them an African team
it seems like you're denying

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.015
their Frenchness. This,
even in jest, legitimizes

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.816
the ideology which
claims whiteness

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.852 align:start size:84% position:16%
as the only definition
of being French."

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
So now here's the thing,
first things first.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.593
I understand what he's
saying 'cause I read

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.828
up on this afterwards,
right? I take criticism.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.697
I'll listen to what
somebody says to me.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.666
I genuinely believe you
should, and what it turns

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:24.671
out is in France, a lot
of Nazis in that country

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.577 align:start size:97% position:3%
use the fact that these
players are of African descent

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.478 align:start size:84% position:16%
to shit on their
Frenchness, you know.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.981 align:start size:94% position:6%
So they go you're not
French, you're from Africa

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:37.083
go back to where you came
from, you're not French.

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.320
They use that as
a line of attack.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.457
Now my thing, my opinion is
coming from South Africa,

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:47.227 align:start size:97% position:3%
coming from Africa and
even watching the World Cup

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.761
in the United States of America,

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.165
black people all over the
world were celebrating

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.668
the Africaness of the
French players, right.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:58.104
Not in a negative way but
rather in a positive way

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:00.907 align:start size:97% position:3%
going look at these Africans
who can become French.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.744 align:start position:0%
You know what I mean, it's a
celebration of that achievement.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.314
And so, this is what I find
weird in these arguments

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that people go they're
not African, they're French.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.454
Then I'm like why
can't they be both?

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:18.124
(audience applauding)

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:23.129 align:start size:94% position:6%
Right, why is that duality
only afforded to select

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.734 align:start size:88% position:13%
group of people, why
can they not be African?

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.370
So what they're arguing here is,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.106 align:start size:84% position:16%
in order to be French
you have to erase

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.509
everything that is African,
'cause what do they mean

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
when they say that
our culture, our this.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:42.515
So you cannot be French and
African at the same time,

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.150 align:start size:81% position:19%
which I vehemently
disagree with.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.852
I go if you see those
players I love them,

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.254
Paul Pogba, N'Golo Kante,
I've watched all of them.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, I love those players
and I love how African

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.992
they are and how
French they are.

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't take their
Frenchness away but I also

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.096 align:start size:97% position:3%
don't think you need to
take their Africaness away.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.065
And that is what I
love about America.

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.566
America is not a perfect
country but what I love

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.902
about this place is that
people can still celebrate

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.905
their identity in
their Americaness.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.941 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can go to a St. Patrick's
Day parade in America

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.376
celebrating that you are Irish.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can go to a Puerto
Rican day parade in America

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.981
still celebrating the fact
that you are Puerto Rican

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.916
and American at the same time.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.385 align:start size:94% position:6%
You can celebrate
Juneteenth as black person

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.287
and be like "yo, I'm
African-American,"

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.624
which is the duality
of the two worlds.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.560
But here they're going,
"No you are only French."

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.195
(audience laughing)

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.531 align:start size:88% position:13%
And here's why it
vexes me, to be honest.

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.733
This is what I find interesting,

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.436
is like, when I read
stories from Africa

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.338
and I watch what
politicians say,

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.741
especially in France
about African migrants:

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.746 align:start size:94% position:6%
when they are unemployed,
when they may commit

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.116
a crime, or when
they are considered

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.819
unsavory, it's the
African immigrant.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.724
When their children go on to
provide a World Cup victory

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.027
for France, we should only
refer to them as France.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:06.232 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we even saw it with
that African man who climbed

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.468
the building to rescue the
baby, do you remember that?

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.669
- [Audience] Yes.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We watched him
climb that building,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.073
he rescued the child and
then they gave him French

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:18.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
citizenship, they said
you are now French.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:20.546
So now I'm going so is
he now no longer African?

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.682
(audience laughing)

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.083 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is that what you're
saying? So when

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.885 align:start size:84% position:16%
he was on the ground
he was African.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.721
(audience laughing)

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.523
And then he climbed up
and as soon as he rescued

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.992
the baby now he's French.
So if he dropped the baby,

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.427
The African dropped the baby.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.664 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.440
I don't believe that you need

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.008
and here's like I would
say again with respect

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:51.177
I understand what the
ambassador is saying.

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.612 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm not joining the attack
and I know don't get me wrong,

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:55.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
I know we live in a
world where like nuance

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.518
is something that
is in short supply.

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:01.587
And so you will find in
America for instance,

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
the alt-right saying, "That's
what we've been saying,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
they're not French and
we're saying but if Trevor

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.095
says it it's not racist, but
if we say it it's racist."

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.463
Yeah, yeah. I'll
say yeah, you know

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.799
why? Because I believe
context is everything.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.834
There are certain things
you can say to somebody

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.335
that like when I
say to my friends,

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.337
What's going on, my nigga?"
and if a white person came

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.406 align:start size:97% position:3%
and said the same thing, yeah
there's a big difference.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.874
(audience laughing)

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.509
When I'm saying they're
African I'm not saying

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.478 align:start size:94% position:6%
it as a way to exclude
them from their Frenchness

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.880 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I'm rather using it to
include them in my Africaness.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.451 align:start position:0%
I'm saying, "I see you my French
brother of African descent."

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.587 align:start size:97% position:3%
Do you know what I'm saying,
that's what I'm trying

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:37.523 align:start size:94% position:6%
to say, when somebody else
says it the other way.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:38.591
You can use the same
line in different ways.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.194
People are like,
so it's different?

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
Yeah, yeah it's different,
it can be different.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's like somebody saying, "So
if you play with your naked

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:47.033
child it's a problem but if
I do it I'm a pedophile?"

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.435
Yeah, yeah there's
a big difference.

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.671
There's a huge difference.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:55.441
(audience clapping)

So I will continue to praise
them for being African

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:02.348 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I believe that
they are of Africa.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:05.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
Their parents are from
Africa and they can be French

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.854
at the same time. And if French
people are saying they cannot

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:11.624
be both, then I think they
have a problem and not me.

and applauding)
