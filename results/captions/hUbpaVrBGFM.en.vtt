00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.598
- Hello, I'm Davin Reckow with Hagerty.

00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:05.502
I'm the automotive content specialist.

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:06.961
- My name is Ben Woodworth.

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.554
I'm one of the video production guys here

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:10.973
at Hagerty and the one behind the camera

00:00:10.973 --> 00:00:12.676
in all these Redline
Rebuilds that you guys

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:14.208
have been liking.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:15.539
- [Davin] Today we're
going to talk about our

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.403
Ford flathead video that
we did a few months ago

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:22.153
and show you some of the finer pieces and

00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:23.899
some of the not-so-fine pieces.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.572
Anything we missed that you've still got

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:27.103
questions about, shoot
them to us and we'll

00:00:27.103 --> 00:00:28.884
do our best to answer them.

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:30.160
Let's get on with it, though.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.086
All right, so this is
our 1946 Swap to Street

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:34.461
Challenge truck.

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.850
The four of us put this truck together.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.229
We drove it roughly 740
miles, I think it was,

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.250
back to the Traverse City office here

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.011
from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.439
Matt and I did some real
quick, we had one-week

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:50.557
turnaround, basically,
to get the car, the truck

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:53.765
prepped to drive to SEMA
in Las Vegas which was

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.682
roughly 2500 miles, I think it was.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:01.259
And we made it there,
famously, with no issues,

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.606
although it was starting to
be a little under-powered

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.944
and we were starting to
feel some of the aches

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:09.586
and pains of a truck built in four days.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:13.449
And got it back and
then when the time came,

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:16.137
we decided we should pull the motor and go

00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.825
through it, so that's
what we're doing here,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:20.012
is actually pulling the motor back out.

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.332
We use an engine-leveler.

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.309
That's key in this situation, especially

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:25.098
when you're pulling the transmission.

00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:27.531
You can see the mad angle that you're

00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.622
lifting it out at.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.134
With those pullers, you can get it

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:33.639
almost vertical coming up out of there

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:35.028
if you absolutely have to.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.203
- [Ben] So that's the
yellow piece with the

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:37.132
chains attached.

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:38.747
- [Davin] That's correct, yep.

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:41.183
- [Ben] So it allows
you to tilt the engine

00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:42.484
back and forth?

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.225
- [Davin] Yes, yep.

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:45.566
- [Ben] So you can pull it out without

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.703
banging it into things.

00:01:46.703 --> 00:01:47.946
- [Davin] Yeah, exactly.

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.537
And it leaves the heavy lifting

00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:51.493
to the equipment as opposed to the

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.253
folks trying to do it.
- Oh yeah, I see it now.

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:54.606
- [Davin] And now see, we leveled it out.

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.180
- [Ben] So the transmission
is still attached.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.013
- [Davin] Yep.

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:59.036
- [Ben] But 8BA is on the heads.

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.486
- [Davin] Correct, so
that signifies that its

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:04.069
a later model, so a '49 to '53.

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:08.895
Again, so does the
distributor, so the heads,

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.620
if you will, match the rest of the engine.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.754
- [Ben] Oh, now we're
dropping in to the thick

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:13.644
of things here.

00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:14.595
- [Davin] Yes.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:16.777
- [Ben] This is our engine.

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:19.074
- [Davin] So right here,
you'll see the water

00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:21.002
pump pulleys and then the two outlets for

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.537
the water pumps.

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:24.632
Something else that's
unique with a Ford flathead

00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:27.510
is there's two water pumps.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.066
Most vehicles, most engines, only have one

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.040
water pump that feed
both sides of the block.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.846
The Ford flathead does
not have a crossover tube

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:42.177
going between right and
left-hand sides of the engine

00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:45.142
so the, it needs two
independent water pumps.

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:47.080
- [Ben] For an old crusty
engine, it's pretty

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.123
cool-looking.

00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:49.114
- [Davin] Yes.

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:50.770
- [Ben] Eww, what's going
on with the exhaust?

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.676
- [Davin] Well, you can see
that we're having a little

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:54.325
bit of coolant leak
out of the head on that

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.492
far left side.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:58.652
- [Ben] It looks like we have--

00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:01.507
- [Davin] And we have a
couple stacks of extra,

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:03.266
this is the issue with
when you're building

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.891
a motor on, in a four-days
deal where you have

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.516
limited resources.

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:09.814
You can see the exhaust
bolt on the right-hand

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:13.814
side there is a little
bit long, but with enough

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.865
half-inch hex nuts, it
shims it up just fine.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.999
So, coil off, here's the distributor,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.877
brand-new looking fresh
contacts on that rotor.

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:27.729
So here we're taking
the intake manifold off.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.479
Stock intake manifold,
two-barrel carburetor,

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.548
original three-bolt Ford.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:39.730
- [Ben] So there are a
crapload of bolts to take off.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.033
- [Davin] This has a lot, I
think it's 24 or 26 per head.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.111
I forget the exact number.

00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.847
- [Ben] Does that, is that good?

00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:47.746
Is that bad?

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:50.168
Like, what was up with their design that--

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:52.229
- [Davin] Well, I find
it interesting for the

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.007
lack of compression that
it needs so many bolts

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:56.831
to hold it down, but I'm
not, at the same time,

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.636
that's a huge piece of
cast iron to hold flat

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:01.471
and I think that's what
the bolts are doing more

00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:02.926
than anything, is just
trying to hold a warped

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:04.324
piece of cast iron flat.

00:04:04.324 --> 00:04:05.574
- [Ben] Uh-huh.

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:07.947
- [Davin] So, yeah.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:11.896
- [Ben] So immediately,
right away, again, I know

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:14.019
enough about engines to
get me in trouble, but

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.777
this doesn't look like most engines that--

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:16.610
- [Davin] Nope.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.585
- [Ben] I've seen.

00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:21.568
- [Davin] This is, the function
of a flathead by naming

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:25.707
convention is the head does
not have any valves in it.

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:27.365
It's flat.

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:29.877
All the valves are right
in the engine block.

00:04:29.877 --> 00:04:32.422
So that means the seats
are in the engine block.

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:35.082
The valve springs,
everything is in the block

00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:36.499
not in the heads.

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:40.436
When the intake charge
comes in, it has to make

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:44.685
a 90-degree angle into
the, into the cylinder bore

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.268
which can get ugly.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.715
- [Ben] So just, essentially, that means

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:50.835
it is not efficient.

00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:52.585
- [Davin] It is not
efficient at all, nope.

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:56.824
It is, for all practical,
it is an eight-cylinder

00:04:56.824 --> 00:05:00.452
lawn mower engine by today's standards.

00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:01.285
- [Ben] All right.

00:05:01.285 --> 00:05:03.499
So moving on, getting the other head off.

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:04.833
I mean, how is this thing
looking at this point?

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:06.942
You guys have driven it around a bunch.

00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:09.331
We didn't really know
what was inside it when

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.197
we bought it, so it, was this all sort of

00:05:11.197 --> 00:05:12.973
like a surprise to you?

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:14.880
- [Davin] No, this is
pretty well what I expected

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.875
on the top side.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.059
The real concern I had
was what did the bearings

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.709
look like in the bottom end.

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:23.861
But, I mean, I expected it
to be as rusty and crusty,

00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.790
if you will, as far as
the ports were concerned,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.144
specifically in the
water jackets and really,

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:31.881
the cylinders didn't look too bad.

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:33.631
The rings were tired.

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:39.310
- [Ben] So here, off comes
the exhaust manifold.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.160
- [Davin] Nice shot of it
rotating, engine rotating.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.990
You can see there's a
lot of carbon buildup.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.231
Evidently we didn't get on the gas enough.

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.178
- [Ben] All right, so what's this?

00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:51.499
- [Davin] So this is the
front of the crankshaft

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:56.112
which has your pulleys for
the water pumps and the fan.

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.494
And then behind that is the balancer.

00:05:58.494 --> 00:06:00.026
- [Ben] That looks like a cool tool.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.717
- [Davin] Yep, gear puller.

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:07.525
So there we have, one
thing that's awesome about

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.633
the Ford flathead is you
never have to worry about

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:14.464
stretching the timing chain
because it doesn't have one.

00:06:14.464 --> 00:06:17.414
- [Ben] Oh, because normally
you're, what we have the

00:06:17.414 --> 00:06:19.151
crankshaft and the camshaft here.

00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:20.570
- [Davin] Yep, yeah.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.497
So the big gear is your
timing gear and then the

00:06:23.497 --> 00:06:26.954
bottom gear, the smaller
one, is your crankshaft gear.

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:30.780
And yeah, so normally, in
most engines, you would

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.530
have a timing chain or
belt in today's world.

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.323
But these did not use that.

00:06:37.323 --> 00:06:39.089
It was gear-to-gear.
- So it was direct meshed.

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.922
- [Davin] Yes.

00:06:39.922 --> 00:06:41.277
- [Ben] So basically the
main thing we have to do

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:43.713
is make sure that your
teeth are in the right spot.

00:06:43.713 --> 00:06:44.546
- [Davin] Correct.

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:45.566
- [Ben] And from there, you're good to go.

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:46.399
- [Davin] Right.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.829
Yep, but I would say one
little issue that they

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:53.936
would have is the fact
that the timing gear is

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.686
a nylon-toothed deal.

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.566
- [Ben] Oh, so even though
that's all black and grimey,

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:00.456
it's actually plastic.

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:02.086
- [Davin] It's actually plastic, yes.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:04.789
So obviously those could deteriorate and

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.516
bust off and what not.

00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:09.010
And the reason that
they're nylon or whatever

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.290
the official material is,
is it quiets things down.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.159
It's not as loud.

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.980
Otherwise it would, it would
hum like a son-of-a-gun.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.206
- [Ben] So here, what are you doing?

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.623
You've got this big pry bar.

00:07:20.623 --> 00:07:21.456
- [Davin] All right.

00:07:21.456 --> 00:07:23.332
Yeah, I found that this
was probably the ugliest

00:07:23.332 --> 00:07:26.033
part of the whole teardown,
and installation for

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:28.260
that matter, but it's
pulling these springs out.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.843
There's a, in theory,
they're one assembly.

00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:38.344
But, given all the sludge and nastiness,

00:07:39.273 --> 00:07:41.715
there's a retainer in
there and some keepers

00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:43.928
you've got to lift up
and pull out and tap out

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:48.095
and beat them and yeah,
that part was kind of ugly.

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.525
So this is our truck oil
pan that we had to search

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:52.942
high and low for.

00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:55.520
- [Ben] What would have
been the difference?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.208
The one that was on
there when you guys got

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.715
the engine, would have looked like what?

00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:03.115
- [Davin] Yeah, the
difference was, is where that

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:06.782
rear bump-out is, it's
back further to clear

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.444
the crossmember in the truck.

00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:15.057
The car crossmember is
further forward towards

00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:17.925
the front of the engine,
which is to your right.

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:22.078
So it had a larger sump, if
you will, on the car pan.

00:08:22.078 --> 00:08:23.266
- [Ben] Okay, so here's the big reveal.

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:25.734
The oil pan comes off, and we've got this.

00:08:25.734 --> 00:08:26.567
Holy--

00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:30.770
- [Davin] This, uh, you
know what this reminds me of

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.958
is a lava flow is what I think of.

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.966
You know, after everything has been burnt.

00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:40.177
- [Ben] Right. It's like
solidified volcanic rock.

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:41.010
- [Davin] Yes.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.843
- [Ben] That is gross.

00:08:41.843 --> 00:08:43.291
So what's popping up here?

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.343
- [Davin] So that is the oil pickup tube.

00:08:46.343 --> 00:08:50.812
This is certainly a
testament of change your oil

00:08:50.812 --> 00:08:54.804
more often than not, because
this ran the same oil

00:08:54.804 --> 00:08:56.137
for a long time.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.429
- [Ben] You can't even
see, like any parts of

00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:00.476
the actual metal.

00:09:00.476 --> 00:09:01.366
- [Davin] Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:03.381
I forgot that it was this dirty.

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:04.273
- [Ben] Okay, what's going on now?

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:05.391
You're pulling some parts off.

00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:06.748
I see a hammer.

00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:08.915
I see a piece of lead rod.

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:13.411
- [Davin] We're taking
the pistons out here,

00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:18.324
so we're disconnecting
the caps from the rods and

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.104
hammering the pistons
out of the bottom, out of

00:09:21.104 --> 00:09:24.540
the top surface or bottom
surface in this case.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.762
And of course we're
strategically placing the

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:31.576
long rod and tapping it
with a hammer so we're not

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.801
destroying the rod because
we're going to reuse

00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:38.012
the rods and the pistons
we had already planned

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.690
on replacing.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.438
The pistons for this are dirt cheap.

00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:43.107
I mean, they're almost
as cheap as a small block

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:47.161
Chevy so the intention
was never to reuse them.

00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.786
- [Ben] All right, so here
we're looking at the bottom.

00:09:48.786 --> 00:09:50.362
- [Davin] Yep, here's the
bottom, here's one of the--

00:09:50.362 --> 00:09:51.470
- [Ben] Piston dropping out.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.441
- [Davin] Yep, here's a piston coming out.

00:09:53.441 --> 00:09:57.127
As it rotated, we had to pull them out.

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:01.071
I'll say if the Ford flathead
has any weakness for power,

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:03.419
it is the fact that it only
has three main cams in it.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:04.909
- [Ben] So how does that affect power?

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:06.481
- [Davin] Well, it affects
power because you have,

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.644
you only have three
journals as opposed to, say,

00:10:08.644 --> 00:10:10.144
five or four.

00:10:10.144 --> 00:10:11.654
- [Ben] So you're saying
journals instead of

00:10:11.654 --> 00:10:13.212
five or four, it spins--

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.965
- [Davin] Relative to the block.

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:15.848
- [Ben] Okay.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.635
- [Davin] So what's holding
the crankshaft into the block.

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:20.162
So you have three
supports, yeah, so there's

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:24.213
three supports instead of four or five.

00:10:24.213 --> 00:10:26.497
- [Ben] So what's sitting
in here right now?

00:10:26.497 --> 00:10:28.869
- [Davin] So what you
have is what they call

00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:31.342
a half shell, or a shell bearing.

00:10:31.342 --> 00:10:35.009
So they're a multi-layer
of different alloys

00:10:36.954 --> 00:10:39.255
to basically spin on.

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:40.187
That's your bearing surface.

00:10:40.187 --> 00:10:41.028
- [Ben] Okay.

00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:43.261
So most people think of a bearing as--

00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:44.939
- [Davin] Having a needle
bearing or a ball bearing.

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:47.194
- [Ben] Right, like something
actually moving inside.

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.027
- [Davin] Correct.

00:10:48.027 --> 00:10:51.603
- [Ben] But these are, the
only thing that's between

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:54.801
these bearings and the
crankshaft itself is the oil.

00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:57.552
- [Davin] Is a real
thin layer of oil, yep.

00:10:57.552 --> 00:10:59.946
- [Ben] So, in this, I
guess another way of putting

00:10:59.946 --> 00:11:03.127
it is that the oil is
the balls or the needles

00:11:03.127 --> 00:11:04.192
in this type of bearing.

00:11:04.192 --> 00:11:06.508
- [Davin] Yes, correct.

00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:08.174
- [Ben] All right, now
it looks like you're

00:11:08.174 --> 00:11:09.874
attacking that plastic piece.

00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:14.394
- [Davin] Yeah, with, it
has some, like a retainer

00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:17.105
clip that flips over the bolt head so they

00:11:17.105 --> 00:11:18.421
don't back out.

00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:20.220
- [Ben] Looks like somebody's
keeping a screwdriver--

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.053
- [Davin] Yep.

00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:22.361
- [Ben] Just to keep it
from spinning on you.

00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:23.681
- [Davin] Yep, you've got to have some way

00:11:23.681 --> 00:11:25.957
to resist that torque.

00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:27.156
- [Ben] All right, so there it comes.

00:11:27.156 --> 00:11:29.506
- [Davin] Yep, so there's your,

00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:31.812
so your timing gear is off, that reveals

00:11:31.812 --> 00:11:32.895
the camshaft.

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:35.601
- [Ben] And here it comes.

00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.665
Now this, is this also a reusable item

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.869
or is this a replace item item, maybe the

00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:41.702
wear on the--

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.535
- [Davin] We could have, with some good

00:11:43.535 --> 00:11:45.544
close inspection on a
camshaft, you can reuse

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:46.461
a camshaft.

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:50.056
We wanted something a little better than

00:11:50.056 --> 00:11:51.399
the stock cams.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.843
- [Ben] All right, now
we're dropping into Thirlby.

00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:54.894
I love this place.

00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:55.727
- [Davin] Yes.

00:11:55.727 --> 00:11:56.695
- [Ben] These guys are awesome.

00:11:56.695 --> 00:11:57.853
- [Davin] Yes, they are.

00:11:57.853 --> 00:11:58.743
- [Ben] So what's going on here?

00:11:58.743 --> 00:12:00.442
What are these three huge green things?

00:12:00.442 --> 00:12:04.488
- [Davin] So they have, this
is their cleaning process.

00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:07.821
It's, you know, your fire and brimstone,

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:11.613
your shot peen and your wash.

00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:12.588
- [Ben] Here's the block.

00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:16.026
- [Davin] Yep, this is the
three-step cleaning process.

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:17.536
- [Ben] Oh yeah, wow, look at that.

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:18.477
Already, it looks like a

00:12:18.477 --> 00:12:19.854
brand new block.
- Already better, yes.

00:12:19.854 --> 00:12:21.023
Much better.

00:12:21.023 --> 00:12:22.051
- [Ben] And he's just
getting rid of all that

00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:22.907
bead blast stuff.

00:12:22.907 --> 00:12:26.155
- [Davin] Yeah, just a little, yeah.

00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:29.623
Little more attention
to the details there.

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:32.183
Cleaning all the thread
ports and passages out.

00:12:32.183 --> 00:12:33.732
- [Ben] Yeah, I mean, it
looks brand new at that point.

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:34.565
- [Davin] Mm-hmm.

00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:35.676
- [Ben] Okay, so over--

00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:40.215
- [Davin] So what this
is, is he is magnafluxing

00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:41.048
the box.

00:12:41.048 --> 00:12:44.209
So basically that's a
magnet and he's puffing a

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:48.232
little iron powder at it
and the way the process

00:12:48.232 --> 00:12:51.088
works is if there's a
crack, it will highlight

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:52.636
the crack.

00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:54.814
I guess it's not magnafluxing, but--

00:12:54.814 --> 00:12:58.610
- [Ben] Okay, so no cracks in the block.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.967
Good to go.

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.490
- [Davin] Correct.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.982
Even though there are,
Ford flatheads are very

00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:06.724
known to crack on the top
of that cylinder surface

00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:10.551
between the two, between
the bores, specifically

00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:12.037
where the head bolts go through.

00:13:12.037 --> 00:13:13.108
- [Ben] Uh-huh.

00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:14.910
- [Davin] It will spider-crack out.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.887
It's fairly thin in there.

00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:18.584
Mike's going through and cleaning up that

00:13:18.584 --> 00:13:20.818
bore, or the deck surface for the heads,

00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:24.121
so it's a nice, clean,
flat and perpendicular

00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:25.548
to the pistons.

00:13:25.548 --> 00:13:27.706
And typically you don't end up milling the

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:30.369
top surface where the intake manifold goes

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:32.910
unless there's something that's drastic.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.839
- [Ben] How's that, just
because there's not--

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:38.608
- [Davin] Well, you've
got a lot of sealant

00:13:38.608 --> 00:13:39.535
that's on there.

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:41.210
It's not as critical.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.504
- [Ben] What's going on here?

00:13:42.504 --> 00:13:46.002
- [Davin] So here, Mike's
going through and boring

00:13:46.002 --> 00:13:49.470
the cylinder walls out 30
thousandths on this one,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.403
on these bores here.

00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:53.275
- [Ben] Now is this pretty, is that bore

00:13:53.275 --> 00:13:54.311
pretty typical for this?

00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:56.109
Is it easy to find pistons at that--

00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:56.942
- [Davin] Yeah.

00:13:56.942 --> 00:13:57.775
- [Ben] Pistons and rings?

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:58.642
- [Davin] Yeah, for all
intents and purposes,

00:13:58.642 --> 00:14:02.809
most engines you can get
pistons in a 30, 40 and a 60.

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:05.693
There's also other variations but that's a

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:08.041
pretty standard off-the-shelf piston.

00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:09.895
- [Ben] All right, so it's all bored out.

00:14:09.895 --> 00:14:11.218
And now--

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.806
- [Davin] Now to the hone process.

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:16.506
- [Ben] We've seen this
in all the rebuild videos.

00:14:16.506 --> 00:14:19.923
- [Davin] Yep, this is very, very typical

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.577
You go through and you do a final bore, or

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:27.110
cutting process, and now
this is the final finish

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.272
where you hone out, typically,
five or 10 thousandths

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:33.523
depending on what the machinist prefers.

00:14:33.523 --> 00:14:36.697
And that gives you that
beautiful crosshatch

00:14:36.697 --> 00:14:40.864
which allows the rings to
actually, it finish files

00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:45.763
the rings to fit the bore.

00:14:45.763 --> 00:14:49.876
And then, of course that's
all lubricated with coolant

00:14:49.876 --> 00:14:52.293
so the stone doesn't load up.

00:14:53.148 --> 00:14:55.446
- [Ben] Mike looks like
he's done this a few times.

00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:56.623
- [Davin] Uh, yeah.

00:14:56.623 --> 00:14:57.541
- [Ben] All right.

00:14:57.541 --> 00:14:59.663
- [Davin] Now this is where
things are slightly different

00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:01.568
than your typical block.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:05.262
Back to the quote, unquote,
head portion of this.

00:15:05.262 --> 00:15:09.165
So instead of having a small
head over at the cylinder

00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:11.586
head area, you have the whole block.

00:15:11.586 --> 00:15:14.586
And Mark's doing the seats and such,

00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:18.829
seats and guides right here, on his bench

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:21.045
that's not really used
to having a full block

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.223
there because of the--

00:15:22.223 --> 00:15:24.055
- [Ben] So, seats and guides.

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:25.048
- [Davin] So you have--

00:15:25.048 --> 00:15:26.704
- [Ben] Can you explain that to me?

00:15:26.704 --> 00:15:30.513
- [Davin] So, a valve
has a big large diameter

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.794
that has the seat on it.

00:15:31.794 --> 00:15:35.035
That's what you, the hole
that you see right now.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.926
And then you have a
guide that's down further

00:15:36.926 --> 00:15:39.038
from the stem, a smaller
portion of the valve.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.694
- [Ben] Where the valve
is actually being held.

00:15:41.694 --> 00:15:42.527
- [Davin] Right.

00:15:42.527 --> 00:15:43.360
- [Ben] Or it's going up and down in that.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.454
- [Davin] Yep, the seat
is your sealing portion,

00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:47.981
regardless of the exhaust or intake.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:50.421
And then the guide is
what holds it in the block

00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:52.739
and keeps it located to the seat.

00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:57.358
Here he's got the rods in
the pin vise, or rod vise,

00:15:57.358 --> 00:15:58.806
so he's basically going
through and torquing the

00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:00.812
nuts onto there.

00:16:00.812 --> 00:16:02.268
You can see the torque wrench there.

00:16:02.268 --> 00:16:04.413
- [Ben] So he's tightening them on there,

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:06.947
obviously you can't put
it on the engine that way.

00:16:06.947 --> 00:16:11.076
He's, why is he putting them
on now and torquing them?

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.805
- [Davin] Well, he's
torquing them down because

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.733
he's going to go and
measure the big end and make

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:17.554
sure it's true.

00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:20.533
And then if it's not
true, there's a hone that

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:22.519
he can go through and resize them.

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:25.875
So, over time, they will,
they'll stretch around and--

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.581
- [Ben] Basically like an
oval instead of a circle.

00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:28.915
- [Davin] Exactly.

00:16:28.915 --> 00:16:31.791
- [Ben] Okay, so that
machine does essentially

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:32.827
what that honing,

00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:34.080
the big up and down machine--
- Same as the block

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.592
- [Ben] For the block does.

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.979
- [Davin] But the
function is, it's still to

00:16:38.979 --> 00:16:41.430
get a perfect size to that hole.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.943
- [Ben] Okay, so he's
sliding it in and out

00:16:42.943 --> 00:16:45.034
and that thing's spinning.

00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:46.917
And then what's he doing
up here on the left?

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.867
- [Davin] He's checking it for size.

00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:51.088
- [Ben] Okay, so that's just
a micrometer of some sort?

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:52.826
- [Davin] Correct.

00:16:52.826 --> 00:16:55.973
And he'll do the same thing
on the small end as well.

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:56.851
- [Ben] Oh, there they are.

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:57.782
- [Davin] There, they're done.

00:16:57.782 --> 00:16:59.940
- [Ben] Good to go.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.544
- [Davin] Now we're at the
paint booth, taping it off.

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:06.708
Something to note, we've
done this actually in all

00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:10.875
the engines, but when possible,
we use automotive paint.

00:17:13.259 --> 00:17:15.344
In this case, for timing,
we were not able to use

00:17:15.344 --> 00:17:17.944
the automotive paint, so
here we're going to use

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:22.478
the standard HBT engine
paint, high-temperature,

00:17:22.478 --> 00:17:24.759
quote, unquote, high-temperature paint.

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:27.109
Taping all the machined
surfaces off and only

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:31.361
to where the cast iron
exposed surfaces are.

00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:34.364
Of course prepping any
parts in a solvent tank.

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:36.333
- [Ben] So essentially they used those big

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:40.367
green tanks to clean off
all the stuff on the block,

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:41.893
so now you're just getting
the rest of the bits

00:17:41.893 --> 00:17:42.752
that are getting--

00:17:42.752 --> 00:17:43.767
- [Davin] Exactly.

00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:45.941
- [Ben] Painted and ready to go.

00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:49.441
- [Davin] This into a
sandblasting cabinet using

00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:53.191
glass beads, actually,
pulls off all the rust

00:17:55.272 --> 00:17:59.600
and whatever's left, to
get a nice, clean surface.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.687
- [Ben] Yeah, it looks brand new almost.

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:03.847
Oh, the rattle can.

00:18:03.847 --> 00:18:07.127
- [Davin] Here we've got
the traditional rattle can.

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:10.474
And to clarify, regardless
of what it looks like

00:18:10.474 --> 00:18:14.245
when we go to spray color
on there, that is Ford red,

00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:15.662
not Chevy orange.

00:18:17.038 --> 00:18:18.765
Just to verify.

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.378
I know we had a lot of
people that were concerned

00:18:20.378 --> 00:18:22.769
that we put hugger orange on a Ford motor

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:25.719
and that would be absolute blasphemy

00:18:25.719 --> 00:18:28.540
even for a Chevy guy
to do on a Ford engine.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.373
- [Ben] All right.

00:18:29.373 --> 00:18:31.109
- [Davin] We have this,
our little makeshift booth,

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:33.766
and it does a pretty decent job.

00:18:33.766 --> 00:18:36.013
- [Ben] All right, paint is done.

00:18:36.013 --> 00:18:37.038
Oooh.

00:18:37.038 --> 00:18:37.969
- [Davin] All right, here we go.

00:18:37.969 --> 00:18:39.303
- [Ben] Moody.

00:18:39.303 --> 00:18:41.240
- [Davin] Just pulling
all the masking tape off

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.702
so we can get to our machine
surfaces and start assembling.

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:49.869
Now here we're putting in
the three main bearings.

00:18:51.825 --> 00:18:54.371
So, the idea is, just
before you install the

00:18:54.371 --> 00:18:57.942
crankshaft, you should always
check the bearing clearance,

00:18:57.942 --> 00:18:59.171
the actual clearance.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.161
So you put the bearings in.

00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:06.328
You torque down the main
caps and you check that ID

00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:11.438
or the diameter, and then
compare that to the OD

00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.759
of the bearing surface on the crankshaft,

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:19.279
and that gets you your bearing clearance.

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.758
You know, you're looking
for something around

00:19:20.758 --> 00:19:24.099
a thousandth to two and a
half, somewhere in that range.

00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:26.564
Likewise for the rods.

00:19:26.564 --> 00:19:28.580
And then we get into the
assembly side of it here.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.933
So just to qualify that we did all of our

00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:34.054
checks before we started assembling.

00:19:34.054 --> 00:19:36.291
- [Ben] Now it looks like
you're spreading something?

00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.745
- [Davin] Yep, so that's
putting in the rear main seal

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:42.280
right there, putting a little goop on it.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.397
- [Ben] And there's all sorts of goop.

00:19:45.397 --> 00:19:47.807
You've got some goop on
the crankshaft there,

00:19:47.807 --> 00:19:49.670
is that stuff specifically for--

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.061
- [Davin] Yep, it's assembly
lube for that initially.

00:19:52.061 --> 00:19:55.601
You certainly would not want to have it

00:19:55.601 --> 00:19:56.759
start up dry.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:00.391
You would take the bearings
out of it immediately.

00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:03.153
So you use assembly lube and

00:20:03.153 --> 00:20:06.012
you can use oil but the
assembly lube stays in

00:20:06.012 --> 00:20:09.382
place a lot better, it
doesn't run so much.

00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:12.156
Especially in that
initial startup, because

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:14.963
you have a little extra
friction in there from normal.

00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:16.543
All right, so here we're
taking all the pistons,

00:20:16.543 --> 00:20:20.622
these pistons use a floating
wrist pin, so instead

00:20:20.622 --> 00:20:22.143
of being pressed on--

00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:24.212
- [Ben] Hold on, what's
a floating wrist pin?

00:20:24.212 --> 00:20:26.769
- [Davin] All right, so
you have, you have two ways

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:30.100
to attach the rods to the pistons.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.793
Always with a wrist pin,
but sometimes that wrist pin

00:20:32.793 --> 00:20:35.615
is floating versus pressed.

00:20:35.615 --> 00:20:37.903
Floating meaning it
floats relative to the rod

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.764
and the piston.

00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:42.847
Pressed onto the rod versus floating.

00:20:44.815 --> 00:20:47.153
So you'll see we have
some retainer rings here

00:20:47.153 --> 00:20:48.582
as we go.

00:20:48.582 --> 00:20:50.988
- [Ben] So you'll, with
the pressed, you'd have to

00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:53.931
have a tool like a
pneumatic press to literally

00:20:53.931 --> 00:20:54.839
press it in?

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:56.738
- [Davin] Actually, you
heat up the small end of

00:20:56.738 --> 00:20:59.129
the rod and press them on.

00:20:59.129 --> 00:21:03.030
- [Ben] The heat would
expand the rod and allow,

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.912
or, the rod allowing the pin--

00:21:04.912 --> 00:21:06.224
- [Davin] To slide through.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.789
Yep, and then of course
it contracts and pulls it

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:08.691
into position.

00:21:08.691 --> 00:21:09.524
- [Ben] Cool.

00:21:09.524 --> 00:21:10.904
But that's not what's happening here.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:12.174
- [Davin] That is not
what's happening here.

00:21:12.174 --> 00:21:13.746
This has a bushing,
you can see it, you can

00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:17.172
see the brass piece, that's
a bushing on those rods.

00:21:17.172 --> 00:21:20.492
And they are, they're
slip fit, so it will,

00:21:20.492 --> 00:21:23.272
it's very tight but it
will slip, a slip fit.

00:21:23.272 --> 00:21:26.047
Put some oil on them, they'll slip in.

00:21:26.047 --> 00:21:29.547
Likewise into the pistons and then you can

00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:32.516
see the needle-nose pliers you use.

00:21:32.516 --> 00:21:34.954
There's a little retaining
ring that goes in there.

00:21:34.954 --> 00:21:37.139
Here we're putting cam bearings in.

00:21:37.139 --> 00:21:38.215
- [Ben] Hammering something.

00:21:38.215 --> 00:21:40.825
- [Davin] Oh yeah, hammering
in the cam bearings.

00:21:40.825 --> 00:21:44.137
- [Ben] And those bearings
are similar to the crankshaft

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.796
bearings, they're just,
they're, when you say bearings,

00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:48.907
they're just pieces of metal?

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:52.039
- [Davin] Yep, they're the
same style of bearing material

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:56.317
as your main bearings, but
instead of being two halves,

00:21:56.317 --> 00:21:57.891
they're actually a full circle.

00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:00.599
- [Ben] So, we've got some
more piston action here.

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:02.916
What's, now, what am I seeing there?

00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:04.261
- [Davin] So now all the pistons are ready

00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:08.299
to go in and Matt is holding
on to a ring compressor.

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:11.416
So the ring is naturally
has some tension out

00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.899
towards the bore, that's
basically what helps

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:18.385
them seal is they have
tension so you have to

00:22:18.385 --> 00:22:21.771
compress them slightly to
get them into the hole.

00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:23.344
So that's what this ring compressor does.

00:22:23.344 --> 00:22:27.559
It plants around that piston and then and

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:31.585
I usually use that little,
that black dead blow,

00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:34.130
and just pop it with
the handle to knock them

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.443
into the hole.

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:37.890
You've got to be really
careful, because if that

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:42.244
ring compressor is not tight
across the top of the block

00:22:42.244 --> 00:22:45.439
as it goes on to the bore,
your ring could slip through,

00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:47.656
and if it doesn't go easy,
you'll break it, you'll

00:22:47.656 --> 00:22:49.703
break the ring off when you go in.

00:22:49.703 --> 00:22:53.946
- [Ben] Do those have torque
specs there, or what's the--

00:22:53.946 --> 00:22:56.386
- [Davin] Yep, there's a
torque spec relative to

00:22:56.386 --> 00:23:00.250
the rod bolts and it's
very important to follow

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.934
that torque spec.

00:23:01.934 --> 00:23:06.645
Most failures in the piston
area is the rod bolt.

00:23:06.645 --> 00:23:09.790
It's, there's times where
it's the rods itself

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.309
but it's usually the bolt, that
fastening is very critical.

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.938
And then you'll see here, here
goes, here's the crankshaft,

00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:18.593
or the camshaft going in.

00:23:18.593 --> 00:23:21.418
You'll notice that there
is different lube on

00:23:21.418 --> 00:23:25.418
the lobes of the crankshaft
versus the bearings.

00:23:27.295 --> 00:23:30.453
Quite frankly, you can use molybdenum on

00:23:30.453 --> 00:23:34.620
the bearings, you can also
use the camshaft break-in lube

00:23:36.886 --> 00:23:39.074
on the bearings as well.

00:23:39.074 --> 00:23:43.074
I choose to put as much
on the lobes as possible

00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:48.051
because a camshaft has,
it can have premature

00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:51.800
failure really fast if you
don't break it in correctly.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.861
And since we pointed it out
at the beginning with the

00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:56.725
timing gear, you'll notice
that this timing gear

00:23:56.725 --> 00:24:00.892
is now aluminum, as opposed
to the composite setup.

00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:06.019
Some of the reason is the
composites just aren't

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:10.186
available, and the aluminum
tends to be a little better.

00:24:12.867 --> 00:24:16.324
And of course torque
spec on the cam retainer.

00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:18.693
- [Ben] So with the
aligning there, how do you,

00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:20.978
how do you know where
your crankshaft is and

00:24:20.978 --> 00:24:22.585
where your camshaft is?

00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:25.142
- [Davin] So what happens
is, so you rotate your

00:24:25.142 --> 00:24:28.725
crankshaft to have the
number one piston at

00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:31.641
top dead center, or the top of its stroke.

00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:33.942
- [Ben] So looking here, that's the--

00:24:33.942 --> 00:24:35.980
- [Davin] Far left.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.703
- [Ben] Piston closest to you on the left.

00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:38.542
- [Davin] Correct.

00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:42.207
And then the timing gear
can only go on the camshaft

00:24:42.207 --> 00:24:46.622
one way and on there, on
the face of that, there is

00:24:46.622 --> 00:24:50.400
a mark that you align with the crankshaft.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.665
- [Ben] Okay, so it's that easy.

00:24:51.665 --> 00:24:53.668
- [Davin] Yeah, it's that easy.

00:24:53.668 --> 00:24:57.393
So here the lifters are
going in, which these are

00:24:57.393 --> 00:25:01.039
adjustable lifters for
the, you can see the little

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:02.415
hex set hanging up out of the top.

00:25:02.415 --> 00:25:03.248
- [Ben] Okay, yep.

00:25:03.248 --> 00:25:06.281
- [Davin] These are, in
my opinion, a royal pain

00:25:06.281 --> 00:25:08.281
in the rumpus to adjust.

00:25:09.127 --> 00:25:10.239
- [Ben] Well, because
they're in there, and that's

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:11.493
a tight space.

00:25:11.493 --> 00:25:13.043
- [Davin] And you have
to have a little special

00:25:13.043 --> 00:25:16.740
like, spanner wrench to reach in there and

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.171
you'll see as we start putting valves in,

00:25:19.171 --> 00:25:20.714
the space gets eat up real quick.

00:25:20.714 --> 00:25:21.547
- [Ben] Oh, jeez.

00:25:21.547 --> 00:25:24.115
- [Davin] So here's the
valves into the guides.

00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:28.546
And the, so the guides in
this all can be preassembled,

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:30.309
so you can see on the
right-hand side, you've got

00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:32.454
the spring, the retainer, the guides.

00:25:32.454 --> 00:25:34.469
When we took it all apart,
the guides were physically

00:25:34.469 --> 00:25:37.597
stuck into the block so
we couldn't show that

00:25:37.597 --> 00:25:39.945
because most of them didn't come out.

00:25:39.945 --> 00:25:40.851
- [Ben] So did the
machine shop have to take

00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:41.764
them out for you or what?

00:25:41.764 --> 00:25:43.865
- [Davin] Yeah, yep.

00:25:43.865 --> 00:25:47.936
You see plenty of lubrication
again on the lifters.

00:25:47.936 --> 00:25:49.817
- [Ben] Okay, it looks
like you're using that

00:25:49.817 --> 00:25:51.867
ring compressor again and that is--

00:25:51.867 --> 00:25:54.456
- [Davin] Yep, putting
that retainer in there.

00:25:54.456 --> 00:25:56.242
- [Ben] So to keep the
valves from flying out.

00:25:56.242 --> 00:25:57.848
- [Davin] Yep, yeah, exactly.

00:25:57.848 --> 00:25:58.923
- [Ben] Important.

00:25:58.923 --> 00:26:01.273
- [Davin] This is the brand new oil pump.

00:26:01.273 --> 00:26:03.603
Here's our fresh, freshly painted oil pan.

00:26:03.603 --> 00:26:05.207
- [Ben] It's coming together here.

00:26:05.207 --> 00:26:06.322
- [Davin] Put some screws in it.

00:26:06.322 --> 00:26:10.432
Of course a little schmutz
on the cork gasket.

00:26:10.432 --> 00:26:11.446
- [Ben] What kind of schmutz?

00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:13.257
What are you using on it?

00:26:13.257 --> 00:26:15.961
- [Davin] Usually, I
think that was a Grey RTV.

00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:17.857
- [Ben] What's on the front,
sticking out here, now?

00:26:17.857 --> 00:26:20.451
- [Davin] That, we just
got that setup so we can

00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:21.745
put that on a balancer.

00:26:21.745 --> 00:26:25.036
It's a balancer puller, or
installer, in this case.

00:26:25.036 --> 00:26:27.119
So, balancer and pulleys.

00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:30.318
- [Ben] Oh, okay.

00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.038
So it's just to press it onto--

00:26:32.038 --> 00:26:34.852
- [Davin] Yeah, you do not
want to hammer a balancer,

00:26:34.852 --> 00:26:36.235
onto a crankshaft.

00:26:36.235 --> 00:26:40.106
That thrust bearing will not like it.

00:26:40.106 --> 00:26:41.576
- [Ben] And I recognize these guys.

00:26:41.576 --> 00:26:45.798
- [Davin] Yep, here comes
our steel freshwater pumps.

00:26:45.798 --> 00:26:47.400
So here's one trick I've got to point out.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.117
So, before you put this together, always

00:26:51.117 --> 00:26:55.494
tighten down the bolt
that's in the water hose.

00:26:55.494 --> 00:26:57.608
- [Ben] Oh, yeah.

00:26:57.608 --> 00:26:59.394
- [Davin] Don't forget to tighten that.

00:26:59.394 --> 00:27:01.298
I don't tell you how I
know, but don't forget

00:27:01.298 --> 00:27:03.930
to tighten down that bolt.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.367
- [Ben] I bet you I know how.

00:27:05.367 --> 00:27:06.980
It leaked, didn't it?

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.100
- [Davin] Yes, it does.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.892
And you have to pull
all the coolant out and

00:27:10.892 --> 00:27:14.305
the hose to get to that bolt, of course.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:16.211
- [Ben] Oh, yeah, that's
something you learn

00:27:16.211 --> 00:27:17.781
once and probably don't ever forget.

00:27:17.781 --> 00:27:19.436
- [Davin] And never forget, yep.

00:27:19.436 --> 00:27:22.586
Now here's all the
porcupine quills going in

00:27:22.586 --> 00:27:26.795
out of the head studs,
which is kind of the

00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:30.565
final step here on the
heads, put in studs, put in,

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:33.232
I always use some Teflon sealant

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.803
in case there's one that
goes into the jacket.

00:27:36.803 --> 00:27:38.405
It also helps them come
back out if you ever

00:27:38.405 --> 00:27:39.773
have to take them back out.

00:27:39.773 --> 00:27:41.241
- [Ben] Set yourself up for success.

00:27:41.241 --> 00:27:42.825
- [Davin] Exactly, yep.

00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:45.940
- [Ben] All right, and oh,
that looks like a fancy gasket.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.051
- [Davin] Brand new head gasket.

00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:49.312
- [Ben] That's not cork.

00:27:49.312 --> 00:27:50.562
- [Davin] Nope.

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:53.432
- [Ben] So that looks
like it's lined with a

00:27:53.432 --> 00:27:54.412
bunch of metal bits.

00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:55.443
What does that do for it?

00:27:55.443 --> 00:27:57.409
- [Davin] Yes, you have,
around the combustion

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:00.968
chamber you have that
metal ring that seals

00:28:00.968 --> 00:28:05.365
the chamber off very well, a
fire ring, they refer to it.

00:28:05.365 --> 00:28:07.323
- [Ben] So it's like a softer
metal that will compress

00:28:07.323 --> 00:28:08.156
between--

00:28:09.183 --> 00:28:11.180
- [Davin] Yeah, between
there but also it'll take

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.166
that heat.

00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:14.832
And then you have the
gasket material around the

00:28:14.832 --> 00:28:17.834
outside for the water jacket and such.

00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:19.719
- [Ben] So already I'm
noticing something different.

00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:22.616
The heads last time were
held on by long bolts.

00:28:22.616 --> 00:28:24.192
And now you have studs and nuts.

00:28:24.192 --> 00:28:27.520
- [Davin] Yep, yep, we
went to the stud and nut

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520
setup because they're just sexy, no.

00:28:32.757 --> 00:28:35.747
- [Ben] So this is,
obviously, this isn't the--

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:36.844
- [Davin] No.

00:28:36.844 --> 00:28:39.720
- [Ben] This isn't the original head.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.067
- [Davin] We certainly
took some liberties here

00:28:42.067 --> 00:28:44.548
and because we're not
trying to go after any

00:28:44.548 --> 00:28:47.074
sort of bone originality
with the pickup truck,

00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:50.271
we opted for a couple of hot
rod parts, first of which,

00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:51.566
well, you already saw one.

00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:54.681
We have a three-quarter
race cam, as it's known

00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:57.803
on the street, for the camshaft.

00:28:57.803 --> 00:29:01.477
Pistons were the same
as far as dome-wise and

00:29:01.477 --> 00:29:06.052
then this higher compression
head from Edelbrock,

00:29:06.052 --> 00:29:08.401
both aluminum and finned.

00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:10.965
So for those with a lot
of fingers, there's 24

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:13.422
acorn nuts in this bad boy.

00:29:13.422 --> 00:29:16.549
That is a lot of head bolts.

00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:17.839
- [Ben] That is.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.109
- [Davin] And same
thing on the other side.

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.027
- [Ben] So at this point,
you didn't put anything

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:24.925
else on, because why?

00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:28.856
Like, right now I'm looking
at a filthy intake manifold.

00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:30.325
- [Davin] Filthy pickup truck?

00:29:30.325 --> 00:29:34.145
The reason why we haven't, we did not

00:29:34.145 --> 00:29:36.409
put the other intake
and you'll see why here.

00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:38.834
The old intake made a much
better lift point than

00:29:38.834 --> 00:29:40.084
the new intake.

00:29:42.044 --> 00:29:44.007
And you'll see as we get there.

00:29:44.007 --> 00:29:47.295
So we decided that at this
point we were going to use,

00:29:47.295 --> 00:29:49.575
go back to the old intake.

00:29:49.575 --> 00:29:51.033
We were going to put on the transmission.

00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:53.584
Basically, reverse of pulling it apart,

00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:55.588
and then we'll swap
out the intake manifold

00:29:55.588 --> 00:29:56.881
when we get there.

00:29:56.881 --> 00:29:58.477
So we pulled the old intake back off,

00:29:58.477 --> 00:30:00.644
put the lift plates on it.

00:30:01.595 --> 00:30:04.107
This is the flywheel going on.

00:30:04.107 --> 00:30:06.279
- [Ben] Did you do anything
to the transmission or no?

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.463
- [Davin] No, we did not.

00:30:08.463 --> 00:30:10.296
Some headers going on.

00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:14.114
- [Ben] They look much
nicer than the old--

00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:15.640
- [Davin] The ugly old caps.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.942
- [Ben] Manifolds that
were on there, especially

00:30:16.942 --> 00:30:18.967
with your fancy bolts
that you have on there.

00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:20.041
- [Davin] Oh yeah.

00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:21.741
Yeah, you'll notice
that all these bolts are

00:30:21.741 --> 00:30:23.909
the right size, length and--

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:25.480
- [Ben] You didn't have
to use bolt washers?

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.485
- [Davin] Yeah.

00:30:27.485 --> 00:30:28.715
- [Ben] Oh, spark plugs, that's new.

00:30:28.715 --> 00:30:30.931
- [Davin] Yep, fresh set of plugs.

00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:33.127
And it's very critical
to get the right length

00:30:33.127 --> 00:30:36.939
plugs so they don't hit the pistons.

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:38.687
- [Ben] Now is that something that changes

00:30:38.687 --> 00:30:41.159
because you have different
heads on them now?

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:43.492
- [Davin] Um, possibly, yes.

00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:47.211
- [Ben] You seem to be--

00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:48.879
- [Davin] Well for all
intents and purposes, there's

00:30:48.879 --> 00:30:52.086
only two different lengths of, a long and

00:30:52.086 --> 00:30:53.573
a short-throw plug.

00:30:53.573 --> 00:30:54.858
- [Ben] So, Davin, did
you get the wrong one

00:30:54.858 --> 00:30:55.691
the first time?

00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:56.770
- [Davin] We might have had the wrong ones

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.871
the first time.

00:30:57.871 --> 00:31:00.966
So, fresh motor in the old pickup truck.

00:31:00.966 --> 00:31:04.716
That engine leveler
makes everything so nice.

00:31:06.276 --> 00:31:09.848
- [Ben] All right, so
you're just fiddling with

00:31:09.848 --> 00:31:13.561
some stuff, probably, what
are you doing at this point?

00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:14.781
- [Davin] You're putting the
motor mounts in right there.

00:31:14.781 --> 00:31:15.614
Now we're--

00:31:15.614 --> 00:31:16.765
- [Ben] Off comes the tape.

00:31:16.765 --> 00:31:17.643
- [Davin] Yep.

00:31:17.643 --> 00:31:19.303
Now we're setting in, the
engine is still at top dead

00:31:19.303 --> 00:31:21.586
center so we dropped in
the distributor, didn't

00:31:21.586 --> 00:31:24.151
want it in the way dropping
it in because you'd

00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:26.251
hate to break that off.

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:29.120
I'm putting in the coil right there,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.274
and the temp-sending
units and here goes in

00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:34.357
some engine break-in oil.

00:31:35.938 --> 00:31:37.539
Might as well do it now, it's a lot easier

00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:39.890
to pour in than later, got a gaping hole

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.062
instead of a little dinky one.

00:31:42.062 --> 00:31:45.582
So here's our intake manifold gasket,

00:31:45.582 --> 00:31:50.094
sprayed on some copper
coat to help seal it up.

00:31:50.094 --> 00:31:53.844
And then this is why we
did not reuse the old

00:31:55.116 --> 00:31:56.353
intake manifold.

00:31:56.353 --> 00:31:58.477
Because this already--

00:31:58.477 --> 00:31:59.310
- [Ben] Preassembled.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.143
- [Davin] Preassembled.

00:32:00.143 --> 00:32:03.461
I preassembled this to drop on.

00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:04.506
- [Ben] That looks nice.

00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:07.436
- [Davin] Yeah, so this
is our additional hot rod

00:32:07.436 --> 00:32:11.603
part, going to a two-barrel
setup, or a two-barrel,

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:16.967
deuce setup, whatever way
you want to look at it that.

00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:20.758
This is Edelbrock's slingshot manifold

00:32:20.758 --> 00:32:24.790
and from the side you'll see it's a V or

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.283
why they call it a slingshot.
- I can sort of see it there.

00:32:26.283 --> 00:32:30.139
- [Davin] So they started
making the flatheads in '32,

00:32:30.139 --> 00:32:32.722
Edelbrock had a upgrade in '34.

00:32:34.355 --> 00:32:37.830
That is still the best
horsepower-producing

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.699
intake manifold with the exception of one.

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:43.074
- [Ben] So they got it right.

00:32:43.074 --> 00:32:46.384
- [Davin] Yes, they did a very good job.

00:32:46.384 --> 00:32:47.927
You'll see us put on the generator off the

00:32:47.927 --> 00:32:48.982
front of that.

00:32:48.982 --> 00:32:50.504
We had to do a little
bit of customizing to

00:32:50.504 --> 00:32:52.366
make it fit well.

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:54.645
- [Ben] What kind of
carburetors are on this?

00:32:54.645 --> 00:32:57.562
- [Davin] Those are Edelbrock 194s.

00:32:58.496 --> 00:33:00.636
- [Ben] Fuel lines, now
why, how 'come clear

00:33:00.636 --> 00:33:01.553
fuel lines?

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.273
- [Davin] Well, they look sexy.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:10.221
- [Ben] I'm okay with that answer.

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:13.743
The more practical side
of me is like, well,

00:33:13.743 --> 00:33:15.978
it's also, you can tell
if it's getting fuel.

00:33:15.978 --> 00:33:18.224
- [Davin] Well, there is that.

00:33:18.224 --> 00:33:20.717
We did reuse those spark
plug wires, if you notice.

00:33:20.717 --> 00:33:22.609
- [Ben] I do.

00:33:22.609 --> 00:33:24.592
They were already pretty newish.

00:33:24.592 --> 00:33:27.067
- [Davin] And the fan
is, we reused, basically

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:29.388
any parts that we could
reuse from the original

00:33:29.388 --> 00:33:31.353
build, we did.

00:33:31.353 --> 00:33:32.576
You know, if they were
new there was no reason

00:33:32.576 --> 00:33:34.510
to throw those out.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:39.364
The generator was, the guts
are cleaned up on that.

00:33:39.364 --> 00:33:41.827
The battery is going back in.

00:33:41.827 --> 00:33:44.827
I'm tightening down the hose clamps.

00:33:46.069 --> 00:33:48.437
At this point we're
ready for the radiator.

00:33:48.437 --> 00:33:49.640
All right.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.882
- [Ben] Oh, this is the real video.

00:33:50.882 --> 00:33:52.221
- [Davin] This is the test.

00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.795
All right, so we've got
fuel going up the lines,

00:33:54.795 --> 00:33:56.395
we can see that.

00:33:56.395 --> 00:33:59.228
(engine cranking)

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.660
(engine running)

00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.352
- [Ben] It's alive.

00:34:09.352 --> 00:34:11.597
- [Davin] And that is the best feeling.

00:34:11.597 --> 00:34:14.297
- [Ben] I love the look that
you give the camera there.

00:34:14.297 --> 00:34:16.275
You were pretty psyched.

00:34:16.275 --> 00:34:17.701
- [Davin] So, throw the hood back on, make

00:34:17.701 --> 00:34:20.312
it a little bit more aerodynamic.

00:34:20.312 --> 00:34:24.062
- [Ben] These trucks were known for--

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:24.974
- [Davin] Yep.

00:34:24.974 --> 00:34:26.505
- [Ben] So that's pretty much it.

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.306
- [Davin] That's a wrap on this one.

00:34:28.306 --> 00:34:31.784
The only thing that's left
here is, go for a ride.

00:34:31.784 --> 00:34:33.118
- [Ben] Of course we've
got our GoPros up there

00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:34.595
because the camera guys
have got to put cameras

00:34:34.595 --> 00:34:36.036
on everything.

00:34:36.036 --> 00:34:37.753
I used my skateboard for this shot.

00:34:37.753 --> 00:34:40.154
- [Davin] Yes, Ben, I
was impressed with that.

00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:43.556
- [Ben] Skitched for a bit and off you go.

00:34:43.556 --> 00:34:44.389
- [Davin] Yeah.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.374
- [Ben] Just like that.

00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:46.207
Well, good work, man.

00:34:46.207 --> 00:34:47.040
- [Davin] Thank you.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.354
- [Ben] Well, thanks, guys, for watching.

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:54.190
If I left anything out, let us know in the

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.002
comments or ask any other questions.

00:34:56.002 --> 00:34:58.493
We'll do our, do our
best to answer and again,

00:34:58.493 --> 00:35:00.496
if you have any questions
about video stuff,

00:35:00.496 --> 00:35:01.817
you can ask me.

00:35:01.817 --> 00:35:04.374
Otherwise Davin can shoot
back some answers on

00:35:04.374 --> 00:35:06.201
anything regarding the rebuild.

00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:07.910
- [Davin] Yep, absolutely.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.161
And stay tuned, you never know,
we might have another one.

00:35:11.161 --> 00:35:11.994
- [Ben] Or two.

00:35:11.994 --> 00:35:12.852
- [Davin] Or two.

00:35:12.852 --> 00:35:13.885
- [Ben] Or five.
- Five. (laughs)

00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:15.026
- [Ben] Or as long as
you guys keep watching,

00:35:15.026 --> 00:35:15.859
we'll keep doing it.

00:35:15.859 --> 00:35:16.727
- [Davin] Sweet, that's right.
