00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
who would like to play Send To All?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.360
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200
This, of course, is where I take
a celebrity's mobile telephone

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.960
and send a text to all their
contacts of our choosing

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.480
and we see what hilarious replies
we get at the end of the show.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.760
So let's see who is in the
Send To All box this week.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.320
Please welcome the extraordinarily
multi-talented and brilliant,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.040
it's Bradley Walsh!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.960
Bradley!

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920
We love you, Bradley!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.320
I love Brads.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.280
So much love for you, Bradley.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.600
Thanks, Mike.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
How are you?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.240
I'm really well, thanks.
I'm really nervous.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.600
Don't worry, it's really fine.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.840
Don't panic, Bradley.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.200
How are you in your life?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.600
You're doing so many things -
you're a very busy man. Yeah.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.840
Yeah.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.360
I am. So, Doctor Who, this is
an extraordinary turn of events.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.000
How did it come about, Bradley?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.680
It's not a phone call
you were expecting?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.880
No, it wasn't.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.600
I mean, it's a great team,
I've got to say.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
And the show is, obviously, you
know, is just fantastic.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.480
My son is obsessed with Doctor Who.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.040
Yeah, it's really great.
It's great.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.840
So Doctor Who is
tremendously exciting.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.000
Yes. And then, The Chase.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.480
How many Chases are you doing?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.560
You're constantly being chased.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.120
We make three a day.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.880
We probably make 200 a year.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.040
It's amazing.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.200
Yeah, it's great to be able to
do it cos it's a fun show.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920
I literally get paid to go
into work and play.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.400
I don't know who the Chaser is.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.800
I don't see the questions.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.760
But that, I think that's what makes
it so spontaneous and hilarious.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.400
Also, you get the giggles a lot.
Yeah.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.360
What's the ones that
have made you laugh a lot?

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.720
Well, the original one...

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.760
Fanny Chmelar, of course.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.120
And then you've got Dick Tingler.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.440
Willy Whacker.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.240
SHOUTS FROM AUDIENCE

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.520
Sorry?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.040
That's my mother. I'm sorry.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.400
Just finally, before
we play Send To All... Yeah.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.720
..you're singing, Bradley?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.680
I mean, this is
an extraordinary thing.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.040
There's a few people
here who are familiar

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.440
with your singing.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.600
But that's not to say that you
haven't enjoyed humongous success.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120
Didn't you have something

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120
like the biggest-selling
album of last year?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.640
Well, it's the biggest-selling
debut album, yeah.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.080
Wow.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080
And you beat Zayn Malik?
This is the thing I can't get over.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.160
Yeah... Zayn Malik went solo
after One Direction,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.840
the biggest boyband in the world,
and you ended up beating him.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.760
You sold more records
than Zayn Malik.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.800
You know, who knows,
we may collaborate.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.080
Zayn Malik featuring
Bradley Walsh...

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.760
..with Fanny Chmelar. I'd buy that.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.240
Yeah, quite. Well, thank you so, so
much for agreeing to do this.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.640
You're welcome. If you'd like
to pop your mobile phone

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.400
into this contraption...
There you go. ..I will bring it...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.880
GASPS

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.400
LAUGHTER

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.960
I thought you were
going to catch it!

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.360
Bradley, what have you done?!

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.200
It's completely smashed up.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.600
It's all right. Here's mine.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.080
Webuyanyphone.com.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.960
Got to be worth a tenner,
isn't it, yeah?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.120
All right.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.360
So, I'm going to just move this,
and that should come down now.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.760
DOCTOR WHO THEME PLAYS

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.520
Oooh!

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.160
That's on my next album.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am now in possession

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.840
of Bradley Walsh's
actual mobile phone.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.040
So if I plug this in here...

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.280
Hello!

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.560
There it is.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.960
Oh, I smell somebody who's
changed their screensaver

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.720
for the show.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.880
There's no way
that is you, Bradley.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.960
No, that was a photograph
I took on a beach when I was

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.560
on holiday in Portugal.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.560
I waited for ages for
that bird to fly across.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.320
Honestly, I sat there,
my wife said, "We've got to go,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.680
"come on, we've got to go."

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.680
I said, "No, it'll be here
in a minute."

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.600
It's a beautiful picture. OK.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.680
Where are you?
Where's all this weather?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.360
Almancil?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.920
Where's that? In...

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.640
Near Faro, where I go
quite a lot on holiday.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.000
Epping?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.160
Epping...

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.280
Epping...

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.600
Epping!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.560
You go on holiday in Epping?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.520
Epping is where I live in Essex.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.200
CHEERING

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.680
There you go. Newport.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.000
We've actually filmed
Doctor Who in Cardiff,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.800
but I stay in Newport.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.400
And the weather differs massively
from Newport to Cardiff?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.800
Shenzhen?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.480
Um...

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.560
They do the best crispy duck,
and I have it sent...

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.360
You've got weather in your
local Chinese restaurant?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.200
Shenzhen's in China,
and my wife works in China.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.880
Right. Occasionally.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.160
Sheffield?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.640
It's where...

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.920
West Hollywood?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.600
Are you on the run, Bradley Walsh?
No.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.560
My son's in West Hollywood.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.400
Beverly Hills! Woo!

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.080
Look at this.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.840
Has anyone in the world ever
had Southend and Beverly Hills

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.480
back-to-back?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.880
No. This is a unique phone, Bradley.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.280
Where am I today, oi, oi!

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.480
Is it Southend...
or Beverly Hills?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.760
Or Cowbridge! Where's that?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.240
It's... It's...

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.480
It's a place in Wales.
It's beautiful.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.640
Beautiful Cowbridge.
La Calahorra?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.320
I have absolutely
no idea where that is!

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.000
OK. Quick look at some photos.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.600
And this is...

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.960
That's my wife Donna with
Winston Churchill and Eisenhower.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.560
Really? Were they sitting like
that when she sat down?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.960
I'm a bit worried where
she's got her hands, actually.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.840
Yes!

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.920
She's really into
Eisenhower and Churchy.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.400
It's a wonderful sculpture
in Old Bond Street.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.000
Um...

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.360
I can press play on this.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.480
# Mamma mia, mamma mia

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.120
# Beelzebub has a devil
put aside for me

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.200
# For me, for me! #

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.680
Oh, my God, Bradley.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.920
Bradley, what's that?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.040
So...

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.320
I don't do any social media at all,
and I got into Instagram via my son,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.920
Barney. That's called
Bradders' Bangers.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.240
Brad's Bangers!

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.880
So you're posting these online?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.720
Every morning, just to get people
out of bed and get in the kitchen,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.960
you know, laughing and joking,
you know what I mean.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.920
You're going to have
to post tomorrow morning,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.000
because everybody watching this is
dying for the next instalment, Brad.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a crazy guy!

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.800
Now, let's have a little bit of fun
with a man who is all about fun.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.360
So, what are we going
to pop into your phone?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.720
Singer, actor,
comedian, photographer.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.640
"Just woke up...

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.800
"..from a power nap...

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.160
"..and had the weirdest dream."

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.880
Oh, no.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.440
Now, the dreams are funny,
because anything can happen

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.880
in the dream. That's why we went
for the weirdest dream.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.440
"I was lying on a beach...

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.680
"..between...

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.640
"..the Beast...

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.240
"..from The Chase..."

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.560
Oh, no! "..and a Dalek.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.280
"Being served cocktails..."

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.080
Oh, no. "..by Zayn Malik."

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.440
Right, here's where it gets tasty.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.960
"And you were there, massaging...

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.920
"..sun cream..." Oh.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.280
"..into my thighs.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.640
"And calling me..." Oh.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.280
You'll like this.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.720
"Your Highness.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.520
"What do you think it means?"

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.240
How would you sign a text?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.640
Brad. Good idea.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.080
The text that we're going to send
to everybody in Brad's phone

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.320
is the following.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.640
"Just woke up from a power nap
and had the weirdest dream.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.240
"I was lying on a beach
between the Beast (from The Chase)

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.120
"and a Dalek, being served
cocktails by Zayn Malik.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720
"And you were there,
massaging suncream into my thighs

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.000
"and calling me Your Highness.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.280
"What do you think it means?
Brad."

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.920
Shall we send that to everybody
in Bradley Walsh's mobile phone?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.280
It's a fun one!

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.160
And it has gone,
ladies and gentlemen!

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.400
We will be finding out later
in the show what replies

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.640
Bradley Walsh gets,
but one more time,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.880
a sensational sport, the hilarious
Bradley Walsh, Walshy!

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.240
Thank you so much.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.800
Very good.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.440
So, let's remind ourselves
of the text we sent

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.880
into Bradley's phone.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.480
Well, we'll just crack on with this.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.840
This is from Pip Skoda and Steph.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.920
Who are they?

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.720
That's Phillip Schofield
and his wife, Steph. Oh.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.160
Pip Skoda. I can't believe
you've just read that!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.120
That's what I call him,
but he doesn't know I call him that.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.360
I can't believe...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.600
I can't believe you've just
grassed me up.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.840
Well, Pip Skoda...
Yeah, Phillip Schofield.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.120
Phillip Schofield.
Phillip Schofield and Steph.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.000
He's just texted... Oh, no.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.520
.."You're just having
flashbacks to the summer.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.080
"Wow, what memories."

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.480
And he's signed it, "Your Highness."

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.720
Gibbo. Who's Gibbo?
That's Terry Gibson.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.760
Used to play for Man United
and Spurs. Terry Gibson.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.880
Gibbo. Terry Gibson, yeah.
"I'm not entirely sure.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.360
"I need a few more details."

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.400
Thinking emoji.
"What particular beach are you on?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.600
"What cocktail was it?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.640
"And did I make sure that it was
a high enough factor?"

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.320
Right, OK. Matt Up Yard.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.640
What's Matt Up Yard?

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.200
Who's that?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.360
That's...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.000
Who's Matt Up Yard?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.320
It's just Matt up the yard.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.320
He lives at the end of your garden?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.400
It's just...
It's just Matt up the yard.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.720
Which yard? It's just the yard.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.640
The yard... Where there's,
like, workshops and stuff.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.080
Right, yeah. The yard.
Mechanic yard?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.760
Well, yeah, but he wraps cars.
A rapper?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.680
I don't mean like he raps
cars, he wraps cars. OK.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.120
So, Matt Up Yard, "Seriously,
it probably means that you need

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.200
"to have a moment to ground yourself
and get some quiet time.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.040
"Try a bit of meditation.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.720
"Let me know if you
need help with that."

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.560
On the side, Matt does
all the crystals and stuff.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.920
He does crystals and cars?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.520
Matt Up Yard?

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.400
Matt Up Yard.
Does meditation and he fixes cars?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.720
Is business not booming?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.640
I'm going to text him back,
"Can you do Tuesday at two?"

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.080
Oh... Oh, no.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.520
Mandip?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.080
That's Mandip Gill, who's in Doctor
Who with me.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.560
"I'm most alarmed as to why
you had a power nap at 9pm."

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.080
OK. Rick Wakeman.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.920
Yeah, Ricky Wakeman.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.040
Yeah. Wow.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.080
He's just texted, "It means
that dreams can come true."

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.880
Wait. "I'll bring the sun cream."

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.000
Wakeman's on his way over
with some sun cream.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.200
One-word reply.
"Hurry."

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.840
Alex Adams, who's that?

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.000
Oh.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.120
That's my dentist.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.440
He started with, "Well, Brad,
if that was really meant for me,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560
"then you've got me worried.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.200
"But if you heard me
asking to open wide,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.200
"then it is the sort of message
that we send out to patients

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.120
"when they're well overdue
for their check-ups."

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.280
He's a great dentist and I haven't
seen him for about a year.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.480
I've got to go. I've got to...

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.520
I've got to go,
that's the end of it.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.160
I've just got to go. OK.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.160
Just to let you know
that Matt Up Yard has answered

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.840
the "Can you do Tuesday?"

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.560
"Yes, mate. Can't do it here
as place full of cars and spares.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.520
"Might be able to shift
things around if needs be.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.840
"Let me know."

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.080
He's actually never
had an appointment ever.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.840
He can't believe it.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.720
"How much will this cost me?"

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.400
Oh, my God.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.840
Shane?

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.920
Shane? Shane Richie. Shane Richie.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.600
"No idea, but it's a great
storyline for EastEnders."

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.760
As we know and love him, Gino DC.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.960
Gino D'Acampo has texted back,
"Oh, dear.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.720
"You maybe want to cut
down on the Viagra.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.480
"I know it's helping you,
but it's definitely messing up

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.000
"your brain, my friend."

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.440
What an absolutely sensational
Send To All that was.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.480
Wonderful guest tonight, the
fantastic Mr Bradley Walsh, Walshy!

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.240
