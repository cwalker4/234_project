00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Ever since the earliest rockets we've
seen them working with a bell-shaped

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.050
engine nozzle from the first German v2
rockets right up until the spacex falcon

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.730
heavy but the ubiquity of the bell
shaped rocket nozzle doesn't mean to say

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.800
that it's the best way to do things in
fact they have a major drawback which is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:30.720
one of the reasons why we use multistage
rockets, however since the early 1970s

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.370
there has been an alternative rocket
engine which has much greater efficiency

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
and was to power the next generation of
single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.340
replace a space shuttle but if it's so
good why hasn't even been flown yet. The

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.559
engine in question is the aerospike, a
design that goes back to the 1950s when

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.449
it was first developed by Rocketdyne. Now
whilst this might sound like an exotic

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.120
new type of propulsion the aerospike is
not actually a whole new engine it's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.310
actually just a different way to contain
and control the thrust but any rocket

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.100
be that liquid or solid fuel produces and
it replaces the Bell type combustion

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
chamber. Now if we've been using the Bell
type rocket nozzle combustion chamber

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
since the very first Rockets right up
until now and what's wrong with them. For

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.590
a rocket to work correctly and produce
enough thrust to lift it into orbit then

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.600
you have to control the burning rocket
fuel. If there was no rocket nozzle then

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
the burning rocket fuel would just
expand uncontrollably in all directions

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.689
and very little of it will be converted
into useful thrust. What the rocket

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.119
nozzle does is convert the high-pressure
combustion of a rocket fuel into an

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.700
ultra-high speed flow of gas exiting the
nozzle in one direction and at

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.049
atmospheric pressure. The ratio of the
size of a narrow end

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.240
to the wide end of the nozzle must also
allow for the atmospheric pressure where

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.619
the rocket will operate. Now this sounds
complicated but it's actually quite

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.920
simple. Everything including you, me
the ground and rocket engines has

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.500
atmospheric pressure pressing on us in
all directions due to the weight of the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.250
atmosphere as the air is pulled down by
the Earth's gravity.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.579
If you imagine a column of air measuring
one square inch or 2.54 square

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.769
centimeters from sea level to the top of
the atmosphere, that air would have a

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.750
mass of 6.67 kilograms or
14.7 pounds.we don't

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.980
feel it because we have evolved to live
at that pressure but if you were to go

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.290
up to 12 kilometers that pressure
would be just one-tenth of sea level and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.810
at 50 kilometers it will be one
hundredth of sea level simply because

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.239
the column of air is now much shorter
and thus weighs much less. That air

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.299
pressure also pushes on the gases
exiting the rocket nozzle. For a rocket

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.560
to work at its most efficient and
produce the most amount of thrust the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.629
gases exiting the rocket nozzle must be
at atmospheric pressure so where they

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.940
exit out as straight as possible. This is
fine if your rocket is traveling

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.599
sideways through the atmosphere like a
air to air missile then the air

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.609
pressure doesn't change much. A rocket
going into orbit however starts at sea

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.280
level with a lot of air pressure and
ends up in a vacuum with no air pressure.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.769
Because a bell nozzle has a fixed shape
and size its maximum efficiency and

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.739
thrust will only be achieved at one
altitude. Design it to have maximum

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.290
thrust at sea level and takeoff and the
exhaust gases will over expand and lose

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.239
thrust at high altitudes because of a
lack of air pressure, design it to have

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.269
maximum thrust at high altitudes and at
takeoff the air pressure is so much but

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.220
it constricts the gas flow inwards which
leads it to separating from the nozzle

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.870
wall and becoming unstable
usually resulting in the engine blowing

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.250
up.
In an ideal rocket nozzle it would

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:27.110
change its shape as the altitude and air
pressure changes this is what an aerospike 
 does. It uses the pressure of the air surrounding it
air surrounding it to have the same

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.449
to have the same effect as the bell of a traditional rocket engine. The two main types of

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.259
aerospikes which have been developed
are the annular or round ones and the

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.539
linear or straight ones. The round ones
are where we get the name from, if you

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.720
imagine an inverted bell shape it
becomes a round spike, this spike becomes

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.320
one side of a virtual Bell whilst the
air pressure surrounding it compresses

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.259
the exhaust gas against the inner spike,
although many now use a truncated spike

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.810
which has a much shorter design than the
equivalent engine bell. As the rocket

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.009
goes from takeoff at high air pressure
to the low air pressure at high

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.110
altitudes the shape of the exhaust flow
changes due to the changing air pressure

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.020
to keep it at its optimum shape and
optimum thrust. This is what's called an

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.449
altitude compensating rocket nozzle.
Although it might not be as efficient as

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.630
a bell any given altitude it outperforms
them at all others. The Space Shuttle

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.099
main engines which were used from
takeoff to space were much less

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.110
efficient at sea level than they were in
space. With a rocket engine like the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.400
aerospike you could use just one
engine that will work efficiently from

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.830
takeoff to space and avoid the need for
multiple stages with different rocket

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.620
engines optimized for different
altitudes effectively becoming an SST o

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.560
or single-stage-to-orbit.
So if these are so good why aren't they

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.639
used to date no major rocket launches
have used an aerospike despite much

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.050
research and development being done
during the 1960s and 70s and then in the

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.599
1990s. As a follow-on to the successful
J-2 engine which was used on the Saturn

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.520
third stage Rocketdyne set about
developing and building both toroidal

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.379
and linear aerospikes using the turbo pumps and engine

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.909
infrastructure of the J-2. one of the
biggest problems with a aerospike

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.469
engine is the cooling of the spike. in
the toroidal or round design the spike

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:43.300
is long and heavy which makes it
difficult to cool the tip of a spike to

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.830
stop it from melting. This was mostly
overcome with the development of the new

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.529
copper alloy called NARloy-Z in the
1970s which allowed longer use of high

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.839
temperatures. The design were also
changed with a truncated spike with some

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.439
of the exhaust gases being passed
through the center to achieve a similar

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:08.649
result of a long spike but with much
less mass. However the linear version was

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:14.039
even more flexible. In this the round
spike is straightened out into a v-shape

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:19.599
with the combustion chambers on either
side, the beauty of this design is that

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.360
can be made modular so that it can have
more combustion chambers added to make a

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.909
longer a more powerful engine. Back in
the 70s they use combustion nozzles made

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:35.649
into small banks which were stacked
side-by-side on both sides of the

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:41.019
"V" center. Although aerospikes were
proposed for the space shuttle, as the

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:45.860
Apollo program was wound up in the early
1970s development work on the aerospikes

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.979
also stopped and the space
shuttle went on to use conventional Bell

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:55.839
engine nozzle designs. Things stayed
pretty much like this for the next 20

00:07:55.839 --> 00:08:00.219
years until NASA was looking to develop
the next generation of space shuttle

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:06.249
using an all-new single-stage-to-orbit
design. The design brief was to be able

00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:11.409
to come up with a completely new launch
vehicle that would be fully reusable and

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:17.189
would greatly reduce the cost of getting
into space from $10,000 per pound to

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:21.759
$1,000 per pound.
Lockheed Martin won the contract to

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.569
build the revolutionary design
designated the X-33

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:30.869
and one of the key features was the use
of the linear aerospike engines.

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:37.750
Development work continued on the XRS-
2200 linear aerospike and by now with

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.219
the use of electricmagnetic nozzles it meant that the fuel

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:45.420
system could be controlled on a nozzle
by nozzle basis a bit like the fuel

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.730
injection on a car. This allowed for much
greater throttling control and allowed

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.930
for the thrust vectoring by turning off
different sections of the engine. This

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:00.780
also removed the need to have heavy
complex engine gimbals. Work progressed

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.250
well up until 2001 when due to issues
with the X-33's

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:11.040
composite fuel tank and cost overruns
the project was cancelled again taking

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.710
the aerospike engines with it. Progress
has been made with NASA testing small

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.320
scale solid rockets with a toroidal
full-length aerospike in 2004 but since

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.680
then there have been no large aerospike
engine developments. So why don't new

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:34.200
companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin
use the aerospike engines with all the

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.060
efficiencies they bring wouldn't they be
the perfect match for a low-cost route

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.000
to space. As far as we know SpaceX has
looked at using aerospikes but given

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.190
the fact that no large-scale aerospike
has ever been flight tested it would be

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.120
a very big risk when you're looking to
set up a commercial orbital space

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.190
company. One of the driving principles of
the space race was "To do the job good

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.960
enough and no more", basically mainly that 
once you have developed your spacecraft

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.820
or your rocket engine to do what it was
designed to do then that's it you stop

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:15.210
there. The technology SpaceX and others
are using is well known and tested. The

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.110
way they use it might be different like
relighting the main angels descend back

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:25.260
to earth but the engines themselves are
a known quantity. Commercial companies

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.210
have to make a profit in the end and
taking on a major task like developing a

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:35.990
new untested engine design is something
but could quickly sap those profits away.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.910
Although the X-33 project almost got
them to flight testing, it's still new

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.500
technology and needs more money and more development. It would also mean

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.360
completely redesigning the Rockets away
from the tried and trusted but yet

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.080
limited traditional
bell nozzle engines. All this takes time

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.030
time which could be used launching with
traditional engines and getting money

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.610
into the companies. Although there would
be a saving of up to 40%, the fuel is

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.630
actually one of the cheapest parts of a
rocket launch, Elon Musk said himself

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.450
that the Falcon 9 costs $60 million
to build but only $200,000 to

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.670
fuel. The bringing back of the boosters
and the central core with the engines

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:27.310
brings far greater savings than could be
achieved with a change to aerospike

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:34.120
engines. It seems as though until the
price of launches has been driven down

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.850
to as low as conventional Bell nozzle
engines will allow that arrow spikes

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:45.130
will remain on the drawing board.
The single-stage-to-orbit vehicles which

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.170
perfectly compliment the aerospikes
capabilities seem a long way off since

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.730
the cancellation of the X-33 and the
renewed interest in returning to the

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:00.040
moon using variations of conventional
engines that date back to the early

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.800
1960s. There are smaller companies like
Arco space which are developing

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.150
small-scale aerospike engines for
single-stage-to-orbit satellite launches

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:16.300
but unless there is a radical change in
the space market only time will tell if

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:22.540
arrow spikes will ever get used for
future space vehicles. So what does it

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.640
take to design a rocket engine how much
thrust does it take to lift a spacecraft

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.740
and how fast must we launch an object
from the surface of the earth to get it

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.150
to leave. You can look up the answer if
