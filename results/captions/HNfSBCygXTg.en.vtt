00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:20.130
In 1612, Russia was in a state of anarchy.
They called it 'The Time of Troubles'.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.600
The people were terrorised by war, famine and
plague. Up to a third of them perished.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.320
Foreign troops occupied Moscow, Smolensk and Novgorod.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.160
But then, Russia fought back.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.360
Prince Pozharsky and a merchant, Kuzma Minin,
led the Russian militia to Moscow, and threw

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.659
out the Polish garrison.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:58.299
Since 2005, this event has been commemorated
every 4th November, as Russian National Unity

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:12.110
Day.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.670
The Russian assembly, the Zemsky Sobor, realised
the country had to unite behind a new ruler,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.930
and elected a 16 year old noble, Mikhail Romanov,
as the next Tsar.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.110
His dynasty would rule Russia for the next
300 years.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.730
Tsar Mikhail exchanged territory for peace,
winning Russia much-needed breathing-space.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:49.490
His son, Tsar Alexei, implemented a new legal
code, the Sobornoye Ulozheniye. It turned

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.380
all Russian peasants, 80% of the population,
into serfs â€“ effectively, slaves - their

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.280
status inherited by their children, and with
no freedom to travel or choose their master.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.090
It was a system that dominated Russian rural
life for the next 200 years.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.250
The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch
Nikon, imposed religious reforms that split

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:29.810
the church between Reformers and 'Old Believers'.
It's a schism that continues to this day.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.840
Ukrainian Cossacks, rebelling against the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, recognised

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.870
Tsar Alexei as overlord in exchange for his
military support.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.400
It led to the Thirteen Years War between Russia
and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Russia

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.209
emerged victorious, reclaiming Smolensk and
taking control of eastern Ukraine.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.280
A revolt against Tsarist government, led by
a renegade Cossack, Stenka Razin, brought

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.040
anarchy to southern Russia. It was finally
suppressed: Razin was brought to Moscow and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340
executed by quartering.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.640
The sickly but highly-educated Feodor III
passed many reforms. He abolished mestnichestvo,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.950
the system that had awarded government posts
according to nobility rather than merit, and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.730
symbolically burned the ancient books of rank.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:42.250
But Feodor died aged just 19. His sister Sofia
became Princess Regent, ruling on behalf of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.640
her younger brothers, the joint Tsars Ivan
V and Peter I.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.810
After centuries of conflict, Russia and the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth signed a Treaty

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.459
of Eternal Peace. Russia then joined 'the
Holy League' in its war against the Ottoman

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.590
Empire.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.680
Sofia's reign also saw the first treaty between
Russia and China, establishing the frontier

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:24.240
between the two states.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.189
At age 17, Peter I seized power from his half-sister,
Sofia.

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:39.099
Peter became the first Russian ruler to travel
abroad. He toured Europe with his 'Grand Embassy',

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.699
seeking allies for Russia's war against Turkey,
and learning the latest developments in science

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.490
and shipbuilding.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.449
The war against Turkey was successfully concluded
by the Treaty of Constantinople: Russia gained

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:03.650
Azov from Turkey's ally, the Crimean Khanate,
and with it, a foothold on the Black Sea.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:12.099
Peter made many reforms, seeking to turn Russia
into a modern, European state. He demanded

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:19.740
Russian nobles dress and behave like Europeans.
He made those who refused to shave pay a beard

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.349
tax.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:30.309
Peter built the first Russian navy; reformed
the army and government; and promoted industry,

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.240
trade and education.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.869
In the Great Northern War, Russia, Poland-Lithuania
and Denmark took on the dominant power in

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.490
the Baltic, Sweden.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.879
The war began badly for Russia, with a disastrous
defeat to Charles XII of Sweden at Narva.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.650
But Russia won a second battle of Narva...

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.349
Before crushing Charles XII's army at the
Battle of Poltava.

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:10.699
On the Baltic coast, Peter completed construction
of a new capital, St.Petersburg. The building

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.460
of what would become Russia's second largest
city among coastal marshes was a remarkable

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.659
achievement, though it cost the lives of many
thousands of serfs.

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:29.800
The Great Northern War ended with the Treaty
of Nystad: Russia's gains at Sweden's expense

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.569
made it the new, dominant Baltic power.

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:43.439
Four years before his death, Peter was declared
'Peter the Great, Father of His Country, Emperor

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:54.930
of All the Russias'.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:03.929
Peter was succeeded by his wife Catherine;
then his grandson Peter II, who died of smallpox

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:07.129
aged just 14.

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:13.529
Empress Anna Ioannovna, daughter of Peter
the Great's half-brother Ivan V, was famed

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:22.860
for her decadence and the influence of her
German lover, Ernst Biron.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.349
During Anna's reign, Vitus Bering, a Danish
explorer in Russian service, led the first

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:36.129
expedition to chart the coast of Alaska. He
also discovered the Aleutian Islands, and

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:43.969
later gave his name to the sea that separates
Russia and America.

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:50.289
After Anna's death, her infant grand-nephew,
Ivan VI, was deposed by Peter the Great's

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.389
daughter, Elizabeth.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:08:01.659
Ivan VI spent his entire life in captivity,
until aged 23, he was murdered by his guards

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:04.349
during a failed rescue attempt.

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:13.770
Elizabeth, meanwhile, was famed for her vanity,
extravagance, and many young lovers.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:20.659
But she was also capable of decisive leadership:
in alliance with France and Austria, Elizabeth

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:26.110
led Russia into the Seven Years War against
Frederick the Great of Prussia.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.559
The Russian army inflicted a crushing defeat
on Frederick at the Battle of Kunersdorf,

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.740
but failed to exploit its victory.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:42.450
Meanwhile in St.Petersburg, the Winter Palace
was completed at vast expense. It would remain

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.660
the monarch's official residence, right up
until the Russian Revolution of 1917.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:57.050
Peter III was Peter the Great's grandson by
his elder daughter Anna Petrovna, who'd died

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.490
as a consequence of childbirth.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:06.830
Raised in Denmark, Peter spoke hardly any
Russian, and greatly admired Russia's enemy,

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:13.770
Frederick the Great - so he had Russia swap
sides in the Seven Years War, saving Frederick

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.090
from almost certain defeat.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:24.450
Peter's actions angered many army officers.
And he'd always been despised by his German

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.060
wife, Catherine.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:35.910
Together they deposed Peter III, who died
a week later in suspicious circumstances.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:43.770
His wife Catherine became Empress of Russia.
Her reign would be remembered as one of Russia's

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.990
most glorious...
