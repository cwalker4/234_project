00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.880
Ada, where am I?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.780
Ada: You are in orbit of Q-465b.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
What about Philip?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960
Ada: Philip's cryopod has lost power.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.800
His oxygen level is critical.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.080
Plot a course to get me next to him.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.280
Ada: This will significantly reduce your power reserves.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.580
You may not have enough to return to Solis. Are you sure?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.160
Emiliana: Positive, do it.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.340

Decelerate.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.860
Deploy the left lateral connectors.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.020
 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.960
Reverse engines. Get me to Solis.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.720
Ada: Power reserves depleted.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.300
Emiliana: Open doors to docking bay 2. Ada: Understood.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.380
But you won't be able to correct your trajectory.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.160
Deploy top connectors.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.220
[alarm cycles]

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.660
Ada, power up the medlab. Ada: Understood.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700
 

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:12.475
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.620
Ada, what's wrong with the med equipment?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.880
Ada: The medical equipment is functioning properly.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.660
Is Philip alive?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.420
Ada: Yes.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.380
Then why are the probes telling me he's dead?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.940
Ada: I don't know.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.020
Keep pumping O2 no matter what it says.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.500
Ada: Understood.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.560

Ada.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.140
What the fuck happened?

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.080
Ada: I don't know.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.240
Why did you eject our cryopods?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.460
Ada: I did not eject any of the cryopods on the ship.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.140
We landed with them. That means we should have been ejected.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.160
Ada: I cannot explain this discrepancy.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.960
[thud echoes aboard the ship]

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.140
[whispers] Ada...

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.960
Who else is on the ship?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.180
Ada: You and Philip Mayda are the only people on the ship.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.060
How many living beings are on the ship?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.620
Ada: Two.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.280
How many heat sources of approximately 37 degrees are on the ship?

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.740
Ada: Three.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.340

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.280
Ada: Emiliana Newton.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.820
Are you sure?

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.460
Ada: Yes.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.040

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.060
Identify the person on the med slab.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.060
Ada: Philip Mayda.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.220
Philip: Ada, how is that possible?

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.220
Ada: I cannot explain this discrepancy.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.300
[sighs]

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.200
You died.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.800
Philip: The hyperlight core gave out a few days ago.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.580
We came out of cryo and... we been trying to fix it...

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.800
...since it happened.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.900
You went space walking... I accessed the

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.680
core's external sensors. We were operating under no sleep but...

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.040
[external boom]

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.340
...just two hours ago

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.340
boom there was this explosion that surrounded the whole ship and y-

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.640
She died in the rain of wreckage.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.320
Now you're here.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.160
Alive. And-

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.160
You look... just like her.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.300
Emeliana: Ada.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.080
What's the current date and time?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.640
Ada: Earth date is March 22, 2103.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.040
The SUT is currently 954:34:54.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.400
Philip: What?

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.280
Emiliana: T- Two hours ago was when were were schedule to exit hyperlight.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.240
Philip: Heading where?

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.340
Did you activate your distress beacon?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.180
Philip: Of course I did, it's protocol.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.440
That's, that's why we came here - to respond to a distress beacon.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.060
Philip: Christ!

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.380
Emiliana: When... When our Solis arrived yours was already here.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.540
And we can't be in the same place at the same...

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.460
That's why you, the um...

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.900
The other you has no vitals because in this reality you're already here.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.580
And I'm ok because I'm dead.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.380
Emiliana: I'm so sorry.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.940

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.480
...you and he...

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.200

Emiliana: Ok.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.360
Philip: Alright I'm gonna go hack away at the CPU.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.460
I think the uh, next thing you were planning was uh...

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.040
you were gonna go check out the shore controller.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.980
Ok.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.420

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.460
It's not communicating with anything on the ship.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.520
Yeah, I know.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.640
I'm gonna try some mods.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.460
Who knows if any of them work.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.760
Ada, where are my quanter tools?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.300
