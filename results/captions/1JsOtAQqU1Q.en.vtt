00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.629
Three women who came they've been held
as slaves in a home in London for at

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.669
least Thirty years have been rescued by
the Police. They're described as a 69

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:22.239
year old Malaysian woman, a 57 year old,
aged 69 year old from Malaysia, a 57 year

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.119
old from Ireland, and a 30 year old
British woman were all rescued. All three

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.739
women were highly traumatized and were
taken to a place of safety where they

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.860
remain. We have seen some cases where
people have been held for up to 10 years

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
but we have never seen anything of this
magnitude before. Thank you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.510
It's, you know, it's kind of impossible to
believe that something like that could

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.170
happen. Well i didn't know nothing about 'til
i read it in the papers that he was like keeping

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.489
them as slaves or brainwashing them or 
what, you know. But I didn't know nothing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.470
about it. When I first heard this strange
and intriguing story, I wanted to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.000
discover how this could have happened
right under our noses in the heart of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450
London.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.940
It's only now, three years after the
women emerged from captivity, that I've

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.820
been able to piece together a full
account of this extraordinary story.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.920
He's 'God', he rules the world, he's immortal

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.050
and he's our leader and teacher and we just have
to obey him otherwise we will die.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.310
The first contact with the women was
made by a charity who rescued them from

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.390
a flat in Brixton in South London. We got
there about 11:05 because there was a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.269
window of opportunity when the people
who weren't in the house.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:28.910
And sure enough these women all come out
at exactly 11:15 sharp. Coming up

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.720
in the car somebody wanted to know why
the cars coming towards us had white

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.220
lights - That was Aisha - and the cars in front of us
had red lights. Do you want to know why that was.?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.459
In the immediate aftermath none
of the agencies involved knew what they

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.349
were dealing with. So the women were
spirited away to Leeds where they could

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.860
be protected from the press and the public.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.920
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.010
Yvonne Hall and Gerard Stocks run an
organization helping people who've been

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.150
trafficked and enslaved.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.010
They took the three women under their
own roof and were the first to realize

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.230
the full extent of what had taken place.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.840
The 69 year old Malaysian woman seen
here on the left is Aisha. The 57 year

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.750
old Irish woman on the right is Josie.
And the 30 year old is Katie. When she

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.580
first came, yeah she was 30 years old in
the way we measure age, but she wasn't.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.450
She was much probably nearer to 10 or 11 
or something like that, again I'm not a

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.750
psychologist but I didn't think that
would be accurate from what other people...

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.130
I would even go in further, i would say she was
10 or 11 in her ability to communicate

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.360
verbally, but in her ability to actually
do practical daily tasks, I probably drop

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.459
it back down to maybe six stroke seven.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.349
It became clear that Katie had been born
in captivity and had never known any

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.860
other life

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.390
She had never been to school and had
only rarely left the house. After much

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:30.970
delicate discussion Katie finally agreed
to an interview. Did you ever go to the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:43.990
dentist or the doctor?  No. Not allowed.
And why was that.?  I guess he, i guess

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.370
he didn't want anybody to know of my
existence, that was part of it, but he

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.960
also used to say that "NHS means
'Never Helps Self' " So we should, if we get

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:08.680
ill, you have to focus on him and then
we'll get better as if by magic.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.200
Good evening and welcome to the BBC's News at 6

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.190
The couple suspected of holding three
women as slaves for more than 30 years

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.380
have been named as Aravindan
Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda. The BBC

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.250
understands that both were leading
figures in a far-left communist faction

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:31.840
based in Brixton in South London in the
1970s. Up in Leeds the women began to talk

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.570
about life in what they termed 'The
Collective'. They referred to Balakrishnan

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.270
as 'Comrade Bala' or A.B., and
revealed that he had had control over

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.340
every aspect of their lives. He had
threatened and terrified them claiming

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.470
to have an invisible all-powerful machine 
at his disposal which he called "Jackie".

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:07.410
Tell me about Jackie, what does
Jackie stand for?  Jehovah Allah Christ

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:16.180
Krishna and Immortal Easwaran.
And what was Jackie?  It's Bala's mind-control machine.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.270
Who controls everything in nature and

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.420
everything in the world. And what would he
say that Jackie would do to you if you

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:36.160
did the wrong thing or stood up to him
or.? Kill you or cause you terrible harm

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.430
 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.900
'Jackie' came up a lot with all three
people. And even now I would

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.850
suggest that two of the three absolutely
are definitely very scared of Jackie, that

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:11.840
Jackie's going to take revenge at some point.
Are they leaflets about comrade Bala yeah?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.310
Despite having voluntarily
left The Collective, Josie Herival has

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.360
spent the last three years on a one-woman
mission to clear Balakrishnan's name.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:32.780
Thank you very much.  Are you and others
also fighting?, are you part of the campaign with

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.960
other people as well? Absolutely! We are showing solidarity with all of the people who are suffering under

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.180
the British State you know. US-led British state.
It's a slave of America.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.780
Britain is a slave of America.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.640
And how is comrade Bala?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.980
No No! I'm not being interviewed, Ok, I don't
to be interviewed. She declined to take part in this film

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:04.300
declaring the BBC, "a tool of the
British fascist state".  In the one

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.630
interview she gave to Channel 4 News
in 2015 she gave her view of Jackie. What

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:18.370
I understand about it is, it's it's a
machine, you know, electronic machine

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:25.300
which helps people to do good you know.?
But he has talked about people dying as a

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:31.000
result of that machine - Yeah - Do you
believe that?  I do, yeah. That he had

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.390
the power to make somebody die.?
Yes.  With Jackie's help - Balakrishnan

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.700
controlled the world from inside the
flat. He took credit for all global

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.940
events, including wars and natural disasters.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:09:00.000
Everything that happened outside, like
earthquakes and hurricanes, he claimed

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.510
was a consequence of a lack of
discipline or misbehavior by his

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:11.700
followers inside. We asked that space
shuttle Challenger it was meant to have

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:20.970
blown up when he said that people were
challenging him in the house, and the

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.970
shape was like a 'Y'. When the shuttle
blew up it was like a 'Y'. So he used to say

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:34.880
it's because people are VYING with him.
So the 'Y' there like that in the sky.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.900
The Collective lived at numerous
addresses in South London over the 40

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:52.529
years of its existence. At one address,
a pizza delivery boy rang their bell by mistake.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:57.480
So Bala said that this was the fascist

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.580
state trying to provoke him. What, by
bringing the pizza? Yeah by bring the

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:10.500
pizza and disturbing him and disturbing
what he was doing. So then the same day

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:19.920
there was an earthquake in Kobe
in Japan, which meant that, 'Kobe'

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:34.680
means 'gods door', that's what he said. So he said when there was a knock on god's door...

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.890
Sort of crazy, but yes. Go on, finish that thought,
so when there was a knock on god

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.950
door, then there's this huge earthquake
in Kobe to punish the fascist state for the

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:52.709
fact that the pizza delivery man 
came to God's door. Bala's door?

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:55.070
Bala's door.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:07.490
When I was asking her about some of the
strange theories that Balakrishnan had - she laughed -

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.540
she would laugh. - Yes she would have done. It's not because she thinks it's funny,
it's because she's really

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.160
embarrassed or really pressured. It's a
really important thing to know when if

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.000
you're asking a question to isn't it
really because a lot of people will see the

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.990
laugh and think, 'Oh! she thinks it's funny',
whereas really, she the, at,

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.460
she's in distress at that point.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:35.060
Using Jackie as his tool, what was his plan, to become
the ruler of the world?  Yes, or he used to say, to

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.770
become the overt ruler of the world, he was
already the ruler of the world, but then

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.630
he has to become overt, that's what
he used to say. So he was the covert ruler

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:50.570
world at this point? Yes. Yep.
Inside the flat. Yep. And and and he

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.500
was going to becoming overt ruler. Yes. And
how was that going to happen, what was

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:00.890
going to happen that suddenly would mean
that the whole world would obey him.?

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:08.090
He never exactly said. He was going to take
over the universe after the world. And to

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.120
see if she could eventually take over
the world, I believe the country that

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.990
was mentioned was Brazil. She was going
to get Brazil as a starter to see if she

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:23.540
could control that okay. I know. So that
she was being primed for ruler of Brazil?

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:30.080
Yeah. Why Brazil, i've absolutely no idea. Does she know, had she been, does she know

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.200
much about Brasil? I don't know. I don't think so.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:13:02.390
He walked into my life, and now he's taken over.
--- It all began in 1976 when Balakrishnan

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:08.780
founded his Maoist collective. The workers Institute of Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.200
thought was on Acre Lane in Brixton
in South London

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.670
His group included his Tanzanian wife
Chanda,

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:28.360
her disabled sister and about 15 core
followers, most of whom like him was

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.350
student from Asia.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:39.250
One of them, Aishah Wahab, has never
spoken to the media before. She had come

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:48.670
from Malaysia at the age of 24 to study
Quantity Surveying. I was really inspired

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:58.690
by him you know, and I thought he he was
great, you know, to have been able to know

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:08.560
clarify our minds as to what to do with
our lives really. Were you happy living

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:18.579
in The Collective Aishah.?  Yes I
thought every day was very interesting

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:25.060
and I was never ever bored. There's
always something new to learn. There's

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:35.459
something new to do I mean everything
was, I just can't imagine I would have

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:39.839
had a better life than that.

00:14:44.589 --> 00:14:50.300
Also in the group were two middle-class
British women. Josie who was studying

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.880
Music when she met Balakrishnan. And
Sian Davis, a postgraduate student at the

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:04.089
London School of Economics. I was
particularly intrigued by Sian's story.

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:10.459
How did you know Sian.? I was at school
her. And what school was it.? It was

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:18.560
Cheltenham Ladies College. She was academic
I think she was quite profoundly

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.790
academic in a funny way, it wasn't
necessary the type of academia that

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:30.000
passed exams of a very high level at that
stage, but she was a deep thinker.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.149
Oh well we used to see them down on the
market place. We used to have

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.779
our paper sales there, and other groups
did as well - it is a bit of a crowded market

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:58.190
- and these guys would turn up. And they didn't have a paper to sell, but they

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:04.550
used to hand out leaflets. And we used to
collect them because they were sort of like

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:09.290
the comic relief. And we popped down
the pub afterwards for a pint and we

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:17.000
just roar with laughter at what the Workers
Institute had to say. The Communist Party

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.319
of China and Chairman Mao are on the
verge of launching the final offensive

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:27.740
this year. Dismantled the old world of
colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.880
and build a new world of Socialism.
And then in emphasis,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.130
Eternal glory to our great leader and
teacher Chairman Mao Tse-tung upholds

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.829
proletarian internationalism. There we are.

00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:58.370
I have one specific memory of her which is
probably the last time I saw her I can't

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.260
be sure of that, but I think it probably
was when she invited me for dinner. She

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.650
had her boyfriend Martin there.
And she was dressed in, dressed like a

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.510
Maoist, with the blue and the
collar and the whole dinner

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:24.829
we had the Chinese Communist
radio playing. And she talked to me,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.820
well the way she talked to me I didn't know
who she was. She had become a communist

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.010
in the way she was talking to me, she she,
there was nothing of her coming through

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:39.530
at all by this stage that's what I would
say, it was quite scary. I didn't like

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.010
being there, it was too late. I had to
stay the night. She didn't want to

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.120
give me a bed because I wasn't a
communist but I got a mattress

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.820
eventually, and I'm afraid the next
morning I just ran away.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.270
 

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:08.419
One of the things that is interesting is
that the Workers Institute was probably

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:12.559
unique among the groups of the far left
in that they didn't see themselves as

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:17.840
being in the business of creating a
revolution. They saw their role as

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.360
preparing the population in the
imperialist heartlands as they referred to

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.650
Brixton, London, Britain - for liberation by
the Chinese.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.600
Did they put or set a date when the Chinese
Liberation Army was going to do this.?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:48.140
End of 1977. And so very early in 1978
I had a conversation with several of them,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.130
their members at the time, expressed my
disappointment that I had not been

00:18:52.130 --> 00:19:00.050
liberated from capitalist oppression as
they had predicted. And they said that

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:05.840
the computer satellites got so good that
actually the Chinese do already control

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.370
everything in the world, but they realized
that you can't hand people Socialism on

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.270
a plate, they need to learn to struggle
for themselves. So they have actually

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.230
taken over everything but they're
leaving the appearance of Capitalism in

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:27.740
place so that people can actually have
this experience of liberating themselves.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:36.740
The idea was that the Chinese Red Army
would come and liberate the UK within a

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:44.330
year,  that's what Bala expected, you
remember that? Yes. So you're waiting for

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:52.300
that to happen? Yes, it didn't happen.
It didn't happen did it?  Yes

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:09.530
I came across Aravindan Balakrishnan in
the mid-seventies. It was my formative

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:14.500
years as a police officer, I was a
uniformed police officer in Brixton.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:27.429
And it really was an age of lots happening.
There was anti capitalist marches.

00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:37.360
Whole environment like a cauldron of
demonstration. And in amongst all of that

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.360
appeared in these premises here in Acre
Lane what was called The Chairman Mao

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:52.100
Memorial Centre. And this was quite intriguing
even for those days and i decided to pay

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.690
them a visit one day. And I said to Balakrishnan "I'm going to be watching you"

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:05.320
And I'll be looking out every time I
come by what you're doing in here.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:14.220
The Workers Institute were raided, that was
very very rare, we were all surprised

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.990
considering these guys had no presence
anywhere and where we just like a nuisance

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:26.100
to the authorities on a non-political
nature. We the police got a warrant and

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:33.030
it's very telling we got that warrant under
the Misuse of Drugs Act because you know

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:39.090
our belief was these people were on some
form of drugs and the place was raided

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:48.960
by police, no drugs were found and it was
boarded up and closed down. And while

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.280
their view is going to be 'yes this is
the capitalist state closing us down',

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:00.780
while I'm sorry sometimes it needs a
hard hand. Well we call it trumped up charge,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:10.280
you see, the charge was about having
drugs, having and holding drugs and

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.680
consuming drugs as well.
So none of us even smoked cigarettes, so

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:25.230
we don't know anything about drugs. This
was seen as persecution, and as I

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:32.160
understand it that's when Balakrishnan
then withdrew into a much more almost

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.490
hermetic kind of environment with just a
very very small group of mostly female

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.000
acolytes

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.360
People would just say every so often,
whatever happened to the Workers

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.690
Institute? Because they suddenly
disappeared because they'd always be

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:54.900
there on the corner of Brixton, and then
suddenly disappeared and now we know

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.140
what happened - they went underground,
or what was left of them.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.200
By 1980, The Collective was living in
hiding and consisted of Balakrishnan

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:17.000
his wife and her sister and seven other
women including Sian, Josie and Aisha.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.090
Exploiting their isolation from the
world, Balakrishnan indoctrinated them

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:39.650
with increasingly strange ideas. Was it
your understanding that he was immortal?

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:53.420
Well he did say that and he did
repeat it again and again, and he also

00:23:53.420 --> 00:24:00.400
showed how it was possible for him to be able to.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:11.510
How did he show you that? Well you know
different things for example he never

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:18.230
believed in going to the dentist because
he said we should let the teeth drop naturally.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:24.890
Hello again. Hello. And then by the
time you're a hundred years the teeth

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.390
will regrow. Pleased to meet you.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.910
And then you have another set of teeth and
then when those drop you'll regrow again.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.760
 

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.670
You see you've lost quite a number of teeth over the years.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:50.000
We loose teeth. We wait until the teeth grow again.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.810
Until the tooth grows on its own.?
Yes. It will grow on its own, are 100 or over yes

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:02.800
It will grow back on its own? Yes. Have you ever heard of that, we have a lot of teeth growing back.?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.180
No. No. Well i've heard of it, It does happen, but I don't know if I'm going to be

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:14.010
even hundred years old, so.
Yeah yes you see sometimes its better to

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.050
keep what you have rather than wait
for. No No I don't loose my teeth on

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:24.450
purpose. No no no no. I don't know what
what our stories that let the teeth

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.560
fall by itself and it will grow up again. Who

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.700
who said this to you?  Somebody i know. Right.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.980
I suppose again you know from the
outside it does sound like you were

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:44.280
brainwashed what's your response to that
Aisha.? I think it's a question of being

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.590
wash, I quite agree.
I think they did the line that we were

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:57.780
given is that we do need to be our
brains didn't need to be washed because

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:08.160
it was you know it was dirty or mucky,
you know, whatever, it had to be washed of

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.880
all ideas. When you bring, you want to build a new world, you can't bring the old into it,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:22.530
the old you know into it so we have to chip
away the old and in place you can't

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:27.000
leave it blank
we have to fill the void

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:38.760
In 1983 Balakrishnan's socialist program
took a new and sinister direction. He

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:47.610
began an experiment which he called
'Project Prem'. When Katie was born did you

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:53.120
know who the father of the baby was.?  No.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:00.420
I did ask Sian, i said, because at first
when she was pregnant, we didn't know she

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.500
pregnant, well I didn't anyway, so I said
"Sian, you know, are you pregnant?",

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:13.770
because her tummy was going, because,
she says "No", l said why is you body like

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.200
this? So she said. 'You know A.B. said
some people do have it like this, that's

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.140
gas in the body' and and you know it gets
bigger and bigger so that's it. And

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:32.160
when Katie was born, I was really shocked.
Do you think Sian believed that, did she

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.570
know she was pregnant.? Maybe she didn't, I don't know, maybe she didn't either, you know.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:42.090
That must have been a real
surprise when, so she just had a big tummy

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:48.200
for whatever strange reason and then
suddenly a baby arrives.? That's right yes.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.180
I think he used to say that I was the
product of electronic warfare.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:07.610
His mind control machine Jackie
was meant to have got

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:15.650
Sian pregnant I suppose. Tell me what
name you were given at birth Katie.?

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:24.800
Prem Maopinduzi. The first name 'Prem'
is in Asian language it means 'Love',

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:34.940
and the second name is Swahili
it means 'Revolution'.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:41.300
So he meant 'Love Revolution' and I hated that.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:53.090
So you name is like an instruction. You must love revolution?
Yes. And we thought that when he rules the

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.700
the world that I meant to be
like a soldier for him or his mouthpiece.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:06.320
'Project Prem' was an experiment in child
rearing intended to eliminate the

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.500
nuclear family.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:16.310
Comrade Prem - as Katie was known - was
dressed in genderless clothing, was never

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:21.000
told who her parents were, and was raised
collectively by the group.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:38.480
It's a new way of looking after a baby, its
not done before. I am so used to babies

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.429
being held and cuddled and carried and
things like that.

00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:52.880
We were discouraged from doing those
things because -- I wasn't really clear

00:29:52.880 --> 00:30:03.950
exactly what what the correct lines were
but it meant to, um, you see the baby's meant

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:11.540
to be solid without any encumbrances
from anywhere else, you see, so we're just meant

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.760
to stand by him, herself.
I suppose that was the idea you know

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.410
that when you hold somebody or caress
somebody, there's a bonding

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:30.020
going on you, there's a bond
between baby and mother. But there wasn't

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.929
that encouraged in Katie.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.240
He was the only one who was meant to
cuddle me and no one else was meant to

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.420
because if I was to cuddle other people, he
used to say that that's being about being

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:55.730
a lesbian to cuddle other women. When
Katie was born there was plenty things I had

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:02.660
to question and this was one of them
about treatment of Katie, disciplining of

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:10.010
her, and there was a discipline on me as
well, there was once when Katie wets

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:17.960
herself, and she was only four, and you
know she was denounced and I was

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.880
denounced as well for letting her wet,
and I was so angry about it,

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:29.390
i really felt like running out the house
at that time but I didn't, I tried hard

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:35.300
not to because then I could see that if
I had gone out I had nobody outside.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:43.500
I lost contact my family, I had no money, I
had no job and I might have been deported.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.280
They were strange. If you see
them on the street, even shopping,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.650
they never say 'hello'. They just
go straight in out, yeah. If I'm in

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:02.420
the garden, they're upstairs, if they see
anyone out, see - if you look up they close

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.740
the curtains, so you don't actually see who's looking.
What do you think they were

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:12.350
unusual neighbours? I think they were just
refugees, - and lived there.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.830
Or they were hiding from somebody, never
speak. But one look like she looked like

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:27.470
English, but the others look like Chinese
or Filipino whatever. But one - she's tall

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:33.380
and rest short. The garden was overgrown,
it must have been 3 - 4 foot all the time

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.980
since them people left, and it was the same
with the front of the house. He would never

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.040
cut anything, he would always tie the
stuff back, just enough to get the wheelchair in &amp; out.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.620
And the whole garden was
covered in weeds.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.059
Curtains were never opened at any time
at all front or back of house, the only time

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:49.970
you see them was sometimes at their back
when their little girl when she would turn round

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.890
pop the head of pop back down again.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.130
Is it disturbing to you Peter to think that
there was a child being held captive

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.180
next door.? I mean I've been talking to
yourself now especially bringing a lump to the throat.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:23.660
What aspect of it is upsetting for
you Peter? It's just the thought of what that

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.750
child has gone through at the time I
just didn't do anything about it. I mean

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:32.420
and i'm so sorry i let it. Again I didn't know
what was happening but if I did, I'd

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.400
definitely would have done something about it.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:53.030
One night 1996 there was screaming in the
middle of the night and subsequently I

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:58.630
learned that Sian had tried to stab
herself with a knife.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.669
And then on the early morning of
Christmas Eve - again there was

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:11.460
screaming and shouting in the middle of the
night, so I went downstairs with Aisha

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:20.399
who I was sleeping with and found Sian's.
Sian was lying on the floor and she had

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:26.569
been tied up her hands and legs were
tied and she was gagged.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.619
And she had this piece of cloth in her
mouth - it was a sock or something

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:40.260
i don't know. And O &amp; Josie were both holding
her down on the floor and they had tied

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:50.490
her up. And Bala and Chanda were both
shouting at her. She had tried to run out,

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:55.619
that's why she was tied up, she knew
things he was hard to live with me as I

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:59.550
was trying to escape, and then because
she couldn't escape that way that's why

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.830
she went out through the window
thinking she could escape that way she

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.500
had lost her mind by that time.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:22.950
A.B. said that she fell, he started from the beginning to say that she fell you know because of the

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:29.750
nature of the bathroom, so I just stuck
to that.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.140
Having fallen from the bathroom window
Sian was taken to hospital where she

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:47.340
fell into a coma and died seven months
later. There was an inquest after Sian's

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:52.950
death. And at that inquest you were asked
whether she had any children? Yes. And you

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:59.160
said no? No yes. Why was that your
response? Because A.B. said to do so.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:06.960
Because we definitely didn't want
Katie to be taken away and then live a

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:16.940
life as of old, you know, and not participate
to build a new society.

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:30.599
At the time of the inquest, a journalist
visited The Collective and had an

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:36.989
exchange on the doorstep with Josie,
Aisha, and a third woman Oh Kareng, who was

00:36:36.989 --> 00:36:49.319
also from Malaysia. the colloid bomber
policy we're calling open I expect on

00:36:49.319 --> 00:36:56.539
you we speak the common ballot we don't
wish oh yeah are you playing in the fun

00:36:56.539 --> 00:37:03.690
everything that people really good job
you guys seem pretty likely we should be

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:09.900
why one discrete actually please could
we speak to Col rosada

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:24.329
Sian died when Katie was only 14. After she died, did
life get better or worse for you.?

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:31.729
Life got better for me in a funny way I mean
because she was one of the worst, like

00:37:31.729 --> 00:37:41.459
servants of Bala. So it was such a relief
with her not there. Because of his worse

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:47.569
enforcer had gone.? Yes his worse enforcer had gone. Yes.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.160
 

00:37:55.090 --> 00:38:02.430
Life may have improved, but the unbearable
tyranny of Project Prem continued.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.490
 

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.970
 

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.260
 

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:23.690
He used to say that everything would go
against me if I had done wrong. So like

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:29.190
possibly the light shouldn't work,
or the taps shouldn't work because

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:37.500
everything is controlled by him, by
Jackie, his mind control machine. So if I

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.550
went to the bathroom and turned the tap on,
it shouldn't work because I had done wrong

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:48.510
and then when I went to the bathroom and
the tap DID work, Oh the tap! - your on

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:55.100
my side! Thank you! And then I kissed tap
and hugged the toilet when the flush worked

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.640
I used to look forward to the clocks changing

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.290
when they used to go forward in
March or go backwards in October because

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:22.500
that made things a bit different get
darker or lighter in the evenings.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:39.300
In 2004 Comrade Oh who had been with Balakrishnan since the Seventies had an

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:51.119
accident in the kitchen. I think she
banged her head and she collapsed

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:58.800
and she was shouting 'call the
doctor'. Bala and Chanda kept harassing

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.579
her as she was collapsing and she was
ill and kept saying ... talking

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:09.810
talking talking to her and try to force
her to answer questions, and she couldn't

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:15.180
answer because she was she was dying
really and then they started saying to

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.730
her stop throwing a tantrum, nobody bangs
their head and refuses to talk and things

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:32.550
like that. But she was actually unable to
to talk because she was, she had a stroke

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:37.220
and then the next day she died.

00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:47.539
By now two comrades had died and three
other women who had been with the group

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:55.489
since the 1970s had chosen to leave. The
Collective had dwindled to just six.

00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:59.299
Balakrishnan, his wife Chanda, her sister and Katie, and

00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:08.479
only two remaining followers, Josie and Aisha. Josie and Aisha were required to do

00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:16.069
all the housework. And The Collective
depended financially on Chanda's carer's

00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:24.529
allowance and her sister's disability
benefit. Balakrishnan continued to

00:41:24.529 --> 00:41:33.079
frighten the few remaining members of
the household into staying. He also used to say

00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:40.160
that, if I defied him and just wanted to go
out on my own, then either there will be

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:47.210
a lightning will strike me dead or blow up
 because of spontaneous human combustion

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:58.000
That you would spontaneously combust? Yes. Or explode?

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:06.650
To me that idea that someone would
spontaneously combust if they left their

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:13.910
flat is complete nonsense to me in my
worldview. Now that you're out and living

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:22.430
your own life, can you see that that
sounds like nonsense.? Well I can see

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:29.809
that it can be as nonsensical, but
there is such a thing as spontaneous

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:39.289
human combustion. I've read about it in two
or three different places, so I have an

00:42:39.289 --> 00:42:41.400
open mind about that

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:52.900
But as to whether A.B. can induce it as
and when we wants, that's a different issue.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.720
 

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.140
 

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.670
In 2005 at the age of 22,
having never gone outside on her own

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.910
and despite believing she could be
killed by Jackie

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:24.340
Katie decided to take the risk and made
a break for it.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:35.720
How did you get out of the house? By the
back door. And then just carrying lots of

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:43.580
bags and things. And somebody saw me and said, do you need any help your bags?

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:52.430
so I said no but i've run away from home,
so they said so I said what do i do?

00:43:52.430 --> 00:44:02.750
they said go to the police station, so I
did. Tell me what happened when you entered

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:14.830
the police station? So they persuaded me to let
them call Bala and so then he came

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.690
Balakrishnan reassured the police that
all was well and took Katie back to The

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:26.900
Collective where she remained in
captivity for another eight years.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:39.740
A.B. did say that he likes to discuss things and
query things, why things are done like

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:50.200
this or like that, but he says that if it's
gone more than two or three times and he

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:58.390
he resorts to, you know, slapping you, or
you know, on the face you see and

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:05.840
something sometimes other parts as well,
so he yes it did happen, it did took place.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:15.000
So you were beaten? I was, Yes. Was
everybody beaten? I would have thought so. Yes

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:24.830
These are outrageous allegations
everywhere within every if anybody know or humiliate anybody know I dishing out
the thirty board he didn't do that to me

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:30.820
and yeah you never saw anything like no
I didn't

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.440
Every aspect of life in The Collective
was neatly timetabled and logged in

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:46.000
handwritten rotas, including Balakrishnan's
baths and meals

00:45:55.619 --> 00:46:01.440
But over time the daily schedule evolved.
Previously only Balakrishnan and his

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.359
wife had had access to the television
but now all the comrades were allowed to

00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:13.710
watch selected programs including the 6
o'clock news. Would you discuss the news

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:19.109
with him, would you discuss world events
with him? He would discuss with us. So he

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:24.299
would talk and you would listen.? Sounds like
there wasn't much discussion because

00:46:24.299 --> 00:46:29.220
discretion means people exchanging ideas.
That's right. But actually he talked and

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:34.519
you listened naturally there's no
discussion about no

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:47.380
In her late twenties, Katie suffering
from undiagnosed diabetes began to

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:53.010
rapidly lose weight. Terrified that a
third member of The Collective might die,

00:46:53.010 --> 00:47:01.460
Josie committed to memory a helpline
number she'd seen on the news.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.290
the BBC action itv recorded information

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:12.270
Josie saved money in secret smuggled a
mobile phone into the flat and in

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:19.500
protracted discussions with the helpline
put together an escape plan it was

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.730
arranged that Katie and Josie would leave
when Balakrishnan and Chanda were out

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:24.230
shopping

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:35.000
So 11:15 sharp, we left, Josie and me
with our trolleys.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:43.890
I had no intention of leaving you know in fact
leaving the collective for me was really

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:50.460
sort of like breaking my heart really
but I could see that she needed help

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:55.020
so you know she asked me to go with her
so I agreed to do it

00:47:55.020 --> 00:48:05.130
i regret it very much now but at that
time I didn't think that it will all

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:08.060
blow up like it did

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:15.210
As Katie and Josie made their way to
freedom, Aisha choose to stay in the

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:25.490
collective and was there when Balakrishnan and Chanda came back

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:36.120
He was denouncing Katie and Josie and
saying that now they have jointed British

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:43.290
fascist state and all these things so
time for lunch were actually a good

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:49.020
lunch so we said we were seated sitting
down to have lunch when the police came

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:59.640
a to the police I come with them but as
I was coming out I saw Chanda and one

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:11.030
day I went and hugged them whatever I
you know my misgivings I have them leave

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:18.740
the other last time I saw the motion
that's our memories very sad for you

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:26.000
tree that very sad for you when you
remember that you look upset about it

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.130
emotion so if you've been with them for
forty years so and they were like family

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.940
really you

00:49:57.579 --> 00:50:02.269
in the course of the police
investigation all charges against Bala

00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:06.679
Krishna's wife Chanda were dropped but
new charges were brought against Bala

00:50:06.679 --> 00:50:12.649
Krishnan himself it emerged that as well
as having had sex with Sean Bala

00:50:12.649 --> 00:50:18.139
Krishnan had sexually abused two other
women over a period of years both of

00:50:18.139 --> 00:50:28.269
whom had fled the collective by the
early 19th the first incident with MS a

00:50:28.269 --> 00:50:35.569
was when she was called into mr. Bhalla
Krishna's bedroom it had never happened

00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:46.489
before she didn't know why and without
warning he kissed her mr. Bala Krishnan

00:50:46.489 --> 00:50:55.819
then began to summon is a to his bedroom
and where the sexual abuse that had

00:50:55.819 --> 00:51:05.329
begun with a kiss then became a more
extreme in nature and became sexual

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:13.819
abuse involving oral sex forcing her to
perform oral sex upon him and thereafter

00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:21.999
of sexual intercourse rape the serious
sexual abuse of that type continued and

00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:31.519
involved in addition the defendant
ordering her to lick his anus she did as

00:51:31.519 --> 00:51:39.009
she was ordered notwithstanding the
distress that plainly she was exhibiting

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:48.760
one of the women who testified in court
that when she tried to leave this woman

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.330
a were special scored in court when she
tried to leave

00:51:52.330 --> 00:52:02.110
she said that Shawn and O and Josie and
you all held her down while Bala beat

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:12.190
her is that true
cause I don't think I was there I mean I

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:18.570
might have been there but not holding
her down like that for a B to beat her

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:27.520
son but in another way if that was true
I shall would you feel able to tell me

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:35.140
or would it be too shameful I would tell
you if I had done it you know I would

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:41.050
also be able to tell you why I did it
but it was against me to do it it was

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:49.290
against my instinct to do it you know so
that means she's lying she might have

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:54.160
she might have thought I was there
because all three of them you know if it

00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:01.150
Shawn Yoshi and O was hooking her down
and I was there she might thought that

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:07.600
was also picking a ton I doubt that even
three of them there you don't need three

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:14.440
people to you know maybe just Shawn was
working it down because a B doesn't need

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:23.460
anybody to be holding anybody for her in
to you feel smack on the face

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:50.329
and from the spell of of the cult Haifa
is now 72 and is living in sheltered

00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:58.910
housing what any aspect of fallows
political experiment with any aspect of

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:11.059
that success would you say I think that
the issue about loving somebody was not

00:54:11.059 --> 00:54:22.130
your own I think that is the success
that every child has the right to live

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:30.140
properly to be loved to be cared you see
there's a contradiction Eliza because

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:41.240
Tyler's gone to prison for abusing Katie
yes but I mean we now know how cake

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:49.150
cakey felt a party and individual we
know not to do that

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:58.770
if you can't find a new weight and you
carry on with the old I suppose but

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:06.539
surely the old hasn't worked so we still
have to find what respective

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:21.710
katie is doing her best to leave the job
of her past behind she's attending

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:26.450
college and has recently moved out of
supported accommodation into a flash of

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:33.920
her own when she first came yeah she was
30 years old in the way we measure age

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.090
but she wasn't me she was much probably
nearly to 10 or 11 or something like

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:42.800
that but we've almost seen this journey
through the ages of thinking and I think

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.770
she's getting very close to a numerical
edge now
