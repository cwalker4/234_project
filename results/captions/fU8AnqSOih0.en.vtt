00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.809
Two and a half years ago during my very first visit in India I spent two days walking all around the slums of Mumbai and

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.540
Even though I got to learn so much about the life

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.059
And the slums I didn't really have the chance to live

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.570
Inside the slums and so I left with more questions than answers

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:22.109
So now that I came back to India for the second time I decided to go back to Mumbai and actually spend five days

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.160
Living inside the adi, which is one of the largest slums in the world

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.949
This is how it looks?

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.799
At the end of the 19th century that IV was a sparsely populated village inhabited by coldy fishermen

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.649
Then the slums were established in 1882

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.119
During the British colonial era and grew exponentially fast due to the expulsion of various polluting industries from downtown Mumbai

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.039
Throughout the years millions of people have reported to Mumbai from rural India in search of a better future

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.959
And some of them settled in Dharavi this led to the local population being incredibly diverse in their religions cultures and languages

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.299
These days that I've is one of the largest slums in the world housing up to a million people

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.779
Since there's very little government regulation it has become a hub for entrepreneurs and in place of incredibly cheap labor

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.459
It is estimated that the annual turnover of Dharavi some around a billion u.s.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.309
dollars with most of their goods being exported overseas

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.570
In the 21st century the Ravi has become a topic of interest in mystery for

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.739
Millions of people due to the publicity to received from movies like Slumdog Millionaire and books like Shantaram as for me

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.829
I'm not a scientist or a researcher of any kind

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.129
I simply wanted to learn more about what life was like in the slums of Mumbai. I knew I would find this experience

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.759
I open it. I just couldn't have predicted how much

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.040
It is 12 p.m.. In Mumbai a few kilometers away from the slums

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.859
And I'm finally going there so my friend who lives in the slums. Who's called Praveen is already waiting for me

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.889
I'm gonna pack my stuff and take a back seat to meet him

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.379
It's been almost two years since I last saw Praveen and I was incredibly happy to finally meet him again

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.710
Yeah

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.290
brother

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.609
Once we met we started exploring the slums right away and made our way to one of the biggest markets in all of that that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.289
Was completely packed with people there's literally thousands of people buying and selling stuff

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.890
There's kids going home from school. There's all the vegetables fruits clothing electronics and everything else you can imagine

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.279
It didn't seem like all the food stalls were properly sanitized

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.839
But the locals told me the products were fresh so I dug in walk garden for 15 euro cents. That's a good deal

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.670
Then we kept on exploring other areas of that, I'll be passing through dozens of tiny crowded lanes

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.299
I'm gonna try playing cricket for the first time in my life right now

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
right here

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.299
After a couple of hours in the slums I asked permian if I could use the bathroom somewhere

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.280
He said no problem, bro

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.140
And we ended up here in those houses these houses these houses

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.209
Or these house people don't have any toilet

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.828
So everyone just crosses this sheet and goes to the bubble toilets right there every single day over

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.649
2,000 people used this public toilet, and it cost only 5 Euro cents to get it they have toilets on both sides

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.409
This side right here

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420
Every single door has a different toilet

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.720
It turned out the day I arrived to Dharavi was a really important celebration across India called Guru, Poornima

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.519
It is an Indian festival dedicated to spiritual and academic teachers during which the students pay their respects and express gratitude

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.809
Praveen brought me to a tent where everyone was paying their respects to their spiritual teacher status fighting the atmosphere was really

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.849
Festive and everyone got as much free food as they wanted. I couldn't resist it, too

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.579
Which is like well here it became smart a single

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.860
Everyone was really excited that I came to the festival and they brought me on the stage which was quite a unique experience

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.189
Eventually, we hit the streets and spend hours parading all across the slums

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.090
the police have stopped the whole

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.170
Traffic in this intersection so that we could pass a little in the middle of the street and now the chorus goes together this card

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.359
And the procession will continue

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.799
Late at night pravin took me to the place that would become my home for the next five days

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.600
I finally go to the place where I will be saying for the next five days. It looks like a proper slum

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.380
There's many small houses a lot of moist dark lanes

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.319
Sometimes there's some lighting, but not always

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.119
Yeah, yo Praveen

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.069
I'll wait I need to leave money wishes

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.849
It is already 11 p.m.. At night, so I guess it's the end of the first day of me being in the slums

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.389
But so far has been awesome right now. Just go straight to bed

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.799
I'll try to wake up early next morning to once again explore as much as I can

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.850
This morning I went downstairs and everyone was taking a bath

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.240
And then my host said so where do you want to take a bath?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.079
I said I don't know I'm too lazy to think about and then he said no no no no

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.329
If you live in the slums you have to take a bath every single day no exceptions

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.689
So I guess it's time for my morning bath they

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.500
Start with a pina

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.499
Fresh feeling of freshness and

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.920
For your head you guys use like a shampoo

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.010
After the shower we had a quick breakfast and continued exploring that Island that day Praveen wanted to show me the only

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.529
Non-urbanized place in the slums, so we walked at the edge of the lobby and hopped into his friends Pratt

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.570
How do you like it Praveen?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.300
It's good

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.410
Good you want to swim you want to go swimming

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.760
Well hater ha ha

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.659
Some minutes later. We arrived to this really tiny fishermen's village where we met up with a few more praveen's friends

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.330
We just came to some small island and look at the color of that water. It's even more interesting hey

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.340
We have a floating platform right here

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.480
Then a bathtub right there. It didn't take me long to understand

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.899
Why this place was so incredibly important to Praveen and his friends?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.690
It was their only get away from the hustle and bustle of life in Dharavi now. We're going to some sort of another swamp

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:37.299
That's much bigger than this one apparently and also Praveen told me that no foreigners have ever

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:44.890
Visited this place only the local people who who live in these tiny houses or our huts

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.830
Somewhere somewhere there, that's that is garbage

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.970
That's that is

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.339
Relatively clean water so they have this water drainage system

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.980
where basically the fish from this side they cannot pass to that sides to the garbage and

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.009
The water level increases on that side the water without the garbage can flow to that side

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.790
Lucas's house, yeah

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.659
We have some images so that and for the yeah

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.850
Yeah, so they also sleep here or just rescue

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.490
Fish catching so they catch fish here

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:32.260
Here, and then the rest here the place wasn't the cleanest but the guys didn't seem to care all that much and made the best

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
of their time in the nature

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.369
The woman in the vote now has a helmet. Let's race guys who's gonna be first

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.670
Would you like to live here

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:57.010
This is a small island. They say it's the small Thailand right here

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:03.339
Coming here was like going into a time machine that took me hundreds of years back to the end of the 19th century

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.520
when that IV was just a group of tiny fishermen's villages housing only a few thousand families a

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.500
few hundred meters later

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.489
I was thinking back to the 21st century where I could see the mind-boggling

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:22.239
Contrasts between the fisherman's village the slums and the high-end office buildings that were so close to one another yet

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:29.830
So completely distant at the same time. This is still the swamp side. That's a super black river, and these are already the slums

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:34.449
Someone's building their house right now. We're so close literally 3 meters away

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.830
Though I don't think you can cross this part so easy

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.600
bye, bye

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.600
bye Hey

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.510
From then on I would wake up early every morning have myself a refreshing shower either inside or outside

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.640
Yes

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:08.219
Then I'd get something to eat and spend the whole day exploring throughout those few short days

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.640
We went absolutely

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.640
Everywhere from children's playgrounds to workshops where praveen's friends worked to busy

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.449
intersections and tons of other interesting places a couple of times

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:24.689
I borrowed my friend's motorbike and drove to a few of the many other slums in the area some didn't look that good

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.950
But others surprised me with incredible views well, Jess. It's one slum

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.299
That's just by the sea the sea is right here. The waves are really strong today

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.469
So apparently everything is wet even the walls of these houses

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:44.100
I didn't expect this but some of the slums we visited were so clean. They didn't feel like slums at all the slum

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.910
We're visiting right now is

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.830
extremely clean and

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.609
Every Hut is basically a house

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:57.239
So definitely look like Islam, it looks like a normal cute area the houses are color for that's a ping pong

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.530
That's a yellow one blue one the red one the orange one the other one

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:09.419
Though it--one and the best part is there's no smell it feels clean. It feels very beautiful very well preserved

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.880
We also checked out a few areas in the slums that the government redeveloped into proper apartment buildings

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.340
Just entered one of the houses apparently it's not allowed, but we're gonna transfer you stop. I don't know

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:34.520
Would you look at the view apparently this whole area used to be slams right now this part is to the Muslims

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.520
But everything around it became a building

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:43.339
so they would demolish the huts and these tiny buildings and build something like this and give everyone a flats and

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.829
The same thing happened here where I'm standing right now

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.810
This is a huge apartment building the UCB stands. No one can stop this love

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.859
One of those days Praveen told me we could go rooftop

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:03.110
At first it seemed a bit weird to randomly walk on people's roofs in the middle of the day

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.619
But Praveen told me no problem bro and off we went

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.729
Everyone thinks Hong Kong is the place to go rooftop in but it turns out into that I?

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:14.389
Look at this huge huge tree

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.060
There's room right out of the roof

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.810
There's a temple downstairs for hanging around on this roof

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.939
Next to the tree. I don't know how many roofs. We've been on, but it seems like 50 or more

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:33.020
there's hundreds and hundreds of huts all around this area and apparently can go on most of them as long as you don't break the

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.319
Roof because it's someone's house look at all of these houses

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:41.899
Everywhere in every single one of them. There are some people so here someone is drying their clothes

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.000
There someone's cooking. I think cuz I can smell it and in every single house

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.089
There's at least a few people right now and apparently there's someone down there. Also hello namaste namaste

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.089
On my last day that I had a super fun morning dance battle with perviness

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.359
Then we made our way to the local train station to check out how the

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.659
millions of people of the slums commuted to other areas of Mumbai

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.599
Every single day we're approaching the train station to take a train that crosses all of the Navi

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.839
It's only two stops, but we can see literally the whole swamp. There's the train. That's the cabin pretty packed

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:26.259
I would say how the chains beginning to move let her get these photos back. There's so many people outside

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.170
Today's my last day in the slums of Mumbai and as any

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:48.790
Sensible person would do I decided to get a clean professional shape for 30 US dollars chefs

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:00.670
I know this might look a little different from your ideal barber shop, but this guy was a total pro

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.550
He gave me proper clean shape in no time

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.239
We forgot those in fact in for good measure

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.280
Then everybody

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.250
Then ever grow

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.269
The five days that I lived in the slums of Mumbai opened my eyes in ways

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.129
I couldn't have imagined because they got to spend so much time with the local people who completely

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.860
transformed my outlook on what their lives were like

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.890
You see as most outsiders had a very distorted view of the people of Islamists

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.099
We grew up hearing stories about them dying on the streets

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.569
No one being able to read and write kids having to sleep, surrounded by flesh-eating brats

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:54.660
And so on there are of course tons of problems that need to be addressed especially when it comes to sanitation

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.119
for example sources say that in Dharavi

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.299
There is an average of one toilet for a thousand people also

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:07.649
Livestock general lives in the same quarters with people and that combined with the fact that the local water sources lack cleaning facilities

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.319
sometimes causes the spread of contagious diseases

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.930
I am obviously in no way knowledgeable enough to know of all the intricacies of life in the slums

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.439
However people there are just like everywhere else

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.939
They have their own dreams goals careers thoughts and emotions

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.320
They are no way different from the rest of us it is said that the Rob is the most

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.829
Entrepreneurial place in the world and I found that to be very much true

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.420
Most people I met had something going for them some were running their own workshops

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.999
Or small factories others had the restaurant shops or food stalls not only that a lot of the slum dwellers

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.049
actually work those big office buildings for various technology or financial companies and

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:49.719
Simply lived in the slums to save money on friends

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:56.199
Which is incredibly expensive in Mumbai there were some astonishing success stories to take my good friend shale ash

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.579
He was born and raised in Dharavi and started his online business at the age of 22

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.800
The business took off a few years later

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.569
And now Sheila's rents six figures online business employs 12 people full-time

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:15.549
Goes on vacation every once in a while and supports his whole family. It doesn't matter where we come from we are all equal

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.850
Some of us are born with golden spoons at our mouths others are not but that doesn't define us

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.149
What defines us is our pursuit of happiness our compassion for others and our ability to adapt to whatever?

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:31.029
Circumstances were in and make the best of them

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.740
You
