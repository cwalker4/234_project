00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.269
we last left you exploring San Diego
with our buddies tio Aventura since then

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.110
we hosted an impromptu meet up with an
amazing turnout from our beautiful

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.470
community what was supposed to end at
4:00 p.m. carried on well into the night

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.010
to recover from the party we swapped
tiny houses with Chase and Maria and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
tried out bus life for 24 hours after an
amazing week together it's time to say

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:41.640
hasta luego as we set our sights on
Mexico good morning friends here we are

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.420
on Fiesta Island Bec and I were just
saying how much this has felt like our

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
home when we go out and we do errands we
say to each other is it time to go home

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.789
and Fiesta Island is always hope and
it's like right in the heart of San

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.239
Diego it is truly the ultimate place to
live in a vehicle and we have the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.930
ultimate neighbors

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:33.570
sunshine it's probably locked
miggy's we need to be very intentional

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.570
that we don't get carried away with time
because it's very easy to lose track of

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.120
time here in teal Aventura it's so true
we were supposed to leave yesterday and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.490
now we're having coffee sitting on the
couch with my buddy very dangerous now

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.500
we do have to go we just say goodbye oh
girl yeah well you can drink your coffee

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:06.790

thank you I like yours too are you ready
for your 3 minute tour so this is a 1985

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.640
toyota dolphin the outside looks like
the 70 year old man I've always wanted

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.500
to be and they all updated I'm sure
because I don't really like looking that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.580
creepy all the time I'm always getting
like yeah but so the inside is nice

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.390
because everything is built in when I
bought it right like the plumbing and I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.480
have like a little bathroom shower thing
that I didn't really have to do much to

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.769
you update the plumbing because it's
from the 80s and like the beds there and

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.190
everything is kind of built the cabinets
are already built like I can do

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.630
cabinetry but I didn't want to so it's
kind of nice I just had like paint it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.930
all and spruce it up and make it a
little bit more main it was a little bit

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.050
more cost-effective I think my Instagram
is at Adventures underscore in

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.840
Huck underscore Finn and it's been like
dolphin so Phin n and I run a small

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.200
little business out of the here so if

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.460
Frank in our vlogs turning alleys dog

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.600
with the frisbee Mike do you want to
catch one frisbee for the vlog where do

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.430
we keep the frisbee huh in there okay

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.650
it's pretty easy to get distracted here
on Fiesta so we got to go we're gonna

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.500
pack up hit the road we got some things
we gotta get goin this morning

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.760
one of the big upgrades we've done for
Mexico is increase our storage so we

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.959
actually went to a luminous here in San
Diego and we've got two back bumpers

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.520
installed so we're able to fit like so
many chickpeas in our lives now and the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.470
problem the only problem is that to
access our back drawer now I have to go

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.820
out and around pull out the back bumper
and then pull out the drawer so I'm

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:42.380
gonna get my shower stuff from the back
drawer so beck says problem but I don't

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.419
see it as a problem it's an amazing
solution to increase storage and still

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.979
have access to your back doors so she's
struggling right now because she's never

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.650
had to open it but they're really quite
easy to open and here yeah you want to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:11.090
leave her out of climb this one and then
just pull now a project that want to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.180
finish today is organizing at all yeah
cuz we did get an extra fuel tank which

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.840
I need to mount we got these beautiful
max tracks so there's no excuses not to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.729
get to this spot which are basically
like truck tire tracks that you can put

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.419
in when you get stuck it's one of those
things that we're gonna say in a couple

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.530
of weeks we don't know how we ever lived
without these drawers I'm sure but it

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.770
also is gonna take a little bit of
getting used to and adjusting we're

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.149
gonna head in the planet fitness shower
up we'll see afterwards

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.840
we're almost ready to roll just on hold
here with the insurance provider heading

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.330
to Mexico make sure you get travel
insurance our credit card has actually a

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.350
really good insurance policy but it's
only for 25 days we got to extend that

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.230
we're having a little bit of food you
got to get some water and then we're

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:31.000
going to Mexico we're going to cross the
border babe okay see on the road next on

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.590
the to-do list is to fill up diesel now
one of our biggest concerns about going

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.900
into Mexico is that the diesel is not as
high-quality as you find in the rest of

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.880
North America
so we are also filling up a smaller sort

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.430
of supply of diesel so the tank plus our
little what do you call it a jerrican on

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.180
the back this is just a little 2 gallon
it's not a whole lot but in a sticky

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.810
situation it could really save your butt
can't really see what I'm feeling

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:12.160
did I pay for that yeah but maybe not
I'm gonna go pick up okay I don't know

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.880
if it's the coffee but I did pay boy I
don't know what's going on today

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.500
it's a Mexico goodness or something I
think you are nervous I do I get quiet

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.600
and I get not stressed but like I gotta
wash my hands okay so our friends the

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.470
mat knees recommended this taco joint
that's right oh yeah we could go for

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:40.890
tacos on a couple hours we put it in its
14 minutes from us it is crazy how close

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.990
we are to Mexico Diego did you tell them
that I went to get wax this morning no

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.330
oh well I went to get wax this morning
everybody and I was speaking to the

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:57.349
esthetician who's a local San Diego
it's not the word and she's never driven

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:02.870
across to Mexico I hope that baja bound
and this series can show you guys that

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.719
Mexico has amazing amazing culture food
landscape to offer and maybe just maybe

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:12.699
you'll think about going there sometimes

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:38.180
oh you can go nope no she just goes for
the back door that's what I said

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:44.080
two metal boxes strapped to it but she
decides to open the back door

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.180
okay welcome to Mexico baby no no what
that's it dude

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.940
no maybe a hundred percent look Central

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:24.239
it's finally time break into the stache
ceremony let's see we're working with

00:09:24.239 --> 00:09:28.619
hair okay
we've been saving this last year what's

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:33.359
this 20 this is not gonna buy us tacos
whether we're hungry or not we're going

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:36.359
for some time might be the last
opportunity we have so we'll take it

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:39.749
we've been saying that for days now so
like while we're in San Diego we went to

00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:43.049
this vegan fast-food place and I kept
saying okay we should pick out and get a

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.899
milkshake and everything because this
might be the last vegan opportunity we

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:52.729
have to eat out so you know that's what
we're saying we got to stop saying that

00:09:54.889 --> 00:10:01.319
vegan Oh
see perfect so we got one of these they

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:06.149
really know it only cost us seven
dollars and fifty cents a pretty good

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:10.769
deal smells like corn jerky I'd just
like hmm

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:16.350
whoa that is class that's like a fish
taco

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:27.340
without further ado let's see all right
baby girl you're ready to roll you're

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:36.070
supposed to say yes we are going to try
to make it down towards Ensenada for the

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.730
evening
apparently there's a little spot where

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:49.590
you can dig out your own little hot cool
and that would sound right up my alley

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:04.779
you are going to fall hi you actually
don't need to get a registration because

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:09.279
unless you're planning a point where in
mainland so we're not a hundred percent

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:12.849
like we're probably going from man lamb
beef always get that not very crossing

00:11:12.849 --> 00:11:17.259
yeah so we're just gonna drive to Baja
no problem and you're always allowed to

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:20.739
come back up money if you go through
mainland then you do need to go for that

00:11:20.739 --> 00:11:33.339
registration as you probably saw if you
watched our hello Mexico series GoPro

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:40.239
off in thoroughly enjoying our scenic
road trip to Ensenada and we've arrived

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:46.509
in the main town area we've decided to
stop at the local Mart and pick up just

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:52.209
some stuff for breakfast and maybe a
little bit of dinner supplies my big

00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:57.149
fingers are crossed because we forgot to
get vegan mail for us famous

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:05.310
we might need one of you guys to
military how are you feeling I don't

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.540
know why I'm feeling just a little
anxious mm-hmm

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:17.940
I mean we're by ourselves this time
that's different it's a new country they

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.320
don't speak English it's okay yeah I
guess I think it's really good that you

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:30.920
you like share that because it's just
real it just takes some getting used to

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.870
going to the main grocery store yet
sorry Anna sorted yeah also Maria you'd

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:50.070
be proud I've been practicing me gusta
tu sonrisa a little bit more of a role I

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.200
think I'm working on it
to solve Lisa oh that's not very good

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.040
thank you
and so the hunt for vegan mayonnaise

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.350
begins
boy there's gotta be a vegan that lives

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:10.740
in Ensenada that's requested it for us
sugar don't fret friends even though

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.190
there is no vegan mayo we make a really
good chickpea salad sandwich with

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:21.060
avocado rice I heard it one of my
favorite parts about being back in

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:28.209
Mexico free entertainment free
entertainment on the intersection

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:49.990
highway welcome to our home for this
evening

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.800
typically Amon and I would look for a
place on Io Verlander that is either

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.209
free or free tonight we were just
feeling a little bit of culture shock

00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:02.529
like we talked about a little bit of
like we'd like to have a place that we

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:07.059
feel secure in that we could wake up and
do some like little modifications that

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:10.929
even wanted to do on the van before we
continue so also it's supposed to be

00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:15.369
really cool here is that low tide you
can walk out onto the beach and dig a

00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:21.040
hole and there's geothermal activity
under the water and you can build

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.149
yourself like a little hot tub so the
next one isn't until midnight if we're

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:29.499
still awake maybe we'll go out and show
you guys with our headlamps or 1:00 p.m.

00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:35.009
tomorrow didn't take long for the Sun to
go down here at La Jolla beach camp and

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:40.629
we're both feeling very very pooped it
was a mix of emotions Amon is feeling

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:46.749
the the stress again of just learning to
drive again here in Mexico and all that

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:52.389
sort of stuff right yeah just put the
drain on you like like this one police

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:56.529
caught like car like almost hit me and
then we're like driving this truck was

00:14:56.529 --> 00:15:00.160
like on the side and there's all these
potholes just like stress and tired

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.699
mm-hmm
and yeah just tomorrow's gonna be

00:15:03.699 --> 00:15:07.689
amazing
yes so I grew up in a house where if

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.499
you're feeling lazy you make popcorn for
dinner so I'm gonna make us a bowl of

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:15.970
popcorn we're gonna lie down just relax
spend some time together and we'll catch

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:21.480
you guys in the morning
mañana por la manana

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.240
good morning everybody good morning
everybody

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:42.300
I am feeling a lot better today I think
there was just a mix of emotions last

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.290
night and everything just in pot I piled
on itself just I think a lot of it had

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.210
to do with you know the uncertainty we
don't have a lot plan here in Baja and

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.940
then combined with we booked our travel
insurance and when you go through travel

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.750
insurance they start listing off all
these horrible things that can happen to

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.850
you so that was in my head and like when
I met Craig Craig was saying how much

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:15.060
security devices he has on his veins go
like this this VIPRE security system and

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.780
then one of those crossbars that goes
around the wheel and so I get into

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.700
Mexico and these guys start cutting you
off and they're driving fast and so I

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.110
was just highly highly stressed and
anxious and I'm sorry baby I did I took

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.220
it out on you a little bit but we woke
it up here on this beautiful beautiful

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.730
beach with the sun shining and we paid
for the campsite last night just to

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:45.750
insure we wouldn't get woken up and I
feel amazing good babe well you got to

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.870
tell them what you're most excited about
it's nothing to do with being in Mexico

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:53.030
I got a project I'll show you now

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:06.630
what I've done here they actually
modified this bungee I had an old bungee

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.290
that had plastic hooks on it they don't
want this straightening so I just cut

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.980
those off and use this rubber one which
is stronger so that's kind of how I've

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.480
got the top in there really so and then
these are the pegs that come for the max

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.170
tracks and it's nice because you can put
a padlock right on it so that's kind of

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.120
my security of course if someone wanted
them they could just cut them out but I

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.790
don't think anyone want not bad I
couldn't put another one on here but I

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:42.270
think that's pretty good dude
next project gas tank mounting this one

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.840
is just a big box
there's no shelves so for now we've got

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.700
extra food storage and the other one
that we actually got them to put shelves

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.780
in so they can have a little bit more
organization but I wanted to leave this

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.410
one open so it's a little bit more
versatile on what you could store

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:11.430
basically it's just a little acquire
right now grandpa Vecchio that's mounted

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:18.960
so basically it's just a plate and then
if you want to take it off you just pop

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:25.090
I could see this accessory business
getting very very addicting I'm like

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:30.780
already what's next
while I was out playing as Beck calls it

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:38.440
Beck was in here making a mess in the
kitchen by myself and I wanted to make a

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:47.320
nice awesome big field roast Apple sage
leaves a little bit more color so I'm

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:56.890
going to sprinkle some green onion on
top yeah all right good vibes vivvy good

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:02.350
vibes hey this is awesome
everything's perfectly cooked I'll give

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:11.260
this a solid 8.5 8.5 only so I think I
mentioned yesterday that at low tide

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.330
here at La Jolla Beach you can actually
dig yourself your own personal hot tub

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:21.820
so before yeah I wanted to tell him I
didn't realize that it was literally

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.970
right here so that's kind of a bonus
that we paid for the site yes because

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.080
apparently there's a day use fee to come
and dig your own thing anyways wow it's

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:34.170
windy it better be hot hot if I'm
getting a bikini on

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:40.840
what we're looking for is spots that are
wetter than others and have a little bit

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:52.480
of bubbling going on okay

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.050
I think there's a reason why there's no
locals or no one else on this PC oh what

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:38.130
