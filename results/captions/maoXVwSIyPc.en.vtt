00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.050
During the first few years of the Galactic
Empire, Palpatine and his apprentice Darth

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.630
Vader were aboard a cruiser named the Defiance.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.490
The ship had been used as a Flight Training
Institute for nearly its entire existence,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.820
and was known for graduating some of the most
talented bridge navigation officers among

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.380
similar schools.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.279
Emperor Palpatine was using the cruiser as
a meeting ground that he had planned among

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.860
his top Naval Chiefs to discuss how to best
re-organize the former Republic Academies

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.250
to better align with their plans for the galactic
wide Imperial Navy they were building, as

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.250
well as to have the Academies be more responsive
toward Palpatine whenever he wished to order

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.690
a change in the training programs.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.059
While preparations for this meeting were being
made within the main offices of the Defiance

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.760
Cruiser, Darth Vader was ordered by his master
to oversee the training exercise that was

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.820
underway on the bridge among the newest cadets.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.489
This training exercise was being advised by
a Commandant named Pell Baylo.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.980
He was an old man in his 70s who had been
training cadets on the Defiance for nearly

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.110
5 decades, and had taken great satisfaction
in his ship’s reputation and his school.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.740
Hours went by as Vader just stood there looking
at the cadets and their instructor going over

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.970
standard procedure that was expected on the
bridge of a ship.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
Vader began to wonder why his master had asked
him to oversee such a tedious exercise, surely

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.590
he was far more useful doing something else.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.830
The only subtle thing he noticed that was
of some interest to him was that the instructor

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.869
was clearly in physical pain due to a back
injury he likely sustained in some prior battle,

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.049
yet he still pushed on with his duties as
he attended any cadet that needed his help

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.649
or to look at their work, not allowing his
pain get in his way.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.610
Vader once heard a few cadets whisper to one
another how Baylo was brave for still teaching

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.200
despite the pain he had in his back, a statement
that ticked the Sith Lord off, as the old

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.360
instructor knew nothing of real pain compared
to him.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.109
Finally near the end of the teaching lesson,
a young cadet called over to have the Commandant

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.910
check on her calculations for the coordinates
for the planned hyperspace jump to Christophis.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.310
Baylo came over and was initially impressed
with the calculations she had until he discovered

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.680
one small error, that he went on to change
himself.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.700
After making the supposed correction in the
navigation computer, Baylo looked at Vader

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.470
and made the comment “They don’t learn
right away, but they do learn.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.069
I get results.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.130
You can tell your Emperor that”.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.800
For the first time since stepping on the bridge,
Vader spoke, stating that Palpatine was his

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.520
Emperor as well.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.790
Several cadets turned over to look at the
two men who were face to face of each other,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.250
curious to see what was about to occur.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.790
But instead of feeling intimidated, Baylo
stood his ground and went on to ask what Vader

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.709
even was to the Emperor.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.090
To which the Sith Lord replied that he would
do well if he never found out.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.030
Still unphased by Vader’s presence and comments,
Baylo went on to tell his cadets that he was

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.830
leaving to attend the meeting with the rest
of the Naval chiefs and that they ought to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.120
finish up by going into hyperspace using the
calculations he put in earlier.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.299
He then casually walked by Vader and left
the bridge.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.060
As Commandant Baylo left, Vader looked over
toward the cadet sitting at the navigation

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.190
computer and told her to wait.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.620
He then walked over and looked right at her,
sensing something was off about her emotions

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.180
following her confrontation with the Commandant.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.000
He sensed that for some odd reason she knew
that her initial calculations were correct,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.069
and that despite Baylo telling her otherwise,
she refused to argue with him out of fear

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.300
of being possibly removed from the class.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870
Vader asked her to check her calculations
again.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.959
She did just that and found that what Baylo
put in was completely off and made no sense.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.409
He then told her to put in her initial calculations
in before they embarked into hyperspace.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.200
As the ship was traversing through hyperspace,
Vader met with Baylo right outside the office

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.060
that was being used for the meeting.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.430
Baylo made a joke how he’s not used to waiting
outside his own office for this long, to which

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.730
Vader responded that it wasn’t his office
anymore.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.659
Still not intimidated, Baylo replied with
“whatever you say”.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.549
Shortly afterwards they were asked to enter
inside the office to meet with Emperor Palpatine.

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.720
As Baylo was seated, Palpatine explained to
him how his current training school on the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.480
Defiance was going to be folded into the existing
training center on Corellia for more efficiency,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.760
and that he’ll be put on the navigation
institute plantside.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.510
As the explanation finished, Baylo responded
with a simple “No”.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.820
Such a response surprised both Sith Lords
present in the room, to which Palpatine asked

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.450
the man to repeat himself.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.160
Baylo did just that, stating that he will
not transfer his vessel over to the Emperor’s

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160
new command.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.720
He continued by saying that his ship was commissioned
by the Republic to be used to train cadets

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.380
in service of the Republic Navy only, and
that he did not find the new Empire as legitimate.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.940
After his rant ended, Palpatine told him to
stop playing games, and was about to explain

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.100
how the senate voted for the Republic to be
made into the Empire before being cut off

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.100
by Baylo,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.170
who stated that the senate dissolved its pact
with the people the very moment it allowed

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.910
for a tyrant to take over.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.170
He continued by saying that he considered
the Empire to be a hostile power and couldn’t

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.610
fulfill its orders.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.470
Baylo then reached into his coat pocket and
placed down a datapad, stating that it was

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.750
his resignation.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.300
Palpatine simply looked at the datapad and
then at the Commandant, and he began to chuckle

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.600
at the little speech he had just heard.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.380
Before Baylo could dismiss himself from the
meeting, Vader stepped toward him.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.070
Baylo looked up and told him how he didn’t
care if he was about to kill him.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.430
Vader replied with that was only because he
believed himself to be already dead.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.520
Palpatine asked what he meant by that, to
which Vader explained how Baylo intentionally

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.960
plotted the cruiser they were in to launch
itself into a star by changing the calculations

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.560
of the navigation computer.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.930
Vader then said how he had them changed back
to their correct state, preventing the collision.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.030
Having heard his assassination plot be foiled,
Baylo sat back down and cursed under his breath.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.600
Palpatine congratulated Vader on his efforts,
and then turned back on the Commandant, who

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.250
had clear hatred and anger in his eyes now.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.250
Baylo then exploded into a rant, saying how
he watched Palpatine and his cronies corrupt

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.820
the Navy bit by bit during the Clone Wars.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.120
Turning it from the shield that protected
the people, into an oppressive weapon that

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.530
now was used to destroy.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.730
And how doing so was the biggest insult to
all the men and women who have died in the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.620
Republic navy before Palpatine’s Empire
took and corrupted it.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.340
Vader looked at his master, awaiting an angry
response back, but was instead surprised to

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.530
see Palpatine very amused.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.650
Perhaps wanting to hear more of the man’s
anger, Palpatine asked how Baylo was willing

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.400
to sacrifice his own colleagues and students
that were aboard the cruiser had his assassination

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.750
plan been a success.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.340
Baylo responded that he now viewed his colleagues
only as mere traitors trying to save their

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.090
posts, and that death was a far better fate
for his students than having them become apart

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.550
of an evil force in the galaxy.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.720
Having heard enough of this, Vader force choked
the man, snapping his throat in a blink of

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.500
an eye and killing him instantly.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.460
Palpatine’s smile quickly vanished as he
witnessed what his apprentice had done and

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.720
shouted out his name, telling him how he did
not give him the order to kill Baylo.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.960
Vader stood still, not understanding why his
master would have wanted to keep such a man

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.050
alive.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.050
Sensing his apprentice’s confusion, Palpatine
explained how he was going to keep the old

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.360
fool alive for his own pleasure, forcing Baylo
to watch as the Navy he once loved be transformed

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.670
into something he hated.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.680
Melt down the ship he beloved into metal to
be used for caterfia trays.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.630
And that at the end of it all, he perhaps
could have used such a man in his Navy.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.220
Baylo was willing to kill his own students
for a cause afterwall, and Palpatine believed

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.880
he could have convinced the man to use that
fire for his own ambitions.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.580
But now all that was gone because Vader killed
him.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.990
Vader tried to defend himself by saying that
Baylo was a clear threat, and that his method

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.090
of just killing him was a far more efficient
means of doing things.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.280
But Palpatine didn’t want to hear any of
it, instead saying that because he did not

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.590
command Vader to kill Baylo, that he should
not have done it.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.000
And his apprentice’s reasons for doing so
did not matter.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.550
Before this Master and Apprentice discussion
could continue, the office door opened by

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.250
a cadet with the message that they’ve arrived
at their destination and the Naval chiefs

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.960
of Christophis were awaiting their Emperor.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.680
She looked over at her former Commandant,
confused as to how he died.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.060
Palpatine quickly commented how Baylo had
a sudden death from his old age as he was

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.690
making his way out of the office.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.580
But before he left, Palpatine gave the cadet
one more order: to rename the cruiser they

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.190
were on from the Defiance, to the Obedience.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.570
It was a one last kick into the passed Commandant
and a not so subtle hint toward Vader to know

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.330
his place.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.280
Also fun fact, the female cadet in the story
was actually Rae Sealone.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.110
She would later became a self appointed Grand
Admiral about 2 decades later, following the

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:54.700
Battle of Endor.
