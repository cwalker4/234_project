00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:01.041
PUBLIC HEARING, SANDRA.

00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:02.242
&gt;&gt; Sandra: THANK YOU.

00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:05.478
&gt;&gt; Bill: WANT TO BRING IN OUR

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:07.147
HEADLINER MICHAEL CAPUTO, ONE

00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:10.450
OF THE 81 WHO RECEIVED THESE

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:11.384
SWEEPING DOCUMENT REQUESTS FROM

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.486
JERRY NADLER AND THE HOUSE

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:14.454
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:15.422
GOOD MORNING FROM LANCASTER,

00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:15.856
NEW YORK.

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.924
A WEEK AGO YOU SAID YOU WON'T

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:18.291
COOPERATE.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.794
HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:22.429
&gt;&gt; NO, I HAVEN'T.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.865
I THINK THERE WERE SOME KIND OF

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.867
CLICK BAITING HEADLINES OUT

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:27.167
THERE.

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:28.268
MY ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.736
RESPONDED TO THE COMMITTEE'S

00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:31.404
REQUEST SAYING WE HAVE NONE OF

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.240
THE DOCUMENTS THEY ASKED FOR.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.741
THEY ASKED ME FOR THREE

00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:35.809
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THINGS I HAD

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.677
NOTHING TO DO WITH AND NOWHERE

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:37.978
NEAR.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.013
IF THEY HAPPENED AT ALL.

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:42.349
THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING, ANY

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.217
KIND OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:45.785
MANAFORT AND DATES AND RUSSIANS

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:47.521
AND ANY RUSSIANS WHO WERE IN

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.356
CONTACT WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:52.292
I WAS NOWHERE NEAR ANY OF THAT.

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.294
PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN.

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:56.396
IN THAT CONVERSATION THE SENIOR

00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:58.131
COMMITTEE STAFFER ASKED MY

00:00:58.132 --> 00:00:59.499
ATTORNEY IF HE WOULD PRESENT ME

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.000
FOR TESTIMONY.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.302
THAT WOULD BE THE FOURTH TIME

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:03.970
I'VE TESTIFIED UNDER OATH

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:06.106
ANSWERING THE SAME QUESTIONS

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:06.406
AGAIN.

00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:07.607
MY ATTORNEY WAS PALMS UP ABOUT

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:08.208
IT.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:09.376
WE HAD A DISCUSSION.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:10.777
I DON'T INTEND TO TESTIFY IN

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:12.879
FRONT OF THEM IF THEY INVITE ME.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.415
I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE WHO

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:16.516
HAS TESTIFIED UNDER OATH BEFORE

00:01:16.517 --> 00:01:17.317
SHOULD DO IT AS WELL.

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.219
&gt;&gt; Sandra: COULD YOU GIVE US

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.620
SOME IDEA WHAT EXACTLY -- WHAT

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:22.022
SORT OF DOCUMENTS THEY WERE

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:23.056
LOOKING FOR AND WHAT THEY

00:01:23.057 --> 00:01:24.624
WANTED TO DIG INTO?

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.960
&gt;&gt; SURE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 81

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:27.894
PEOPLE WHO GOT DOCUMENT

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:29.763
REQUESTS, SOME OF THEM GOT SIX

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:31.865
AND SEVEN PAGES WORTH OF

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.000
REQUESTS LIKE DON JUNIOR HAS

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.868
GOT TO HAVE THREE OR FOUR

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.437
ATTORNEYS WORKING HARD TOWARD

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:37.704
IT.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.106
I HAD THREE PARAGRAPHS, LESS

00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:40.040
THAN HALF A PAGE.

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:41.675
THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:42.175
RUSSIAN ATTORNEY.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:43.210
I WAS IN CLEVELAND AT THE

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:44.478
CONVENTION AT THE TIME.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.545
I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THAT

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:47.748
MEETING UNTIL IT WAS IN THE

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:48.048
PRESS.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.817
THEY ASKED ME IF I HAD ANY

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:52.986
DOCUMENTS ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.922
BETWEEN RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT

00:01:54.923 --> 00:01:56.090
OFFICIALS OR THEIR

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:57.024
INTERMEDIARIES AND THE TRUMP

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:57.391
CAMPAIGN.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:58.125
NONE OF THAT HAPPENED AND I

00:01:58.126 --> 00:01:59.360
HAVE NONE OF THAT.

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.496
THEY ASKED ME FOR ANY DOCUMENTS

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.666
I MIGHT HAVE REGARDING RICK

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.369
GATES AND PAUL MANAFORT

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.271
COMMUNICATING WITH TWO RUSSIANS

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:10.738
AND UKRAINIANS.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.672
I WAS NOWHERE NEAR THAT.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.008
I HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.643
WE WERE IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIVE.

00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:19.713
IF THEY'LL ASK ME WITH JUST

00:02:19.714 --> 00:02:21.816
THREE PARAGRAPHS OF REQUESTS

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.451
PROBABLY THE SHORTEST DOCUMENT

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:23.784
REQUEST.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:24.051
81.

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:25.820
IF THEY INVITE ME BEFORE THE

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:26.754
COMMITTEE THEY'LL INVITE ALL 81

00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:30.024
AND IT WILL BE A LONG, LONG

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:30.357
SUMMER.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.793
&gt;&gt; Bill: HOW HIGH OR DEEP ARE

00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:34.729
YOUR LEGAL BILLS TODAY?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.130
&gt;&gt; WELL OVER $200,000.

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.733
I WAS ABLE TO RAISE ALL OF THAT

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:39.434
AN GoFundMe.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.069
I RAISED ENOUGH ON GoFundMe I

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.871
WAS ABLE TO PAY THE LEGAL FEES

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:44.839
OF SEVERAL OTHER TRUMP

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.107
ASSOCIATES WHO WERE RECALLED IN

00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:48.443
AS WITNESSES AS WELL.

00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:50.311
PEOPLE LIKE -- WHO DIDN'T HAVE

00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:53.414
THE WHEREWITHAL TO PAY LIKE MY

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:53.748
FAMILY.

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.217
BUT UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:58.353
WE'RE FACING -- EVERY TIME YOU

00:02:58.354 --> 00:03:00.788
GO BEFORE THESE GUYS ITS

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.390
$20,000 OR $30,000.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:05.861
IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE  NRIFSH

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:08.664
LIKE I WOULD DO.

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:09.364
IT'S REALLY A FINANCIAL

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:11.233
PUNISHMENT AND RAISE IT ON

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:11.934
GoFundMe AGAIN.

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:14.269
IT IS A TERRIBLE THING.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.970
I'VE LOST MY BUSINESS.

00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:17.539
I NEARLY LOST MY HOUSE.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.308
MY KIDS 4 AND 6-YEAR-OLD AND

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.510
16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, MY WIFE.

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:22.544
WE'VE HAD OUR LIVES ON PAUSE

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.080
FOR TWO YEARS AND WE WERE JUST

00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:26.381
ABOUT GETTING READY TO PRESS

00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:27.916
PLAY WITH THE PRESENTATION OF

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.584
THE MUELLER REPORT AND HERE WE

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:30.452
GO AGAIN.

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.788
&gt;&gt; Sandra: WHY DO YOU THINK

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:33.789
NADLER AND HIS COMMITTEE ARE

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.157
ASKING FOR THIS?

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:36.391
&gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:40.595
I'M FROM NEW YORK.

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:42.464
I'M IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.

00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:44.099
NADLER IS IN MANHATTAN.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.600
THIS GUY IS SHARP AND BEEN

00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:47.035
AROUND A LONG, LONG TIME.

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:48.403
PEOPLE LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:50.072
DEMOCRATS IF YOU'RE ON THE

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:50.672
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:52.307
DON'T MAKE FUN OF JERRY NADLER.

00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:53.642
HE IS SMART AND KNOWS WHAT HE

00:03:53.643 --> 00:03:54.009
IS DOING.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.812
I THINK HE IS TRYING TO GET --

00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:59.147
ENTRAP SOME PEOPLE IN PERJURY.

00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:00.983
ANYBODY WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.986
LIKE MYSELF TRUTHFULLY THREE

00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:04.486
TIMES UNDER OATH.

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:06.221
I TESTIFIED BEGINNING TWO YEARS

00:04:06.222 --> 00:04:07.489
AGO.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.124
MAYBE I MISREMEMBER A DATE,

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.260
COLOR OR SMELL AND I'M ON A

00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:11.727
PERJURY CHARGE.

00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:13.362
IF HE GETS SOMEBODY ON A

00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:14.763
PERJURY TRAP LIKE THAT THEY GET

00:04:14.764 --> 00:04:17.266
THEM TO FLIP AND SAY SOMETHING

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:17.966
NEGATIVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.668
LIKE MICHAEL COHEN IS DOING.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.570
JERRY NADLER IS TRYING TO PUT

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:23.205
TOGETHER AND ASSEMBLY AND

00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:24.173
TRYING TO CREATE ANOTHER

00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:25.774
MICHAEL COHEN SO THEY CAN

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:26.475
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT.

00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:28.911
THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:30.946
A PERJURY TRAP LEADING TO

00:04:30.947 --> 00:04:32.614
IMPEACHMENT AND I'M NOT GOING

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:33.549
TO PLAY.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.885
&gt;&gt; Bill: DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE

00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:37.253
PRESIDENT WILL PLAY, EITHER.

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:41.724
ADAM SCHIFF MADE AN APPEARANCE

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:43.792
-- MAKING A CASE THAT MUELLER

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.227
CAN'T PUT OUT A REPORT UNLESS

00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:46.161
HE GETS THE PRESIDENT UNDER

00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:46.462
OATH.

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:48.297
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE.

00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:49.698
WHEN YOU GET WRITTEN ANSWERS

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.134
FROM THE WITNESS IT IS THE

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.504
LAWYER'S ANSWER AS MUCH AS A

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:56.472
CLIENT'S ANSWER.

00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:57.640
YOU NEED TO ASK FOLLOW-UP

00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:58.240
QUESTIONS IN REALTIME.

00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:00.109
&gt;&gt; Bill: I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.610
GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.078
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD BASED

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:11.621
ON WHAT YOU HEAR FROM JAY

00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:13.890
SEKULOW AND GIULIANI.

00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:15.391
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD SCHIFF WANT THE

00:05:15.392 --> 00:05:17.860
GRAVY TRAIN TO END.

00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:18.794
THE RUSSIAN COLLUSION DELUSION

00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:20.463
IS COMING TO AN END.

00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:21.631
THE MUELLER TEAM WHETHER YOU

00:05:21.632 --> 00:05:24.433
LIKE THEM OR HATE THEM, THEY'RE

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:26.402
THE MOST CAPABLE, MOST

00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:28.004
REMARKABLE INVESTIGATION TEAM

00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:29.872
WE'VE ORGANIZED IN AMERICA AND

00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:31.507
CERTAINLY IN THIS MILLENNIUM.

00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:34.077
IF THEY CAN'T FIND RUSSIAN

00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:36.312
COLLUSION, DO YOU THINK

00:05:36.313 --> 00:05:38.581
CHAIRMAN SCHIFF OR CHAIRMAN

00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:40.016
NADLER AND THEIR TEAM WILL FIND

00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:40.383
SOMETHING?

00:05:40.384 --> 00:05:42.819
IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.921
&gt;&gt; Sandra: AS A FORMER TRUMP

00:05:44.922 --> 00:05:46.322
CAMPAIGN ADVISOR TO TAKE A LOOK

00:05:46.323 --> 00:05:48.057
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 2020 SO

00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:48.691
FAR.

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:50.059
JOE BIDEN ISN'T EVEN IN THE

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.129
RACE AND THE LATEST DES MOINES

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.497
REGISTER POLL HE IS LEADING THE

00:05:54.498 --> 00:05:54.798
PACK.

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:57.934
HOW DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE

00:05:57.935 --> 00:05:59.469
LOOKING RIGHT NOW, MICHAEL?

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.339
&gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, JOE BIDEN IS

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.174
SOMEONE WHO IS OUT FROM WESTERN

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:05.108
NEW YORK.

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:06.076
HE IS FROM SCRANTON,

00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:07.110
PENNSYLVANIA JUST TO OUR SOUTH.

00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:09.579
HE IS A GOOD MESSENGER FOR THE

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.080
WORKING MAN.

00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:11.715
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:15.285
ARE HOLDING OFF GETTING IN OR

00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:19.556
DID NOT GET IN, BROWN AND

00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:21.758
MCCAUL I HAVE IS WAITING TO SEE

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.093
IF BIDEN GETS IN.

00:06:23.094 --> 00:06:24.027
HE COULD SHUT DOWN SEVERAL

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:26.129
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COMPETE IN

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.430
THIS.

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:30.834
JOE BIDEN IS FORMIDABLE, AS

00:06:30.835 --> 00:06:32.402
SOMEBODY WHO SERVED AS VICE

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:34.137
PRESIDENT HIS BEST DAY IS THE

00:06:34.138 --> 00:06:36.373
DAY BEFORE HE GETS IN THE RACE.

00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:37.774
SO HE MAY BE LEADING RIGHT NOW.

00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:39.776
IF HE GETS IN THIS RACE THEY'LL

00:06:39.777 --> 00:06:43.080
BE TEARING HIM APART.

00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:44.414
I THINK KLOBUCHAR IS

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:44.815
COMPETITIVE.

00:06:44.816 --> 00:06:47.217
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE COMPETITIVE.

00:06:47.218 --> 00:06:49.086
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:51.421
FROM 2016 WITH A DOZEN PEOPLE

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:52.456
COMPETING RIPPING EACH OTHER

00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:52.823
APART.

00:06:52.824 --> 00:06:57.327
I THINK DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW

00:06:57.328 --> 00:06:59.463
IS GOING TO BUY MORE POPCORN

00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:00.632
AND WATCH THEM RIP EACH OTHER
