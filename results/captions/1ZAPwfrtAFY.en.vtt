00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.239
The presidency
of Donald Trump.

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.709
The man voted "Least Edible"
by<i> Cannibal Magazine</i>

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.711
-six years in a row.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.713
-A-- And I know,
I honestly know

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.882
that the prospect
of talking about Trump yet again

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:16.983
feels exhausting.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.986
We're all so tired of him,
every room in America

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.621
should have a sign
on the wall that counts

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.122
the number of minutes
that it's been

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:25.392
since someone brought up
his fucking name.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.660
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But-- But that is the thing.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.129
Trump's presidency
is like one of his handshakes.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.032
It pulls you in,
whether you like it or not.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.402
He's had so many
terrible moments this year,

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.137
you probably forgot about
many of them.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.773
Remember when he creepily told
the French president's wife

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.408
-that she was in good shape?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.110
Or-- Or when his
tacky golf resort was touted

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.246
on the States Department
website?

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:49.315 line:0%
Or, when he shoved
the prime minister

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.654 line:0%
<i> Look how proud
 of himself he is!</i>

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.589
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Look how proud he is!

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.658
You should at least have to know
that Montenegro is a country

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.529
before making a move that says,
"Suck it, Montenegro."

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.932
And there were also quieter
but no less alarming moments

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.334
like when he explained how hard
he's been fighting

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.337
to bring "clean coal" back
without appearing to understand

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.772
what that actually is.

-Listen, is it possible

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.626
that Trump is well-versed
in and is referring to

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.529
flue gas desulfurization,
fluidized bed combustion,

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.997
and selective
catalytic reduction?

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.065
Sure, it's possible,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.400
but let's agree
it's considerably more likely

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.069
that he thinks you just
take a bunch of coal

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.237
and scrub-a-dub it
with a big ol' sponge.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.140
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.575
I'm saying the president
fundamentally doesn't understand

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.011
what he's talking about,
and you know what that means.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.347

-The point is--

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.668
The point is tonight...
let's pull back

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.770
from the daily
Trump-induced chaos

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.205
and take a look at the norms
that his presidency

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:22.008
has violated,
and not the obvious ones,

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.377
like the fact that he never
released his tax returns,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.578
or that his own daughter
and son-in-law

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.714
work in the White House,
although, admittedly,

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:31.317
I am using the word "work"
there so generously

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.752
that I should be able
to deduct it

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.687
as a charitable donation
on my taxes.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.257
Or-- Or that instead
of putting his assets

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.592
into a blind trust to help
reduce conflicts of interest,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.960
he simply showed America

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.296
that he has many
large stacks of paper,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.164
presumable containing
the sentence

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.200
"I can't believe
I'm getting away with this,"

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.368
printed 750,000 times.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.572
No, instead, we're going
to talk about Trump's assault

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.474
on something even more basic,
the norms governing

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.543
how our leaders engage
with us,

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:59.478
and how in turn,
that affects the way

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.480
that we engage with one another.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.649
It's why even the notion
of "getting him"

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.684
can feel so hopelessly futile.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.154
And let's first stipulate
that it definitely doesn't help

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.557
that so often what Trump says
is complete nonsense.

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:14.693
We often read transcripts
of Trump's speeches,

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.462
and it's something
that everyone should actually do

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:18.797
once in a while,
because when you strip away

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.734
his blindly confident
entertaining delivery

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.437
and just read his words,
it is staggering

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.138
how incoherent he is.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.507
Here is a word-for-word
reading of a speech

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.809
where he talked about
the Iran nuclear deal.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.792
Trump's actual speech patterns

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.794
sound like when you write
a long text

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.596
by choosing only
the predictive text

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.131
your iPhone suggests for you.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.167
Seriously, we wrote
a message like that,

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.203
starting with the words,
"the nuclear,"

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.704
and here is what we got.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.307
(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:53.092
-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-That makes exactly as much,

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:56.328
and potentially more sense,
then Trump's speech

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.298
about the Iran nuclear deal,
meaning an iPhone

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:02.168
would be a more coherent
president of the United States.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.904
But with Trump,
we are familiar enough

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.607
with his speech patterns
that you get the basic gist

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.074
of what he's trying to say.

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.010
The real damage isn't
in how he says things,

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:15.514
but from three key techniques
that he uses to insulate himself

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.183
from criticism and consequence.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.518
And if we are not
extremely careful,

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.787
all three could have
serious impacts

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.456
that far outlast his presidency,

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.057
and let's start
with the first one.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:26.792
Delegitimizing the media.

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.594
Now, Trump has been
attacking the press

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:29.895
since he declared
his candidacy,

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.998
and in a broader sense,
he's been waging war

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.465
on the very concept of truth

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.534
ever since he first
turned to his mom and said,

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:38.270
"Dada," and she said,
"No, I'm mama,"

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.139
and he said, "Fake news,"
and shit his pants.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.607
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now--

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.510
the difference now is,
he's crying fake news

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.478
as President
of the United States,

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:48.280
and he is openly proud of it,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.516
to the point that he recently
tried to take ownership

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:51.617
of the term itself.

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:55.321
The media is... is--
really the word--

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.256
I think one of the
greatest of all terms

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.192
I've come up with is "fake."

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.859
I guess other people
have used it perhaps

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.929
over the years,
but I've never noticed it.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.498
-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-He just took credit

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.400
for inventing the term
"fake news,"

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.202
which, for the record,
he did not,

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:11.003
meaning what he just said

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:12.671
was technically
"fake" fake "news" news.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:13.706
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.474
A-- And you can imagine
him saying, "Well,

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.944
I'm not the first politician
to criticize the press.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.212
What about Hillary Clinton?

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.512
What about Barack Obama?

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:21.914
What about Bernie Sanders?

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.517
And that actually brings us
to Trump's second technique,

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:26.519
something called
"whataboutism."

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.988
It's the practice
of changing the subject

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.190
to someone else's
perceived wrongdoing.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.258
Now, Trump does this
all the time,

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:34.794
most famously when he was asked

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.895
why he hadn't forcefully
condemned the neo-Nazis

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:39.298
in Charlottesville,
and this was his response...

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.235 line:0%
What about the alt-left
that came charging

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.069 line:0%
at the-- as you say,
the alt-right?

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:47.206 line:0%
Do they have any
semblance of guilt?

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.075 line:0%
What about the fact
they came charging--

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.144 line:0%
that they came charging
with clubs in their hands,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.311 line:0%
swinging clubs?

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.647 line:0%
Do they have any... problem?

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.317
Well, actually, no,
because a Nazi killing someone

00:06:58.417 --> 00:06:59.718
with a car is so heinous,

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.054
any other issues that might
be up for debate,

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:05.391
under any other circumstances,
kind of have to wait their turn.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.859
You can be wearing Crocs
with socks,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.062
but if you're using
those socked-Crocs

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.464
to kick Hitler in the balls,
do you know what?

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:14.300
I'm suddenly not
so fucking focused

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.302
-on the footwear.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:19.871
Now-- Now this technique
of saying "what about..."

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.641
is actually an old Soviet
propaganda tool,

00:07:22.741 --> 00:07:25.877
and the reason it is dangerous
is because it implies

00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:28.313
that all actions,
regardless of context,

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.516
share a moral equivalency,
and since nobody is perfect,

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.652
all criticism is hypocritical

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.788
and everybody should do
whatever they want.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:38.357
It is a depressingly
effective tool,

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.426
which is why,
on Trump's favorite network,

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.060
you hear it all the time.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.849 line:0%
but what about Benghazi?
What about the blatant lies

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.117 line:0%
that the Obama
administration told us?

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:07.119 line:0%
What about the fact that
Ben Rhodes bragged

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:08.920 line:0%
about lying to the media
and the public

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.756 line:0%
-about the Iran deal?
-HANNITY: Great point.

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:12.792 line:0%
What about the fact that
Jonathan Gruber

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.061 line:0%
basically said the
American people were stupid?

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.331
Okay, stop, stop, stop,
because here is the thing,

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.832
none of the errors those people
may have made in the past

00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:23.202
excuse the Trump
administration's actions.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.238
A defense attorney could not
stand up in court and say,

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:28.307
"Maybe my client did
murder those people,

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.609
but I ask you this...
What about Jeffrey Dahmer?

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:32.244
-What about Al Capone?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.346
What about the guy from
the<i> Silence of the Lambs?</i>

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:37.249
I rest my case here, people.
I rest my case."

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:42.721
The problem with whataboutism
is it doesn't actually

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.258
solve a problem
or win an argument.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.693
The point is just to
muddy the waters

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.395
which can make
the other side mad,

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.564
and that actually
brings us to Trump's

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.332
third technique... trolling.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.268
Now trolling itself
has been around for years.

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.570
It's basically 80% of what
happens on the internet.

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:00.639
It's-- it's when a
YouTube commenter

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:02.341
says something
willfully provocative

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:06.044
like saying, "I've aged like
an apple core in a dumpster."

00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:09.882
or that I "look like a fucking
pickle with glasses."

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:13.119
Now, it doesn't matter
whether they mean any of that,

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.920
the point is just to
get a reaction

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.888
and to hurt my feelings
which, by the way,

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:17.990
it absolutely does.

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:22.928
But-- But Trump... Trump may
well be the first ever troll

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:25.030
to be elected president.
And that's right,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.298
I said elected.

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.901
Remember tenth president,
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard?

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.203
He assumed office after
William Henry Harrison died

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:32.604
and if you're thinking,
"Hold on,

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:35.941
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard was not
America's tenth president"...

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.142
Really?

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.545
Who was America's
tenth president?

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.947
Exactly. Let's assume
I'm right.

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:46.619
The point is, as a troll,
Trump often does things

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.220
that have no effect
other than

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.222
to piss off
his perceived enemies.

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:52.524
Like when he tweeted
this wrestling GIF

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.060
of himself
body slamming CNN,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.063
or attacked Mika Brzezinksi
by saying she was,

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.764
"bleeding badly
from a face-lift,"

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.366
or, as we mentioned
earlier tonight,

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.634
called a leader
with nuclear weapons

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:03.836
"short and fat."

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:06.372
And Trump even once
retweeted a claim

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.473
that he was the most
superior troll

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.576
on the whole of Twitter,
calling it

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:11.911
"a great compliment."

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.747
Which it is not,
because sometimes

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.849
when you do something that
makes a lot of people mad,

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.617
it's because,
and bear with me here,

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.652
-you're a dick.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:23.689
If you-- If you sneak
into someone's house

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.792
and urinate
in every heating vent

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:29.528
and they get mad at you,
you're not an epic troll

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.664
sticking it to the
snowflake cucks,

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.899
you're just
some fucking asshole.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:36.802
But the thing is,
Trump's trolling

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:39.371
is not actually without
political value.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:42.407
Despite Trump's few real policy
accomplishments to date,

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:43.875
he has consistently achieved
one thing,

00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:46.211
and that is making
his enemies unhappy.

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:49.247
And for many Trump supporters,
that itself counts

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:50.349
as a major victory.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.318
Just listen to how
<i> Fox &amp; Friends</i> reacted

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.953
after Trump freaked
people out

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.554
by standing
with military leaders

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:57.589
during rising tensions
with North Korea,

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:00.493
and suggesting that it was
the "calm before the storm."

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.028 line:0%
I feel like he's trolling
the media.

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:05.598 line:0%
He is-- I think he's totally
trolling the media there.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.033 line:0%
You do something like that--
even the smile and the wink.

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.068 line:0%
Those of us that are sick
of the status quo,

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:12.437 line:0%
the forgotten men and women
who voted for President Trump,

00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:15.340 line:0%
want that town to freak out.
I want those reporters going,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.375 line:0%
"What do you mean?
What do you mean?"

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.110 line:0%
It's beautiful to watch.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:19.444
Is it?

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.415
Why?
I'm genuinely serious.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.617
Who benefits from mass confusion
about whether or not

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:26.852
we're about to go to war?

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.054
Are there thousands of
unemployed factory workers

00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:31.423
across the Midwest going,
"Well the plant closed down

00:11:31.523 --> 00:11:33.125
and I lost my healthcare.
But somewhere,

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:35.093
a<i> Washington Post</i> reporter
is scared of dying,

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:37.363
so things are looking up. Mega!"

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.400
Judging your political success
on how bad you make

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.535
other people feel
makes just about as much sense

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.604
as judging your success
as a zookeeper

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:47.405
by how many bears you fuck.

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:50.909
Oh, wow, that is not
your job.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.046
I mean, I guess it's impressive
in its own way,

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:56.816
but it is definitely not what
you're supposed to be doing.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.587
And the surest proof of trolling
often comes

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:02.922
when a troll is confronted.

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.256
Because that's when
they have to either

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.024
put up or shut up.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:07.726
You may have heard about
cases where

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.895
people tracked down the source
of something awful

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.897
that was posted online,
only to find

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.600
some sullen fifteen-year-old
who just shrugs and goes,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.036
"Well I don't know why
I wrote that. I just did it.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.837
Stop asking me so many
questions."

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:22.775
Well, that is basically
our president now.

00:12:23.108 --> 00:12:24.443
I'll show you.
Remember when Trump said

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.179
that Obama had surveilled him
in Trump Tower, tweeting...

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.883
"How low has President Obama
gone to tap-p my phones?"

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.920
Watch what happens when he
was asked to justify that.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.890
Well, you saw what happened
with surveillance

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.459
and I think that was
inappropriate.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.560
-That's the way--
-What does that mean, sir?

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.028
Uh, you can figure that out
yourself.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.930
Well I-- The reason I ask
is you said he was--

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.531
You called him "sick and bad."

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:49.134
Look, you can figure it out
yourself,

00:12:49.234 --> 00:12:51.269
he was very nice to me
with words, but--

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:53.471
and when I was with him,
but after that

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.006
there has been no relationship.

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:56.809
But you stand by that claim
about him?

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.443
I don't stand by anything.
I just, uh...

00:12:58.543 --> 00:12:59.845
You can take it the way
you want.

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:03.749
Okay, so let's walk through
what just happened there.

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.651
On the internet he claimed
that his predecessor

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.786
committed an extremely
serious crime.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.289
But in person, he is suddenly
backing down.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.391
First saying Obama was
"very nice to me with words,"

00:13:13.892 --> 00:13:16.661
then that, "I don't stand
by anything."

00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:18.030
Which is one of the most

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.765
frighteningly nihilistic
sentences a president can say.

00:13:20.865 --> 00:13:22.534
I would honestly rather
hear that

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.503
from a clown holding a knife
than a president.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.372
Because at least when
a clown says,

00:13:27.472 --> 00:13:28.941
"I don't stand by anything,"
you think,

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:31.877
"Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
Please make it quick."

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.245
-And...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.214
And look, it gets worse, because
that interview kept going

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.383
and Trump was explicitly
given the opportunity

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:41.720
to set the record straight
for the "fake news media,"

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.421
but he flat-out refused.

00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:45.290
I just wanted to
find out that--

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.558
You're the president
of the United States,

00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:47.759
you said he was "sick and bad"

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:49.794
-because he attacked you--
-You can take it any way--

00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:51.230
You can take it any way
you want.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.999
-But I'm asking you, because you
don't want it to be fake news.
-You don't--

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:55.467
-I want to hear it from
President Trump.
-You don't have to ask me.

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:56.868
-You don't have to ask me.
-Why not?

00:13:56.968 --> 00:13:59.871
Because I have my own opinions,
you can have your own opinions.

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:01.073
But I want to know
your opinions.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.607
-You're the president
of the United States.
-Okay. That's enough.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:03.609
Thank you.

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:05.511
Thank you very much.

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:12.918
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:16.054
Okay, so...

00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:19.724
There is a lot that is
infuriating about that clip.

00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:23.395
But Trump going back to his desk
and pretending to work hard

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:25.664
is an objectively funny
thing to do.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.366
That's like your dog
avoiding questions

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:32.337
by pretending to do his taxes.
You never do this,

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.807
why would you need
to do it now?

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:39.744
Look, while there is nothing new
about any of these techniques,

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.014
they are now coming out
of the Oval Office.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:45.417
Which not only legitimizes them,
it risks them spreading,

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:47.753
and that, sadly, is happening.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.988
Last month,
Congressman Paul Gosar

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:51.323
used all three techniques.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:52.958
First, he suggested
in an interview

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.526
that the march
in Charlottesville

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:56.662
may have been
a false flag operation

00:14:56.762 --> 00:15:00.499
created by the left, which is
pretty troll-y behavior.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:04.203
And when confronted about it,
he deployed the other two tools.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.705 line:0%
-It's all been debunked.
-It's not been debunked.

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.606 line:0%
Absolutely not debunked
whatsoever.

00:15:08.706 --> 00:15:10.042 line:0%
-So stay tuned.
-The conspiracy theory

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:11.844 line:0%
that you have put out there
has been debunked.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:14.313 line:0%
It has not been debunked.
Look at-- Look at what CNN

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.848 line:0%
has talked about with, uh,
with what's going on

00:15:16.948 --> 00:15:19.351 line:0%
with the Clinton administration
right now with the dossier.

00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:22.587 line:0%
Hardly an aspect
in regards to debunk.

00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:24.389 line:0%
You're not real news,
you're fake news.

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:26.691 line:0%
Sir, everything you've said
has been debunked,

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.627 line:0%
why are you continuing
to put this out there?

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.799
So he's basically just
copying Trump.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.401
And if there is one thing
worse than something terrible,

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:39.004
it's a cover band
of that terrible thing.

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:42.608
If Trump is Nickelback,
that man is Bickleknack.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.410
Not as good at it
as the original,

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:48.147
and a horrible sign
that the disease is spreading.

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.816
The problem is
if that becomes

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.517
the level of discourse
in this country,

00:15:52.617 --> 00:15:55.153
we are seriously
and lastingly fucked.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.357
And just this week,
we saw some of these techniques

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.692
pushed to the absolute limit
by the scandal involving

00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:02.895
Alabama Senate candidate
Roy Moore,

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.130
who has denied allegations
of sexual misconduct

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.567
with a 14-year-old
when he was 32

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.269
and called them "fake news."

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:13.372
Now, watch Sean Hannity
then use whataboutism

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.840
to derail
a discussion about it.

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.710 line:0%
This 14-year old girl,
purportedly,

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.111 line:0%
according to
<i> The Washington Post,</i>

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.679 line:0%
told two of her girlfriends

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.614 line:0%
-what happened in real time.
-SEAN HANNITY: Here's
a tough question...

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.418 line:0%
Do you think Bill Clinton,
in retrospect, was a predator?

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.888
But, that is not what this
discussion is about.

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:32.391
You might as well have said,
"Here's a tough question,

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.093
'If you had to guess,
how many lobsters are there?'"

00:16:35.193 --> 00:16:37.529
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"Like total? In the world?"

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:40.632
Is that worth discussing?
Sure, but first let's finish

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:42.300
talking about
the Senate candidate

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.670
who may have made sexual
advances on a child.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.773
And, look, whether Clinton
engaged in predatory behavior

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.009
is absolutely a legitimate
question, but

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.412
it shouldn't really inform
what we do about Roy Moore.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.682
And, even if you believe
the Democrats are guilty

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.950
of a double standard,
the solution is not to have

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.652
no standard whatsoever.

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:04.956
That is why it's so important
to train ourselves to identify

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.159
these techniques because their
natural endpoint

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:10.295
is the erosion of our ability
to decide what's important,

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:13.565
have an honest debate, and hold
one another accountable.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.601
And that erosion
could be so gradual

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.802
that it's difficult to spot.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.704
It's like being murdered
by a sloth.

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:22.941
It happens very slowly
and you might not notice

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.210
-until it's too late.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.580
Now, listen, this is all
very bleak.

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.082
I cannot pretend that it isn't,

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.752
which is why it is so important
to take some hope

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:36.188
from this year's small victories
like the Muslim ban

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:39.224
being blocked by the courts
after massive public protests.

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:41.826
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-Or, or, the attempts...

00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.395
to appeal Obamacare stalling,

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:46.097
thanks in part to people
pressuring their lawmakers.

00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:48.900
And, just this week,
just this week in Virginia,

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:51.336
voters rejected Ed Gillespie
for governor

00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:53.838
after he ran a Trump-style,
dog-whistle campaign.

00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:56.275
And that is encouraging
because it's nice to know that

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.843
if you use Trump tactics

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.778
in a Virginia gubernatorial
election,

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:01.846
you do not get
to be "gubernator."

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:02.947
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Now...

00:18:03.047 --> 00:18:04.782
further down the ballot there,

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:07.519
Tuesday also marked the defeat
of Bob Marshall,

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:10.689
who earlier this year proposed
a so-called bathroom bill.

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.659
He lost to Danica Roem,
who will now be Virginia's

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:17.229
first openly transgender
legislator.

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:21.566
And the tone that she has taken
is already markedly different.

00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:24.836 line:0%
Danica, you were running
against, um, Robert Marshall,

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:27.105 line:0%
an incumbent,
thirteen-term incumbent.

00:18:27.205 --> 00:18:29.741 line:0%
He's also a man who referred
to himself

00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:32.344 line:0%
as "Virginia's chief homophobe."

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.547 line:0%

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:36.948 line:0%
Do you have anything
you wanna say to him?

00:18:37.048 --> 00:18:40.418 line:0%
Come January, delegate Marshall
will be one of my constituents

00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:43.955 line:0%
and I'm not gonna disrespect
my own constituents.

00:18:44.555 --> 00:18:48.627
Wow, that is incredibly
refreshing.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:50.462
Just think about that.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:53.498
She beat a man who openly
disrespected her,

00:18:53.598 --> 00:18:55.800
but given the opportunity,
she chose not to respond

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.768
by tweeting...

It's nice! It's nice not
to have that.

00:19:06.477 --> 00:19:09.848
And, look, Tuesday's results
should not make you complacent.

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:12.784
They are absolutely no
guarantee that the midterms

00:19:12.884 --> 00:19:14.319
will turn out at all well.

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.586
That is why, though,

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.656
you should take these moments
of encouragement

00:19:17.756 --> 00:19:18.924
to help you keep going.

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:21.659
Because the Trump Presidency
is basically a marathon.

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:25.097
It's painful, it's pointless,
and the majority of you

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.531
didn't even agree to run it.

00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:28.600
You were just signed up by
your dumbest friend.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.401
And-- And the fact is

00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:33.305
we are not even at mile six
right now,

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:35.440
or possibly even mile three.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.509
So, there is a long way to go,

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.544
and though you're exhausted
and your whole body

00:19:39.644 --> 00:19:42.080
is screaming for you to give up,
and your nipples are chafing

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.117
for some reason,
the stakes are too high

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.851
for any of us to stop.

00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:48.853
And, I do realize that
I'm saying that

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.490
as we're about to stop doing
shows for the year.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.824
But-- But here's the thing,

00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:54.693
we won't actually
be going away entirely.

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.528
You might remember
earlier this year,

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.497
we used our "Catheter Cowboy"
to try and get information

00:19:59.597 --> 00:20:02.234
to the president in the
ad breaks of<i> Fox &amp; Friends.</i>

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.336
Well, Trump is still watching
that show and we know this

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:07.940
because<i> The Times</i> wrote
a generally negative piece

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.074
about its enormous
influence on him.

00:20:10.174 --> 00:20:11.709
And because of that called it

just 45 minutes after that
information was on Fox,

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:18.343
