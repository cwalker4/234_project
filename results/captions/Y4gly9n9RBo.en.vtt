00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.619
So a black guy walks into a bar -

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:22.390
sounds like the beginning of a bad joke;

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.548
I see people shifting around a little bit,

00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:25.689
but it gets better -

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.079
and the first thing he sees
is everybody else in there is white.

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.809
So he sits down at the piano
on the stage with the band, to play,

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.520
and on the band break,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.848
a white gentleman
comes up to him and says,

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:42.746
"You know, this is the first time

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:47.400
I ever heard a black man
play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis."

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:52.928
Well, the black pianist
tries to explain the black origin

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:57.469
of boogie woogie, rockabilly,
and rock and roll to this gentleman,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.040
but he didn't buy it.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.969
But he wanted to buy
this black guy a drink.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.749
So they went back to the table.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.127
He had a beer, the black guy
had a cranberry juice,

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:09.140
and they began talking.

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:14.801
And then the white gentleman says,
"You know, this is the first time

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:18.489
I ever sat down and had a drink
with a black man."

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:21.250
Well, the first thing
that occurs to the black guy is,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.711
this guy is having a night of firsts.

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.181
And when he asked
the white gentleman why -

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:29.881
how can that be? -

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:35.142
the white gentleman revealed
that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:40.371
Well, this guy
was having a night of firsts.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.801
My first experience with racism
occurred when I was 10 years old,

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.451
in 1968.

00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:52.411
My family had just moved
to a place called Belmont, Massachusetts,

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.021
and I was one of two black kids
in my entire school.

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:57.681
Ten years old in fourth grade.

00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:01.611
I joined the Cub Scouts,
and we had a parade, a march,

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:07.271
from Lexington to Concord, Massachusetts,
to commemorate the ride of Paul Revere.

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:11.951
Somewhere down the parade route,
as I was marching with my fellow scouts,

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.580
I began getting hit by bottles,
soda pop cans, rocks

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.226
and debris from the street

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:22.942
by a small group of white spectators
off to my right on the sidewalk.

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:27.529
I had no idea that I was
the only person getting hit

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.531
until my den mother
and other scout leaders

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:33.160
came rushing over and huddled
over me with their bodies

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.309
and escorted me out of the danger.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.339
And they never explained
why this was happening to me.

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.860
And I had no clue.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.024
When I got home,

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:46.459
my mom and dad were fixing me up
with Band-Aids and Mercuorchrome,

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:52.852
and they explained to me
why I was the target of these projectiles.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.043
At the age of 10,
I formed a question in my mind,

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.866
and that question was,

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:04.170
How can you hate me
when you don't even know me?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.151
So years later, here I am,

00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:11.852
a college graduate
with my degree in music,

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:13.751
and I'm sitting at a bar

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.772
at a table with a member of the KKK.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.311
I'd been seeking the answer
to that question for years,

00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.202
unable to find it.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.724
Now, here's my opportunity.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:32.352
For who better to ask than someone
who would join an organization

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:38.731
who historically, their premise has been
hating those who do not look like them

00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:41.093
and who do not believe as they believe?

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:42.952
Who better to answer that question,

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.004
How can you hate me
when you don't even know me?

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:53.531
I persuaded this Klan member
to give me the contact information

00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:56.521
for the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:58.942
He reluctantly provided it to me

00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:03.013
on the condition that I not reveal
where I got it from.

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:05.724
The Klan leader's name was Roger Kelly.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.342
I had my secretary contact Roger Kelly

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.351
because I decided
I wanted to write a book.

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:14.583
I wanted to sit down and interview
Klan leaders and Klan members

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.357
all around the country

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:18.872
and ask them that question.

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:23.254
So I was going to start right there
in Maryland, where I currently live.

00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:29.044
So I had her contact Roger Kelly
and not tell him that I was black

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:32.412
but ask him if he would consent
to sitting down with her boss

00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:34.354
and giving him an interview.

00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:35.793
So he agreed.

00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:39.104
I arranged a hotel room for us to meet in.

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:42.792
And when he arrived
with his armed bodyguard,

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:45.323
they were shocked to see that I was black.

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:47.373
And I could see apprehension on them.

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:50.582
And I stood up and went like this
to show I had nothing in my hands

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.154
and invited them in.

00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:54.682
They came in, Mr. Kelly took a seat,

00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:57.320
and the bodyguard
stood at attention to his right.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.152
He had his sidearm
right here in his holster.

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:03.623
And we started this interview process.

00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:05.315
Everything was going along fine.

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:09.384
He let me know that, indeed,
I was inferior

00:05:09.384 --> 00:05:10.764
due to the color of my skin -

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:12.553
that made me inferior.

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:16.646
But I wasn't there to fight with him,
I was there to learn from him

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.483
where these perceptions came from.

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:20.674
Because in order to address something,

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:24.075
you have to learn how
they got there in the first place.

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:25.495
So I'm listening.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:28.224
A little while later into this interview,

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:32.616
a strange noise occurred,
kind of a (Quack), and we all jumped.

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:37.416
And my eyes locked
with Roger Kelly's eyes.

00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:40.495
I knew he had made that noise
because I didn't make it.

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:45.649
And my eyes were silently asking him,
"What did you just do?"

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.534
Well, his eyes had fixated on mine,

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:52.425
and he was silently
asking me the same question.

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:55.024
The bodyguard had his hand on his gun,

00:05:55.024 --> 00:05:58.526
looking back and forth
between the Klan leader and myself,

00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:02.175
silently asking, "What did
either one of you all just do?"

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:05.985
Well, my secretary realized
what had happened.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:12.037
She had filled the ice bucket with ice
and put cans of soda in there

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.767
to be hospitable and offer
everybody beverages.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:18.035
Well, the ice bucket
was sitting on top of the dresser.

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.144
The ice had begun melting,

00:06:20.144 --> 00:06:23.047
and the cans of soda
cascaded down the ice,

00:06:23.047 --> 00:06:24.865
and that's what made the noise,

00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:27.675
and we all began laughing

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.994
at how ignorant we all were.

00:06:30.994 --> 00:06:34.063
But this was a teaching moment.

00:06:34.063 --> 00:06:36.886
I won't say anything
was learned at that moment,

00:06:36.886 --> 00:06:38.655
but a lesson was taught.

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:41.076
And that lesson was this:

00:06:41.396 --> 00:06:45.184
All because some "foreign" -

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:48.036
and underscore or highlight
the word "foreign" -

00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:50.616
entity of which we were ignorant,

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:52.987
that being the bucket
of ice and cans of soda,

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:57.634
entered into our little comfort zone
via the noise that it made,

00:06:57.634 --> 00:07:02.236
we became fearful
and accusatory of each other.

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:06.104
Thus, ignorance breeds fear.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.404
If we don't keep that fear in check,

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:12.886
that fear, in turn, will breed hatred

00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:15.887
because we hate
those things that frighten us.

00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:21.762
If we do not keep that hatred in check,
that hatred will breed destruction.

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:26.055
We want to destroy
those things that frighten us

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:27.707
and that we hate.

00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:29.364
But guess what.

00:07:29.364 --> 00:07:32.466
They may have been harmless,
and we were just ignorant.

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:37.475
So we saw the whole chain
almost unravel to completion

00:07:37.475 --> 00:07:39.482
had the bodyguard drawn his gun

00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:42.985
and destroyed either myself
or my secretary.

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.456
So like I said, we all began laughing
and carried on with the interview,

00:07:46.456 --> 00:07:48.543
and there were no more problems.

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:53.675
Over time, Mr. Kelly
would come down to my house

00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:55.845
and continue these interviews.

00:07:56.155 --> 00:07:59.576
He would even have dinner
and lunch at my table.

00:07:59.806 --> 00:08:03.006
Or we would go out
and have dinner and lunch.

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:06.196
Now, this was somebody
who considered himself superior

00:08:06.196 --> 00:08:07.856
and me inferior.

00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:09.806
We continued this relationship.

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:11.917
He did not invite me to his house.

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:15.966
But after a couple of years,
he began inviting me to his home.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:17.838
I would see his Klan den,

00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:20.757
and I'd take some pictures
and some more notes for my book.

00:08:20.757 --> 00:08:23.689
Then he began inviting me to Klan rallies.

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.525
I'd go to these Klan rallies
and watch these Klansmen and Klanswomen

00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:29.157
in their robes and hoods

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:32.809
parade around this big,
20- to 30-foot cross,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.796
set it on fire, and it would (Whoosh),

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:38.339
and they'd parade around
and give all these lectures -

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:40.298
take some more pictures and notes.

00:08:40.298 --> 00:08:43.159
Well, CNN wanted to do a story on this.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.387
They knew who I was through music,

00:08:45.387 --> 00:08:48.077
and they knew who Roger Kelly was
through the Klan.

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:53.187
So I'm going to show you this clip
that was shown every hour for 24 hours

00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:56.967
on CNN and on HLN all over the world.

00:08:56.967 --> 00:09:01.357
And I want you to pay particular attention
to what Mr. Kelly says.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:06.908
He says that even though he and I
would do different things together,

00:09:06.908 --> 00:09:11.277
it did not change his views on the Klan,

00:09:11.277 --> 00:09:16.527
because his views on the Klan
had been cemented in his mind for years.

00:09:16.527 --> 00:09:20.950
And then he goes on to say how he believes
in separation of the races.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.547
But also listen
to what he says about respect,

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:27.006
and then listen
to the commentary at the end

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:29.475
that the two CNN anchorpeople give.

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.107
Show the video please.

00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:34.056
(Video) [CNN Sunday Morning]

00:09:35.977 --> 00:09:38.986
Bob Cain: Welcome to this final hour
of CNN Sunday morning.

00:09:38.986 --> 00:09:41.821
I'm Bob Cain, in today for Miles O'Brien.

00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:44.158
Joie Chen: Good morning
to you all. I'm Joie Chen.

00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:46.648
BC: Friendship can transcend
all kinds of boundaries.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:47.698
JC: Just look at us.

00:09:47.698 --> 00:09:49.329
And two men in the Washington area

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:51.429
are showing that even
an African American man

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:54.288
and a member of the Ku Klux Klan
can find common ground.

00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:56.289
CNN's Carl Rochelle reports.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:57.309
(Piano music)

00:09:57.309 --> 00:09:59.288
CR: Daryl Davis plays a hot piano.

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:02.290
It's part of the show,
and it makes him stand out.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.908
(Boogie woogie piano music)

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:08.128
He also stands out here.

00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:13.568
Davis is one of the few African Americans
you will ever find attending a KKK rally.

00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:15.777
More than attending, he is welcome.

00:10:15.777 --> 00:10:18.128
Roger Kelly: I got more respect
for that black man

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:20.099
than I do you white niggers out there.

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:21.828
(Shouting)

00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:23.697
CR: It's been a tough day for the Klan.

00:10:23.697 --> 00:10:25.890
Their Maryland rally
found many local residents

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.411
rejecting the message of white separatism.

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.349
After it's over, Daryl Davis
hangs around backstage

00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:34.039
with his friend, Klan wizard Roger Kelly.

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:36.360
(Chatter)

00:10:38.128 --> 00:10:41.520
It's not unusual for blacks
and whites to be friends,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.359
but it is unusual to find a black man
and a Klan leader chatting pleasantly

00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:48.567
over an orange soda after a Klan rally.

00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:51.669
The relationship started
over a book Davis was writing.

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:54.620
His secretary set up
an interview with Roger Kelly

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.578
but didn't tell him Davis was black.

00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:58.699
They talked, and talked some more.

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:02.068
Davis learning about the Klan;
Kelly learning about Davis.

00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:05.338
RK: We get to know one another,
and we do different things, you know.

00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:07.779
It hasn't changed my views
about the Klan, you know,

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:11.458
because my views on the Klan's been
pretty much cemented in my mind for years.

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:14.450
CRF: Kelly and his Klan friends
go to hear Davis and his band.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.429
(Boogie woogie band music)

00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:21.778
And Davis goes to their rallies.

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:26.769
Daryl Davis: I sat on the front row,
and I listened to each Klansman speak.

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:29.911
Some things I agreed with;
other things I did not agree with.

00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:33.390
CRF: Davis thinks that his presence
promotes badly needed understanding.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.008
DD: Hate stems, I believe, from fear,

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.000
from fear of the unknown,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.213
and I think this is all across the board,

00:11:40.213 --> 00:11:42.779
regardless of whether
it's the Klansmen or anything else.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.929
CR: But he has
no illusions about the Klan.

00:11:44.929 --> 00:11:47.911
If he did, his friend
would be quick to disabuse them.

00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:49.868
RK: I believe in separation of the races.

00:11:49.868 --> 00:11:52.250
I believe that's in
the best interest of all races.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.391
CR: Does he really?

00:11:53.391 --> 00:11:55.930
Or has friendship
transcended the color barrier?

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.350
Listen to Kelly at a Klan rally.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.358
RK: I will follow
that man to hell and back

00:12:00.358 --> 00:12:03.980
because I believe in what he stands for,
and he believes in what I stand for.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.121
A lot of times
we don't agree with everything,

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.811
but at least he respects me
to sit down and listen to me.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:11.159
And I respect him
to sit down and listen to him.

00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:15.531
CR: The strange relationship
of a KKK wizard and his black buddy.

00:12:15.531 --> 00:12:19.761
In Washington, I'm Carl Rochelle,
CNN Sunday Morning.

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:21.840
BC: Strange.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.380
It's a good adjective - strange.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.441
JC: Certainly that.

00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:25.440
(Video ends)

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.600
DD: Okay.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.119
You heard the Klan leader say
that he respected me.

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:32.821
What's up with that?

00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:35.210
He's the Klan leader. I'm a black guy.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.991
He said, "We may not agree on everything,

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.690
but at least he respects me
to sit down and listen to me,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.949
and I respect him
to sit down and listen to him.

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:44.011
Very important, folks.

00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:46.049
If you have an adversary,

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:49.090
you don't have to respect
what they're saying,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.232
but respect their right to say it.

00:12:51.232 --> 00:12:53.059
And have that conversation.

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:56.720
We spend too much time
talking about each other,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.872
at each other,

00:12:57.872 --> 00:12:59.031
past each other,

00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:02.461
and not enough time
talking with each other.

00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:03.971
That is respect.

00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:04.991
Okay?

00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.059
(Applause)

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:07.070
Thank you.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.361
And as a result of that respect,

00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:11.701
over time,

00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:15.013
Mr. Kelly began rethinking his ideology,

00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:20.072
and that cement that held his ideas
together in his mind for so long

00:13:20.072 --> 00:13:23.302
began to crack and crumble
and then fall apart.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.722
And then just a few years back,

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.913
Mr. Kelly decided
to give up the Ku Klux Klan -

00:13:28.913 --> 00:13:32.701
he renounced it
and gave me his robe and hood.

00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:35.612
This is the robe of the Klan leader!

00:13:35.612 --> 00:13:36.733
(Applause)

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:37.801
Right here.

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:42.382
This is the same robe
you saw him wearing in the video.

00:13:43.401 --> 00:13:46.902
And of course, this is the hood and mask.

00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:52.022
Keep in mind, when two enemies
are talking, they're not fighting,

00:13:52.022 --> 00:13:53.051
they're talking.

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:56.154
They might be yelling and screaming,
but at least they're talking.

00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:57.952
It's when the talking ceases

00:13:57.952 --> 00:14:00.343
that the ground
becomes fertile for violence.

00:14:00.343 --> 00:14:02.442
So keep the conversation going.

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:05.484
People learn racism through dialogue.

00:14:05.484 --> 00:14:07.532
Somebody tells them about it.

00:14:07.532 --> 00:14:09.453
So if you can learn it through dialogue,

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.823
you can also unlearn it through dialogue.

00:14:12.053 --> 00:14:14.412
So a black guy walks into a bar,

00:14:15.092 --> 00:14:17.013
sits down at the piano,

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:19.183
and then a conversation starts.

00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:23.673
(Boogie woogie piano music)

00:16:00.464 --> 00:16:02.885
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

00:16:02.885 --> 00:16:04.635
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:16:05.795 --> 00:16:06.843
That's -

00:16:06.843 --> 00:16:08.003
Thank you.

00:16:08.003 --> 00:16:09.013
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:16:09.013 --> 00:16:10.094
Thank you.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.404
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:15.594
Thank you.
