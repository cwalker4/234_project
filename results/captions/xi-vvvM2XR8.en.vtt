00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
There are news from the Milky Way
and dwarf galaxies:

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.840
It could be, we know what dark matter is.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.520
I wouldnt have thought that,
you probably either

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.780
Dark matter: this is one of
dark chapter of astronomy, because ...

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.100
Although ... you know that

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.440
it´s there, that it must be there,
that there is an effect that can be measured,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.440
but you do not know what it is.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.700
Here again for all those who are not on a daily basis deal with the dark matter:

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.000
There are patterns of movement

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.700
of luminous matter, that's the stuff as you
and I, therefore, electrons, protons and neutrons,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.740
you can even just understand
the movement patterns,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.820
if there something is, 
that does not radiate, but is heavy.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.740
A typical example is the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.000
Rotation curve of a galaxy like our Milky Way.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.520
Normally, so if you are far enough
away of the galaxy,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.040
then this curve, the speed,
with which something rotates around the center,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.640
should gradually decrease with radius.
This is called Keppler rotation.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.200
For all those who wanna look for it with a search engine 
- whose name must not be mentioned -: Keppler rotation.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.060
That's what you expect when you

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.300
have a dominant source of gravity

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.880
and that moves to this dominant source of gravity,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.720
so to speak, is only  test mass.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.880
And of course that´s a gas cloud, for example,
which is far enough away from the center of a galaxy.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.660
So that should at its rate of rotation,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.880
the further it is away from the galaxy,
 get slower.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.200
And what is to measure?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.820
Exactly the opposite!
Will not slow down!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.920
The rotation speed remains

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.820
from a certain radius at a high level.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.480
That's even understandable, 
this kind of high rotational speed,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.180
if anything the matter, to ...
So when something accelerates the matter ...
it must be a ...

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.080
a Halo - call the astronomers that - act.
So to create an atmosphere

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.300
of matter which is not visible at all,
do not even do one thing above all,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.900
namely to absorb radiation.
Could well be dust, for example,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.400
So very fine dust and which would virtually

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.200
as accelerate the luminous matter with a ... with its mass. But is not!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.800
Nope, no dust!

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.860
You can practically see the galaxy so
you can even see very distant galaxies as they are.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.460
This is clearly a form of matter,
which in no way

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.960
electromagnetically interacts.
So, neither the radiation

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.040
absorbed nor emitted. And that is the dark matter! I want to take another example,
then really aground top form:

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.980
This is the hot gas around galaxies 
Hot gas is natural

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.840
hot ...  gas, accurate, and hot gas has a tendency to disappear actually.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.880
If you turn thinks to it,
so you water is boiling on the stove,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.660
then one can see, how the steam disappears. Indeed! Because temperature has something to do with
kinetic, ie with

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.060
kinetic energy. And actually the hot gas surrounding large galaxies should already be gone, because the hot gas is so hot

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.740
that it is so quickly, that it actually would long ago have to be gone.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.660
But it is not going away! And? Why is that?
It is because the gravitational potential

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.280
is made not only by the luminous matter, but above all by the dark matter.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.060
The ... the one that pushes so deep, now time for all
Specialists of general relativity,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:28.700
in the space-time that the hot gas does not come out. Finally, we know that there are dark matter and in the clearest of course, by the ...

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.500
... gravitational lens effect of dark matter. Yes.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.460
Yes, it's like this, that the presence of mass so bends the light paths, again for all those engaged in the general theory of relativity

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.220
know that know the course.
That's the general theory of relativity!

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.680
That the presence of masses changes the geometry and on the surface of this space-time,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.320
since moving so happens to the light.
So, if dark matter should be there, then ...

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.040
... the light paths would indeed bend.
It would have to come to the gravitational lens effect

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.140
and doing it all along. It is even so today,
that from the distribution of

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.100
Gravitational lenses in the sky, so the warped images of galaxies, can infer the distribution of dark matter.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.180
So we know an awful lot about dark matter,
only one we do not know: What does it consist?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000
We know it has to ...

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.150
... it must be to ...

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.280
... cold ...

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.180
... Dark Matter act.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.700
is called "cold", the particles of which it consists,
which must be difficult, because heavy particles,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.260
as we all know, dealing with the
Relativity know and those are probably all now ...

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.440
Yes, that is particles that have 'ne mass that can not move at the speed of light.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.460
And everything that is smaller than the speed of light,
this can be described as quasi "cold".

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.980
If 'n particles having
or to move the speed of light close,
then the hot dark matter would be.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.120
Why cold? Why cold? Now,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.580
only cold dark matter can clump so,
So you can then come together under the gravitational interaction,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.300
they must indeed have. It may indeed have only no electromagnetic interaction.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.140
So under their own gravity, they may collapse and therefore they are now so small

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.260
generates gravitational potentials ... Why?
Well, because there are dwarf galaxies.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.520
Dwarf galaxies are galaxies that are smaller than normal galaxies, so they are called dwarf galaxies.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.600
So, so you hinkriegt such small, small galaxies, dark matter must

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.480
can condense, it must

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.760
can come together. And she could not if she had incredibly high speeds.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.160
Scary high speeds we need
for galaxy clusters, for large,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.220
for ... But here at the dwarf galaxies,
there are things very different and precisely in the dwarf galaxy and in the Milky Way

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.580
has but now more recently the evidence, so we say, reinforces the evidence, it could actually

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.220
the particles to be found, from which the cold dark matter. These are the so-called ...

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.900
... I say the time now: Neutralinos.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.800
I mean, neutrinos are known already from our world from our normal world.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.620
Those are relatively light particles produced in nuclear reactions such as in the sun.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.620
As I always like to say here by our,
so many neutrinos fly so by my thumbnail per second from the sun

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.720
like the Milky Way star has,
just under 100 billion.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.120
Nee, on Neutralinos as it comes to particles
coming from a completely different era of the cosmos.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.160
Back then...
... it was the year,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.940
yes, you not once wrote 'n years, you do not even wrote a sec, you do not even wrote' ne thousandths or 'ne hundred thousandth of a second,

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.100
you wrote a trillionth part of a second!
A nanosecond, a trillionth of a second!
At that time the Neutralinos emerged.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.840
In a very early stage in the cosmos than the symmetry which, in the early cosmos was equality so high

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.400
that you do not even between matter particles
could differ and force particles.
We can today.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.620
There are four forces and these four forces include four power brokers. One of them is the photon,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.080
another is the ...

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.240
... are the particles that mediate the strong force in 'NEM nucleus together.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:07.240
But above all, there's the particles that make up matter. And the Neutralinos come from
a time when you do not between

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.360
Fermions - these are the particles that make up the material - and bosons, which are the particles,
mediate the forces

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.580
could differ. This is called the theory:

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.360
Supersymmetry. At the very beginning of the cosmos.
And when the universe was getting colder,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.780
since the Neutralinos would quasi

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.540
fallen like so snow crystals from the cosmic evolution.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840
And these Neutralinos,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.980
that would be the ideal candidate, according to the theory,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.980
for the dark matter. For the cold dark matter.
They were about 100, maybe 200 times heavier than protons.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:49.740
And ... they were their own antiparticles and could destroy. If they would destroy, then, would this thing occur?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.480
Of course, all ...

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.500
... expert on quantum electrodynamics and the theory of relativity know when particles annihilate each other, the result is gamma radiation.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.980
And here we are with today's observations:
There is a surplus

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920
of gamma radiation in the Milky Way

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.960
and a surplus
of gamma radiation in a dwarf galaxy

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.900
and an excess of gamma radiation

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.380
in a spectrometer in the international,
on the International Space Station.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.320
All three together now suggest the following scenario:

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.020
that actually Neutralinos to
a considerable extent,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.800
as the saying goes, annihilate.
This is nothing indecent. So, they destry themselves.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.220
This produces gamma radiation.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.760
And how do you know that?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.440
Well, you summed together in a sense that gamma sources we know because in the Milky Way?
There's so few:

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.200
There's the supernova remnants, then there is the

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.680
the neutron star, so those are stellar remnants,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.360
above all, produce gamma radiation. There are also black holes that produce gamma rays.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.880
That is, you know all these point sources. If they are then ausaddiert,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
one realizes we see in the Milky Way

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.520
too much gamma radiation. Now one could say: Well, maybe you

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.360
not yet discovered one or the other or population or population of neutron stars.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:13.180
That's why we look in dwarf galaxies.
And since it is particularly interesting,
because there's not that many neutron stars.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.820
And there you will find now also
an excess of gamma radiation.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.660
And that, together with the test result on the International Space Station,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.620
could mean that we can say afterwards:

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:32.800
We have been here as at that time the Neutralinos, the particles of dark matter,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.360
from which the dark matter consists build.
That would be a real breakthrough!

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.440
It condense the information that we riddle the dark side of the universe

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.680
actually dissolve. I think it's great!
I have to say honestly. Wow!
