00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.602
Ms. Sanders: Good afternoon.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.173
Today, I had
the opportunity to visit

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.909
the National Safety
Council's Opioid Memorial

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.144
on the Ellipse.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.579
It's a moving experience.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.814
President Trump
and the First Lady

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.416
encourage you all
to visit the memorial

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.219
before it leaves Washington,
D.C. on April 18th.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.857
Today at the Summit
of Americas in Lima, Peru,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.393
Assistant to the President
and Advisor Ivanka Trump,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.929
Overseas Private
Investment Corporation,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.664
and the Acting U.S.
Secretary of State

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.200
announced OPIC's 2X
Americas Latin

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.103
American women's initiative
-- say that fast --

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.406
which will mobilize $500 million

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.708
in private capital
to invest in projects

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.743
that empower women
in Latin America.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.546
This new initiative
will help break down barriers

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.416
that limit women's full
participation in the economy

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.352
and reaffirms the Trump
administration's commitment

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.320
to empowering women
in Latin America

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.789
and around the globe.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.690
As you all saw,
yesterday's confirmation

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.660
hearing for Secretary
of State-designee Mike Pompeo

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.061
went very well.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.697
From his years in the Army,
to his time as a key member

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.566
of the House
Intelligence Committee,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.935
to his successful tenure
as CIA Director,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.138
Secretary-designee
Pompeo has excelled

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.740
as one of the nation's
key leaders

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.942
in national security
and foreign policy.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.978
As a result of Mike
Pompeo's leadership,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:22.682
America has been safer, more
secure, and more prosperous.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.318
There is absolutely
no legitimate reason

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.288
that Secretary-designee
Pompeo's confirmation process

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.357
should not be done in a speedy
and bipartisan manner.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.294
Even the Washington
Post editorial board --

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.429
hardly a cheerleader
for this administration --

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.965
published an editorial
yesterday with a simple,

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.900
straight-to-the-point headline:

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.502
 Confirm Mike Pompeo. 

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.737
Democrats and Republicans
should do

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.506
exactly that by coming together

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.308
and doing what is,
without question,

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.676
the right thing
for our country.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.878
And with that, I will
take your questions.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:52.412
Cecilia.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.379
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.849
The President came
out swinging today,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.285
calling James Comey a "liar,"
a "leaker," a "slime ball."

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.654
Is he worried about
what he's saying?

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:03.490
Ms. Sanders: Not at all.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.725
The American people see
right through the blatant

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.094
lies of a self-admitted leaker.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.463
This is nothing more
than a poorly executed

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.198
PR stunt by Comey

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.335
to desperately rehabilitate
his tattered reputation

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.404
and enrich his own bank account
by peddling a book

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.374
that belongs on the bargain bin
of the fiction section.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.877
Instead of being remembered
as a dedicated servant

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.445
in the pursuit of justice

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.214
like so many of his other
colleagues at the FBI,

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.518
Comey will be forever known
as a disgraced partisan

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.586
hack that broke
his sacred trust

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.555
with the President
of the United States,

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.624
the dedicated agents of the FBI,

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:40.627
and the American people
he vowed to faithfully serve.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.795
One of the President's
greatest achievements

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.864
will go down as firing
Director James Comey.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.633
The Press: And another topic,
quickly, if I may.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.535
The Deputy Attorney General
was here yesterday.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.670
Is the President going
to fire Rod Rosenstein?

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.705
Ms. Sanders: I don't have
any announcements at this time.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.741
The President has voiced
some frustrations,

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.175
but beyond that,
I don't have anything to add.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.277
John.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.112
The Press: Sarah, the President,
a short time ago,

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.914
issued a pardon
of Scooter Libby,

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.516
the former Vice President's
Chief of Staff.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.685
There are many people
who believe that Scooter Libby

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.055
was the victim of a Special
Counsel investigation run amuck.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.191
The recent statements that we
have heard from the White House

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.395
would seem to indicate that you
feel much the same thing

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:16.930
about the Mueller investigation.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.899
Was the President sending
some sort of signal

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.035
to the Mueller investigation

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.770
or about the Mueller
investigation

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.104
by pardoning Scooter Libby?

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.406
Ms. Sanders: Not at all.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.174
One thing has nothing
to do with the other,

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.443
and every case should be
reviewed on their own merits.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.147
Pardoning Libby was
the right thing to do,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.050
after the principal witness
recanted her testimony.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.651
The D.C. Court of Appeals panel

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.154
unanimously voted to restore
Mr. Libby's bar

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.923
membership after being
presented credible evidence

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.059
in support of his
version of events.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.494
And it appears that that
key prosecution witness,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.263
Judith Miller,
changed her recollection

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.564
of the events in question.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.600
The Press: In the statement,
the pardoning statement today,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.169
the President acknowledges
he doesn't know Scooter Libby.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.604
What was it that convinced him

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.039
that Scooter Libby
deserved a pardon?

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.307
Ms. Sanders: The President
thought it was the right thing

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:01.908
to do.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.142
Justin.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.410
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.
I have two questions.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.745
I wanted to ask
about the first --

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.380
The President,
at the beginning of the week,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.748
said he expected a decision --

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.216
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, can you
speak up a little?

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:11.751
The Press: Sure, the President,
at the beginning of the week,

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.154
said he expected a decision
within 24 to 48 hours on Syria.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.991
On Tuesday, he said a decision
would probably come that night.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.895
But here we are on Friday,
and in a statement last night,

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.665
you said that no final
decision had been reached.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.200
So, I'm wondering
if you could walk through

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.070
why the President hasn't met
his own timeline there,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.007
and specifically, if it had
anything to do with the,

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.642
sort of, Syrian troop movement

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.344
that we saw after
his tweet on Wednesday,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.146
sort of threatening
a missile strike.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.314
Ms. Sanders: 
No, we're continuing to have

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.715
ongoing conversations

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.317
with our partners and allies.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.786
The President spoke with
President Macron of France,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.221
again, earlier today.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.157
We're continuing
to have ongoing meetings

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.825
and conversations here
at the White House.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.360
And when we have
any further developments,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.795
we'll let you know.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.297
The Press: And then, because
it's Friday, I'm wondering if --

00:04:58.297 --> 00:04:59.399
Ms. Sanders: Friday the 13th.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.266
The Press: Yeah.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.534
(Laughter.)

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:02.735
You could walk us

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:03.936
through exactly
what the President has --

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.438
Ms. Sanders: You guys all groan
like that's a bad thing.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.940
The Press: -- committed
to Senator Gardner

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.942
in terms of both what
the Justice Department would do

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.844
and what the White House
would do in terms

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:13.112
of supporting legislation

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.882
on states that
legalize marijuana.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.216
Ms. Sanders: I can confirm
the President

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:20.753
did speak with Senator Gardner
yesterday and again today.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.556
We're always consulting
Congress about issues,

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:24.857
including states' rights,

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.993
of which the President
is a firm believer.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.327
And the statement
that the Senator

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.296
put out earlier
today is accurate.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.731
Steve.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.733
The Press: You mentioned he's
spoken to President Macron.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.601
How big a coalition does he have

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.271
for this expected
action in Syria?

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.106
Ms. Sanders: Again, I can't talk
about anything

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.474
that may or may not happen,

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.309
but I can tell you
that the President

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.479
and a number of individuals
within his administration

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.614
have spoken to a number
of our partners

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.150
and allies at various
levels across the world.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.388
The Press: And is he satisfied
now that Syria was responsible

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.622
for the chemical weapons attack?

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.559
Ms. Sanders: Yes,
we're, again, confident

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.561
that both Syria

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.329
had responsibility

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:04.697
in this chemical
weapons attack,

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:08.434
but we also hold Russia
responsible for their failure

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.169
to stop chemical
weapons attacks

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.504
from taking place.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:12.672
Josh.

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:15.608
The Press: It was reported today
that Michael Cohen,

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:16.743
the President's
personal attorney,

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:19.679
helped negotiate
a $1.6 million settlement

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.548
to a Playboy playmate.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.117
It also emerged, today,

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.152
that Michael Cohen is under
criminal investigation

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.954
by the Southern
District of New York.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:30.656
Is the President still
associated with Michael Cohen?

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.659
Does he continue to
consider Michael Cohen

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.695
someone he holds in confidence?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.064
Ms. Sanders: I know that the
President has worked with him

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:39.165
as a personal attorney.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.267
Beyond that, I don't have
anything else to add

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.735
about their relationship.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.137
The Press: Is he concerned
about these developments?

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.571
Would the President like
to say anything about them?

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:46.739
Ms. Sanders: Look, the President
has been clear

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.207
that he has a deep concern

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.042
about the direction
the Special Counsel has taken.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.978
The investigation started
as Russia collusion,

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.346
of which there was none.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.481
The President has spoken
on this topic at length,

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.250
and I'd refer you back
to those comments.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.818
The Press: What about Michael
Cohen's actions, though?

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.920
Does the President have
any concern with those?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.255
Ms. Sanders: Again,
I would refer you

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.123
to Michael Cohen's
personal attorney.

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.424
That's simply reports right now,

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:06.759
but I can't get
anything beyond that.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.960
Jill.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.362
The Press: Just a follow-up
on that and then another topic.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.397
Is Cohen still the President's
personal attorney?

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.032
Ms. Sanders: I'm not sure, Jill,
I'd have to check.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.367
The Press: And I wanted to ask --

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.635
Ms. Sanders: I can only speak
about White House staff.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.969
The Press: It looks like
Paul Ryan just endorsed

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.605
Kevin McCarthy for Speaker
in an appearance,

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.440
or an interview,
with "Meet the Press."

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.176
Does the President believe
that McCarthy should be

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.544
the next Speaker?

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.078
Ms. Sanders: The President has
a great relationship

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.013
with Kevin McCarthy.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:29.515
But in terms of an announcement

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.384
about who he wants to see
as the next Speaker,

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.852
I don't have any announcements
on that front.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:33.686
Jon.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.388
The Press: On
the James Comey book,

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.123
some excerpts came out today.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.025
He speaks of the President --

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.562
writes about the President
in very personal terms.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.397
Were you surprised by that?

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.232
Was the President
surprised by that?

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.835
Ms. Sanders: I don't think
we're surprised by the fact

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:54.473
that James Comey continues
to spread false information.

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:56.275
The guy is known to be
a liar and a leaker,

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.344
and so there's not a lot
about James Comey

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.346
that we would find
to be very surprising.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:02.181
The Press: And just really
quickly on the pardon

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.784
that came out today
for Scooter Libby.

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.286
The President, so far
in his time in office,

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.956
has issued three
presidential pardons.

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.626
One of those was to Joe Arpaio.
Is there a commonality,

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.361
in terms of what
the President looks for

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.430
when he pardons individuals?

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.565
Ms. Sanders: Again, every case

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.367
should be reviewed
on their own merits,

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.135
and that's what the President
has done in each of those.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:24.003
Steven.

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.204
The Press: Yes, Sarah.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.540
I'm wondering if
the administration has reacted

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.110
with any message to Moscow
after officials there

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.715
today said that the chemical
attack in Douma was faked

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:38.985
and staged with Britain's
direct involvement.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.989
Ms. Sanders: Certainly, our
intelligence tells us otherwise.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.090
I can't go beyond that.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.526
But again, we have
a very high confidence

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.395
that Syria was responsible.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:54.133
And once again,
Russia's failure to stop them

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:58.504
and their continued
disaction on this front

00:08:58.504 --> 00:08:59.739
has been part of the problem.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.140
April.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.776
The Press: Sarah, what part does
the President bringing Russia

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.077
into the Syria equation

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:09.715
now cause for the delay
in the strike timeline?

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.517
Ms. Sanders: Again,
we are continuing to have

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:12.785
ongoing conversations

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.721
with partners and allies,
assess the information.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.790
And once a decision is made,
we'll let you know.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.724
Dave.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:19.959
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.394
The Justice Department
Inspector General

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:25.031
came out with his long-awaited
report this afternoon

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:28.167
on former FBI Deputy Director
Andrew McCabe,

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.404
saying that he improperly
leaked information

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.206
about the Clinton Foundation
investigation to a reporter,

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.976
and then lied
to James Comey about it

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:39.845
and, under oath,
to two FBI investigators.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.213
Do you have a reaction to that?

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.982
And does that, in your mind,

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.484
validate the decision
to fire McCabe?

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.186
Ms. Sanders: I haven't seen
the full report,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.923
but it sounds like two peas
in a pod with McCabe and Comey.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.193
McCabe was fired in disgrace for
misconduct and lying about it.

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:56.195
Beyond that, I don't have
anything at this point.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:57.263
Francesca.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.531
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:03.536
You said that James Comey
was a liar, that he's a leaker,

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.906
that he made false
representations or claims.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.841
Other than what the President
tweeted this morning

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.243
about lying under oath
to Senator Grassley,

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:14.347
what exactly has he said
that's false or a lie?

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.581
Ms. Sanders: Comey
claimed reopening

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.216
the Clinton investigation

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.985
when he did was based on merit.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.754
Now he says it was based
because of poll numbers.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.057
Comey claimed the President told
him to stop investigating Flynn,

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.659
after he previously testified

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.928
that no one told him
to stop investigations.

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:32.131
He also -- even the media
has reported

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.067
that officials have determined
that Comey leaked four memos --

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:38.304
at least four that we know about
-- with classified information.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.440
I think it's very clear that
Comey has a credibility problem.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.375
The other thing is clear,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.710
this is one of the few
issues in Washington

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.346
that both Democrats
and Republicans agree on.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.382
He's been criticized
by the legal community

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:52.284
for leaking sensitive
information and organizations

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:53.619
promoting good government found

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:56.355
Comey's leaking
grounds for firing.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:59.091
Multiple Democrats, including
some of the biggest leaders

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.528
in the Democrat party
have also attacked Comey.

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.663
Minority Leader
Pelosi said Comey,

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.399
was  maybe not
in the right job. 

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.869
Senator Schumer said he was,
 appalled by what Comey did 

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.471
and  did not have confidence
in him any longer. 

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.206
Senator Bernie Sanders
said Comey

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:16.442
 acted in an outrageous way. 

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.878
Clinton's running mate,
Senator Kaine, said Comey is,

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:20.679
 responsible for
the lowest moment

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.648
in the history of the FBI. 

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.485
Even Congresswoman Maxine Waters
said Comey has "no credibility."

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:30.189
The FBI should be independent
and not led by a political hack.

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.826
Comey's higher loyalty is pretty
clear that it's only to himself.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.795
If you can get
this group of people

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.229
and others like Mark Meadows

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.265
and a number of others
to agree on something,

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.699
I think that you'd
have to be right.

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.201
The Press: Sarah, what about
the dossier, though?

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.436
Sarah, what about the dossier?

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.838
Did he also lie
about the dossier

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:48.174
in his conversation
with President Trump about that?

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.609
Ms. Sanders: The dossier is
false opposition research

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.745
that was funded by
the Clinton campaign

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.146
to attack the President.

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:57.216
It was used illegally to
justify spying on Americans.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.185
And I think that's
quite the problem.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.352
Jim.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:02.888
The Press: Sarah,
what about the content

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.591
of the President's
attacks on Jim Comey,

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.692
your attacks on Jim Comey?

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:10.262
Isn't all of that a bit
unbecoming of the Presidency

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.730
of this White House

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.033
to go after him in such
a personal way like that?

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:15.734
Ms. Sanders: I think it --

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:16.669
The Press: Calling him
a "slime ball"

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:17.736
and a "liar" and a "leaker?"

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.305
Ms. Sanders: I think it's
unbecoming for the person

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.573
that is supposed
to be the top

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.942
law enforcement official
in the United States,

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:25.177
the person that is
supposed to protect

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.445
the people of this country,

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.882
to lie and leak
classified information,

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.784
certainly to falsify documents.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.719
I think that's
a very big problem,

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:37.356
and somebody who has created
this problem for himself.

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:41.360
I didn't encourage Jim Comey
to go out and do a PR campaign.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.997
Congress has asked Jim Comey to
come and testify multiple times,

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.099
of which he's denied
being able to do.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.968
Yet he found time to sit down

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:51.237
with George Stephanopoulos
for five hours.

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.706
I think if anybody
has created this problem,

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:56.175
it's Jim Comey and he should be
the one held responsible.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.376
The Press: Sarah, if I could
just follow up --

00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.178
Ms. Sanders: I'm going to keep
moving, for the second time.

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:00.613
The Press: Other folks had two
questions. If I could just --

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.780
Ms. Sanders: Sure.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.848
The Press: -- ask a second
follow-up question because --

00:13:02.848 --> 00:13:04.183
Ms. Sanders: Because
it's Friday.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:05.484
The Press: Well,
it's Friday, yeah. And you've --

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:06.485
Ms. Sanders: And you'd
probably get really upset,

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:07.653
and I don't need
that if I did.

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:08.821
The Press: No, no, no,
not at all, not at all.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.089
(Laughter.)

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.690
No, but you've probably
seen this tweet.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.760
It was a tweet that you posted
before the election in 2016,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.262
"When you're attacking
FBI agents

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:19.665
because you're under criminal
investigation, you're losing."

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:24.103
What do you make of that now --
isn't that --

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.371
Ms. Sanders: The rank-and-file
FBI

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.540
are some of the greatest
people in this country.

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.643
We've repeated that
time and time again,

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.345
and certainly have the full
support of this administration.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.314
I think that we've been
very clear, though,

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:37.583
how we feel about
some of the leadership

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.485
at the FBI,
particularly James Comey.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.053
The Press: But when you go after
Comey and Rosenstein

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.421
and Mueller,
doesn't that mean you're losing?

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.656
Ms. Sanders: I did give you two,
Jim. I'm going to keep moving.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.690
Go ahead.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.791
The Press: Following up
with that, I mean,

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.992
one of the themes
of Comey's book

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.394
is the President's "disdain"

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.528
for the rule of the law
and his continued efforts

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:52.064
to publicly undermine federal
law enforcement officials.

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:54.066
So, how would you characterize
the President's attitude

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.935
towards the rule
of law and things

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.536
that he said publicly
about many of his

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:59.271
top federal law
enforcement officials?

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:00.839
Ms. Sanders: The President
has a great deal of respect

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.775
for the rule of law,

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:05.511
but the President does not have
a lot of respect for people

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.514
whose sole job is
to carry out the law

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.216
and they leak
classified information

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.351
and they lie to
the American public about it.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.352
The Press: But it's not
just leakers;

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.386
it's his own Attorney General,

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:15.854
it's his own
Deputy Attorney General,

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.189
it's Special Counsel,
it's the FBI,

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.158
it's judges who make decisions
that he doesn't like.

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:21.927
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry, I'm not
-- what was the question?

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.696
The Press: There's a whole list
of federal law enforcement

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.064
officials
that he has undermined.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:27.299
It's not just people who have
proven to leak information.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.068
Ms. Sanders: The President
hasn't undermined them

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.036
in any capacity.

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.938
Just because he calls out things

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:36.475
that he finds to be
problematic or concerning,

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:37.876
I think that he should do that.

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:41.247
If members of the FBI are
leaking classified information,

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.849
the President should absolutely
call that to question.

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:47.553
You guys spend hours upon hours
every single day

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.854
praising Jim Comey,

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.824
propping him up, giving him
the biggest platform.

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.460
We shouldn't be praising him;
we should be putting him down,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.295
we should be taking
him off of air,

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.097
instead of giving him
minute after minute.

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:00.366
This country has a lot
of real problems.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.034
We should be talking
about the economy.

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.636
We should talk about Syria.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.204
We should talk about
the drug crisis.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.406
But instead, we're going
to talk about Jim Comey.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.275
You guys will cover
it endlessly,

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:11.377
all day today, all day tomorrow,

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:14.680
and my guess is every day
next week with very little time

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.649
given to the issues
that people care about.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.018
So, the President has
every right to call out

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:19.818
that individual

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.453
that you guys are propping up,

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:22.755
and say that there are problems

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.290
and that we should be
concerned about it.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.624
Charlie.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:27.426
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.495
This morning,
James Comey admitted

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:31.163
that he didn't tell
the President

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.398
about the political source --

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.533
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry.
Can you speak up?

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:35.834
The Press: This morning,
James Comey said

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.436
that he didn't inform
the President

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.672
of the political source
of the dossier.

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.774
Was the President
surprised to hear that?

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:44.410
Did Director Comey
ever tell him

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.212
about the sourcing of the
political dossier against him?

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.082
Ms. Sanders: I'm not sure about
that specific conversation,

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:55.521
but I know that it's been
documented many times over now

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.324
that the dossier is
false opposition research

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.658
funded by the Clinton campaign

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.593
and used to attack
the President. I think --

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.228
The Press: And a second
question, because it's Friday.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.831
Did the President
speak to former

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.232
Vice President Dick Cheney

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:10.636
about the Scooter Libby pardon
either before or after it --

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.671
Ms. Sanders: I'm not aware of
any conversations on that.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:13.238
John.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:14.873
The Press: Yeah.
Thank you, Sarah.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.943
Three Republican state
senators from Missouri

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.712
wrote the President yesterday

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:24.483
saying that the embattled
Governor Eric Greitens

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.218
should resign from office.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.122
He has serious charges
of sexual abuse against him,

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.991
faces impeachment,
and refuses to resign.

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:36.528
They concluded that,
as a former Navy SEAL,

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:37.996
he would salute and resign

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.898
if his Commander-in-Chief
asked him to.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:41.934
Did the President
receive the letter?

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.635
What is his response?

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.372
And will he ask Governor
Greitens to step down?

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:48.407
Ms. Sanders: I don't have an
official response at this time,

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:51.744
but it's certainly something
that is very concerning

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:53.746
and something that we're
taking very seriously.

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:55.514
And I'll keep you updated
as we have something.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.448
Sarah.

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.916
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:01.420
So, concerning the summit
with Prime Minister Abe

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.356
next week in Florida,
does the President plan to push

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.658
for a bilateral free
trade agreement with Japan?

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:10.062
Ms. Sanders: I'm not going
to get ahead of the President's

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.765
conversations with 
Prime Minister Abe,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.234
but trade will certainly
be something that is discussed,

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:18.270
as well as the
ongoing conversations

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.938
around North Korea.

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.408
The Press: Sarah,
does the President

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:25.277
have another NSC
meeting today on Syria?

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:26.912
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry?

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.013
The Press: Will the President
be having another

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:29.148
NSC meeting today on Syria?

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.016
Ms. Sanders: There is another
national security

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.219
meeting later this afternoon
at the deputies' level.

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.320
Ayesha.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.655
The Press: Thanks.

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.190
I wanted to ask about
the pardoning process.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.359
It seems like we've had
these three pardons;

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.728
they all were
somewhat high-profile

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.496
or had gotten media attention.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:49.034
How is the President deciding
when to take action on a case?

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:52.604
I mean, with Arpaio,
he hadn't been sentenced yet;

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.807
the Scooter Libby case
was very old.

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:59.812
So how are you deciding when
to take action on these cases?

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.014
And can a normal person
who feels like

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:04.316
they've been unjustly convicted,

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.453
can they get their case
to the White House?

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:10.622
I mean, there's a
Justice Department process,

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:11.890
but it seems like the President

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.259
is taking special interest
in certain cases.

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:17.696
Ms. Sanders: Again,
the President has exercised

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.398
constitutional authority,

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:22.601
and he determines when
and how he's going to use that

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.203
when it comes to
the pardon process.

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.438
He looks at each
one individually,

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.807
and makes a decision,
and we make that announcement.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:29.808
Nadia.

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:35.914
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:40.385
The OPCW is sending
inspectors to Syria.

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:42.521
Do you think this is
a futile exercise,

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.856
since you already
have the evidence

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.158
that actually they have
chemical weapons?

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.794
Ms. Sanders: Once again, we are
confident in the intelligence

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.395
that we have

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.064
and in the fact
that we know

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.132
that Syria is responsible
for these actions.

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.534
I'll take one last question.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.535
Brian.

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:57.669
The Press: Thanks, Sarah,
I'll do two.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:00.706
One on Syria and one on
the Department of Justice.

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:03.442
On Syria, the President
has publicly said

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:04.977
that he wants to
get out of Syria.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.479
Has this strike changed
his mind on that?

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.715
And is he considering
other options,

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:13.719
other than a plan to pull out
U.S. forces from Syria?

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.655
And if you could just --

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.956
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry,
what was the last part?

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.925
The Press: Is he considering
other options

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:23.695
other than a long-term strategy
to get U.S. forces out of Syria?

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:26.532
Ms. Sanders: I don't have any
additional changes to policy

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.933
in Syria at this time.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:30.469
And in terms of options, all of
our options are on the table,

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:31.870
and we're continuing
to look at those

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.405
and we'll make
an announcement then.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:34.573
The Press: And so,
I have a question about

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.108
the Department of Justice.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:39.411
What does the President have
to say to Republican lawmakers

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:44.283
who believe that firing Mueller
would be  suicide, 

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.685
as Grassley has said,

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.420
or firing Rosenstein
could be the end

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.057
of the presidency
for Donald Trump,

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:53.725
as Lindsey Graham has said?

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:57.729
Ms. Sanders: I'm not going to 
get into hypothetical situations.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:59.865
The President has taken
no action on that front,

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.134
and I'm not going to get into a
back-and-forth on hypotheticals.

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.135
The Press: 
Does he have any response

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.236
for Republican lawmakers

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.171
who are counseling him
not to take an action like that?

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.606
Ms. Sanders: As with
a number of issues,

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:10.676
the President talks to
a lot of different lawmakers

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.710
on a number of topics.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.246
He's going to continue
consulting with them,

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.547
not just on this,

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.584
but on some very big issues
that our country is facing,

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.485
and that's what his
focus is actually on.

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:22.120
Thanks so much, guys,
Happy Friday.
