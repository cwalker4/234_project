00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
Although the Separatist Droid Army was the
largest of its kind ever assembled, it was

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.030
clear that it was quantity over quality, as
a vast majority of the battle droids deployed

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.790
were nearly useless as individual units.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.280
But despite this fact, the Separatists did
invest a ton of credits into developing powerful

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.730
droids to use for special occasions, as well
as to replace and upgrade the main units had

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.369
the war gone for many more years.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.680
When it comes to the battle droid with the
most overwhelming power and defensive armor,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.360
then that easily goes to the Scorpenek annihilator
droids.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.000
These guys were absolutely terrifying in battle.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Imagine a droideka that was twice as big,
fired blaster bolts powerful enough to penetrate

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.089
heavy walkers with ease, and had the shielding
that could withstand large scale artillery

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.840
fire; that was essentially what the annihilator
droids were.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.570
They were developed and deployed during the
late stages of the Clone Wars and most saw

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.210
tremendous success in action, as it took only
a few of these droids to turn the tide of

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.530
battles in the Separatists’ favor.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.420
Actually, in one case a single annihilator
droid was able to take out over one hundred

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.840
clone troopers.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.280
Once this fact became known within the Republic,
these droids quickly became among the most

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.299
feared within the clone ranks.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.090
While the annihilator droids were nearly unstoppable,
due to their insanely high price tag and difficulty

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.440
in production, less than one hundred of these
droids were ever created.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.460
Another interesting fact about them was that
after the Separatist droid armies were shut

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.229
down, the annihilator droids were among the
very few that were reactivated and used by

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.579
the new Galactic Empire.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.440
A few were taken to the Imperial Department
of Military Research center, and the rest

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.829
were put to use on Palpatine’s secret fortress
world on the Deep Core world of Byss, where

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.679
they were likely used for defensive purposes.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.420
On the complete opposite end of the power
spectrum, were the countless standard B1-

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
Battle droids.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
But despite being some of the weakest droids
in the entire army, there were models within

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.890
the B1 line that were far more capable than
the standard ones.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.470
The strongest B1 model was most likely the
B1-A air battle droid.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.890
With far stronger armor plates, two wrist-mounted
blasters, a jet pack, and two double edged

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.560
blades, these B1s were actually a threat to
most troopers even as individuals.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.870
They also had a small shield that was capable
to resist direct lightsaber blows to a degree,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.650
which made them among the few separatist battle
droids that were specifically designed to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.050
deal with Jedi.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.420
Some Separatist designers had high hopes of
mass producing these droids and having them

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.560
replace the standard B1s, but these ambitions
later disappeared once the droids were known

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.730
to lose control if their jetpacks were shot
down at specific weak points.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.870
Next we have the B3 Ultra Battle Droid.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.400
As the name suggests, this was the upgraded
design of the widely produced B2 Super Battle

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.129
Droid and was regarded as one of the deadliest
droids produced by the Trade Federation.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.069
The B3 line only made it into the prototype
phase, but nonetheless was extremely powerful

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.769
and effective in the limited use it saw.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.890
At twice the height of its predecessor, the
B3 Battle Droid was a giant that towered over

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.489
its enemies, and had a deadly arsenal equipped
across its large body.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.269
It included a small flamethrower, two rapid
fire blaster cannons, a rocket launcher, and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.290
a plasma cannon, which made it effective against
light armored vehicles.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.519
Its large size and weapons made it difficult
for even Jedi to fight, but despite its success

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.439
it was never mass produced, as there were
far too many technical problems that were

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.360
never fully fixed before the end of the war.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.290
However just like with the annihilator droids,
the few remaining B3 Droids that survived

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.079
the war were taken by the Empire and used
for training exercises at some of the Imperial

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.459
Academies.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.230
We then have the C-B3 Cortosis Battle Droid.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.640
This line of droids were coated with Cortosis
armor, meaning they were completely resistant

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.329
to lightsaber strikes.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.870
This made them effective at killing Jedi,
so effective actually, that Palpatine was

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.670
worried that their deployment could have given
the Separatists a quick victory during the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.349
war, so he purposely had their development
be put to an end.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.070
Not only did the Droids’ Cortosis armor
make them nearly unkillable against Jedi,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.030
but they were also outfitted with high intensity
laser cannons that were on special rotation

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.550
wrists, that made them highly effective in
mowing down Jedi knights as they could overpower

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.410
their lightsaber defenses.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.260
When early reports of these droids success
came in, Palpatine, being the puppet master

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.100
of both sides of the war, leaked the origin
factory of these droids as well as a small

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.320
opening in their armor, which allowed for
the Republic to destroy these droids before

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.540
they became a too great of a threat.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.130
It was assumed that all of the Cortosis Battle
Droids were destroyed following the elimination

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.140
of their production factory, as none appeared
afterwards.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.180
Next we have the Advanced Dwarf Spider Droid.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.920
Built for use in nearly any terrain it was
placed in, this advanced dwarf spider droid

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.580
model was quite deadly in every engagement
it was placed in.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.610
With heavy armor plating, rocket launchers
and and a heavy blaster cannon, this droid

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.450
was a massive threat toward many Republic
vehicles.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.000
It also was effective against infantry and
was capable of fully operating in the dark.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.200
These droids were known to keep marching on
toward their objective, no matter what, and

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.850
because of their extremely heavy armor plating
they were usually made a high priority to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.720
destroy during battle by Republic forces.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.050
Finally for this video we have the V2-Series
Commando Droids.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.780
While the standard commando droids themselves
were already quite deadly against enemies

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.740
they were put up against, the V2-series was
just an upgraded version of them across the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.740
board.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.000
With heavier armor plating, the V2 droids
were much harder to eliminate and were typically

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.970
placed in specific strike zones during battles.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.800
Not much else is known about them, other than
the few models that survived the war were

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:14.380
used by mercenaries as advanced security droids.
