00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.545
hometown

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:05.213
of New York City.

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:07.716
In fact, his family has a
long history in the Big Apple,

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.592
starting with his grandparents.

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:12.387
Friedrich and Elizabeth Trump
were both born in Kallstadt,

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.931
Germany, and actually
grew up across the street

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.433
from one another.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.018
In the 1880s, Friedrich
ventured to North America,

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.438
making a small fortune
during Alaska's gold rush,

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.607
operating restaurants
and brothels.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.067
After Friedrich
returned to Germany

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.862
and married Elizabeth in
1902, the young couple

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.781
left for a place where all
immigrants could find a home--

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.199
New York City.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.410
The city part of that
was relatively new.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.120
The five boroughs
had only formally

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.205
incorporated four years prior.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.541
The Trumps first settled
in with Friedrich's sister

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.753
in Morrisania, a rapidly
growing German neighborhood

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.254
in the Bronx.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.673
Today, a nail salon
occupies their old address.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.717
But even though they lived
amongst their countrymen,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.635
Elizabeth quickly
became homesick.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.637
After giving birth
to their first child,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.599
also named Elizabeth, in
1904, the growing family

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.601
traveled back to Deutschland.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.561
But the German government
wouldn't allow Friedrich

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.063
to regain his citizenship,
claiming he had only left

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.941
for America in the first place
to avoid the German empire's

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.735
mandatory military service.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.737
So back to New York it was.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.614
They found their next
home again in the Bronx,

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.992
an apartment building
that still stands today,

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.536
now home to a liquor store.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.872
Elizabeth soon gave birth
to their second child

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.750
and first son Frederick
Christ, although he was known

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.960
as Fred from an early age.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.089
A third child, John George,
would be born two years later.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.218
To provide for his young family,
Friedrich set up a barber shop

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.512
in lower Manhattan,
shaving and trimming men

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.806
of finance at 60 Wall Street--

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.017
now the headquarters
of Deutsche Bank.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.019
But Friedrich wouldn't
be satisfied with cutting

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.687
rich men's hair for long.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.898
He wanted to be the
one in the chair.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:50.109
So in September, 1908, he
bought his first property

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.320
as an investment--
a two-story dwelling

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.656
in the Woodhaven
neighborhood of Queens.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:57.367
To supplement his income,
he took up a job as manager

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.829
at the German-owned Medallion
Hotel in midtown Manhattan.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.580
The hotel has since
been demolished,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.251
and the property now
exists as a parking lot.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.044
Soon after, the
whole Trump family

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.380
moved to Queens to be closer
to Friedrich's real estate

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.716
interests, settling in a
two-story house in Woodhaven,

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.552
still a house today.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.262
All was good for the Trumps.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.305
But like many German
immigrants in the US,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.518
they faced extreme bias after
the outbreak of World War I.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.228
To appear more
American, Friedrich

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.188
dropped became Frederick Trump.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.524
Interestingly, his son
Fred Trump would go on

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.443
to further reject his German
ancestry, claiming the family

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:35.155
was Swedish in order to
appeal to Jewish renters,

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.574
a claim considered by his
son well into the future.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.958
Back in 1918,
America experienced

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.587
one of its most dangerous
epidemics-- the Spanish flu.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:54.924
Influenza killed over 21 million
people worldwide that year,

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.595
including Frederick Trump.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.847
Elizabeth went on to manage
her deceased husband's

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.017
budding real estate company,
now inside old Elizabeth Trump

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.436
and Son, the son being Fred.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.480
Until he was of age, Elizabeth
bought and sold property,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.317
built homes, and arranged
mortgages, all while selling

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.985
for her neighbors on the side.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.737
Fred soon took
over the business,

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.488
and, over the course
of several decades,

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:18.489
built it into the family empire
his son Donald would inherit.
