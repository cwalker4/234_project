00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:02.165
WHO WOULD HAVE LOVED THE

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.067
OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN THOSE

00:00:04.068 --> 00:00:04.534
CLASSROOMS.

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:05.268
STEVE: THERE WAS A DOCUMENT

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:06.603
DUMP BY THE REPUBLICANS ON

00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:08.338
THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:08.738
COMMITTEE.

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.440
THE HOUSE SENT OUT HUNDREDS

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.208
OF PAGES AND WE'RE LEARNING

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.543
MORE ABOUT PERHAPS THE DEEP

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:14.811
STATE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.380
JUSTICE AND AT THE FBI.

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.749
BECAUSE IN THIS DOCUMENT

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.384
DUMP, THEY ADMITTED THAT THE

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.253
FBI WAS ORDERED, LADIES AND

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:24.387
GENTLEMEN, REMEMBER HER?

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:25.488
THE FBI ATTORNEY.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.024
SHE ADMITTED THE FBI WAS

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:30.160
ORDERED BY THE BARACK OBAMA

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.029
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOT TO

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.397
CONSIDER CHARGING HILLARY

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:37.000
CLINTON FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:37.834
IN HANDLING INTELLIGENCE

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:38.768
WHICH IS CLASSIFIED.

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.870
REMEMBER, IN AN EARLY DRAFT

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.505
OF WHAT JAMES COMEY WAS --

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:43.673
HE WAS ACCUSING HILLARY

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:47.043
CLINTON OF BEING GROSSLY

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:47.410
NEGLIGENT.

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.845
WELL, GROSS NEGLIGENT CAN BE

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:49.746
PUNISHED WITH PRISON TIME.

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:51.948
THEY CHANGED IT TO EXTREMELY

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:52.382
CARELESS.

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:53.416
AND PAGE TESTIFIED THAT

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:54.317
THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:55.185
BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:55.986
JUSTICE AND THE FBI ABOUT

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.455
HOW TO GET HER OFF THE HOOK,

00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.122
ESSENTIALLY.

00:00:59.123 --> 00:00:59.789
AINSLEY: REPUBLICANS ON THE

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.391
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

00:01:01.392 --> 00:01:02.659
THEY RELEASED HUNDREDS OF

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.427
PAGES OF THESE TRANSCRIPTS

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:05.762
FROM THAT HEARING WITH THE

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:06.329
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.697
THIS IS WHAT ONE OF THEM

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:08.765
SAID TO YOUR POINT WHEN SHE

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.801
WAS ORDERED NOT TO CHARGE

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:11.435
HILLARY CLINTON.

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:13.170
SHE SAID WE HAD MULTIPLE

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:13.737
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:14.805
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:16.740
BRINGING IN GROSS NEGLIGENCE

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.174
CHARGE.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:18.742
AND THAT'S, AS I SAID, THE

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.110
ADVICE THAT WE GOT FROM THE

00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:21.845
DEPARTMENT WAS THAT THEY DID

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.281
NOT THINK THAT IT WAS

00:01:24.282 --> 00:01:25.949
CONSTITUTIONALLY VEGAS AND

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.885
NOT SUSTAINABLE.

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.286
THEN CONGRESSMAN RATLIFF

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:30.554
SAYS WHEN YOU SAY ADVICE YOU

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:31.555
GOT FROM THE DEPARTMENT, YOU

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:32.523
ARE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE IT

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:33.891
WAS THE DEPARTMENT THAT TOLD

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:35.659
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CHARGE

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.960
GROSS NEGLIGENCE BECAUSE

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.495
WE'RE THE PROSECUTORS AND WE

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.197
ARE TELLING YOU WE'RE NOT

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:40.831
GOING TO.

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:43.534
AND SHE SAYS THAT'S CORRECT.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.502
STEVE: OH MY GOODNESS.

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:46.537
BRIAN: THIS FROM CONGRESSMAN

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:47.505
COLLINS WHO WAS ON THE RADIO

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.106
WITH ME IN 45 MINUTES I'M

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:50.307
GOING TO RELEASE MORE

00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:50.708
TRANSCRIPTS.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.243
IF YOU LIKE LAST WEEK'S,

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.644
THIS IS LISA PAGE'S DAY.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:54.445
WE FOUND OUT LISA PAGE IS

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.546
GOING TO RELEASE ALL OF

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:56.614
THIS.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:57.548
ABOUT 350 PAGES.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.884
NOW THE BIG QUESTION FOR ME

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.018
WHAT ABOUT THIS INSURANCE

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:02.419
POLICY THAT WE DISCUSSED IN

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
ANDY'S OFFICE?

00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.655
ANDY McCABE DOESN'T SEEM

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.624
TO REMEMBER IN HIS BOOK TOUR

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.192
WHAT THEY DISCUSSED WITH AN

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:09.093
INSURANCE POLICY AS RELATES

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:09.927
TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:10.828
UNITED STATES.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.630
NOW, IF I'M GOING TO BELIEVE

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.631
LISA PAGE AND WHAT SHE SAYS

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.065
AND IF I UNDERSTAND THE

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.901
SUMMARY IN WHICH I READ, IT

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.102
IS ESSENTIALLY LISA PAGE

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.270
SAYING CROSSFIRE HURRICANE

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.938
WAS AN INVESTIGATION INTO A

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.173
POSSIBLE RUSSIAN

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.541
INFILTRATION INTO THE TRUMP

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:23.908
CAMPAIGN.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:24.842
THEY SAY BEING THAT WE

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.277
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.578
WIN, WE COULD TAKE OUR TIME.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.749
BUT IN THE EVENT THAT YOU I

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.752
DO DIE BEFORE YOU ARE 40 WE

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.021
GET WE HAVE AN INSURANCE

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.289
POLICY SOMETHING THEY ADMIT

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.258
IN THIS COPY AND

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.259
CROSS-EXAMINATION THEY KNEW

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.194
VERY LITTLE ABOUT.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:43.828
STEVE: THE SCARY THING IS

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.896
THE FACT THAT THIS

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.364
ESSENTIALLY LAYS BEAR.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.332
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS A

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.032
DEEP STATE.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:48.967
WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT FOR

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.601
A WHILE.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.235
THINK ABOUT THIS.

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:52.537
THERE IS FBI INVESTIGATION

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:57.408
LOOKING INTO THINGS IT'S

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.410
BARACK OBAMA WANTS

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.246
DEPARTMENT

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:02.280
'SPARTMENT

TO CHARGE HER WHICH THE WAY

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.516
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:06.951
WHO DECIDES ANYWAY IT'S THE

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.786
FBI THAT JUST DOES THE

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:09.654
INVESTIGATION.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.023
&gt;&gt; HERE IS DOUG COLLINS.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.658
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.459
UNFAIRLY ATTACKED FROM THE

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.029
MOMENT HE WAS ELECTED

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.463
NOVEMBER 2016.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:18.930
ON MANY FRONTS.

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:20.031
AND NOW WE ARE BEGINNING TO

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.466
SEE THE VAST SCOPE OF WHAT

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.834
MOST OF US VIEW MS. CLINTON

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.936
WAS TREATED COMPLETELY

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:25.871
DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT WE

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.272
ENDED UP SEEING PRESIDENT

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.273
TRUMP BEING TREATED.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.141
THAT'S JUST WRONG.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.475
THIS SHOWS THERE IS A TWO

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.676
TIER SYSTEM AND WE ARE GOING

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:32.611
TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO GET

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.012
THIS OUT AND PUT IN WAYS

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.081
THAT PEOPLE CAN EASILY

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:38.150
UNDERSTAND NOT A LARGE BUT

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.085
TAKE IT METHODICALLY AS WE

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.019
GET THEM CLEARED AND GET

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.288
THEM OUT TO THE AMERICAN

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.689
PEOPLE.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.423
STEVE: BIG QUESTION IS HOW

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.791
HIGH UP DID IT GO?

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:46.725
THAT IS ULTIMATELY WHAT

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.127
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.329
BRIAN: WHEN THAT MUELLER

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.596
PROBE WORD IS IT'S COMING

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.331
OUT THIS WEEK.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.432
HE SAYS I DON'T NECESSARILY

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:53.832
BELIEVE IT.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.267
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.802
ABOUT IT COMING OUT.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.537
MAYBE WE WILL GET SOME MORE

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:58.937
ANSWERS.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:03:59.872
STEVE: I HEARD FROM DOWN IN

00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:00.572
WASHINGTON THERE IS A

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:04.043
POSSIBILITY THAT AS SOON AS
