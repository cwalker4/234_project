00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.520
To win the Olympics, you are 
 special for that distance

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.680
and a dream, I mean, especially 
 a country like Ethiopia.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.120
When you win the Olympics, 
 you are the best of the best.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.440
(LEGENDS LIVE ON 
 HAILE GEBRSELASSIE)

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.160
My father and my parent,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.760
they didn't understand about 
 sport, especially my father.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.240
He said to me, "Oh, man, don't 
 do this kind of job.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
"This is, you know, 
 just kind of wasting time."

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920
If you are a farmer of Ethiopia 
 you have to work hard

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.120
which means there's a whole day 
 busy in the field.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.840
He was brought up on a farm in 
 a rural part of Ethiopia,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880
and I remember him telling me

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.240
he stole his father's radio to 
 go into the field

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.560
and listen to his dad's radio

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720
because he wanted to listen to 
 Miruts Yifter

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.240
running the Olympics in 1980.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.640
The Ethiopian long distance 
 runners

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.320
headed by Miruts Yifter.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
When I was seven, I always 
 think about this guy.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.720
I wish, you know, 
 just to become like him.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.920
He said to me, when I realised

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.680
that Miruts Yifter was from 
 Ethiopia as well,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.560
winning a gold medal 
 in the Olympic Games,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360
and I saw the reaction of 
 people,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.840
how they behaved 
 and how they wrote about him

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880
and talked about him 
 and venerated him,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.680
he said, I decided then 
 that's what I want to be,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.280
I want to be an Olympic 
 champion.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680
I met Haile Gebrselassie when

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.360
he was 18 years old in 
 Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.120
He was different from other 
 athletes

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.680
because he was very 
 open-minded.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.840
Even when his English 
 wasn't that good, you know,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.600
he tried very hard to speak 
 English

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.320
and now his English 
 has gotten very good,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.800
and he always had 
 this great gap-tooth grin.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.400
He still has the same gap-tooth 
 grin,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.800
that hasn't changed about him.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120
So there was always something

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
very approachable about 
 Haile Gebrselassie.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.400
My father, the only time 
 he realised athletics was good,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.320
was when I won a World 
 Championship in Stuttgart.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.960
It's not just because I won in 
 Stuttgart,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640
but because of what I won,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.440
I mean, the car.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.280
We had no car before and my 
 father when he saw that car,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.720
how possible this?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
"From running?"

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.960
"Yes, from running."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.360
"Are you sure that this is 
 your car?"

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.680
"Yeah, it's my car, believe 
 me."

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.240
"Wow, keep it up!"

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.440
The most important thing

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.960
is he was not running for 
 money.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.320
He's smart, he understands,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.600
don't think about short-term 
 money, you know.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.560
If you perform well, 
 the money will follow,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.040
like everything in life and 
 he understood that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360
like nobody else.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.000
(OLYMPIC GAMES ATLANTA 1996)

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.880
Going into the Atlanta 
 Olympics,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.480
Haile was a clear favourite,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.160
and he was 
 everybody's favourite, as well.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.160
He was the first athlete in my 
 experience as a commentator

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.000
who stood on the start line

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.560
and he was smiling on the 
 start line.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.360
The diminutive figure against 
 the tall figure of Paul Tergat,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
there was a rivalry between 
 the two of them,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.400
it was Kenya versus Ethiopia.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
(ATLANTA 1996 
 MEN'S 10,000M FINAL)

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.520
I was injured. By the time

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.320
I ran the semifinal, it was 
 very hard.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.080
Unlike most distance runners,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.160
Haile ran up on the balls of 
 his feet.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.880
Each step must have hurt

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.600
and there are a lot of steps in 
 25 laps.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.680
When he finished that race,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.680
his feet looked like they were 
 ground beef.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.320
He willed himself to win that.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.680
Representing Ethiopia, 
 Haile Gebrselassie.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.400
My reaction, it was tears, 
 I was crying.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.080
I didn't know that when I was 
 there.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
I didn't know how it came.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.760
For me it looks because of 
 dream come true for me.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.360
I was dreaming this for many 
 years, since when I was seven,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.840
I'm telling you.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.280
Silver medallist, Paul Tergat.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.320
Paul Tergat was doing 
 everything he possibly could

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.960
to try and win a gold medal.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.400
He came along at the time when

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.560
there was a man called 
 Haile Gebrselassie.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.240
Between me and Paul, it's a 
 long rivalry,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.440
but one thing you don't forget,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.800
do you expect athletics 
 so popular without?

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.040
For Ethiopia, we need Kenyan, 
 for Kenyan, they need us.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.040
This is a peace fight 
 between the two countries.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.160
(OLYMPIC GAMES SYDNEY 2000)

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.360
The best moment of my athletics 
 career was Sydney 2000

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.880
between me and Paul Tergat.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.200
I can say did I win or not?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.840
The interesting thing 
 about Sydney in 2000

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.080
was that Haile was a little bit 
 injured.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.560
If Paul Tergat would have run 
 the race from '96,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.160
Haile would not be 
 the Olympic champion.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.480
But he waited until the last 
 300 metres

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.200
and he came to the front.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.840
Haile, come on, let's go.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.840
It was between life and death.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.960
He won that race and 
 that showed his lion mentality.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.680
The lion of Ethiopia, 
 I mean, he never gave up.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.360
It was one of the closest 
 finishes,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.000
I mean, 10,000m athletics.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.560
10,000m in Sydney was so close

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.560
that it was closer than either 
 of the 100m races.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.080
(OLYMPIC GAMES ATHENS 2004)

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.600
Haile was having injury 
 problems,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.240
he was building up his business 
 career,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.640
he'd won two Olympic 
 gold medals

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.520
and he knew he'd met his match 
 with Kenenisa Bekele.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.200
You cannot keep 10,000, 
 5,000 metres forever.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.680
When you're getting slower,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.480
the others, they beat you 
 easily.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.480
When you're getting older 
 you cannot keep the same speed

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.200
that you used to have.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.120
I switched to the marathon.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.080
I brought a kind of a 
 revolution for the marathon.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.080
(BERLIN MARATHON 2006 - WINNER)

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.520
(BERLIN MARATHON 2007 - 
 WORLD RECORD)

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.880
You look at two standards, 
 one is winning major races.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.280
He won World Championships

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.160
at the 1,500, the 5,000 
 and the 10,000,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040
and the other one is setting 
 world records,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.840
and Haile did both of them.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120
I don't see how you cannot call 
 Haile Gebrselassie

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.280
the greatest distance runner of 
 all time.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.040
In total, 27 world records

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.480
and four World Championships 
 outdoor,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.520
five for indoor and two 
 Olympics.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.640
I'm good, and now different, 
 a different thing to do.

(ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA)

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.480
I started with 
 the Great North Run.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.760
People there, 
 Brendan Foster and John Carey.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.400
So I spoke to Miles Wickstead,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.560
who was the ambassador for 
 Ethiopia.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.440
The three of us got together

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.280
and we launched 
 the Great Ethiopian Run.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.360
And thank you to the Great 
 North Run

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.640
to help found the 
 Great Ethiopia Run,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.360
now the Great Ethiopia Run 
 is great.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.800
This year it's going to be 
 42,000 people,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.600
the biggest in Africa.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.320
We closed the north-east road 
 for five, four hours, why not?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.560
Let them enjoy.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.360
Haile Gebrselassie, he is the 
 one who inspired us to run.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.880
He is a good runner 
 and he is a strong man.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.880
Slowly we are trying to bring 
 more tourists to Ethiopia.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.280
Ethiopia is a country full of 
 many things, yeah, come.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.360
Right now I am doing many 
 different businesses.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.320
I have a resort hotel.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.080
The profitable one is a car 
 business.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.600
They're a fun business.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.760
This is my favourite business, 
 I'm telling you.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800
Right now, I have over 1,800 
 employees in the company.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.200
Haile is very important 
 in the community.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.040
He has been selected President

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.480
of the Ethiopian Athletics 
 Federation.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.280
As the President of the 
 Ethiopian Athletics Federation,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.760
one of the main goals

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.760
is to work seriously with the 
 youngsters

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.720
and the other very important 
 thing,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.360
zero tolerance against doping.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.040
In my time in athletics 
 I've met some great athletes.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.960
Of all of them, Haile is the 
 greatest.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.520
He was in many ways 
 the greatest runner,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.000
in lots of ways the greatest 
 personality,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.600
he's a great man of Africa,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.200
he's a great man of Ethiopia,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.520
he could end up president of 
 the country.
