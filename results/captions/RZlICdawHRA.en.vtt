00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.760
Dr. Hayward: Thank you very much, Emma. Ladies
and gentlemen, it's a real delight to be back

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.760
in Hillsdale again - a part of normal America
- you know, this week is a heavy travel week:

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.330
I'm going to be at Yale University on Friday,
where I'm going to do my best to point out

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.170
to them that they have a lot of changes they
need to make if they want to be known as the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:31.050
Hillsdale of the northeast. And, as a few
of you know, I recently finished ... I should

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.449
maybe say, I recently survived a year as an
inmate at the University of Colorado at Boulder,

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.079
which is Berkeley with snow, right? In a fit
of madness, they decided they wanted to hire

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.180
a conservative to come try out for a year
... or, actually, three years was the idea,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.889
and I said I would try it for a year and no
longer.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:03.249
Boulder, of course ... their idea of a conservative
at Boulder is a Trotskyite, right? And so,

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:07.010
after I got there, I thought, this'll be interesting,
I'm kind of a gonzo guy, I've been at Berkeley,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.380
how hard could this be? And I had a lot of
fun with them, because I get invited to all

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.990
kinds of liberal audiences who wanted to see
this exotic zoo animal in their midst. And

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.681
the first thing I would tell them is, "You
know, you have it all wrong. I'm going to

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:27.250
let you in on a little secret. I shouldn't,
but I will. Conservatives love Boulder." And

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.200
they would say, "Really?" And we love Boulder
especially for the "green belt" that's around

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.320
it. The environmentalists, 30 or 40 years
ago, put in a green belt to control growth

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.700
and preserve their quality of life, and I
said, "The green belt is the best feature

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.770
of Boulder. I wish they had one in Berkeley.
I mean, the green belt makes the quarantine

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.659
so much easier to enforce. You see, it's easy
to have our Tea Party picket line set up around

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.659
the perimeter, and, you know, when a liberal's
trying to escape, out in the real world, we

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.000
round them up, hand them a bag of fresh, organic
kale, and send them back into the village.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.889
And, you guys, just stay there. It's perfectly
fine with us if you wreck Boulder, and Madison,

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.350
and Cambridge, and Berkeley, if the rest of
America is relatively safer. And then, usually,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.160
things went downhill from there.
I had a great time, actually. I was actually

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.959
embedded, for a semester, in the environmental
studies department. And, boy, that was fun.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.660
I'm going to begin, tonight, with my conclusion.
And then show you how I got to this conclusion.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.519
My conclusion is that, decades from now, I
think historians are likely to look back on

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.620
the hysteria over climate change today the
way we, today, look back on prohibition: as

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.870
a comic misadventure that shows the harsh
limits of political enthusiasm directed against

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.450
basic facts of nature and society. However
- and here's the complicating part - whether

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.849
we'll avoid committing the folly of embracing
the energy equivalent of prohibition is still

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.260
undecided. I'm thinking that we won't, but
it may be a close-run thing, for a very simple

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.500
and elemental reason, and that's the environmental
movement, which is deeply authoritarian at

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.790
its core, has an unquenchable will to power
that cannot be satisfied and will not be denied.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.120
And, so, the fate of this is in the balance,
as Al Gore might have said in a different

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.829
way, and, as I say, we can't tell, yet, whether
this will be looked back upon as a comic misadventure

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.299
or a tragic misadventure.
Now, the formal title of my speech this evening

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.010
is, "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to
Global Warming." And I love this title. I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.540
wasn't sure, though, whether Tim Caspar and
Doug Jeffrey weren't being mischievous, a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.350
little bit, thinking that my, you know, double
chin ... I was starting to look like Zero

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.879
Mostel - you need to be a little older to
get that reference, I know. But I do like

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.159
the title. But, actually, three funny things
have happened on the way to global warming.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.920
Three of them. First, the warming stopped.
Imagine that.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.720
Second, the policy agenda of the "climatistas,"
as I call them ... or, an even better term

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.790
for the climate crusaders is, "Thermageddonites."
I didn't think of that. That's Briton's Lord

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.000
Monckton came up with that, and I think that
one's really good. But the policy agenda the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.420
climatistas has been revealed to be completely
absurd. And I'll walk you through that here

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.380
in a moment. But there's a corollary to that.
As a thought experiment, even if catastrophic

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.710
human-caused climate change turned out to
be true, environmentalists are the last people

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.120
we would want to put in charge of dealing
with the problem. Full stop.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.250
When I'm in a mischievous mood, I did this
at Boulder a lot; I would say to environmentalists,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.630
I said, "Look, let's just quit arguing about
the science. It's really tedious. But, only

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.040
conservatives could fix this, you know." And
that was always fun.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.480
The third funny thing that has happened is
something that no one predicted. There's been

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.420
some talk about it today at lunch and other
presentations, and that's the revival of the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.600
oil ... gas ... energy sector through the
technological revolution of directional drilling

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.460
and "rock massaging"--that's what I call fracking,
"rock massaging." No one saw this coming.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.650
As recently as ten years ago, all the official
forecasts, including of a lot of the energy

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.590
companies--ExxonMobil's annual forecast, British
Petroleum--they all predicted continuing declines

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.520
in gas production in the United States, and
by the year 2020, not far off from now, the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.630
United States was predicted to be importing
20% of its natural gas from, guess who?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.320
And now, that has all changed. And the important
thing is this: this all happened very quietly

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.410
out in the private sector, as was explained
at lunch today, and if our political class

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.160
in Washington, in the media, had known this
was going on, they surely would have done

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.180
something to stop it. And that's what they're
trying to do now, of course, but there's too

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.490
late, there's too much momentum. Aren't markets
and innovation wonderful?

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.970
So, let's take these in order. First, about
the warming stopping. Between roughly 1978

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.140
and 1998, a 20 year period, the catastrophic
global warming scenario seemed to have some

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.050
evidence on its side. During that roughly
two decade period, the global average temperature

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.130
rose suddenly and sharply by about four tenths
of a degree Celsius, and conveniently that

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.230
was right in line with what a lot of the newfangled
computer climate models predicted. But then,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.610
as we say, the funny thing happened: it suddenly
stopped. Even though greenhouse gases kept

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.440
rising the atmosphere at a steady rate. Now,
at first, the pause, as it's come to be known,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.700
could be plausibly attributed to random year
over year variation, what ordinary people

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:07.010
call, "weather," or, what the scientists call,
a, basically, chaotic climate system, that

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.840
they will quickly acknowledge they don't fully
understand, and a couple other one-off events

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.590
like the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1992,
which changed some things, but now we're going

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.050
on 18 years ... really, almost 20 years depending
on how you treat 1998, which I won't do now,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.800
but we're going on 17, 18, up to 20 years
without any warming, and all the models are

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.840
starting to be falsified. The actual temperature
record is now falling below 95% of the climate

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.330
model temperature forecast. In other words,
95% of the projections are proved to be wrong.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.500
Because there isn't just one, by the way,
if you get into this misery.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.120
There's several dozen different computer climate
models generating a different temperature

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.740
forecast. And the record of the last two decades
is now falling below the lowest forecast for

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.000
the future. All but about one or two of the
models are basically still in the ... If this

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.680
goes on for another five to ten years, 100%
of the models will be shown to be wrong. Because

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.890
the basic theory says we should be continuing
to increase about two-tenths of a degree per

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.960
decade as long as greenhouse gases are going
up at the rate they are, and it's not happening.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:21.870
It is becoming the biggest embarrassment for
the scientific consensus since Piltdown Man.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:27.330
You know, somebody today asked Ken Greene
about, or made reference to the email scandals

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:34.270
of the East Anglia climate unit in 2009. There's
one of those emails from climatologist Kevin

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.740
Trenberth, he's one of the deep-dish climate
alarmists at Boulder, and he said, in one

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.579
of those emails, and I'll quote him here,
he said it was a "travesty" that climate scientists

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:50.480
could not explain the pause. And that's five
years ago, now, and we're still pausing.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:59.450
They've been scrambling ever since to offer
a whole series of explanations, and the intergovernmental

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.930
panel on climate change, the U.N.'s I.P.C.C.,
as Ken mentioned today, they're doing their

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:10.420
best to paper this all over and twist and
shout and do everything they can to try and

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:18.290
cover up the fact that their scheme is failing.
I think maybe my favorite moment in the media

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.620
... there's only a couple people in the media
who cover this honestly ... one of them I

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.750
should give fair credit to is Andy Revkin
at the New York Times, who's pretty environmentalist

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.310
in sympathies but pretty much plays this issue
straight. Good for him. The other is The Economist

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.740
magazine, which is otherwise very much within
the so-called consensus, and they wrote, back

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:44.660
in March, quote, "If climate scientists were
credit rating agencies, climate sensitivity

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.980
would be on negative watch." Good for The
Economist.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:57.879
Now, I'm a glutton for punishment, so ... this
is why Ken and I are friends, I guess. I read

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:01.900
through a lot of the latest I.P.C.C. report
on climate science. It came out about a year

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.560
ago. The science report is, you know, 1300
pages long or something. In particular, if

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.221
you're a glutton, I recommend reading chapter
nine. It is called, "Evaluation of Climate

00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:20.370
Models." It's 218 pages long, 218 pages of
very small print, and, Ken said you can't

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:27.519
quote it; actually, you can't even read it.
That's not quite true; it takes a long time

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:33.320
to figure out what's going on. You know, these
days, if the complaint made of people like

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.639
me and Ken if we say the word uncertain or
uncertainty it's bad faith. A chapter on computer

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:46.499
climate models from the U.N., it has the word
uncertain or uncertainty 173 times in 218

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:54.079
pages, and it uses the term error or errors
192 times. I'll describe a couple of these

00:10:54.079 --> 00:11:00.589
errors and uncertainties for you. What they
try to persuade you is we keep twisting the

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:05.100
knobs on these computer models long enough
we can get it to match up with what's happened.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.639
Except you keep going and you realize they
can't even do that. And they admit these things

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:17.019
very grudgingly and talk about how certain
areas of essential knowledge of how the climate

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:23.300
system works continue to really elude our
grasp. In particular, clouds. Clouds and water

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.921
vapor. That's really important to the story.
So, let me quote one quotable part, which

00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:34.100
goes like this: "There remain," this is a
quote, now, "There remain significant errors

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:41.670
on the model simulation of clouds." Next sentence.
"It is very likely that these errors contribute

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:47.209
significantly to the uncertainties and estimates
of cloud feedbacks, and, consequently, in

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:54.000
the climate change projections." And, if you
really read it carefully and ... ten times

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.809
... you realize that they admit that it's
possible that clouds ... they admit that clouds

00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:02.490
could cancel out most of the forcing effect
of greenhouse gases. This is what people like

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.259
Richard Lindzen have been saying for a long
time.

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:11.339
Now, I'm not just a glutton for reading these
reports when they come out. I went to the

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:15.089
trouble of finding some of the drafts leading
up to it. You can get people to leak these

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:22.339
things to you. And one of the last drafts
before the final report came out had this

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:25.971
sentence in it. In that same chapter nine,
which I thought was quite curious. Here's

00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:31.290
the quote: "The ability of a climate model
to make future climate projections cannot

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:40.050
be directly evaluated." Let that sink in for
a minute. We can't even evaluate our models.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.000
That sentence was dropped from the final report.
I'm sure someone said, hey, wait a minute,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.260
we can't say that. Instead, after a lot of
mumbley-mouth stuff about, you know, why the

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.560
pause is happening and we're still confident
that we want to keep playing with our knobs,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.230
this sentence appeared, instead. This one's
even better, actually, when you think about

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:05.709
it. Quote: "These projections were not intended
to be predictions over the short time scales

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:13.899
for which observations are available to date."
Translation: pay no attention to our models

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:18.870
behind the curtain. Just trust our judgment
that the end is near.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:24.550
You know, the great social scientist James
Q. Wilson used to say that social scientists

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:32.180
should quit trying to predict the future because
they can't even predict the past. I think

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.130
the climate science community might well heed
that advice.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.761
Where is the missing heat if you just want
to go from the orthodox climate theory? Most

00:13:40.761 --> 00:13:46.129
of the climatistas say it's going into the
deep ocean. And while that's a plausible theory,

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:50.490
we have very little data to substantiate it,
and some data that's coming in recently suggests

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.579
that it's not happening. And we have even
less understanding about how that might play

00:13:55.579 --> 00:14:02.290
out in the future. Other explanations for
the pause include unusual western Pacific

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.230
wind patterns--I'm not making this up--aerosols,
which means, you know, a higher level of particulates

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:13.649
in the atmosphere, and, my favorite, increased
solar variation.

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:19.339
There's this thing up in the sky called the
sun. You may have seen it. And, what's strange

00:14:19.339 --> 00:14:23.160
is, an awful lot of people, I mean, not just
ordinary citizens who wonder about this, but

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.761
scientists, even, would say, you know, what
about variations in solar radiation and sun

00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.350
spots and the climate science community, as
always, says, no, and their official models,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.100
if you read them, say it's a very tiny factor
in any variation in the climate, and so, for

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.600
them now to say solar variation is driving
the pause, that's interesting, isn't it? How

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.420
convenient.
We're up now to something like 57 possible

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:51.450
explanations for the pause. I think they're
pulling that off a ketchup bottle. Right?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:57.439
Now, the pause and the admittedly persistent
limitations and errors of the computer climate

00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:04.110
models resemble in my mind the kind of anomalies
that the philosopher and historian Thomas

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:11.829
Kuhn famously explained should constitute
a crisis for a dominant scientific theory.

00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:17.240
And while the climatistas refuse to acknowledge
it, this crisis is causing some serious second

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.519
thoughts about the basic question of climate
sensitivity. In other words ... Ken gave a

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:25.420
short primer on this afternoon, if you were
here. It's true that greenhouse gases hurry

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.600
the temperature a little bit, and the climate
sensitivity models have always said, and they've

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.189
always been rigged to say, it's going to do
a lot! And there are more and more studies

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:40.399
published in the peer reviewed scientific
journals saying, know what? We have been systematically

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:45.399
overestimating climate sensitivity. It's much,
much lower than we've been led to believe,

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:51.399
and ... really, what this comes to is, this
is a non-problem. Or not the kind of problem

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:55.680
we've been told about. But instead of confronting
the fact that their cause has floundered mostly

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:02.819
of its own dead weight, the climatistas have
ratcheted up new levels of bad faith and grasping

00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:07.050
authoritarianism. That's the technical terms
for what they're doing, I think.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:12.540
The result of the latest catalog of exaggerated
claims and appalling clichés is, you know,

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.760
it's endless, but the most egregious one is
one that I'm sure many of you have heard of

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:23.269
or seen on T.V. It's the ubiquitous refrain
that 97% of all scientists believe in climate

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:27.149
change. By the way, they even use that word;
believe, like it's an article of religious

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:32.459
faith, which I think is also a curious thing.
And it's not just climate advocates. NASA,

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:37.689
a federal government agency, says ... they
have a web page that says, that phrase, 97%

00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:42.790
of scientists believe in climate change. That's
our government speaking, now.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:49.610
And, of course, the political suggestion behind
this is, if 97% of scientists believe in climate

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.459
change, then, therefore, they must all agree
with the environmentalist agenda to suppress

00:16:54.459 --> 00:17:01.999
energy. So, where did this 97% figure come
from? When you explore its lineage, it turns

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:10.750
out to be about as convincing as a Chicago
election. No, you can't believe that, right?

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.750
... The most prominent form of it comes from
a paper by a professor in Australia named

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.630
John Cook at the University of Queensland,
and he published this paper in an obscure

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.880
journal, and it's just rocketed around and
it's become the big thing. And what this study

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.670
purported to do was review the abstracts of
11,000 climate science articles. Now, just

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.380
stop right there. It's important they say,
abstracts. No one's going to read 11,000 climate

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.250
articles.
Even a whole team of graduate students is

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.700
not going to read through 11,000 science articles.
So they read the abstracts, fair enough. The

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:45.640
abstract is always that one paragraph summary
at the head of any academic journal article.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.510
Well, here's the abstract to the Cook paper,
which no one in the media seems to have the

00:17:50.510 --> 00:18:00.530
wit to read for themselves. First sentence:
"We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:07.260
no position on anthropogenic global warming,
comma." I'll stop right there. Two thirds--66%--two

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:15.070
thirds of the papers express no opinion on
human-caused global warming. Let's keep going.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:21.050
Thirty-two point six percent endorsed anthropogenic
global warming. Zero point seven percent rejected

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.780
it and 0.3% were uncertain. Okay.
So that means a third of those papers had

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:34.680
an opinion on human-caused global warming.
So, the next sentence says this: "Among abstracts

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.590
expressing a position on human-caused global
warming, 97.1% endorse the consensus positions

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:47.500
that humans are causing the warming."
Somehow this has become 97% of all scientists,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.080
when it's 97% of a third of scientists. Or,
you might put it this way. You could just

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.370
as easily say, 66% of scientists publishing
in the field have expressed no firm opinion

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:01.920
on the matter. Or, still another way to think
about it is, this is the grandfather of all

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.190
simple-minded tautologies. Among all the scientists
who agree with the consensus, are all the

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.080
scientists who agree with the consensus. That
would be an adequate way of saying it.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.520
Now, initially Professor Cook refused to share
the data with anybody else to how they've

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.730
been coded, and, what have they matched up.
That's always a bad sign right there, isn't

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.280
it? But, of course, in the modern world, with
things planted on internet databases, somebody

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.160
found the data. And, lo and behold, some of
the articles turned out to be not really about

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.590
climate science at all. One article that was
billed as a science article was about U.S.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:42.010
media coverage of climate change issues. Strangely,
in those 11,000 papers, there's not a single

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:48.120
one from Richard Lindzen of M.I.T. He's the
most prominent skeptic in the climate science

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.760
community, who has been publishing on the
subject since 1961. None of his papers were

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.960
included, somehow. And yet, this phrase ... I
mean, you can't go anywhere now without seeing

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.320
it or, you know, get on the center for climate
progress without seeing that 97% of scientists

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:12.000
agree. Or believe in, right?
Well, it's clear that the climate establishment

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.090
has become as narrowly intolerant as any department
of gender studies on a college campus, and

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.670
for much the same reason. What this really
masks is a will to power, as I said at the

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:26.300
beginning. There's a pretty good new book
out on American environmentalism, called Climate

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.890
of Crisis, by Emory University historian Patrick
Allitt. It's not a bad book, I reviewed it

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:38.510
last week in the Weekly Standard, and he thinks
that the next generation of scientists, like

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.160
previous generational successions, will seek
to overturn the conventional wisdom of the

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.230
current community. I hope he's right about
that. Now, I understand the academic dynamic,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.320
but I'm not so sure. I don't think it's like
history, where each generation of historians

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.850
likes to say the previous one was all wrong
about the American founding, or something,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:00.640
right? I'm not sure it works that way in science.
I think he underestimates how deeply the environmental

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.000
movement is invested in the idea of catastrophic
climate change.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.020
But, that leads me to the second funny thing
that happened on the way to global warming,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.780
and that's the still incomplete realization
of the sheer absurdity of the climate policy

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:22.710
agenda. Now, global warming was always the
dream issue for environmentalists, because

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:28.430
it gave them license to commandeer the entire
energy sector of the entire world. And, as

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.420
energy is the master resource that enables
all other resource use, it's the ... I would

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.660
say, the platform for material human progress
itself. Getting control of energy is the commanding

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:47.360
height of human civilization. But, what they
have proposed is a transformation of the world's

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.830
energy system so sweeping and so unrealistic
that it would make King Canute blush with

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.870
embarrassment.
And, here, I'm going to have to walk you through

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.350
a few numbers. I tend not to like to try and
do numbers in a talk like this, because it

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.820
can be hard to follow. I didn't want to do
PowerPoint for the same reason as Ken, because

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.990
numbers on a screen are even worse, in some
ways, because you can't see em. So, I'm going

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.250
to try and stick with me on this, and I'll
make this as straightforward and comprehensible

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:20.710
as possible. But, you begin with this. The
target of climate policy orthodoxy is an 80%

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:27.281
percent reduction ... eight zero ... 80% reduction
in carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, not

00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:31.190
just the United States, worldwide by the year
2050.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:39.340
Eighty percent reduction by 2050. I call it
for shorthand the 80 by 50 target. No one

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:45.120
actually knew what this meant in practice
until I and a few other people got after it.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.240
And ... you know, you throw out these large
... 80% of something, and, you know, six billion

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.240
tons of emissions. What does this all mean?
It's hard to know when you're throwing around

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.470
these ... my eyes glaze over numbers, right?
Well, here's how this works, and I'll translate

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.919
this into real terms for you.
The big round number you start with is that

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:09.060
... it's changed a little bit, but this is
good enough for our purposes, here. The figure

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.061
that the Department of Energy starts with
from a few years ago is ... The U.S... . we'll

00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:20.900
just use the U.S. for now ... U.S. emitted
about six billion tons a year of carbon dioxide.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:26.480
That's about 20 tons per capita. Twenty tons
for each of us. Now, 20 tons sounds like a

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:35.360
lot. One little fact that's fun is, each one
of us individually exhales about 800 pounds

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.000
a year of carbon dioxide, just from breathing.
So, you can see, a nice down payment on the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.040
way to your 20 tons, just from breathing in
and out. So that's not really that much if

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:51.810
you think about it, then. Twenty tons. Now,
an 80% reduction ... actually 83% in the Waxman-Markey

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:56.370
Bill, but don't worry about that ... it takes
us down to about 1.1 billion tons. Or, if

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.750
you want to just keep it simple, we're going
from six billion, roughly, in round numbers,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:05.170
to about one billion.
Now, the first threshold question I got curious

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:11.510
about was: when was the last time the United
States' carbon dioxide emissions were that

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.710
low? You can figure this out ... takes a little
bit of work; it's not that hard ... you got

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.610
to go through the historical data tables that
are available. And, the answer you come to

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:28.310
is that the U.S. last emitted a billion tons
of carbon dioxide around 1910. Maybe 1905.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:33.890
That's another calculation someone else did
that's pretty good. In 1910 the U.S. had only

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:39.680
92 million people. If you do the math, that
meant we had about ten tons per capita emission.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.090
So, about half of the level we are today,
with 92 million people. However, in the year

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.711
2050, if the census bureau is right, we're
going to have about 420 million people in

00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:56.370
this country. What that means is, if we're
going to have to stay under a billion tons

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.500
of total emissions for the whole country,
each one of us will have to lower our per-capita

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:08.740
emissions to 2.5 tons a person. That's one
quarter the amount our great, great grandparents

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.960
emitted 100 years ago. When, by the way, their
incomes were, you know, a fraction of what

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.430
they are today. Didn't have air conditioning,
didn't have flat screen TVs, didn't have a

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:24.450
lot of refrigerators. Didn't have many cars.
You're starting to see where this is going.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.420
I did look up ... when was the last time the
U.S. was ... I think, by the way, U.S. carbon

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.120
dioxide emissions may have never been that
low, even in the colonial era, when we were

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:38.682
only burning mostly wood and some whale oil.
But, from the data tables, I was able to figure

00:25:38.682 --> 00:25:43.900
out that the last time we were at 2.5 tons
per capita of carbon dioxide emissions was

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:56.910
1875. There is a technical name for this kind
of policy target. That name is Looney Tunes.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:02.240
This is not going to happen in 36 years or
whatever that time frame is off from now,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.320
right? There are a few nations that emitted
2.5 tons per capita that we can look at as

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:16.840
possible models. Belize, Mauritius, Haiti,
Somalia ... you get the picture. Desperately

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.020
poor countries emit at that level because
they're poor.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.520
By the way ... this is also something that
any sensible person understands ... really

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.340
poor countries, what are their environmental
records like, overall? They're really, really

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.720
bad. Their water's terrible, they cut down
all their trees, they overgraze their land,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.211
they pollute their water terribly ... you
don't want to be that kind of country. That's

00:26:39.211 --> 00:26:42.460
not how you solve environmental problems.
You need to get rich to solve environmental

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.810
problems.
What about those enlightened Europeans? Well,

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:53.821
the best countries in the world that are industrialized
and wealthy are France and Switzerland. They

00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:58.910
both get about 90% of their electricity from
nuclear power and hydro power, which have

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:04.210
no greenhouse gas emissions. And, they're
compact countries, right? People don't drive

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:08.210
a long way in France or Switzerland. They
don't have to ship to, you know, Paris to

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:14.020
Lyon ... they don't ship goods very far in
that country. Agricultural goods or any other.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.130
Here, we ship stuff from Chicago to Los Angeles,
right? We ship things a long way. We're not

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:23.200
the same. But, even there, those two countries,
with all their super green policies, their

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:29.680
per capita emissions are 6.5 tons per capita.
You know, two and a half times the target

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.150
we're told we have to meet by the environmentalists.
I could go on with this, and ... I might go

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.240
just a little bit more to give you a little
bit more grasp of this. I'm still on sort

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.340
of large numbers, right? Per capita and all
the rest of that. Give you one more example

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:51.800
of how crazy this is. Remember, our target's
about one billion tons.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.980
Now, when the Department of Energy does these
assessments and gives us our emissions inventory,

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:03.840
they break the U.S. economy into four basic
sectors. Residential: our houses, and apartments,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:10.090
and condos, and whatnot. Commercial: office
buildings. Industrial: our factories. And,

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.170
transportation: how we all move around and
move our things. Those four sectors.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:22.520
So, remember. One billion tons for the whole
country in 2050. All four sectors. Right now,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:29.240
the household sector. Just living at home,
making our coffee. We emit 1.2 billion tons

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.590
of CO2, just from our houses. That's, you
know, 20% higher than a target for the whole

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:39.960
country for everything 36 years from now,
when we're going to have a whole lot more

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:47.370
people. Now, if we have the same pie in 2050
as today, and that could change, but it's

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:53.450
worth using the same pie, or same share, it
means the household sector in the year 2050

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:59.390
would have to emit no more than about 205
million tons. Instead of the 1.2 billion we

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:06.930
emit today. So, I decided to break that down
even further. To figure out some interesting

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.810
things.
How many of you here who have houses ... some

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.110
of you are students, I know ... how many of
you have natural gas in your houses? For your

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.790
furnaces? Yeah ... yeah, a bunch of you, right?
And that's the state of the art for new houses.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:25.150
It's much more efficient than electric heating.
Remember I said 205 million tons for the household

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:33.890
sector in 2050 for everything? Today, CO2
emissions just from natural gas use in our

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:42.800
houses, before you flip a single light switch:
237 million tons. So, our natural gas use

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.070
today is already higher than what it's supposed
to be in 2050 for the whole household sector

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:51.950
for all uses.
I mean, the Department of Energy projections

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.120
... they're all saying, this is a joke, right?
You know, household use of energy overall

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.860
is going to be much higher by 2030. That's
as far out as their projections go, right

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.450
now, is 2030. We're supposed to be building
something like 40 million residential households

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:09.060
in the U.S. I can go on with this. I have
sort of gone down ... drilled down even further

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:13.090
to point out that if you try and do this through
conservation ... that's what some of my friends

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.540
in the Natural Resources Defense Council say
... let's just do conservation ... and are

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.870
we really going to weatherize the entire housing
stock? Well, it turns out you can't do that

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.980
if you try and ... if you run through the
numbers, what you find is, you don't even

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:31.370
have enough electricity to run your hot water
heater. Forget flat screen TVs or refrigerators.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.220
Same thing's true of transportation. I'll
just give you one last thing, here, and then

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:41.450
I'll stop with numbers. Right now, our cars
and trucks consume about 180 billion gallons

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:50.560
of motor fuel a year. Now, again, if the transportation
sector's going to stay within our total emissions

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.380
budget, we'd have to shrink that down, at
best, to about 30 billion gallons. Well, the

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.850
last time we consumed 30 billion gallons for
our cars and trucks and transportation was

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:12.650
1930. If every single person in the country
drove a Toyota Prius, in 2050, we'd still

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:18.380
overshoot the transportation sector emissions
target by 40 to 50%. And that ... I've left

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.890
out airplanes, by the way. Airplanes are actually
small of our total, but it's like 5% of our

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:26.950
total fuel consumption, is airplanes. And
no one's yet figured out how you're going

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.840
to electrify an airplane. We may electrify
cars someday, better than we're doing now,

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.540
you know ... Teslas are kind of fun, but they're
not very practical, nor are they affordable

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.520
for an ordinary human being.
So, the clear implication of this target is

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.160
that we have to replace the entire fossil
fuel energy infrastructure over the next three

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.210
decades. That's what they're telling us to
do. And not just the United States, but for

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:53.000
the whole world.
Even if it could be done at all, and I think

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.620
it can't, it would be a multi-trillion dollar
proposition. Let me share with you an interesting

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.000
couple of sentences from the International
Energy Agency. They're folks based in Paris,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.640
they do really good international energy analysis
... they publish a world forecast every year

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:20.640
that's really good ... and, they were discussing
this problem. And, they said this. They make

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.070
reference here, by the way, to the 450 parts
per million target, that's part of climate

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.430
... I won't bother explaining that now, but,
I don't think you need to know it to understand

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.590
what the sentence means. Here's the quote
from the I.E.A. in 2008: "In other words,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.861
the O.E.C.D. countries" ... that's, you know,
the industrialized countries of the world

00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:46.440
... "the O.E.C.D. countries alone cannot put
the world onto the path to 450 parts per million

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.280
even if they were to reduce their emissions
to zero."

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.690
Pause there. What they've just said in that
sentence is, the United States, Europe, Japan

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.970
... could disappear off the face of the earth
and the world would still not come close to

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:08.050
the target of climate orthodoxy. Why? Well,
because China and India are growing, and Brazil,

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:13.590
and, you know, Africa would like to develop.
So would the rest of Asia. And, by the way,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.680
they're doing that mostly with coal. Let me
come back to the point in a moment.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:24.460
Let me continue with what the I.E.A. said:
"Even leaving aside any debate about the political

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:31.530
feasibility of the 450 policy scenario, it
is uncertain whether the scale of the transformation

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:38.710
envisaged is even technically achievable as
the scenario assumes broad deployment of technologies

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:45.440
that have not yet been proven. The technology
shift, if achievable, would certainly be unprecedented

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.430
in scale and speed of deployment." This is
remarkably direct language from one of these

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:57.780
international bureaucracies. And when this
came out, guess what happened? All hell broke

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:02.310
loose from the climate community. They denounced
the I.E.A. and essentially they forced them

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.200
to retract this statement. Next year they
said, oh, we can do it ... you know, they

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.720
went back to the usual happy talk clichés
of unicorn flop sweat and all other ... you

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.849
know, banana peels, and all the other things
we can power the world with. They got hammered

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:18.020
for that bit of honesty. Because that's what
the climate campaign is like.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:23.710
One of the things that's important to understand
is that energy transitions are very long.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:28.769
That was true with past energy transitions
from wood to coal, from coal to oil, and now

00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:33.830
we're making a transition in this country,
and others, to natural gas. Transitions are

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.100
long for the same reason that the turnover
in our housing stock tends to be long. Our

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.200
energy systems represent large, long-term,
fixed capital investments, and you don't generally

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.710
replace large infrastructure before its useful
life is over. Because that's economically

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.899
wasteful. It'd be like remodeling your whole
house because you don't like the color in

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:55.659
the kitchen and the bathroom. Or replacing
your 2-year-old refrigerator with a new model

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:01.130
because it's 10% more energy efficient. But
that's the energy equivalent of what the climatistas

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:05.230
want. They want a multi-trillion dollar outlay
to replace energy systems that are not worn

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.750
out and, importantly, whose conventional air
pollution has already been reduced to the

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:15.829
vanishing point.
Now, I'm pretty sure ... in fact, I would

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:19.999
bet a lot on this, that both Robert Bryce
and Mark Mills tomorrow, who are absolutely

00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:23.310
fantastic ... they're going to go through
some of the comparative defects of the current

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:29.069
menu of alternative and renewable energy supplies.
That make the environmentalists wake up happy

00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:33.650
in the morning. I mean, like, wind, and solar,
and bio-fuels. Suffice it today as a placeholder

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:38.460
until you hear from Robert and Mark tomorrow
is, they're vastly more expensive and not

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.730
scalable to global or even national needs,
and in many cases have enormous negative environmental

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.920
trade-offs of their own. Ken mentioned a few
today about ethanol. That's true of wind and

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:55.810
solar as well. Meanwhile, what is going on
is, as in so many other domains ... the Obama

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:01.529
administration's not waiting ... going to
take executive action ... the Supreme Court,

00:36:01.529 --> 00:36:07.230
in 2007, improvidently told the E.P.A. that,
yes, you can regulate greenhouse gases under

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.869
the clean air act, a law written for a completely
different problem with tools that are completely

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:18.339
inappropriate to this problem, even if you
think it is a giant problem. And, so, they

00:36:18.339 --> 00:36:24.349
have announced this very complicated and convoluted
plan to regulate the electricity sector in

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:29.109
the United States.
And, as these things go, it's, you know, 675

00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:33.690
pages of the main plan, and then the 400 page
impact assessment that analyzes the costs

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:41.980
and benefits, and it's very hard to understand.
They emphasize their flexibility in announcing

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.279
this. And each state has a different target
based on its carbon intensity because, you

00:36:46.279 --> 00:36:49.809
know, some states like ... I've never looked
at Michigan, but Ohio and Indiana get about

00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:55.480
80% of their electricity from coal. Washington
State gets almost none of their electricity

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.700
from coal because they have all those old
nuclear power plants and all those big dams

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.010
on the Columbia River.
So, different states have different electricity

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.970
profiles, and they're trying to take this
into account, although, of course, that's

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.710
where the mischief begins, because a bureaucrat's
flexibility today is their mandate tomorrow,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:16.690
right? So, there's all this language about,
we'll have a menu of options, because, by

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:21.249
the way, without getting into the legal parts
of this, they can't directly say to an individual

00:37:21.249 --> 00:37:25.170
coal plant, you have to shut down or you have
to reduce your emissions by some unrealistic

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.809
amount, because that would fail a legal challenge.
But they can do it indirectly, and bureaucrats

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:34.190
are great at that. So look at this menu of
things you can do: conservation, increase

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:39.049
your heart rate, and, maybe even, they say,
a cap and trade scheme between different states

00:37:39.049 --> 00:37:44.220
and different regions. And, although, you
know, again, if you peel this apart very carefully,

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.990
it looks like a wealth transfer from red states
to blue states. Who knows what it will cost,

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:57.140
but, the E.P.A. claims, with a straight face,
that this scheme will reduce everyone's energy

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.900
costs.
Now, I've been asking the question ... there's

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.509
several states, this one student this afternoon
made a question about states with renewable

00:38:04.509 --> 00:38:08.670
portfolio standards. This is where we mandate
you're going to get your electricity from

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.470
windmills and solar panels. You can't point
to a single state with a renewable portfolio

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:18.890
standard where the energy costs have gone
down. Quite the opposite. All those states

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:24.420
have higher than average electricity rates.
When Gina McCarthy, the head of the E.P.A.,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.109
was announcing this back in June, I'm watching
all these unbelievable claims, and I just

00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:34.220
kept thinking, when is she going to say, if
you like your utility rates, you can keep

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:41.940
your utility rates? That’s what she's saying,
it was unbelievable. Contrast that typical

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.010
bureaucratic dishonesty with Barack Obama
himself. I'm going to give him a little credit

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.130
for honesty, here. Back in the 2008 campaign
he said this ... some of you may remember

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:57.049
this quote: "Under my plan of a cap and trade
system, electricity rates would necessarily

00:38:57.049 --> 00:39:02.910
skyrocket. Businesses would have to retrofit
their operations. That will cost money. They

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:08.500
will pass that cost on to consumers." End
quote. I don't see why we shouldn't take him

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:16.540
at his word.
Now, I'll just give you one more. One of the

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.819
E. P.A. fact sheets. Again, a glutton, I read
through these crazy things. It's ... you know,

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:24.650
I have no life, I guess. One of the E.P.A.
fact sheets says the following: "We expect"

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:30.740
... this is a quote, here ... "We expect extensive
and very rapid changes in the structure of

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:36.910
the power sector." Again, once you fight your
way through the fog of bureaucratese and learn

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:40.619
how these things work, you understand what
they're really proposing is to make the E.P.A.

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:46.150
a federal public utility commission. And,
they're going to regulate the electricity

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.560
grid, now.
Now, the way the clean air act works, in shorthand

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.960
is, is states are supposed to come up with
plans to implement it in their state. That

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.980
makes some sense for conventional air pollution
for a lot of reasons I won't bore you with

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:03.910
now. Once this rule is made final, I think
next June it becomes final, the clock starts

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:08.420
ticking, and states are supposed to submit
a plan within a year of how to satisfy these

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:15.150
targets the E.P.A. has set out for them. That's
a high order. There's all kinds of problems.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.319
State departments of environmental quality
actually don't have jurisdiction over electricity

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:21.980
grids, so they're going to have to get the
public utilities commissions, and these inter-agency

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.089
task force, and ... the bureaucracy's going
to be wonderful.

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:29.890
I am wondering, and hoping, especially in
light of the election results, that there

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:35.500
are going to be a number of states who said
no to Obamacare will say no to the E.P.A.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.579
Because, by the way, the fallback of the clean
air act has always been, if you don't do a

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:43.210
plan, we'll come in and do a plan for you
and impose it on your state. It's so much

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.619
better if you do it, because you're closer
to things. Well, you know, if 20 states said,

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:51.059
no, we're not going to do this, and the E.P.A.,
yes, has the legal authority to come in and

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:53.970
say, we're going to impose a plan on you,
then, but I think it would break the E.P.A.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.440
to try it. And I'll bet they're terrified
of that idea. Which is why I'm going to be

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.619
encouraging governors and state legislatures
to say, no. We're not going to do this. There's

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:05.210
going to be a legal challenge, and so it'll
be in limbo for a while, but I think that's

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:11.270
the right ... No, we're not going to do this.
Finally, on this, and then I'll move to a

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:19.570
conclusion and questions ... The target emissions
reduction is just 30% from the electric power

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:24.019
sector, which is only one of ... which only
accounts for, what, 35% of our emissions in

00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:27.680
the U.S. overall, I forget. In other words,
we're talking about maybe, if it really worked,

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.609
a 10% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions,
if it all worked according to plan. The E.P.A.

00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:41.059
touts enormous benefits from doing this. We'll
reduce ozone, we'll reduce particulate pollution.

00:41:41.059 --> 00:41:46.810
Of course, that's what the clean air act does
already. It's happening very fast, so they're

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:50.140
just proposing to do the same thing they're
already doing, only in a different way, and

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.440
more onerous. There's one thing conspicuously
missing from the claims of benefits in the

00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:02.079
E.P.A.'s assessment: they make no claim that
their regulations would affect climate change.

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:08.130
And that's because it won't.
You know, I tried to get a couple reporters

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.060
to try asking at the White House press ... but,
it would just punt to the E.P.A., but, the

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:18.099
question would be, if you run full ... assume
this plan works like a charm and you meet

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:22.240
all those emissions targets. What difference
would it make if you ran that through the

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.349
computer climate models through the year 2100?
The best guess is, it would change the temperature

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:33.329
by two one-hundredths of one degree. Which
is, actually, you know, inside the margin

00:42:33.329 --> 00:42:38.790
of error. In other words, it makes no difference,
right? So, why are we doing this? Well ... oh,

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:43.809
by the way, and even Al Gore ... someone asked
about… are you going to mention Al Gore?

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:49.010
And I said, I wasn't sure I would, but he
described the E.P.A. proposal quite revealingly

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:55.980
as symbolic. Al Gore, in a rare moment of
honesty.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.801
The environmental movement is delighted about
this after saying they didn't want to do it

00:42:59.801 --> 00:43:03.220
this way because they love bureaucracy, and
I think what they're hoping is, is once you

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:08.580
cement in place the E.P.A.'s authority, a
30% reduction can be ratcheted up to a 50%

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.190
reduction, and then a 75% reduction, and then,
maybe 100% at some point, all on the authority

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:25.710
of the E.P.A. alone, bypassing congress.
Let me move towards a conclusion and one last

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:32.190
quick point, my third funny thing, which I
can do in just one paragraph, actually. Here's

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.730
... the point of this middle point of my analysis.
The second funny thing is: the cruel irony

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.380
for the climateers is that the worse the dimensions
of climate change, the more farcical are their

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:46.951
proposed remedies.
So, you know, we may try to close 500 coal

00:43:46.951 --> 00:43:51.809
plants, or about ... still a little over 500
coal plants, but right now there are 1,000

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:54.599
coal plants under construction elsewhere in
the world, and my guess is, we're going to

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:59.700
build another 5,000 of them, at least, in
the next 20 years. Because, as the Chinese

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.950
put it to Al Gore in 1998 in Kyoto: we don't
understand you Americans. You expect us to

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:09.710
be poor forever? And the Indian said to him
... this has never been reported, by the way.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.430
The Indian said to him, when he was trying
to bully them. He had to join in this madness.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.609
He said, you know, you got rich on fossil
fuels. Now, it's our turn. When we're as rich

00:44:17.609 --> 00:44:22.450
as you, then we'll talk about emissions limits.
Well, that's about 75 years off for India.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:28.799
And, so, the real deniers today are the climateers
who refuse to consider that their case for

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:33.930
catastrophe has weakened, while promoting
completely unserious solutions that do little

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:39.119
or nothing to stimulate the energy transition
they say they want. Their default position

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:44.480
continues to be simpleminded exaggeration
or distortion of every possible angle. Know

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.190
what? Somebody'll say today: it's warm today.
It's global warming. Next week, it's going

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.809
to be really cold, here. It'll be climate
change. Right? So, that's the distortions.

00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:59.109
And the opinion polls show that the public
has a case of, what I call, apocalypse fatigue.

00:44:59.109 --> 00:45:05.499
And, so, they've rankly politicized this issue
and demonized any self-criticism even within

00:45:05.499 --> 00:45:08.940
its ranks.
You know, there's this one lady ... Judith

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.230
Curry at Georgia Tech, who's always been in
the conventional climate science community

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:16.310
until five or six years ago, she started saying,
you know, I think maybe we have some things

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.109
wrong, here. And we should re-think some things.
And, by the way, we ought to talk to some

00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:25.869
of the climate skeptics instead of screaming
at them. Well, guess what's happened to her?

00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:29.869
She's been cast into outer darkness and she
was the chairman of the, what, the geophysics

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:35.390
department at Georgia Tech. Person of considerable
scientific chops. That's what happens if you

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:41.680
raise a dissent or a doubt.
Finally, I said that there was a third funny

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.880
thing that happened, and that was the unexpected
revival of oil and gas. And, I want to use

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.460
that to say ... as I say, Robert Bryce and
Mark Mills will talk about this tomorrow in

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:55.009
what's ahead, especially Mark, he has a degree
in engineering from M.I.T. He really knows

00:45:55.009 --> 00:46:04.009
the nitty-gritties of this. And it's true,
what people said today, what ... Ann McElhinney

00:46:04.009 --> 00:46:07.720
said last night, and what I've just said,
the environmentalists are relentless authoritarians.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.279
On the other hand, think how depressing it
must be to be an environmentalist right now.

00:46:12.279 --> 00:46:16.660
And to see this surge in natural gas and oil
production going on that's going to spread

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.779
around the world, right?
I mean, for the longest time, the environmentalists

00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:25.140
said, we've just got to get to using renewable
energy and banana peels and whatever else

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:30.670
because we're going to run out of oil and
coal and gas. Anyone remember peak oil? Anyone

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:35.559
heard of peak oil lately? And now the problem
for environmentalists is that we're not going

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:39.460
to run out of these fuels anytime soon. Again,
ten years ago, environmentalists were saying,

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:44.230
you know, we're for natural gas. It's a bridge
fuel, they'd say. Now, they're against natural

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.960
gas. They've gone all John Kerry on us. They
were before natural gas before they were against

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.549
it. And ... you have to know environmental
folklore here, and I'll end with this. As

00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:57.599
recently as 1998, that was when the first
Kyoto treaty was signed, environmentalists

00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:02.440
thought, hey, we're on our way. This Kyoto
thing is going to work. In 1999, all the leading

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.989
environmental groups in America said, the
leading environmental problem of today is

00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:13.700
suburban sprawl. And that's when they made
a big push in 1999 and 2000, because they

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:19.140
thought, well ... we've signed the treaty.
Right? That's a particular tic of the liberal

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.460
mind, right? You've solved problems by having
signing ceremonies on the White House lawn.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:30.410
And if you had predicted to an environmentalist
in 1998 that not only would the Kyoto treaty

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:35.800
go down in flames, that there would be a massive
revival in oil and gas, that the price of

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.830
natural gas would go from $14 down to 2 and
it would suddenly be abundant as far as the

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:45.789
eye can see, I think they might have marched
out into the sea and drowned themselves. Come

00:47:45.789 --> 00:47:51.319
to think of it, maybe that's not a ... anyway,
I will stop there and turn to your questions

00:47:51.319 --> 00:47:52.319
and comments. Thank you.
I can't see very far, anymore, so it'd be

00:47:52.319 --> 00:48:05.280
good if you ...
Facilitator: I'll point em out. Thank you,

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:12.479
Dr. Hayward. We have a couple microphones
here. Please raise your hands and stand up

00:48:12.479 --> 00:48:18.010
when the microphone gets to you and, also,
they will hold the microphone for you. Thank

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.420
you.
Dr. Hayward: It's just like a classroom. Students

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.499
never want to ask the first question after
a lecture. There's a brave fellow. Go, sir.

00:48:25.499 --> 00:48:31.619
Dr. Kenneth Hayes: Yeah, I have two questions.
Do you know where 2014 is targeted to be in

00:48:31.619 --> 00:48:38.089
terms of the hottest years on record? Is it
going to be in the top 10, or the top 20,

00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:39.400
top 50?
Dr. Hayward: Yeah, it's somewhere in the top

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.089
10 or 20, yeah.
Dr. Hayes: Yeah. It's headed to be number

00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:45.140
one.
Dr. Hayward: There's dispute about that.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.979
Dr. Hayes: Well, we just have to wait another
six or seven weeks ...

00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:49.410
Dr. Hayward: Right.
Dr. Hayes: ... we'll know the answer, but

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.910
have you looked at the hottest months of the
year? Have you looked at May, and April, and

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:59.849
June, and July? They've been the hottest months
on the planet this year. Have you followed

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:02.349
that?
Dr. Hayward: Yes ... if you look at the satellite

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:05.599
data, it's not looking that way. That's based
on the ground temperature data, and that's

00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:08.190
a big, furious controversy, as I'm sure you
must know.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:11.839
Dr. Hayes: I understand the data pretty well.
Can you summarize ...

00:49:11.839 --> 00:49:15.779
Dr. Hayward: ... And by the way, so what,
by the way. I mean, so, you want to have a

00:49:15.779 --> 00:49:17.880
debate here, fine...
Dr. Hayes: So what? So what, it's the hottest

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.020
... it'll be the hottest year on record...
Dr. Hayward: Well, we've been up in the plateau,

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.640
I expect all these years to be among the hottest
of the last century. Why is that news?

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:33.930
Dr. Hayes: Well, can you tell me what evidence
you have that there's been a pause in the

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.500
warming? Can you tell me that evidence? Briefly.
Very briefly. Just a little bit.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.540
Dr. Hayward: I'll give you three words: satellite
temperature record.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:50.291
Razi Lane: Thank you very much for your time,
coming out today, this evening. My question's

00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:54.210
going to be going back to your talk about
Dr. Richard Lindzen, dealing specifically

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.700
with climate models in and of themselves.
What, in your opinion, is the specific flaw

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.029
with hockey stick graphs and stuff that the
I.P.C.C. uses, specifically, what foster things

00:50:02.029 --> 00:50:06.680
such as the Kyoto protocol and the U.N.F.C.C.C.,
and how can we go about addressing that in

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.200
today's modern era? Thank you, sir.
Dr. Hayward: Wait. Hold on, you had two or

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.390
three parts, there. One was hockey stick?
Is that right? ...

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.729
Razi Lane: Yes, sir.
Dr. Hayward: ... And then I.P.C.C. what? I

00:50:15.729 --> 00:50:17.730
didn't quite take it all in. You're going
fast.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.460
Razi Lane: Sorry. Yeah, basically just the
climate models, themselves. What the flaws

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.809
are, how can we go about addressing those?
And, the hockey stick graph as one of those

00:50:24.809 --> 00:50:26.690
models.
Dr. Hayward: Yeah. The hockey stick's not

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:31.140
a model. That's a temperature reconstruction
based on a whole lot of what we call proxy

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:37.780
data. I quit following that, too, after about
... when did the national academy of science's

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:44.970
report on that come out, 2007 or 2008? And
... that was before you had the email ... the

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.280
email leaks that were so interesting because
what it showed is so many of the people who

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.549
had worked on that didn't care for Michael
Mann very much at all. It's pretty funny.

00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:59.130
To read those. The National Academy of Science
has put a report out in 2007, 2008 about reviewing

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:07.160
the hockey stick, and news headlines all said,
vindicates hockey stick! I read the report.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.819
Guess what, it said something else. I'll have
to do this from memory. I wrote it all in

00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:15.010
a couple of articles. Toward the end, they
did several things. They criticized Mann and

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:19.890
his collaborators, Bradley and the other guys,
for not sharing their data. Not being transparent.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:24.960
Second, they said ... the National Academy
of Science, Gerald North at Texas was the

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.569
guy did ... they were given the data and they
looked through it, went through all the stuff,

00:51:28.569 --> 00:51:34.069
and they said, looks to us like this is only
really reliable back about 400 years. Before

00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:37.530
that, we're making stuff up. That's not quite
the language they used, but that's what it

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:41.739
said, and in their press conference they sort
of said, you know, we've overdone this whole

00:51:41.739 --> 00:51:45.950
thing. And that's kind of where things were
left. And then, like I say, when the emails

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:51.369
came out, I wrote two articles about it...
long articles in The Weekly Standard that

00:51:51.369 --> 00:51:54.390
just went through, saying, look what some
of these guys say about each other and about

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:57.569
the limitations of their own work. It was
pretty revealing and pretty amazing.

00:51:57.569 --> 00:52:01.499
Partly, it was a "circle the wagons" thing.
They didn't want to admit any of those doubts

00:52:01.499 --> 00:52:07.170
or uncertainties in their own work. So ... and
now, of course, Michael Mann is suing National

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:14.170
Review and ... what's his name, Mark Steyn,
right? And it's a bizarre suit as a libel

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:19.280
matter, and we'll see how this goes. I mean,
I can't imagine they really want to get into

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:26.720
discovery on this. I don't know what Mann's
thinking, so, that wasn't a model, that was

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.670
a temperature ... what does the past look
like, right? I guess, the other point of it

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:38.260
is, the I.P.C.C. adopted, or, inserted that
thing in their 2001 report at the last minute.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.099
Most of the people who worked on ... never
saw it. And that raised a lot of people's

00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:47.039
ire. Because it seemed to be put in by the
politicians at the end. So, someone else?

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:52.609
Man: Thank you very much for coming out and
speaking. Just a question for you. Because

00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:56.520
you alluded to this during your whole speech,
but never really explicitly said it. How do

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.380
you separate the science from the politics?
In other words, you talked about the ... it

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.609
being described as a "belief" and then, all
of a sudden, this one lady was just going

00:53:05.609 --> 00:53:09.000
out and saying, this is what I found, and
then she was actually cast out. How do you

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.400
separate that? How do you find the truth in
all the muck and all of the political banter?

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.920
Dr. Hayward: Yeah. That's a good question.
Did you all hear the question? It was, how

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.720
do you separate science and politics, is that
a fair enough a re-summary?

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.140
Here's the basic problem, and maybe I should've
put it this way. Science tells us what is.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:31.200
It doesn't tell us what to do about things.
I mean, a corollary position might be ... let's

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.830
go back 20 ... let's go back to the late ‘70s
when, by the way, if you go back to newspapers

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:41.799
... the leading environmental problem, according
to Jimmy Carter, was acid rain. Let's study

00:53:41.799 --> 00:53:47.329
the matter. We spent ten years on NAPAP: National
Acid Precipitation Assessment Project. It

00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:50.720
concluded, in three volumes, that the problem
was real but overstated. But, then, what do

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.319
you do about it? The report didn't say what
to do about it.

00:53:53.319 --> 00:53:59.180
That's what science out to be about, is describing
how something happens. Now, what happens here

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:06.640
and, you know, the people who have thumped
the 97% business like to say: the scientists

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:12.359
all agree that we're doomed, and therefore
we have to have the Kyoto protocol? Most scientists

00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:16.950
are not very good at public policy analysis.
And a lot of them will admit that, by the

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:22.299
way, and a lot of them, you know, there are
a lot of them out there. What happens is,

00:54:22.299 --> 00:54:27.410
the noisiest of them, people like Jim Hansen
at N.A.S.A., who I've debated twice and come

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:37.369
to the conclusion is a manic-depressive.
You know, I think they ... I don't know. You've

00:54:37.369 --> 00:54:41.749
always had some scientists who've wanted in
on the action. That's not true of climate,

00:54:41.749 --> 00:54:46.161
that's been true of a lot of things. But that's
always a problem in science and policy, and

00:54:46.161 --> 00:54:52.799
... yeah, we don't do a very good job of thinking
about all that. So, someone else? Somebody

00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:57.749
there I can see ...
Don Thorson: The point that I find quite interesting,

00:54:57.749 --> 00:55:04.729
if you listen to T.V., and they give you ... oh,
we hit a new record today. The last record

00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:11.710
was 1935 or some such time. So many records
were set in the ‘30s, and maybe we exceed

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:17.369
them by a point or two ... by a degree or
two. I don't know what was warming it up so

00:55:17.369 --> 00:55:25.660
much in the ‘30s. The other point is, very
short, there's a very good reason they called

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:33.670
Greenland, Greenland: it was warm.
Dr. Hayward: Yeah, no, I mean this is what

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:41.269
I call the Groundhog Day aspect of the issue,
right? We go back to some of these arguments

00:55:41.269 --> 00:55:49.779
we've been having for 20 years, now. I mean,
I know one guy, Daniel Botkin, who's now emeritus

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:55.509
professor in environmental science at U.C.
Santa Barbara. He is doing this big ... so,

00:55:55.509 --> 00:55:58.029
we try and find all these things in the past
to try and find out something. He's going

00:55:58.029 --> 00:56:03.619
through ships' logs from the 19th century
up in Hudson Bay. This is back when those

00:56:03.619 --> 00:56:08.119
British sailors would record, you know, what
tea they had in the morning, right? To try

00:56:08.119 --> 00:56:10.910
and see ice extent and see if he can match
it up, so we're always trying these clever

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.609
things to try and figure it out, but that
only goes back 150, 200 years, right?

00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:23.269
So here's how this happens. There were probably
ten articles published today in the science

00:56:23.269 --> 00:56:28.249
journals on some aspect of climate. It's the
big field right now. Maybe it's 25. And you

00:56:28.249 --> 00:56:30.779
can't keep up with them all. I've tried to
keep up with them the best I can in Nature,

00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:37.380
and Science, and some of the summaries, but
it's impossible. That's why I work on the

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:41.239
policy of it. Let's assume ... again, thought
experiment. Let's assume it's true. Kyoto?

00:56:41.239 --> 00:56:44.309
I mean ... as the gentleman was saying, it's
going to be the hottest year. You still haven't

00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:48.130
given any solution that's in the real world
at all.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:56.240
Barbara: Hi. Two different contradictory things.
Both accurate, both within the last year.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:05.329
Both in the northern and southern hemisphere,
the Arctic and Antarctic ice floes are melting.

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:14.039
That's true, so far as I understand. Secondly,
Toledo, Ohio this last year had more snow

00:57:14.039 --> 00:57:20.979
than any time in its recorded snow measuring
history, which goes back to approximately

00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:29.769
1880. So, some things are hotter and some
things are colder. Your comments?

00:57:29.769 --> 00:57:35.790
Dr. Hayward: That's why most climate scientists
will say we have, at least in the short run,

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:44.640
and even the long run, a chaotic system. The
polar vortex, that's not that unusual. I think

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.479
we had a lot of those back in the ‘70s.
We had a lot of really cold winters in the

00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:52.310
70s around here. I don't think we were looking
at it quite in the fine grain way we are now

00:57:52.310 --> 00:58:03.829
for climate reasons. Yeah. I haven't looked
at the latest ice data for a year or so. So,

00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:08.069
the arctic ice cap is about, I'm going to
say ... this could be wrong by ... about 30%

00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:10.400
below where it was in the late ‘70s, when
we started the satellite measurement. And

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:15.760
that was just steadily down, then you had
a big drop in ... 2008, was it? Then a rebound,

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.420
and ... it's not clear, yet, we haven't had
enough to ... this last year looks like we

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.700
had a bit of a rebound up. So, we'll see what
this winter looks like. Might want to see

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.700
that for four or five years before you see
if it's actually reversed trend.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:33.849
Facilitator: We have time for one more question.
Dr. Hayward: One more? ... Okay.

00:58:33.849 --> 00:58:42.710
Man 2: The question I want to ask, kind of
following a couple points, is: you know, most

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:47.060
climatologists in the mainstream tend to blame
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:54.770
for causing temperature aberrations. What
is, kind of, happening with science's accepting

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:59.219
of the notion that perhaps something else
is to blame? I know ... a Harvard researcher,

00:58:59.219 --> 00:59:03.599
I believe, Willie Soon went up to the arctic
... developed some charts ... and he came

00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:06.369
up with the theory, and several others have
come up with the theory, that total solar

00:59:06.369 --> 00:59:09.089
irradiation was to blame ...
Dr. Hayward: That which? Sorry?

00:59:09.089 --> 00:59:15.690
Man 2: Total solar irradiation. Basically,
solar activity. Sun activity. And also I know

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:21.220
some scientists have attributed it to oceanic
oscillations. And so, you know, given that

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:26.460
those theories seem to match up with actual
temperature data far better than carbon dioxide

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:31.309
does, is there any growing acceptance in the
scientific community that maybe these things

00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:38.729
are factors more than human action?
Dr. Hayward: Well ... the short answer is,

00:59:38.729 --> 00:59:43.319
I don't know because ... I mean, I've used
the shorthand of the scientific community,

00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:46.469
but there's a lot of variation in the scientific
community. There's a lot of popularity with,

00:59:46.469 --> 00:59:53.151
yeah, the ocean oscillations, that's a well-known
phenomenon. There is a theory popular with

00:59:53.151 --> 01:00:00.200
people like Hansen, Jim Hansen. It sounds
a little odd, but black carbon. That the shrinkage

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:07.269
of the Arctic ice cap owes more to changes
in albedo. What that means is: the snow's

01:00:07.269 --> 01:00:12.059
actually darker. It doesn't look darker to
us. But the sun and radiation balances all

01:00:12.059 --> 01:00:14.119
the rest of that.
It's darker, therefore it absorbs more heat,

01:00:14.119 --> 01:00:18.440
and then it melts. Now, where's that coming
from? Well, you know, our coal emissions,

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:25.489
or China mostly, but ... not quite sure about
that. But ... so, there's a lot of thought

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:29.210
on that, and, you know, that does make a big
difference. If it's that, that turns out to

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.190
be fairly easy to control... without even
getting rid of coal, I mean, we've gotten

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:37.519
rid of our, you know... we've got scrubbers
on our coal plants. China's new coal plants

01:00:37.519 --> 01:00:40.160
are much lower emissions than the one they've
been building in the last 20 years because

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.680
their air's so bad. And, so if that's true,
it might be a declining problem.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.529
The solar radiation thing has ten different
variations at least. And I'd be hard pressed

01:00:51.529 --> 01:00:56.880
to get into great detail about them. And,
so, I just, I let them thrash all that out.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.470
So, that's about the best I can do on that,
because there's a wide menu on all of those

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.489
things.
Oh, that's right, you said we're done.

01:01:04.489 --> 01:01:12.579
Facilitator: Very good, yes. Thank you very
much, Dr. Hayward.

01:01:12.579 --> 01:01:19.690
The hospitality will begin here on the mezzanine
for our guests and students, you know what

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:24.339
to do hopefully by now. Thank you.
Dr. Hayward: What are students supposed to

01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:27.599
do, go away?
Facilitator: Go on the left.

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:30.450
Dr. Hayward: Oh, okay.
Facilitator: Very good.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:31.669
Dr. Hayward: Yep.
