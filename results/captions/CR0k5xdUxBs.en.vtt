00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.970
RUBIO: ...For example, you're only person
on this stage that has ever been fined for

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.410
hiring people to work on your projects illegally.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.410
You hired some workers from Poland...

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.770
TRUMP: No, no, I'm the only one on the stage
that's hired people.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.410
You haven't hired anybody.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.892
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:17.892
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: And by the way, I've hired -- and by

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:18.892
the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people
over at my job.

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:19.892
You've hired nobody.

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:20.892
RUBIO: Yes, you've hired a thousand people
from another country...

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:21.892
TRUMP: You've had nothing but problems with
your credit cards, et cetera.

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:22.892
So don't tell me about that.

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:24.429
RUBIO: Let me just say -- let me finish the
statement.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.429
This is important.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.189
TRUMP: You haven't hired one person in your
life.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.529
RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.420
And he had to pay a million dollars or so
in a judgment from...

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.420
TRUMP: That's wrong.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.420
That's wrong.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Totally wrong.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
RUBIO: That's a fact.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.420
People can look it up.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.420
I'm sure people are Googling it right now.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Look it up.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.250
"Trump Polish workers," you'll see a million
dollars for hiring illegal workers on one

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.640
of his projects.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640
He did it.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.309
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: That happened.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.469
TRUMP: I've hired tens of thousands of people
over my lifetime.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.469
Tens of thousands...

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.680
RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of
hiring Americans.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
TRUMP: Be quiet.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680
Just be quiet.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Let me talk.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.789
I've hired tens of thousands of people.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.460
He brings up something from 30 years ago,
it worked out very well.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Everybody was happy.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.460
RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.720
TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally
different.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.780
That was a whole different world.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
BLITZER: Thank you.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.939
TRUMP: But I've hired people.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.370
Nobody up here has hired anybody.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.370
BLITZER: Senator Cruz.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.320
RUBIO: If he builds the wall the way he built
Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780
labor to do it.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.380
The second...

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.030
RUBIO: But it -- no, it's not a sound bite.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.030
It's a fact.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.030
Again, go online and Google it.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.030
Donald Trump, Polish workers.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.030
You'll see it.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.450
The second thing, about the trade war -- I
don't understand, because your ties and the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.869
clothes you make is made in Mexico and in
China.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.090
So you're gonna be starting a trade war against
your own ties and your own suits.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.310
TRUMP: All right, you know what?

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.930
RUBIO: Why don't you make them in America?

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.930
TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency
-- they devalue their currencies...

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.930
RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.020
TRUMP: ... that makes it -- well, you don't
know a thing about business.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.020
You lose on everything...

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
RUBIO: Well, make them in America.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.341
TRUMP: But you wouldn't know anything about
it because you're a lousy businessman.

00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:47.890
RUBIO: Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting
four companies.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.570
You've bankrupted four companies.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.420
TRUMP: No, I -- and you know why?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.420
You know why?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.420
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: I don't know anything about...

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
TRUMP: You know why?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.420
RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that
was a fake university.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.420
BLITZER: One at a time.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
TRUMP: First of all...

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
BLITZER: One at a time.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.420
TRUMP: ... first of all, that's called a...

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.420
BLITZER: Hold on.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.420
One at a time, Mr. Trump.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.420
RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and
they're suing him now -- $36,000 to go to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.420
a university...

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.420
TRUMP: And by the way -- and by the way...

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.420
RUBIO: ... that's a fake school.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.500
TRUMP: ... and by the way...

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
RUBIO: And you know what they got?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
They got to take a picture with a cardboard
cutout of Donald Trump...

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500
TRUMP: ... I've won most of the lawsuits.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
RUBIO: That's what they got for $36,000.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500
BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job,
but I've won most of the lawsuits.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring
in...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague
Maria Celeste.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
TRUMP: Excuse me.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Hey Wolf, let me ask you.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Am I allowed to respond to this?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
BLITZER: You're allowed -- you've been responding.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500
TRUMP: OK.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
Well let -- no, I haven't.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.500
I really haven't.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
(LAUGHTER)
RUBIO: He's talked through the whole thing.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.550
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Here's a guy -- here's a guy that buys

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.390
a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist
who's probably here for $380,000 and then

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.060
legislation is passed.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.850
You tell me about this guy.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.850
This is what we're going to have as president.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.930
RUBIO: Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.250
If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know
where Donald Trump would be right now?

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.250
TRUMP: No, no, no.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.250
RUBIO: Selling watches in Manhattan.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.590
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.860
RUBIO: That's where he would be.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.750
TRUMP: That is so wrong.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.270
We'll work on that.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.950
I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.950
RUBIO: Oh, OK.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.950
One million.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.950
TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.940
RUBIO: Then release your tax returns so we
can see how much money he made.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.810
TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it
into $10 billion...

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.000
RUBIO: Oh, he doesn't make that money.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.020
TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.660
RUBIO: ...As soon as I step foot into the
Oval Office.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.720
TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720
He lied.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720
100 percent.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720
100 percent.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.810
RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.810
TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.810
38 years ago.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.810
RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.810
ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.810
RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.230
All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation
on lies.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.310
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: Here’s what you didn't hear in that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.120
answer, and this is important guys, this is
an important thing.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.300
What is your plan?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.510
I understand the lines around the state, whatever
that means.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.459
This is not a game where you draw maps...

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.459
TRUMP: ... And, you don't know what it means...

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.459
RUBIO: ... What is your plan?

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.590
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.040
TRUMP: You don't know.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.409
BASH: (inaudible)
TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.409
(CROSSTALK)
RUBIO: ... What's your plan...

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.409
TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I'll have
you know...

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.409
RUBIO: ... What's your plan...

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.850
TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown
two weeks ago with Chris Christie.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.250
I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's
got is he really doesn't know about the lines.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.900
The biggest thing we've got, and the reason
we've got no competition, is because we have

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.459
lines around the state, and you have essentially
monopolies in this country…

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.260
RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible)
plan, I know what that is, but what else is

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.260
part of your plan...

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.260
TRUMP: ... You don't know much...

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.799
RUBIO: ... So, you're only thing is to get
rid of the lines around the states.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.261
What else is part of your healthcare plan...

00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:07.909
TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:08.909
RUBIO: ... That's your only plan...

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.040
TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done -- not
now...

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040
RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
TRUMP: ... Excuse me.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040
Excuse me.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040
RUBIO: ... His plan.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040
That was the plan...

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.170
TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings
in competition.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.470
So, instead of having one insurance company
taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.470
have many.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.320
They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful
thing.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.650
RUBIO: Alright...

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.430
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: So, that's the only part of the plan?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.430
Just the lines?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.040
BASH: (inaudible)
TRUMP: The nice part of the plan -- you'll

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.310
have many different plans.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.030
You'll have competition, you'll have so many
different plans.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.030
RUBIO: Now he's repeating himself.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.030
TRUMP: No, no, no.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.030
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)
TRUMP: I don’t repeat myself.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.240
I don’t repeat myself.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.490
RUBIO: You don’t repeat yourself?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.280
(CHEERING)
TRUMP: Here’s the guy who repeats himself,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.680
I don’t repeat myself.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.930
RUBIO: You repeat yourself everyday.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.610
TRUMP: I watched him - talking about repeating
- I watched him repeat himself five times

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.610
four weeks ago...

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.670
RUBIO: ... I just saw you repeat yourself
five times five seconds ago...

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.540
(LOUD APPLAUSE &amp; CHEERING)
TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.850
like that, I've never seen it in anybody...

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.000
BASH: ... Let's stay focused on the subject...

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.840
TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming
pool...

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.000
RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every
night, he says five things, everyone's dumb,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.040
he's gonna make America great again...

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.180
BASH: ... Senator Rubio...

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.020
RUBIO: ... We're going to win, win win, he's
winning in the polls...

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.320
BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.600
RUBIO: ... And the lines around the states.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.900
(APPLAUSE)
RUBIO: ... Every night.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.900
Same thing.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.900
BASH: Senator Rubio.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.900
(CHEERING)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.900
the truth.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.070
BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to
respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.070
to what you've just posed to him...

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.190
RUBIO: ... Yeah, he's going to give us his
plan now, right?

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.190
OK...

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.340
BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more
about your plan.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.660
I know you talked about...

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.550
TRUMP: ...No, no, we're going to have many
different plans because...

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.250
BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.250
TRUMP: ... competition...

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.250
RUBIO: ... He's done it again.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.830
(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: There is going to be competition among

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.580
all of the states, and the insurance companies.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.770
They're going to have many, many different
plans.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.650
BASH: Is there anything else you would like
to add to that...

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.650
TRUMP: No, there's nothing to add.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.650
What’s to add?

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.650
(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: What is to add?

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.650
BASH: Thank you.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.650
TRUMP: In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.570
I watched him melt down and I'll tell you,
it was one of the saddest things I've ever

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.570
seen.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.570
He's not going down -- excuse me...

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.830
RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate
deal.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.490
TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people
may even be tougher than Chris Christie.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.490
OK?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.990
RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate
deal, Donald.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.660
TRUMP: OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.660
Let me tell you that.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660
I learned a long time ago.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.660
RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you're dealing
with terrorists.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.660
Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:34.320
TRUMP: You are not a negotiator.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320
You are not a negotiator.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320
bring peace.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
You will never bring peace...

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.530
RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to build
condos in the Palestinian areas, but it's

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.530
not a real estate deal...

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.790
TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to
bring peace...

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.790
BLITZER: ... Senator.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.090
TRUMP: He will never be able to do it.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.090
I think I may be able to do it, although I
will say this.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.551
Probably the toughest deal of any kind is
that particular deal.

00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:53.710
CRUZ: ...You've been funding liberal Democratic
politicians.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.710
And by the way...

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.710
TRUMP: I funded you.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.710
I funded him.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.710
Can you believe it?

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.710
(APPLAUSE)
CRUZ: ... the reason is -- you're welcome

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.710
to have the check back.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.850
TRUMP: I funded this guy.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.850
I gave him a check.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.850
CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.850
TRUMP: I gave him a check.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.850
RUBIO: He never funded me.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.850
CRUZ: And -- and by the way, let's be clear.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.380
(APPLAUSE)
Donald claims -- Donald claims to care about...

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.860
TRUMP: You know why?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.160
I didn't want to, but he sent me his book
with his autograph...

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
(CROSSTALK)
CRUZ: Donald.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160
Donald.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
Donald.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160
I understand rules are very hard for you.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160
They're very confusing.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.160
TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
I have his book.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.160
RUBIO: Yeah on a reality TV show not in politics,
er, in public service.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Thank you -- thank you for the book.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.630
Go ahead.
