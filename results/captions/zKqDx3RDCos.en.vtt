00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.667
could history be so stunningly wrong

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:15.000
that the temples built by
King Solomon and King Herod

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.792
were never on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.501
Jews and Christians alike
believe without any doubt

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:24.751
that these temples were located
on the Temple Mount for

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.250
hundreds of years hidden away in
the temples Holy of Holies

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.250
rested the Ark of the Covenant

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:36.375
and so for Jews the Temple Mount
is the most holy place on earth

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:40.667
a billion Muslims hold this to be
the most holy place as well

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.792
believing it to be where
Muhammad ascended into Heaven

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from the area of the dome of the rock

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.542
this presents a huge
problem for several faiths

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:51.584
that all clash at ground zero

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.959
at a place in Jerusalem that we know

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:55.626
as the Temple Mount

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.751
it should be no surprise that
this is the most volatile piece

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:03.292
of real estate where more blood
has been spilt over the last

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:06.375
three thousand years than
any other place on earth

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:08.709
many believe this will be the site

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.042
of World War Three

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:14.584
but what if the Temple Mount
is not the true location of

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:18.125
the temples will tradition
even allow a closer look

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.709
do we find anywhere in the Bible
ancient history or physical

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.042
evidence that the temples
were located somewhere else

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.913
on the other side of this wall stood

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:44.000
the first temple and the second temple

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:45.709
they were destroyed

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:48.167
and the third temple when the Messiah comes

00:01:48.334 --> 00:01:50.542
will come here on the
other side of the wall

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.417
and we're told that God to reveal
present never left these stones

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.959
from the time of the temple till
now and that's what we feel

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.042
it when we come here God revealed present

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.542
this the holiest place
that we have right now

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.769
the third temple is gonna come right here

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.608
so without a doubt you believe
there's no doubt there's no doubt

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.709
although most people today are
convinced that the temples were

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.501
located on the Temple Mount
that wasn't the case sixteen

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.501
hundred years ago if I told you
in the fourth century there were

00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:26.292
four places that rabbis were
suggesting for the temple four

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:29.356
different locations in the fourth century
would you believe me no I wouldn't

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:32.266
our tradition is that of
authhoritative tradition

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:33.542
wins out and we go with what we have

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:35.751
we don't we don't we don't do our own thing

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:38.626
we don't try to make our own
assumptions we have what we have

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:41.083
if we don't have what our parents and
rabbis gave us then we have nothing

00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:45.000
before somebody can come along
and change what's already been

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.501
established their gonna have to be greater
than the one's who established it

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:51.501
challenging a long held tradition

00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:56.667
is not easy but it's mandatory
in our quest to find the truth

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.626
having a tradition challenged

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.250
is never never never comfortable

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.751
and yet essential if we're gonna
really get at the truth and

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:09.542
what really happened and what
really is going to happen

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.417
you are Jew no I have no time to
lose with you okay [Laughing]

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.876
could it even be possible that
the greatest archaeological

00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:24.751
mistake of all times has
occurred in locating

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:28.209
the temples of Herod and
Solomon on the Temple Mount

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.375
and if so where is the true
location of the temple today

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:36.667
the prophetic implications are
absolutely astounding and

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:40.542
the political repercussions
from it could alter the entire

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:42.375
complexion of the Middle East

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:01.098
hi my name is Bob Cornuke
and we're in Old Jerusalem

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:03.375
and I'm about to take you on
an expedition like you've

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.751
never been on before we're
gonna look for the lost

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.209
location of Solomon's and Herold's Temples

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.959
I believe that archaeology
has really missed this one

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:16.918
I think that history is
stunningly wrong saying that

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:20.918
the Temple Mount is the place
of where Herold's Temples and

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:22.459
Solomon's Temples were located

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:25.334
so we're gonna take out the
Bible and we're gonna use it

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:30.167
as a road map and as a compass to
solve this most ancient mystery

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:35.083
in around 957 BC

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:39.792
God had king Solomon build the
temple for worship sacrifice

00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:43.501
and to house the Ark of the
Covenant this magnificent

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:46.459
facility stood until 586 BC

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:48.876
when the Babylonians destroyed it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.834
and took the Israelites captive

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.292
in around 515 BC

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:57.542
Zerubbabel and other Israeli
exiles were able to return to

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.918
Jerusalem in order to rebuild
the temple on top of

00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:04.125
the demolished first temple
this second temple wasn't

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.876
as spectacular as Solomon's

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:09.959
but served its purpose until
20 BC when king Herod

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.250
initiated a significant
renovation and expansion project

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.000
this is the temple that
stood in Jesus's day

00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:19.459
where He taught on several occasions

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:21.959
and where He confronted the money changers

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.709
in 70 AD

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:27.209
four years after the Jews
rebelled against the Roman Empire

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.626
military commander Titus and the Roman Army

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:32.459
utterly destroyed the temple

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:36.292
today many Jews and Christians
are anticipating the day when

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:40.542
a third temple will be rebuilt as
foretold in the book of Ezekiel

00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:44.000
tradition says it needs to be
rebuilt on the same spot where

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.667
Solomon and Herod's temple
stood will that be the Muslim

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.709
controlled Temple Mount or

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.209
is it somewhere else

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:54.459
this makes the search for
the temples actual location

00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:56.417
that much more imperative

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.000
Biblical explorer Bob Cornuke

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:04.250
has spent the past few decades
searching for the real Mount Sinai

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.667
the Ark of the Covenant Noah's Ark

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:10.292
and the apostle Paul's shipwreck in Malta

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:13.709
his search for the location of
Solomon and Herod's temple's

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:18.365
really began several years ago
when he was reading Matthew 24

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:19.584
the Bible tells us

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:21.709
in Matthew 24

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:24.417
where Jesus is speaking

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:28.083
and He's speaking to His
disciples and He's walking away

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:29.375
from the temple

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:32.959
and He is looking up at
the temple and He tells

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.417
the disciples He said truly I tell you

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.667
not one stone here will be left on another

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:40.751
everyone will be thrown down

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:45.000
not one stone total annihilation

00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:50.584
and that's what we hear from history
that the temple was totally destroyed

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:53.667
the hill called Zion

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:57.751
at Jerusalem the building there
that is to say the temple has

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.834
been utterly removed or shaken

00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:04.626
it was so thoroughly laid even
with the ground by those that

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.792
dug it up to the foundation
that there was left nothing to

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:11.292
make those that came thither
believe it had ever been inhabited

00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:17.292
but if Herod's Temple was
utterly removed how can

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:21.167
the Western Wall of the Temple
exist today either Jesus was

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:23.209
inaccurate in Matthew 24

00:07:23.334 --> 00:07:27.459
or perhaps the Western Wall
wasn't part of the temple at all

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.471
about 63 BC

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.584
the Romans took this city

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.834
General Pompey had the
gates opened up to him

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:46.459
and from that point on the Romans
had control here for over three

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:50.542
hundred years the big question
is where did they stay

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.501
no one has ever found one

00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.459
brick that they know of that's
from the Roman fortress

00:07:57.792 --> 00:07:59.209
I believe it's because

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:01.167
it's been on the Temple Mount

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:03.167
that was the Roman fortress

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:06.584
that huge complex if you look
at it today it is in the same

00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:09.292
dimensions as many Roman fortresses

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:13.375
so where did the Roman's stay
they stayed on the Temple Mount

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:17.751
locating the Roman Fort on the
Temple Mount explains how

00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.083
the temple could be utterly
destroyed yet still have

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.626
remains existing to this
day the Western Wall

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:27.542
instead of being the
remains of Herod's Temple

00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:30.626
may actually be a part of the Roman Fort

00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:36.375
Eleazar Ben Yair the commander of the
Israelites taking refuge at Masada said

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:42.167
Jerusalem is now demolished to the
very foundations and have nothing left

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.167
but that monument of it
preserved I mean the camp of

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:49.334
those Romans that hath destroyed it
which still dwells upon its ruins

00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:53.751
the traditional view places the
Roman Fort called the Tower of

00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:57.918
Antonia at the northwest corner
of the Temple Mount this three

00:08:57.918 --> 00:09:01.834
acre plot supposedly housed
the entire Tenth Roman Legion

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:07.792
but how large a legion history tells us
that a legion is approximately six thousand

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:11.459
soldiers with the support
personel it could reach as

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:13.459
high as ten thousand people

00:09:13.876 --> 00:09:17.209
if I was in coming unto the
tenth heavy Roman legion

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:22.042
sent to Jerusalem to keep the peace

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:27.459
I would have occupied the high
ground I would have put

00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:28.751
my soldiers

00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:30.417
on the Temple Mount

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:36.250
and as I look at the little
bitty building that is called

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.250
Fort Antonia today

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:40.891
it's almost laughable

00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:46.459
to believe that six thousand
soldiers and some four thousand

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:50.626
camp followers occupied that tiny building

00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:54.918
would Rome the proud rulers of
Europe and the Middle East be

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:58.959
content to locate their fort as
an appendage to the Jewish Temple

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:02.792
or would they be more likely to
commandeer the entire Temple

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:07.292
Mount to build the regional
military headquarters again we

00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:09.417
turn to historian Josephus

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.834
now as to the Tower of the Antonia

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.918
it might seem to be
composed of several cities

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:20.167
for if we go up to this Tower
of Antonia we gain the city

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:23.083
since we shall then be
upon the top of the hill

00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:27.250
the only location that is on top of a hill

00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:30.751
and is large enough to house
ten thousand soldiers and

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.375
support staff is the
thirty-six acre Temple Mount

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:38.626
in 333 AD the so called Bordeaux pilgrim

00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:41.792
travel to Jerusalem and
describes what he found

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.542
I'm in a high tower about a
hundred feet high right next to

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:46.083
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and it's

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:48.834
a fascinating place because
from this position

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.334
the Bordeaux pilgrim said that
he looked due east and all

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:55.250
thry could see was a long
wall of a Roman fort

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:58.751
when I look due east of here
all I see is the long wall of

00:10:58.751 --> 00:10:59.542
the Temple Mount

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:01.584
so what I think the Bordeaux pilgrim was

00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:04.918
describing was looking at the
Roman fort from this spot

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:08.292
in fact that's pretty conclusive
that's what he was looking at

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.626
was the Temple Mount complex
certainly I believe was a Roman

00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:13.959
fortress that housed the Tenth Roman Legion

00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:18.083
so if historical evidence
places the Roman fort on

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:21.709
the Temple Mount why do the
majority of people believe that

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:25.125
this is where the temple was
located when it was over with

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:28.792
and the temple was destroyed
by Titus in 70 AD

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:31.501
that there was just like a field

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:33.250
with blowing grass

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.751
you wouldn't even know that was
there and so the Jews that

00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:38.417
were quarantined from Israel for so long

00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.083
it's hard for them to determine
where the temple was so this has

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.626
been the place that everybody
settled on in fact in the

00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:46.834
fourth century

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.334
there was many places

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.334
that people were trying to
figure out where is the temple

00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:54.751
really located people were not sure

00:11:55.626 --> 00:11:58.542
one important event that
promoted the idea of the Temple

00:11:58.542 --> 00:12:02.000
Mount being the location of the
temple was the invasion of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.626
Jerusalem by the crusaders and in 1099

00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:10.751
there was thousands of crusaders
and they came and they conquered

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.959
this Temple Mount complex and
when they went on top of it

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:15.542
there was great carnage

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:18.250
a lot of Jews a lot of Muslims were killed

00:12:18.834 --> 00:12:21.667
and they crawled up on the
dome wasn't gold then

00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:24.375
but they called up on
that dome area up there

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:27.167
and they ripped off the crescent
moon and they replaced it

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:30.000
with the cross and they called
it Templum Domini which means

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.042
the temple of God

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:32.876
that I think started

00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:34.459
a tradition

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:39.000
seventy years after the
crusaders conquered Jerusalem

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:42.626
and eleven hundred years after
Herod's Temple was destroyed

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:45.584
a Jew from Spain named Benjamin of Tudela

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:47.000
visited Jerusalem

00:12:47.292 --> 00:12:50.375
and wrote that the Temple Mount
was the location of the former

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:54.751
temples his emphatic statements
seem to seal the tradition and

00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:56.167
from that point on

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:59.584
it has been virtually
unchallenged well I believe

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.709
that this is not the place
of Solomon's Temple's

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.792
and Herold's Temples but it's
actually in the city of David a few

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:07.375
thousand feet south of here and
we're gonna go the city of

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:09.334
David right now and we're gonna try and see

00:13:09.584 --> 00:13:11.292
if that is the true place

00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:14.250
where God tells us these
temples were located

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:20.542
the city of David is a twelve
acre plot of land just south of

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:21.459
the Temple Mount

00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:23.918
we're here in the city of David

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:27.167
and it was back in the eighteen
hundreds where they established

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.918
that this was the city of David
with the discovery of the Gihon

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:32.000
springs and Hezekiah's tunnel

00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:36.751
when king David arrived in
Jerusalem the city of David was

00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:40.209
inhabited by the Jebusites
David's men captured their

00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:41.000
fortress

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:43.709
and 2 Samuel 5:9 says

00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:47.709
so David lived in the fortress
and called it the city of David

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.501
and then the scriptures in

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:51.918
2 Samuel 24:18

00:13:52.292 --> 00:13:55.584
it is revealed that David was
after he conquered the Jebusite

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:58.459
city which is right under the city of David

00:13:59.143 --> 00:14:03.375
he was required by the Lord to
purchase the threshing floor from

00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:05.459
Ornan the Jebusite

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:09.667
and then 2 Chronicles 3:1 we see

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:13.959
that Solomon it says that Solomon first
began to build the house of the Lord

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:17.459
by the threshing floor that
was purchased from Ornan

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:22.751
the Jebusite Solomon's Temple was in the
city of David the Jebusite fortress

00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:26.626
I can't see how you can
argue with 2 Chronicles 3:1

00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:28.792
if we're gonna take the Bible
at face value that's where

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:29.918
Solomon's Temple was

00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:34.250
the city of David is also
referred to as Zion

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.000
2 Samuel 5:7 says

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.459
David captured the fortress of Zion

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.834
that is the city of David

00:14:41.459 --> 00:14:45.459
Eusebius a third century
historian and curator of

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:47.125
the library in Caesarea

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:49.459
wrote that the temple was in Zion

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.042
the hill called Zion and Jerusalem

00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:55.959
the building there that
is to say the temple

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:57.792
King David took

00:14:58.626 --> 00:14:59.417
the Zion

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:00.834
to the custom

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:02.167
and changed

00:15:02.876 --> 00:15:04.459
his name to the city of David

00:15:05.834 --> 00:15:07.918
so the Mount of Zion is the city of David

00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:12.042
 so the love of his I
only the city of David

00:15:13.334 --> 00:15:15.292
we're standing in the area
of the city of David here's

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:18.125
an archaeological site and
there's the south wall of

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:21.959
the traditional Temple Mount so we're in
the general area of the Temple Mount and

00:15:22.375 --> 00:15:25.375
this area we have seen in
photographs in the 1930's

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:28.959
and we see these terrorists
farms you can even

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:31.792
see the people out there
killing the ground and it's

00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:33.125
very interesting

00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:34.667
that the Bible says this

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:38.125
in a prophecy the minor
prophet Micah says in 3:12

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:41.417
Zion shall be plowed like a field

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.542
Jerusalem shall become heaps
of ruins and the mountains of

00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:46.626
the temple like the bare
hills of the forest

00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:50.209
the temples gonna be like a plowed field

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:54.334
well there's no plowed field up
there those walls have been up

00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:56.792
there you know a couple
thousand years if that is

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:59.417
really the temple Micah says there
should be a plowed field

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.834
it never was this area was

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:04.542
so we can be assured that
in the city of David

00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.417
it matches with what the prophet says

00:16:07.626 --> 00:16:08.834
and what the Bible says

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.459
in history you know there's not a theory

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.292
that it doesn't have a long
list of critics that line up

00:16:15.292 --> 00:16:18.542
especially the temple theory
it's so shocking to a lot of

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.292
people they say wait a second the temple in

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:22.459
the city of David and
the stronghold of Zion

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.501
and then they say wait wait we
have a great verse here that

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:28.834
tells you that you're wrong about the
temple being in the city of David

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:32.959
then Solomon assembled the elders
of Israel and all the heads of

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:36.584
the tribes to bring up the Ark
of the Covenant of the Lord from

00:16:36.584 --> 00:16:38.876
the city of David which is Zion

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.918
so what was brought up out of
the city of David thus it was

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:46.834
brought where they surmise to
the Temple Mount the Bible doesn't

00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:47.918
say where it was taken

00:16:48.626 --> 00:16:51.417
it was placed into the
Holy of Holies after that

00:16:51.834 --> 00:16:53.292
underneath the wings of the cherubim

00:16:53.918 --> 00:16:57.042
now where was it taken when it was
taken out of the city of David

00:16:57.292 --> 00:16:58.792
there was a huge festival

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.501
where all the priest of Israel
came where they slaughtered so

00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:05.292
many animals that they couldn't
even count them the Bible says

00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.751
the city of David's just a twelve acre area

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.709
very very small confines

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:12.209
so they couldn't have done that
in the city did they went and had

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:14.250
this big festival like a state fair

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:19.209
is not gonna be done in city hall
and then they brought it back

00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:23.042
into the temple which was
in the city of David

00:17:25.918 --> 00:17:28.959
a little known historical
account describes two covered

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:32.417
bridges or colonnades that
spanned some six hundred feet

00:17:32.417 --> 00:17:34.959
between Ford Antonia on the north and

00:17:34.959 --> 00:17:36.584
Herod's Temple to the south

00:17:37.626 --> 00:17:39.334
Josephus describes them

00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:42.083
now as to the tower of Antonia

00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:45.834
it was situated at the corner
of two colonies of the court of

00:17:45.834 --> 00:17:49.125
the temple of that on the west
and that on the north

00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:54.667
he then describes Fort Antonia
as a guard to the temple and

00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:57.626
mentions that it is
located on a higher hill

00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:00.542
and that it hindered this side
of the temple on the north

00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:04.125
these descriptions confirm that
the Fort was on the higher

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:07.250
Temple Mount while the temple
was six hundred feet to

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.751
the south and at a lower elevation

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.542
there's a story in the book of
Acts that also confirms this

00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:17.083
it describes the time that the
commander of the Roman soldiers

00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:20.542
quickly deployed troops from
the fort down to the temple to

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:23.959
rescue the apostle Paul
from a riotous situation

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:28.042
at once the commander took along
some soldiers and centurions

00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:29.626
and ran down to them

00:18:30.918 --> 00:18:34.626
then verse forty describes
how Paul addressed the crowd

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:38.167
Paul standing on the stairs spoke to them

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.667
these were the stairs leading
back up to the Fortress Antonia

00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:50.709
another clue to the location of
the temple is the Gihon springs

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:54.751
the fresh water source is
mentioned in the Bible in

00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:57.876
1 kings 1:38 where Solomon
was brought to the Gihon

00:18:58.167 --> 00:18:59.542
to anoint him as king

00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:03.250
fresh running water is
also necessary for worship

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:07.375
and to perform animal sacrifices
which took place in the temple

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:10.083
1 kings 8:62 tells us

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:12.501
on the day of the temple dedication

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:16.667
Solomon offered a sacrifice of
fellowship offerings to the Lord

00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:18.501
twenty two thousand cattle

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:21.459
and a hundred and twenty
thousand sheep and goats

00:19:23.334 --> 00:19:26.751
cleaning up after the sacrifice
of that many animals would

00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:30.834
require a huge amount of
running water Roman historian

00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:35.250
Tacitus tells us the temple
contained an inexhaustible spring

00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:39.292
you have to have running
water from a spring

00:19:39.918 --> 00:19:43.334
to wash and purify the priest
before they go into the temple

00:19:43.334 --> 00:19:47.584
to worship here we have clear
clean running water coming from

00:19:47.584 --> 00:19:49.334
the Gihon springs

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:52.417
which travels through Hezekiah's tunnel

00:19:52.709 --> 00:19:54.667
and comes here to this

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:55.751
pool of water

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:59.417
before the priests would go into
the temple weither it be Solomon's

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:02.209
Temple or Herold's Temple they
needed to be bathed in spring

00:20:02.209 --> 00:20:05.584
water the only spring water in all
of Jerusalem is right here in

00:20:05.584 --> 00:20:06.375
the Gihon springs

00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:09.417
there's absolutely no spring
water on theTemple of the Mount

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.667
there's no way that they would have
washed themselves in the Gihon

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:15.792
springs and then walked a quarter
mile to a half a mile to

00:20:15.792 --> 00:20:16.501
the Temple Mount

00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:19.125
before they were allowed to
go into the temple precincts

00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:21.250
considered to be purified

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:34.083
tradition when valued
higher than evidence can be

00:20:34.083 --> 00:20:36.334
a stumbling block to finding the truth

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:40.083
but tradition can also
provide valuable clues

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.709
when accompanied by scriptural
historical or physical evidence

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.417
so local traditions need to be
considered in our search for

00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:51.751
the temple location I've been
it's a tour guide here for more

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:54.918
than thirteen years and there's
some amazing things that we're

00:20:54.918 --> 00:20:56.209
discovering now that is

00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:57.709
that are to the south

00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:59.292
of the Temple Mount area

00:20:59.542 --> 00:21:01.250
where we believe we've found

00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:05.709
the Temple of Solomon which is
gonna be to the southern part

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.584
and Solomon's Temple

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:11.667
is possibly really in this area
close to the city of David

00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:16.584
we know from all my life
that the temple it's in this

00:21:16.584 --> 00:21:20.501
area nobody say that the temple
it's under the mosque nobody

00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:23.209
say that the temple here in the
corner and nobody say that

00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:23.375
they've

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:27.501
temple here but all the
people who understand

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.417
in these things they say that

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:34.167
the temple it's under the city of
David this is the city of David

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:35.000
the city of David okay

00:21:35.334 --> 00:21:38.125
they say the Jewish say
some of the Jews say that

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:41.167
the temple its been here right on the
Temple Mount yes on the Temple Mount

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.751
there is another people from Jewish

00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:45.334
they say the temple it's

00:21:45.792 --> 00:21:48.876
in the mosque under the mosque so from my

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:52.042
opinion from my what I see over here

00:21:52.417 --> 00:21:54.542
most of the people say that it's

00:21:55.501 --> 00:21:56.667
under the city of David

00:21:57.584 --> 00:22:00.209
so you're saying that the Bible is telling
you an archaeologist is telling you

00:22:00.209 --> 00:22:03.459
the Bible say this is the place the
city of David the city of David

00:22:03.542 --> 00:22:04.250
the Bible say

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:10.334
yeah the Bible say that this but
like if I speak nobody will hear

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:14.751
another people nobody will hear
but it's is something politic

00:22:16.292 --> 00:22:20.209
beyond politics and tradition
is there any archaeological

00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:23.876
data to support the idea of the
temple being in the city of

00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:26.000
David a couple years ago I was

00:22:26.584 --> 00:22:29.501
going on a tour of the city of
David which is an underground

00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:31.167
labyrinth of tunnels and caves

00:22:31.709 --> 00:22:34.542
a lot of these stones are believed
to be from the time of Abraham

00:22:34.542 --> 00:22:37.417
the Jebusite Fortress and things
mentioned in the Bible but as

00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:40.292
I'm walking along I saw this
flicker of light way up in

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.459
a shaft where men were working
I heard metal on metal

00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:45.375
and I saw the flicker of light

00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:49.626
and up inside where they were
working I found out later on

00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:52.709
was a place that we
believe could be part of

00:22:52.876 --> 00:22:54.250
Solomon's Temple

00:22:54.751 --> 00:22:55.959
and we're gonna be going there

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.542
but it all started for me

00:22:57.792 --> 00:22:58.626
right up there

00:22:59.167 --> 00:23:03.209
through that shaft where I
saw that light two years ago

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.000
this area was excavated recently

00:23:06.876 --> 00:23:10.000
by Eli Shukron who was this
director of archaeology in

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.584
the city of David I think
he stumbled across

00:23:13.334 --> 00:23:15.250
an area that was within

00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:18.542
part of the structure of Solomon's Temple

00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:22.501
this is from the first temple
period even be before that

00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:28.250
we're going to back to the middle Bronze
period and that is before King David

00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:32.709
eight hundred years before king
David would place this around

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:36.918
the time of Abraham and Melchizedek
we use this place as a worship

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.167
area and then still use it

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:43.125
till the end of this area it's like

00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:47.504
the end of the eighth century
beginning seventh century BC

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:50.876
and this is the only place that
we know in the city of David

00:23:51.709 --> 00:23:56.626
that we can say here it was some
worship with standing stone

00:23:56.626 --> 00:23:58.042
with the which was for

00:23:58.334 --> 00:24:01.250
sacrifice all what we have around you

00:24:02.083 --> 00:24:05.083
and this is a place for worship
this is a place for praying

00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:09.000
this is place for a sacrifice
and this is a place

00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.834
people connect with their God

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:15.459
we're here in this incredible
archaeological site right below

00:24:15.918 --> 00:24:16.667
my feet here

00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:19.876
is an olive press
you can see where the

00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:22.709
the wood beam went in here
and they ground the olives

00:24:23.876 --> 00:24:26.334
olives are very important for anointing

00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:28.083
someone going into the temple

00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:30.292
right close by within thirty feet

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:33.501
we have the Gihon springs

00:24:34.258 --> 00:24:36.876
and you needed that rushing water to anoint

00:24:37.751 --> 00:24:41.334
the priest before they went into the
temple we also read in scripture

00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:44.459
where Solomon was brought down by a mule

00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:46.584
to the Gihon Springs right here

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:48.751
and he was anointed with the oil

00:24:49.334 --> 00:24:53.626
when he was a crowned king at the Gihon
Springs which is right where we are

00:24:54.167 --> 00:24:58.000
and amazingly archaeologists
have recently uncovered this

00:24:58.292 --> 00:25:01.042
area that is dated to
the first temple period

00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:03.709
and it has within it channels

00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:09.167
if you look here this is a
channel where the blood ran

00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:11.250
the blood ran here

00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:15.292
they would kill the animals and
then blood would go through here

00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:18.834
we could see where the animals
were actually tied up

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:20.709
this is where

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.209
the rings went through

00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:25.250
and this tethered the animal

00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:29.584
when archaeologists came here
they found just piles of bones

00:25:29.584 --> 00:25:32.834
all through here evidence of
animal sacrifices and they

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:34.959
found these unique grooves

00:25:35.334 --> 00:25:36.083
in the ground

00:25:36.918 --> 00:25:39.584
and these are believed to be Eli Shukron

00:25:39.584 --> 00:25:42.334
told me the archaeologists
here that these were stands

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.834
like wooden stands or metal stands

00:25:45.709 --> 00:25:49.417
so this area here going
well over there in here

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.042
is an old ancient

00:25:53.042 --> 00:25:54.918
sanctuary which I believe

00:25:55.626 --> 00:25:59.292
is a part of Solomon's Temple itself

00:26:00.167 --> 00:26:01.375
you got the blood channel you got the

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:03.876
olive press right there

00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:05.667
you've got little hooks

00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:08.918
stone hocks in the side of
the wall where you could tie

00:26:08.918 --> 00:26:12.334
off animals and it's probably
ten yards from the Gihon

00:26:12.334 --> 00:26:13.876
Springs a perfect place

00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:15.584
to have water

00:26:16.209 --> 00:26:18.250
because if your doing a lot of sacrifices

00:26:18.792 --> 00:26:21.584
you need water for that
is this Solomon's Temple

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.334
I don't know is it Herod's
Temple I don't know but

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:28.292
according to a top Israeli archaeologist

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:32.709
it is a temple and he is not
ready to say it was the Temple

00:26:32.709 --> 00:26:35.292
of Solomon or the Temple of Herold

00:26:35.584 --> 00:26:38.876
but he said it was a temple
and it's in the same place

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.459
that 2 Chronicles 3:1

00:26:41.792 --> 00:26:43.167
says Solomon

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.167
set up or built the temple to
the Lord it's in the city of

00:26:48.209 --> 00:26:50.792
David right near the Gihon Springs

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.834
could it be that this ancient
sanctuary is what remains of

00:26:55.834 --> 00:26:59.959
Solomon's temple Herod's Temple
which was built above Solomon's

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.751
was completely destroyed in 70 AD

00:27:03.083 --> 00:27:08.083
but these remains covered over
by the Babylonians in 586 BC

00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:13.000
fit perfectly with 2 Chronicles
3:1 this stuff is blowing

00:27:13.042 --> 00:27:14.667
my mind we think

00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:19.167
that these rocks around us
are telling us that this is

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:22.626
the exact place of Solomon's Temple

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.626
and everything is pointing
to this place and no other

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:29.751
it's not on the Temple Mount
it's in the city of David

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.125
by the Gihon Springs

00:27:31.292 --> 00:27:33.417
which is a gurgling just a few feet away

00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.667
from my standing right now

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.334
well I think one of the things
we need to tread carefully

00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:43.501
because it's so emotional we
need to realize we're dealing

00:27:44.209 --> 00:27:48.334
with deeply held beliefs
so we need to do that

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:51.083
with some compassion on the one hand

00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:54.834
but at the same time I see
it as a healthy thing

00:27:55.334 --> 00:27:57.626
because it should draw us in the direction

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.167
of re-examining our scholarship

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.626
there are certain places
where your big challenge

00:28:05.334 --> 00:28:08.250
isn't finding new evidence per
se the biggest challenge is to

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.281
set aside your presuppositions
so they don't

00:28:11.306 --> 00:28:14.066
get in the way of discovery I think that

00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:18.459
the position of the temple being in
the city of David has merit of course

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:21.959
it raises all kinds of other
questions the fact that

00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:23.125
the scriptures say

00:28:23.834 --> 00:28:26.083
that the temple was in the city of David

00:28:27.042 --> 00:28:29.417
and it had to be near the Gihon Spring

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.459
and I look at the Temple Mount
and there's no spring up on

00:28:33.459 --> 00:28:36.751
the Temple Mount so I have become
a firm believer in the fact

00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:39.667
that the temple was not
up on the Temple Mount

00:28:40.626 --> 00:28:42.459
I'm convinced it was right
there in the city of David

00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:46.626
if indeed the temple was
located in the city of David

00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:49.459
what implication does it have for today

00:28:50.042 --> 00:28:52.626
obviously a lot of Christians
are saying well if the temples

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:53.876
ever gonna be rebuilt

00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:57.125
it's got to be rebuilt right
where the dome of the rock is

00:28:57.375 --> 00:28:58.083
wow

00:28:58.626 --> 00:29:01.042
that's not gonna set of
World War Three is it

00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:05.083
but if if the real temple

00:29:05.709 --> 00:29:09.918
was in the city of David
which is to the south

00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:13.167
of where the dome of the rock
is significantly to the south

00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:16.250
outside the current city walls of the city

00:29:16.626 --> 00:29:19.709
then the temple can be rebuilt
in the city of David and not

00:29:19.751 --> 00:29:22.250
touch the dome of the rock that has

00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:25.959
incredible political
implications quite obviously

00:29:26.667 --> 00:29:29.959
in Luke 8:17 there is a fascinating verse

00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:34.000
for nothing is hidden that will
not be revealed and nothing

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.250
concealed that will not be
made known and come to light

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:41.250
could it be that the temple is one
of those things that it's hidden

00:29:42.083 --> 00:29:45.083
that will be revealed that is
concealed that will come to light

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.375
if we're ever gonna to find the
temple I think we need to use

00:29:48.375 --> 00:29:50.417
the Bible and the Bible is telling me

00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:54.584
that the temple has to
be in the city of David

00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:56.751
in the stronghold of Zion

00:29:57.334 --> 00:30:02.375
and the luring poll of oral
traditions needs to be ignored

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:06.375
that's where we'll find
truth is in the word of God

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:08.375
and not what man is guessing

00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:11.042
but what God is telling us
