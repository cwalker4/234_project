00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.590
The United States government has tried their
best to keep the facts about their Special

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.469
Forces and what they do as secretive as possible.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.130
However, in a country that is so proud of
its military and their lore, quite a bit has

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.820
managed to leak out anyway.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.230
More recently, the Navy SEALs have been very
much in the spotlight due to the raid on the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.779
compound holding Osama Bin Laden, as well
as the subsequent movies and books about it.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.800
However, much of what you have heard recently
about the SEALs may not be the whole truth,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.690
and there are many other equally interesting
Special Forces that have fallen under the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.310
radar in recent years.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.590
10.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.350
The American Green Berets are a Nod to British
Royal Commandos During World War 2

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.500
The Green Berets are one of the most famous
special forces divisions in the world, and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.630
one of the two most well known in the US army,
the other being the US Army Rangers.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.010
The Green Berets were originally formed as
a unit for performing unconventional warfare

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.710
when needed, getting a lot of their original
work during Vietnam, where they fought with

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.330
guerilla tactics and trained those Vietnamese
on the American side to do the same.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.781
However, while the classic green beret is
synonymous with American special forces, it

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:19.510
is actually really a nod of respect to the
British soldiers that inspired their existence

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.890
in the first place.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.750
The green beret was designed by a former Special
Forces Major Herbert Brucker, who had been

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.890
with the OSS, and was very familiar with the
British Commandos during World War II, who

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.860
wore green berets as standard issue.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.880
The green beret was actually not officially
sanctioned at first, and was mostly worn during

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.400
combat training to sort of build morale.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.920
Eventually, President Kennedy expanded the
role of the Special Forces in Cold War operations,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.440
and officially asked them to wear the green
beret from then on.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.680
The Green Berets now specially honor Kennedy,
laying a wreath at his gravesite every year

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.700
in remembrance of the respect he showed them.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700
9.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.040
The US Does Not Track Confirmed Kills For
Any Branch, Special Forces or Otherwise

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.340
Not that long ago, late SEAL sniper Chris
Kyle had a book published that self aggrandized

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.849
his life and role in a way that was likely
not particularly approved by military command,

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.530
and doesn’t really befit the generally humble
and secretive role special forces are supposed

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.530
to take on.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.380
Regardless, he quickly became a folk hero
in certain circles, partly for his claims

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.920
that he had the most confirmed sniper kills
in history.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.050
Now, we should first point out that snipers
today have a lot of very advanced equipment

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.760
and math on their side, so comparing them
to the achievements of the past is hardly

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760
fair.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.490
Further, since then other snipers who had
put their humility on the back-burner have

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.720
claimed to have even higher kill counts.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.760
The problem is that their entire premise is
bunk – there are no “confirmed kill”

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.020
lists in the military.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.680
The military does keep track of incidents,
but they are mostly going on the word of the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.440
soldiers involved, and don’t keep a kill
tally anywhere.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.420
They don’t have the time, or would take
the effort if they did, to go through every

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.500
incident a soldier was involved in and keep
a kill tally.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.580
So when a soldier says they have a certain
amount of kills, some people would just take

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.980
them at their word, as they trust a military
man.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.900
But it is easy for our memories to play tricks
on us and to exaggerate our accomplishments

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.520
even in our own minds.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.230
The truth is that confirmed kill counts simply
aren’t a thing, except in the individual’s

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.230
mind.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.230
8.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.290
The Navy SEALs Have Something Called “Hell
Week” That is Perhaps Even Worse Than It

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.290
Sounds

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.069
The United States Navy SEALs have been in
the news the past few years for several high

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.720
profile operations, and because of the media
spotlight that Chris Kyle turned on himself

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.060
and the SEAL community.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.890
They are known for being incredibly tough,
absurdly well trained, and some of the best

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.970
of the best even among fellow Special Forces
groups.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.000
The way they get there is a selection process
that is straight out of hell.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The final part of the initial training involves
a five and a half day period designated as

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.330
‘hell week’, where you get less than four
hours of sleep a night, and are constantly

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.290
subjected to grueling training in the most
rigorous conditions.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.190
Trainees can expect to get covered in mud,
stand in ocean water, stand still while soaking

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.510
on the beach, paddle boats, carry boats over
their heads, do all sorts of physical exercises

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.750
and training drills, deal with horrible cold,
physical pain and discomfort, complete exhaustion

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.620
in some cases, and extreme mental fatigue.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.290
All of this is expected to be done while extremely
sleep deprived, and good decision making is

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.060
very important during the final part of the
training.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.730
To make matters even harder, the drill instructors
will stand nearby with bullhorns and encourage

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.419
people to drop out, to mimic the voice in
their head that tells them to quit.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.880
The SEALs believe that mentally wanting it
is more important than anything, so this negative

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.440
encouragement ensures that the trainee really
does want it more than anything.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440
7.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.099
The “Night Stalkers” are Especially Good
at Nighttime Operations, Helicopter Use, and

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.249
Awesome Names

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.669
The Night Stalkers are a Special Forces division
of the Army whose job is almost entirely to

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.009
fly helicopters.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.990
Some of the larger helicopters that carry
multiple people will also have a trained Night

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.059
Stalker medic on board as well.

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:51.210
These forces got their name because of their
skill at getting to areas undetected at night,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.409
although they are known for being good at
stealth at any time of day or in any region,

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.939
and are known for their motto “Night Stalker’s
Don’t Quit.”

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.879
As a helicopter force, their job is to get
into places where reinforcement, supplies,

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.379
or evacuation of some kind is needed, often
having to make their way through hostile territory

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.439
to get there.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.509
This has made them very good at making their
way through incredibly dangerous weather,

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.409
terrain and enemy emplacements, in order to
backup the US military as needed.

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.030
(Quick note: if you’ve seen or read Black
Hawk Down, the Black Hawk helicopters were

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.689
piloted by Night Stalkers.)

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.830
They are known for comprehensive but quick
training that is constantly reinforced on

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.849
a regular basis, bringing new people up to
readiness quicker than some other special

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.460
forces – but no less good at their jobs.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.599
Many people may also not realize that while
the SEALs got the lion’s share of the glory,

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.830
they relied on the Night Stalkers for insertion
and extraction when they raided the compound

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.809
where terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden
was hiding.

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:45.809
6.

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.369
Delta Force is So Secretive You Aren’t Even
Supposed to Know They Exist

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:53.979
Delta Force is one of the strangest Special
Force units, and possibly the most elite of

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.680
them all – if nothing else, they are the
most secretive.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.339
Delta Force members are not supposed to tell
anyone the unit exists, with threat of prison,

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.949
and understand well the consequences and the
importance of keeping their role a secret.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.809
When a Delta Force member dies, the United
States Army will not admit that they were

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.729
a member of Delta Force, as the unit is supposed
to be kept

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:13.809
that secret.

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.409
It is one of those open secrets, such as the
DEFCON levels – something that is still

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.379
the highest level of classified – that somehow
leaked out anyways.

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:25.270
However, despite their existence being leaked,
this doesn’t mean the government has any

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.930
desire to give any details about what they
do.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.029
We do know that they were the ones who captured
Saddam Hussein, and who also took out several

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.339
top leaders in Iraq shortly after, but very
little is known about them.

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.680
Unlike the SEALs, they are not compartmentalized.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.139
They are more like a shadow force that operates
almost alongside and within the regular army,

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.180
so that they can perform more longterm operations
as needed – whereas the SEALs tend to be

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.210
used for more quick in-and-out missions.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.289
While some wonder why the SEALs get all the
glory, the focus on the SEALs helps Delta

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.110
Force to keep their mission and work as secretly
as possible.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.110
5.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.309
US Special Forces Have to Know Multiple Languages
On Top of Having Amazing Combat Capabilities

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:07.339
Most people tend to think of Special Forces
as just highly trained killers who specialize

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:09.129
in survival skills as well.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.110
They are often believed to be incredibly physically
fit, and mentally sound, but popular media

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.169
often doesn’t portray them as particularly
intellectual in their pursuits.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.529
More often than not, it focuses mostly on
the aspect of their prowess as warriors and

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.659
their hardened emotions that allow them to
make tough choices in combat and kill others

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:26.960
before they kill them.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.980
However, to get into the Special Forces you
have to be the best of the best, and this

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.800
does not just include physical characteristics.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.849
Anyone who wants to be in the Special Forces,
especially in a leadership position, needs

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:41.929
to clearly demonstrate their intelligence,
especially under pressure.

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:46.569
And Special Forces training includes intensive
training in another language, usually one

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:49.679
that will be used commonly in the region you
are deploying to.

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:54.539
You are not just expected to be tough and
strong, you are also expected to be bilingual

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:58.749
so you can communicate with the locals and
even blend in if necessary.

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:03.409
Being in the Special Forces is often more
about the mental aspect than the physical.

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:07.530
As we talked about earlier when discussing
the Navy SEALs, many in leadership believe

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.529
that the drive to be a part of the Special
Forces is far more important than your physical

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:13.529
fitness.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:14.529
4.

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:18.889
Some US Special Forces are Allowed to Grow
Beards and Have More Lax Discipline in General

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:21.900
Some US Special Forces are actually allowed
to grow beards.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.529
This is partly due to the Special Forces units
often having more individuality and lax discipline

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:30.680
as part of their structure – the most elite
people tend to be less likely to want to submit

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.030
to strict orders and the stifling of creative
thought.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.850
However, apart from the unique personality
of Special Forces, there are also strategic

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.729
reasons for beard-wearing in the Middle Eastern
theaters of war, specifically.

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:46.721
Many Middle Easterners simply do not respect
a man who does not have a full beard, and

00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:50.600
for those who are in positions where they
constantly interact with regular, everyday

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.520
folk in the towns, it can make it difficult
to get respect or blend in without a beard.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.010
And more often then not, these roles end up
in the hands of the Special Forces.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.790
This has always been controversial, as many
in the regular units feel it is giving the

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.930
Special Forces privileges they should not
have, and some in leadership believe that

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.950
it can eventually lead to a breakdown in order
and discipline where troops wear less and

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.050
less of the proper uniform, and altogether
take their jobs too casually.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.880
Recently the United States military cracked
down and started ordering those who are not

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.820
in positions where they regularly interact
with people in the towns to start shaving

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.190
their beards, whether they were Special Forces
or not.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.140
In order to ensure proper discipline, they
felt that if you don’t have a strategic

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.640
reason for having a beard, you should not
be sporting one.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.900
Of course, some in the Special Forces were
not happy at all to hear this.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.900
3.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.450
The US has a Division of Special Forces Who
Specialize in Predicting the Weather

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.670
It’s something you really don’t think
about, but when you do stop to think about

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.120
it, it seems rather obvious.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.710
Of course the United States military cannot
afford to rely on the National Weather Service

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.660
for accurate weather predictions.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.760
They often need very quick and accurate calculations
in very tense situations where lives are on

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.790
the line and time is of the essence.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.960
These situations often occur in remote areas
where any kind of weather service is little

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.780
to nonexistent, or simply isn’t close to
accurate enough to make calls that could decide

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.180
the fate of human lives.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.750
And that is where the Special Operations Weather
Technicians, or SOWT, come in.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.490
They are tasked regularly with keeping a constant
eye on the weather in new and hostile environments,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.360
and sometimes have to make decisions with
very little to go on.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.200
In some rare cases, they have been parachuted
in in order to assess the situation to see

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.560
if a safe escape by helicopter was possible
in dangerously foggy conditions.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.830
They are often brought along as a precaution
when weather is bad, in order to provide input

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.290
to helicopter pilots on how to avoid the most
dangerous weather and bring everyone safely

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.290
back to base.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.440
While most people have not heard of them,
they are a vital and integral part of the

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.180
United States Special Forces.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.180
2.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.990
The US Unified Command Structure For All Special
Forces was Only Established in 1987

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.110
The United States Special Operations Command,
or SOCOM for short, is something you would

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.930
think existed for a long time.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.600
They are tasked with coordinating all of the
various and sundry Special Forces units, making

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.590
sure that they can all work properly together,
and don’t accidentally bump into each other

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.430
while performing operations.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.000
While it would seem like common sense to have
something like this to begin with, sadly that

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.080
was not the case.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.170
Back in the 1980s the Iranians were holding
hostages, and Delta Force botched a rescue

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.550
effort rather badly.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.620
Not to besmirch Delta Force, though; the blame
for the failure was put on the fact that several

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.000
Special Operations groups were not properly
coordinating together, which lead the mission

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
to become disorganized.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.440
After this disaster, the United States leadership
decided that they simply could not afford

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.270
such a thing to happen again – our most
elite units and all the training we put in

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.290
are no good if we cannot keep them properly
organized and coordinated.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.290
We do them a disservice that way.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.560
Since then, the United States has had a unified
command for Special Forces to ensure such

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.650
problems do not occur again.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.650
1.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.320
The US Pararescue Force is Often Tasked with
Recovering Astronauts After Water Landings

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.510
The Pararescue force is one of the most elite
in the United States Special Forces.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.030
While they are not as aggrandized by the media,
as they are not really known for combat, their

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.200
skills are some of the most important, and
very, very few make the cut.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.430
The entire strength of the Pararescue at any
given time is only about 500 men, which is

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.530
incredibly selective even for Special Forces.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.630
They are intensively trained in the ability
to parachute from all kinds of distances and

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.240
into all kinds of conditions, are skilled
at survival, and are often trained with medical

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.780
skills to help those they are trying to tend
to behind the lines.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.000
When they were in their earliest days, the
Pararescue were volunteer medics from the

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.360
army who dropped into a deep jungle to care
for wounded people who had bailed out of a

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.130
plane near the Chinese border.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.530
Since then they have been tasked with being
on hand to rescue astronauts from the water

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:38.200
on splashdown, and once rescued Neil Armstrong
and astronaut David R. Scott when they had

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.230
to make an unexpected landing in 1966.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.990
More recently, they have seen a lot of activity
in the Middle East, rescuing civilians from

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.380
landslides while braving horrific weather
conditions and risking enemy attacks at the

00:12:49.380 --> 00:13:50.899
same time.
