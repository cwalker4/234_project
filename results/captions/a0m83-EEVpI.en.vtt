00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
everyone's just grabbing bottles out of
the packages just like in Germany. hey

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
guys! what's up? it's Kelly again and
welcome back to my channel. for those of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.199
you who might not know me and you're new to my channel and you're wondering why

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.020
I'm on YouTube,
I mean I'm also wondering why I'm on

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.100
YouTube, I'm gonna give you a little bit
of context as to why I'm making this video.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.869
so I lived in Germany for about a year
and a half and I just got back to the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.790
states and I've been living in DC for
two months and my German boyfriend who

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
I've been with for over a year now is
here with me in DC visiting on a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
non-immigrant visa. we went to a grocery
store like the first weekend he was here

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.520
and he suffered from what could only be
described as sticker shock which

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.289
basically means that he was floored by
how expensive the price of food was here

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.570
in DC specifically, it's different all
over the country, but specifically in DC

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.049
it's very expensive. and so we started
looking around trying to find some

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.159
cheaper grocery stores to go to maybe a
little bit outside of the city and we

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.680
stumbled across a bunch of all ALDIs. so
we headed to an ALDI and he was like a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.740
kid in the candy shop you guys. he was so
excited to see the prices which were

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.299
much more reasonable and just like
having that little bit of familiarity in

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.259
a foreign country for him and it was
really exciting to see. so I thought

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.640
hey why not make a video to show you
guys, because I have a lot of Germans

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
that watch my channel, to show you guys
what an ALDI in the US looks like. and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.600
for those of you who are living in the
US if you didn't know, ALDI is actually

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.909
a german grocery store chain and it's
here in the US and they actually run

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.860
their stores very similar here as they
do in germany so if you've been shopping

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.790
in ALDI, you've been shopping the
german way the whole time! so i'm gonna

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.939
take you guys around the store and i'll
point out some of the differences and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.340
some of the similarities between ALDIs in the US and ALDIs in germany.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.659
so let's check it out!

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.900
so first things first the carts, just
like in Germany, you have to deposit a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.849
coin to be able to pull one out. I've got
my quarter here but in Germany it would

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.200
be a 1 euro coin.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.950
so if you watch my German grocery store
video then you would have heard me talk

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.800
about how the entrances to grocery
stores are a little bit different

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
between Germany and the US. oftentimes in Germany you'll see these like gates that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.170
will open up to divide like the entrance
from the exit. in the US, usually you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150
have like entirely separate doors and
then here you'll see like the food is

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.770
being used as a lane to separate the
entrance from the checkout area. it's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.770
actually kind of funny and I'm sure it's
just a coincidence but the peanut butter

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.580
aisle here is just as sad as the peanut
butter aisles that I would see in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.990
Germany. usually in US grocery stores I
mean you have at least like 20 different

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.560
types of peanut butter to choose from.
here, there's only like four so if you

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.970
look behind me you'll see that all of
the food items are being held mostly in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.810
like these little cardboard crates that
they come in whenever they're shipped to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.530
the grocery store. so US grocery stores
normally don't display their products

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.250
like that. normally you take all of the
products out of the boxes and then put

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.940
them on the shelves but this is an ALDI
and so they're doing it the same way

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.660
that you would see it in Germany which
is in the boxes. and I think probably

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.470
because it cuts down in time which means
it cuts down in labor which means you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.630
have to hire fewer employees which of
course means lower prices. now this

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.310
is actually something that you would not
see in a German ALDI because they don't

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.440
refrigerate their eggs. in the US we do
because during the whole farming process

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.430
we actually wash the eggs which means we wash off the protective coating that is

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.980
kind of I don't know given to the egg
whenever it's laid and so we have to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.550
keep them refrigerated whereas in
Germany they don't wash them and so

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.550
they're able to store eggs at room
temperature so you would never see eggs

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.430
in a cooler like this they would just be
sitting out on a shelf.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.320
these spices are so much cheaper here
than they are in other grocery stores in

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.560
the US.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.389
you really just wouldn't see bags of
flour and sugar sitting on pallets on

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.229
the ground in like a normal US grocery
store but you're seeing it here in the

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.250
ALDI in the US and you would see that
everywhere in grocery stores in Germany.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.990
correct me if I'm wrong but I just
really don't remember seeing that many

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.860
energy drinks in Germany. I would see
like the 5-hour energy drinks like

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.150
what's over my shoulder here but not
like a lot of monsters and Red Bulls and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.380
so on which is what you see in a lot of
US grocery stores and you're seeing the

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.090
knockoff versions here in this ALDI in
the US. everyone's just grabbing bottles

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.370
out of the packages just like in Germany.
these water bottles are a lot smaller

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.150
than what you see in Germany. these are
only about a half a liter and in Germany you

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:26.320
usually buy bottles that are one and a
half liters. I've been to a couple

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.320
different ALDIs now and they all
kind of have a little bit of a different

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.720
setup but pretty much with the same idea
of using the cardboard boxes to display

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.940
their produce. in other US grocery stores,
you just wouldn't really see that.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.750
they're normally shelved or in special
little sections... they're not sitting in

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.180
the boxes that they were like shipped to
the store in.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.350
I think one of the food prices that
stuck out like the most to my boyfriend was

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.410
the price of bell peppers or paprika as
Germans will call them. in Germany you

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.350
can get like three multicolored bell
peppers for one euro. here, you're lucky

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.770
to get one bell pepper for $1. it's a lot
more expensive and I remember talking to

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.100
one of my classmates here about it and
he was just like "oh yeah you're not

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.640
gonna be able to afford the multicolored
Peppers anymore like you get green."

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.740
I'm really excited guys, I just found
some white asparagus! in Germany this is

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.360
known as spargle and it is a huge huge deal in Germany

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.320
it's seasonal in the spring and
everybody just goes crazy for it. I mean

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.340
it's not fresh but I'm really excited to
find some in the US and I'm gonna buy

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.540
this and take it home to my boyfriend. so
it looks like I found the authentic

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.280
German food section and all of the food
seems to be produced by the same

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:03.540
company which is Deutsch couch a okay,
I really didn't learn German. German

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.210
Kitchen, super creative name there and
since I know you guys are interested in

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.450
seeing what the prices are here, I'll
show them to you and just so you know this

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.730
really is significantly cheaper than
what you would find in like a normal US

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.500
grocery store, at least here in DC.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:05.080
don't worry, guys we've got some German
sauerkraut here too. for my German

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.439
viewers write in the comments what you
guys think of this section of German

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:11.590
food I'm really curious what you guys
think about it. I went to a lot of

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.949
different grocery stores in Germany and
there are in a lot of them there were

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:18.789
like the US little section or the
American section of food and it would

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:22.599
basically just be like a bunch of
pop-tarts and like barbecue sauce and I

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:26.340
don't know... salsa and so I'm curious
what you guys think of our

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.270
interpretation of German food.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.740
I am looking at all these cheeses and I
just started laughing because the first

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.950
weekend my boyfriend was here we went to a grocery store so he could pick out

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.479
whatever he wanted to eat and he, without
me realizing it, bought American cheese

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:48.810
which is a terrible terrible type of
cheese. it's like the least flavorful

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:54.990
plastic tasting crap you could buy so he
was a little like this is what cheese is

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:00.260
like in the US? but we do have better
kinds. it's a really sad bread section.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.520
the tea and coffee aisle in this ALDI
just isn't as big as the ones that I saw

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.270
in the ALDIs in Germany. alright
guys I walked through the whole grocery

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:16.040
store twice looking for it but I did not
see any boxed, shelf-stable like

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.920
room-temperature H milk like you would
see in Germany. I only saw fresh milk and

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.780
condensed milk. another difference I want
to point out is that this ALDI in the US

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.000
is super air-conditioned compared to the
ALDIs in Germany but guys it is like

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.500
98 degrees out right now in fact it
might have hit 99 by the time that I've

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.000
been walking around in here that is so
hot!! and if they didn't have

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.840
air-conditioning at the rate that they
have it in here, all of the produce would

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.450
go bad. this is some really patriotic
packaging. it even has a verse from our

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.930
national anthem.
alright guys, behind me is the gummy

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.010
aisle. do you see all the gummies? no you
probably don't

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:05.170
because it's just this one little
section of Haribo gummy bears. that's it.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:11.980
not this like excessive huge area of
gummis like you would see in a German

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.660
ALDI. this is it.
it's crazy! these are my boyfriend's

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:30.010
absolute favorite. pretty cool that they
have them here. German ALDIs don't

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.370
accept credit cards because then they
would have to pay transaction fees which

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.020
would drive up the prices of their food.
This ALDI has a bagging counter just

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.610
like all the ALDIs you see in Germany.
seriously guys this is not like a normal

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:49.140
feature in American grocery stores, I've
only seen this in Germany.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:03.410
wow that was some insane technique from
the cashier. I am thoroughly impressed

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:08.450
that girl would fit totally right in in
Germany. if you guys watch my German

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.930
grocery store video then you would have
heard me talk about how it is like

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.390
complete and utter panic at the cashier
at the grocery stores for me when I'm

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.430
checking out in Germany because the
cashiers are just throwing items into

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.580
your cart as fast as possible, it is like
a sprint.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.850
you're there trying to bag everything as
fast as you can and then you're trying

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.050
to pay and it's just like it's kind of
really overwhelming. in the US, we

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.470
oftentimes have baggers and if you don't
have a bagger, then the cashier will

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.940
actually be the one bagging all of your
goods into whether it's your bags or

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:47.000
maybe you're paying extra for bags and
it's a much more like slow calm process

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.070
and of course there is usually some good
old American small talk. so I was really

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:57.380
curious what the kind of like checkout
situation would be in the ALDI in the

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.640
US, if it would be like the German Way
or if it would be like a normal US

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.560
grocery store and it looks like it's
exactly the same as it is in Germany but

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.670
fortunately I speak the language so I'm
able to communicate a little easier with

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.900
the cashier and she actually did, I
didn't record it, but she did tell me

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.820
that they are timed at the ALDIs here
for how quickly they check people out so

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.080
it looks like it's really similar
overall to the way that all these are

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.630
run in Germany. a lot cheaper because
they cut down on labor, they cut down on

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.140
the amount of work that needs to get
done and they're able to be much more

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.610
efficient than probably what the average
US grocery store is therefore they're

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.930
paying their employees less money by paying fewer salaries and so they're able to

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:46.490
keep the prices lower... it all makes sense
now! I think I'm learning more about the

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.090
German discount culture now that I'm not
in Germany than from when I was in

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.530
Germany. alright guys I hope you enjoyed
this video and if you did give it a

of the support you've given me.
if you're interested in my patreon

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.930
campaign go ahead and check out the link
I'll put it in the description below.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:24.860
I'll see you guys next time! bye! it
actually took me a while to be able to

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.810
film me putting my cart back into the
little line of carts to be able to get

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.850
my quarter deposit back and film that
because so many people here were like I'll

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.870
give you a quarter if you give me your
cart. I'm like I'm trying to do something

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.130
here that's weird and you probably
wouldn't understand

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.530
so I.... fine. just take it.
