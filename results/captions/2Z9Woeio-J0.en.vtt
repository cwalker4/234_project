half though.

&gt;&gt; Is cooch not dirty?

00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:00.431
&gt;&gt; I think cooch may be dirty.

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.290
&gt;&gt; Cooch would be a little dirty.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.730

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:23.395
That was a good one.

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:24.916
Look at how much time.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:25.809
Is this over yet?

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.052

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.448
&gt;&gt; That's not bad.

00:02:43.448 --> 00:02:44.493
&gt;&gt; I love that you still hit it.

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:47.148
&gt;&gt; I saw it was nine minutes later.

00:02:47.148 --> 00:02:48.727
We'll take out the bad ones, I guess.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:49.667

&gt;&gt; And after this,

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:16.429
I got to walk out of here by myself.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.622

&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:30.951
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; There's no real winner, right?

00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:32.647
&gt;&gt; Look, five to one.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.504
