00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.819
Today we'll be testing shotgun slugs that resemble miniature tank rounds more than they do shotgun slugs

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.388
Regular viewers may recognize the heavy hitter slugs from previous tests, but based on those tests

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.349
This slug has been redesigned to make it more accurate and stable in flight

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.779
But the most exciting part about these, these actually go boom when they hit the target

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.949
Now the new slug design looks very similar to the old one

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.799
The new one is on the right and you could see that he has shifted the center of gravity a little more forward

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.529
the fins are a little bit flatter and the overall height of the slug is a little bit shorter and

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.339
It's a little tweaks like this that can make the difference between success and failure in the aerodynamics of a slug

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.059
Now the all these tweaks were have done without sacrificing really any weight these things still weigh almost 42 grams or

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.789
close to one and a half ounces or

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.539
645 grains

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.279
Ouch, now these are not a solid slug. They have a pretty sizable cavity in there for a little 12-gauge slug

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.969
so what they want to do is fill that void with a

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.159
trinary or binary compound and use one of those 22 caliber uh nail gun blanks or powder-actuated tool blanks as

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.880
The contact fuse. it's crazy, It's crazy

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.380
Welcome back

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380
Jeff and Danny here

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.919
You guys remember the heavy hitters if you've watched the previous videos of them well, they sent us some new stuff and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.049
He says he's got a noisemaker of some sort in it. We're not sure because we don't know what it is so we can't say

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.790
but

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.249
We've got a box full of them here. We're gonna see what kind of surprises he's got in store for us

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.360
so

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.419
We're gonna load them up here in the Benelli when you get the rifle choke on there. Yes. All right

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.450
Since it's always better to be safe than sorry

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.959
We wrapped the breech of the shotgun with a Kevlar body armor panel just in case the breach happens, too

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.740
let go

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.469
The first target is a gas bottle. It's made out of steel and it's filled with water

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.769
Now the accuracy was pretty good considering the goofy setup

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.159
we had to shoot these from. But look at that energy rip the top off it, it blew the valve off and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.790
the base was as shattered as the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
cylinder expanded in all directions

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.450
so far the tests are going really well.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.430
Little bit different than the last time we shot one of these tanks

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
This one

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.600
Blew the valve and ripped the handle off. Jeez

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.579
Blind aiming it wasn't too bad. Broke that little plastic base thing. But this time

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.970
No exit wound

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.179
Get a few dents. Okay. So did come through and hit it hard, but I don't have to.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.570
And inside the slug is just

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
turned into.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.580
This is what we found inside a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020
Piece of the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.670
brass. I couldn't tell if the thing had a report or not

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.600
If it did it was muffled in the water. Yeah. So we'll shoot a hard target with him and yeah see what we get out of it

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Okay, I'm ready when you are

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520
Ho! Okay

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.780
[Laughter]

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.980
You don't see that very often, huh.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.139
We brought up the frame of the Kronos high-speed camera to eighty eight hundred frames a second and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.880
look at that slug stability the rifle choke gave it just enough spin and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.230
Look at that accuracy almost dead on on that little sticker

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.760
Normally a slug will just drive itself into the wood and not split it like that

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.989
So this gives you an idea how much energy these things have on impact

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.020
Definitely blew up

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.180
[Laughter]

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.820
It blow'd up good. Hey we can see a piece of lead down in there so we're gonna open it up

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.570
in front of all of you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.570
Was that bout where the sticker was?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.920
Think it was. Oh look at that. It's all charred

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.130
Charred, there's a piece of our.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.460
Oh.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.520
Well

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.100
Is it hot? Are you burning yourself? Naw.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.550
I'm tougher than somebody

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.030
Yeah

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.200
'Bout all we can find here there was a couple of fragments on the ground and on the table and

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.950
Nothing us. So that's good. Yeah, none in us.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:24.419
Open up pretty good cavity there. Yeah, it's it's not very often we see a slug split a big old piece of wood like that

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.280
Not bad

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280
So they seem to be working or whatever

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.409
Yeah, I don't want you hit by it no, okay, let's shoot that big ugly block of gel with it. All right

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.910
Haven't seen any flashes or anything yet. So it'll be interesting. Okay. I'm ready when you are

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.530
Well, no test is complete without a failure, this one the

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.920
Contact fuse was knocked out of the nose from the inertia

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.479
We spilled a little bit of that compound and nothing really happened

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.289
Except when a one and a half once slug strikes a fleshy material like our ballistic booger

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.560
things happen

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.289
Okay now Danny recast the lead plate. Thank You Danny

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.520
Nice and fresh

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.849
25 pounds of lead. Let's see what this will do to the

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.259
do to that sucker. Okay. I'm ready when you ever you are

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.790
Yes, sir

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:14.179
What you're about to see is the most impressive lead plate shot we've ever recorded so far

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:23.688
This slug left a cavity measuring two inches across or around five centimeters

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.319
huge cavity from a small 12 gauge slug

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:35.210
You ruined the the pristine new plate put a dent in her. Bits of lead. That's

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.370
Uh

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:45.109
That's deeper than the Russian ones yeah buy a little more than just the tip

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.169
Look at the back side, though

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.509
Yep, that thing's thick

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:58.489
Didn't quite crack it but it sure bulged it. Yeah.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.939
All blackened and everything. Okay, that's good

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:14.838
Okay, well we moved the target to 50 yards, so maybe we can actually hear the the

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.068
Report over the shotgun shot noise, you know

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.300
We're shooting at a big

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.310
cement concrete type

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:27.899
paving stone

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:29.580
paver

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.930
See if Danny can hit these, hit that at 50 yards

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.359
And what effect it will have on it? Okay, I'm ready whenever you are. Okay.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:46.398
Yeah, yeah definitely

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.830
Now 50 yards is probably getting close to the maximum effective range of these slugs

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.840
the shot was just a couple inches to the left, but still a very impressive shot by Danny and

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.520
Look at that devastation and you're probably saying that things got to be illegal. It's got to be a destructive device

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.039
but according to the ATF a destructive device has to have a quarter ounce or more of

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.400
Compound in it and these only have one or two grams in it

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.100
I'm not going to put the puzzle back together.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.620
Suffice it to say they did hit, it hard, definitely got a little rapport and a bit of a flash out of it

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:50.749
now in order to give you an idea how far Jerry link was the designer of these slugs has come in improving the

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.659
aerodynamics of these will shoot an old type at

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.510
50 yards and show you how those perform.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.010
50 yards at the G.O.A.T.S. AR 500 target should be interesting.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.429
I bet he'll knock it over ha ha. Are you ready?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760
Okay, I'm ready

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.080
Boy, you can hear that thing fly

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.780
Now as you can see the old design definitely had some aerodynamic problems this slug is

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:24.319
Just flip-flopping through the air doesn't know which direction to point itself

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.789
Surprisingly Danny still hit the target at that range. And of course the contact fuse was in the wrong orientation

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.370
And nothing really happened

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.190
Okay, take another 50-yard shot at the AR 500 plate

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.390
Okay, I'm ready when you are

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:12.220
Now as you can see the new design tweaks definitely have helped the accuracy and stability of these slugs

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.989
Now these rank up there is some of the coolest and most fun shotgun slugs we've ever shot

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.349
Hopefully these will be available soon. They'll get approval to sell these crazy things and you could buy them too

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.060
Where do you find them? Well, they're gonna be available at war wolf ordinance

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.010
And you've seen some of the stuff we've tested some of the coolest exotic shotgun ammo out there

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.349
Hope you enjoyed watching this. We had a lot of fun making it and we want to thank our generous

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.519
