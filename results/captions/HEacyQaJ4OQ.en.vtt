00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.269
-The theme of President Trump's
State of the Union address

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.104
was supposed to be unity, and
in the lead-up to the speech,

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.406
Trump honored that theme
by attacking Democrats.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.609
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.979
♪♪

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.549
Remember, this speech
was supposed to be last week,

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.051
but it was postponed due
to the government shutdown.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.753
And as he prepared
for tonight's address,

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.688
Trump was once again
threatening the possibility

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.123
of a second shutdown

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.392
when government funding
runs out on February 15th.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:27.693
Trump still wants Democrats

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.295
to give him money
for his border wall,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.798
even though public opinion
is still firmly against him.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.866
And that's because
he just keeps saying

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.302
the same things over and over.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.406
Eventually people are
just going to tune you out.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.975
Sure, the first time you see a
crazy guy yelling on the subway,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.710
you move down
to the other end of the car.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.646
But the 10th time you see one,
you just put your headphones in

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:51.584
and listen to a podcast about
America's mental-health crisis.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:56.122
For example -- For example,
here's Trump yet again

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.157
repeating his claim
that previous presidents

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.459
should have built a wall
on the Southern border.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.761
-We're going to strengthen up
our Southern border.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.831
That should have been done
30 years ago,

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:10.870
40 years ago, 20 years ago,
10 years ago, 5 years ago.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.306
-Those are all the numbers
he knows.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.642
And you know...
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:20.647
You know he just threw in
"5 years ago"

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.148
because he wasn't quite sure

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.851
if Obama was president
10 years ago.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.120
Also, if anyone should be happy

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.790
a previous president
didn't build a wall,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.991
it should be you.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.459
If there was already a wall,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.195
what would people have chanted
at your rallies?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.498
"Maintain the previously
erected wall"?

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:43.569
"Obama built the wall,
but I'm going to keep it clean

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.805
because it was filthy
under Obama.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:51.777
A filthy, filthy,
embarrassing wall.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:55.381
Oh, we're going clean it.
Oh, we're going to clean it.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.917
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.955
Oh, you're going -- You're
going to eat off the wall."

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.923
Now, in his speech tonight,
Trump claimed

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.025
he was interested
in bipartisan compromise,

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.061
and even though he caved
on the shutdown last month

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.696
without getting any money
for his wall,

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.031
his allies on Fox News
have been pretending

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.733
it was actually a major victory.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.169
-He did not cave!

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.437
He made a tactical decision,

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:22.375
a strategy decision
to pick the ground to fight on.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.077
-Anyone out there, by the way,

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.179
thinking President Trump
caved today,

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.281
you don't really know
the Donald Trump I know.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.349
He right now
holds all the cards.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.552
-That's right.
Trump holds all the cards.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.954
Except he's holding them
facing out and upside down,

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.588
and they're Monopoly cards.

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:40.159
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.930
"They are not Monopoly cards!"

[ Laughter ]

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:49.469

[ Laughter ]

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.438
In his speech
to Congress tonight,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.173
Trump also repeated his claim
that a border wall

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.976
would stop crime and drugs
from pouring into the country,

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.312
despite the fact that
immigrants commit crimes

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.113
at a lower rate
than native-born Americans,

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.949
and most illegal drugs
come through ports of entry.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.685
Trump's been making
that same argument for years,

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.787
and polls show most Americans
still aren't buying it.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.889
That's why in the run-up
to his speech tonight,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.691
Trump started making
a new, dumber argument --

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.793
walls work because
cars have wheels.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.196
And what's even more insane
is that Republican senators

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.332
like Ted Cruz have actually
been repeating that argument.

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:23.602
-They say a wall is medieval.
Well, so is a wheel.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:27.073
A wheel is older than a wall,

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.441
and I looked at
every single car out there,

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.513
even the really expensive ones
that the Secret Service uses --

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.048
And believe me.
They are expensive.

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:37.850
I said, "Do they all
have wheels? Yes.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.352
Oh, I thought it was medieval."

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.953
-You know, the President
has a good observation.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.722
He said, "I'll tell you
something else that's medieval.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.989
The wheel."

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.592
There's a reason
the wheel is medieval,

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.226
'cause it rolls things
and it works.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.961
Walls are effective.

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.131
-You know what's medieval?
That beard.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.700
[ Laughter ]

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.468

[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:57.303 --> 00:04:01.340
You look like you're
about to arrest Robin Hood.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.375
Now, that argument was so dumb,
even Trump knew better

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.977
than to include it
in his speech tonight.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.547
Instead, the theme of tonight's
speech was supposed to be unity,

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.548
even with the specter of
a second government shutdown

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:10.916
looming over the whole affair,

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.252
which is why coming in to
tonight, everyone was very eager

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:16.422
to see the dynamic between Trump
and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.591
who would be sitting behind
Trump for the first time.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.793
Remember, for the last two
State of the Union speeches,

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.328
Trump had
Vice President Mike Pence

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.996
and House Speaker Paul Ryan
behind him,

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:25.832
standing and cheering
for everything he said

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.067
like Southern pageant moms.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:32.404
"Yes, Kaley!
You are servin' looks tonight!

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:35.274
Ka-ley!"

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:39.112
And there's a long history
of the people

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.346
sitting behind the President
getting just as much attention

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.649
during the State of the Union
as the President himself.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.351
Just look at former
House Speaker John Boehner,

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.120
who always glared at Obama

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.855
like a supervillain
plotting his revenge.

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:52.558
Or former Vice President
Joe Biden who always...

[ Laughter ]

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.896
...who always looked like
he was going room to room

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:01.067
at a house party, making sure
everyone had enough booze.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.502
"You good, Chad?
How about you, Rick?

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:04.737

to come out to the pool."

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:20.453
And the Trump/Pelosi dynamic --

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.988
The dynamic is going to be
especially fascinating to watch,

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:26.091
given just how overmatched Trump
has been in his negotiations

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.827
with her
over the last few weeks.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.294
Over the weekend, Trump told CBS

00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:31.230
he couldn't get a deal done
with Pelosi

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.065
because she wouldn't budge
on anything.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.901
-You had quite the showdown
with Speaker Pelosi.

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:39.571
What did you learn
about negotiating with her?

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.309
-Well, I think
that she was very rigid.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.479
-Yeah, of course, she's rigid.
It's a negotiation.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.614
This guy wrote
"The Art of the Deal,"

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.083
and he has no idea
how a deal works.

want different things."

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.656
[ Laughter ]

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.792
Trump was insistent
as recently as last week

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.727
that he would get
the better of Pelosi,

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:03.462
and he was confident
that he'd get his wall.

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.731
Let's see how he felt about
the status of the wall today

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:07.633
just hours
before his big speech.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.502
-President Trump tweeted this.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.905
"Tremendous numbers of people
are coming up through Mexico

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.441
in the hopes of flooding
our Southern border.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.443
We have sent
additional military.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.713
We will build a human wall
if necessary."

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.748
-A human wall?

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.884
He negotiated himself down
from a concrete wall

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.120
to a steel barrier to a fence
to a human wall.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.889
Who are the humans
in the wall anyway?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.591
Are you and your weird sons
going to go down to the border

00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:35.694
and play red rover?

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:46.372
And there are all kind of
State of the Union traditions

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.806
most people don't know about.

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.142
For example, every year, there's
one administration official

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:52.244
appointed as
a designated survivor

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:54.714
who stays in a separate location
in case disaster strikes,

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.382
and tonight
that designated survivor

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:58.918
was Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.720
Can you imagine hearing the news

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.221
that the Capitol
had been blown up

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.456
and everyone had been killed

the newscaster say,

"And so now we go live
for an address

from President Rick Perry"?

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.964

we know what he'd say.

-And, in fact, before
Trump's speech even started,

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.037
we already had
one big "oops" moment --

tie has moved to the left.

is saying at any given moment

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.991
can be difficult
for casual observers,

human syntax,

a printed copy of the speech.

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.084
But this was the first time --

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.353
This is the first time
we got to see in real time

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.921
the two different reactions
of Pence on the one hand

00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:12.191
and Pelosi on the other,
and it was very revealing.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.959
As he repeated
the same talking points

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.528
he often repeats
at every speech,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.029
Pence applauded enthusiastically

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.764
while Pelosi was
much more muted.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.134
-African-American,
Hispanic-American,

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:25.704
and Asian-American unemployment
have all reached

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:29.408
their lowest levels
ever recorded.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:33.512
[ Applause ]

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:35.280
-Look at them.
Pence is like a dad

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.716
who's proud that his kid
keyed the principal's car,

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:39.785
and Pelosi's like a mom
who's thinking to herself,

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.922
"I wish I had a daughter."

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:46.058
But the reactions were most
telling when Trump alluded

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.093
to the many investigations
of his presidency,

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:49.896
including investigations
and oversight

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.964
being conducted
by Democrats in Congress

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.933
and implied
that those investigations

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.369
were somehow
hurting the economy.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:09:00.272
-An economic miracle is taking
place in the United States,

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:03.476
and the only thing
that can stop it

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:07.045
are foolish wars, politics,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:11.484
or ridiculous
partisan investigations.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.318
[ Applause ]

00:09:13.318 --> 00:09:17.456
If there is going to be
peace and legislation,

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:22.027
there cannot be
war and investigation.

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:24.930
It just doesn't work that way.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.198
-I'm sorry.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.568
You think the investigations
are hurting the economy?

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:34.073
If anything, you've created
thousands of jobs for lawyers.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.507
This is such an insane argument.

00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:37.543
He's like a guy who gets
pulled over for drunk driving

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:39.411
and says, "Officer,
I can't focus on the road

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:42.114
with a breathalyzer
in my mouth."

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.282
And eventually
Trump got to the central promise

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:45.617
of his campaign and presidency,

00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:48.187
the thing he shut down
the government over -- his wall.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.989
And despite all
the contradictory messages

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.657
he's sent over
the past several weeks,

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.693
Trump insisted that he would
definitely get that wall.

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:57.730
-My administration
has sent to Congress

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.632
a common-sense proposal

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.768
to end the crisis
on the Southern border.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:08.507
In the past, most of the people
in this room voted for a wall.

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:11.843
But the proper wall
never got built.

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:14.279
I will get it built.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.714
-Oh, you're gonna get it built?

00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:17.883
You went from promising
it would be a concrete wall

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.152
to saying it would be
a human wall. What's next?

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.187
"Walls work, and so do wheels,

00:10:22.187 --> 00:10:27.459
and that's why the wall
will be built out of wheels.

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:31.296
Oh, no! Oh, no! The wall's
rolling into the ocean!

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.733
Oh, wheel wall!

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:36.535
Oh, why?!

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:39.004
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:42.040
Goodbye, wheel wall!

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.510
I love you, wheel wall!"

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.579
Trump then moved on
to the economy,

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.713
and when he mentioned
the percentage of new jobs

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:52.184
occupied by women, the record
number of female freshmen

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:54.620
Democrats in the audience
started dancing

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.889
like the cool aunts
at a wedding.

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:00.359
Trump then had the audacity
to note the fact that more women

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.161
were serving in Congress
than ever before,

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.995
as if he had something
to do with it.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:08.734
-We also have more women
serving in Congress

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:11.003
than at any time before.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.305
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:17.910
-Look at Pelosi letting everyone
know where those women are.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.712
Also, I love that Trump thinks
he can take credit for that.

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:22.614
"The only reason
they got elected

00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:26.351
is that most people hate me.
You're welcome, everyone."

00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:29.521
In fact, a wave of Democrats was
elected to Congress in November,

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.857
running in part on
a progressive economic agenda,

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.292
with some,
like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:36.895
openly embracing the label
of Democratic socialist.

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:38.831
Democrats also ran in part

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.599
against Trump's
deeply unpopular tax cut

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.134
for corporations
and the wealthy,

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:45.203
and polls have shown support
for policies like a wealth tax

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:48.340
or a higher income tax for
the richest Americans surging,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.708
even among Republicans.

00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.376
So Trump decided to take a swipe

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:53.412
at the Democratic socialists
in the room.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:59.851
-Here in the United States,
we are alarmed by the new calls

00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:03.322
to adopt socialism
in our country.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:07.126
[ Scattered boos ]

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:11.163
America was founded on
liberty and independence

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:16.035
and not government coercion,
domination, and control.

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.405
We are born free,
and we will stay free.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.440
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:32.118
-Look at Bernie's face.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.921
That's the face he makes
when the waiter catches him

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.124
stuffing sugar packets
in his pocket.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.325
"All the sugar packets
are being hoarded

00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:42.627
by the millionaires
and billionaires!

00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:44.229
Sugar to the people!"

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:45.965
We've been here
many times before.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:47.833
We all know the real Trump
is the one

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.468
who will reappear
on Twitter tomorrow.

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:50.936
In his speech tonight,
he attacked

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.504
the investigations
of his presidency

00:12:52.504 --> 00:12:54.273
and repeated his demand
for a border wall.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.541
He just recycled

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.542
many of the same talking points
he always uses.

00:12:57.542 --> 00:13:00.078
In other words, he went
'round and 'round like...

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:02.581
-A wheel.
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.550
