00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
We will work with anybody across that aisle- 
if they are there to move America forward.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.734
But let me be very clear, if their agenda
is simply investigations, impeachment,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:16.533
and not focused on the hard-working American public,

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.467
we’ll be there to defend the American public.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:20.700
That’s Kevin McCarthy.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.266
Former toasted sandwich slinger,
and the current House majority leader.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:29.166
He’s in charge of helping the Republican agenda get
through congress, and likely protecting the President.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:33.433
He’s outnumbered, and some sources say
he’s not tough or smart enough for the job:

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.166
[TRUMP] You know Kevin McCarthy
is out, you know that, right?

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.333
[Applause]

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.800
And they’re giving me a lot of
credit for that because I said

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.767
‘you really need somebody very very tough and very smart.’'

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:51.734
Kevin Owen McCarthy was born in 1965 to
working class Democrats in Bakersfield, California.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:55.800
McCarthy worked to pay for his first semester
at Bakersfield College, a community college.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.734
After re-selling cars he bought at auctions in LA,
he decided to try his luck on a scratcher.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:05.567
He won $5,000 and with it, opened
up “Kevin O’s Deli” at just 19 years old.

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.133
The deli served up toasted subs,
which McCarthy thinks he invented.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.633
He claims his establishment
was ‘Subway before Subway.’

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:18.667
But perhaps ‘Subway during Subway’ would’ve worked better
as there was already a Subway. In the same town.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:24.467
Much like Subway lied about the length of their footlong subs,
McCarthy may have been lying about…everything...

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.433
At least according to A Washington Post Fact Checker piece.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.734
According to the Post, McCarthy
couldn’t have won the lottery at 19 —

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:36.500
the California lottery didn’t start selling tickets
until 1985 when McCarthy would’ve been almost 21.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.100
And as far as his very own deli goes, it was apparently just a
counter and a refrigerator in his aunt and uncle’s yogurt shop.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.066
In a 1986 review of the shop, the writer noted,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.800
It is unclear if he invented toasting subs.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.100
Either way, McCarthy claims he ran the deli for two years
before selling it and using the funds to go to college.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400
But the Post alleges this too is false.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.433
A spokesman for Cal State Bakersfield, said the school
records show McCarthy started school in 1987,

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.367
one year &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the deli opened.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:18.467
McCarthy’s effort to allegedly embellish his
‘small business’ didn’t wane over the years.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.767
[McCarthy] I was able to start a business when I was 19.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.867
[McCarthy] I used to own a deli. And
the struggles of what you go through.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:28.800
[McCarthy] I think it holds me more
accountable, I get to serve constituents.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.700
While he was at California
State University, Bakersfield,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.834
McCarthy applied for an internship for
local California congressman Bill Thomas.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:39.233
He didn’t get the gig, but later
became his District Director.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:46.166
[THOMAS] Actually the thing I’m probably proudest of is…..ummm….

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.900
In 2002, McCarthy was elected to the California State Assembly,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.266
becoming the Republican leader
during his freshman term in 2003. 

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:59.333
After Thomas retired in 2006, McCarthy entered the
Republican primary for California’s 23rd district,

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.300
and won his boss’s seat handily with
71% of the vote in the general election.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.800
He won re-election six times all the way to 2018.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.100
And boy did he he spend a ton along the way.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.367
McCarthy once gave his colleagues in the California Assembly
framed photos of Theodore Roosevelt

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:17.533
which were reportedly valued at $300 a piece.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:18.300
Cool gift.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.233
And in his 2014 run, McCarthy - through his
reelection campaign and leadership PAC -

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:27.133
spent $140,000 at steakhouses alone.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:30.867
He also spent $426,000 on private jets.

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:35.266
But in 2015, McCarthy had his sights
set on something even bigger:

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:36.600
More steak.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.734
Ah, I’m just kidding.

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:41.567
When John Boehner announced he was
going to resign as Speaker in 2015,

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:43.867
McCarthy announced his candidacy for the role.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:44.767
But it was short-lived.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:48.133
Less than a month later, McCarthy
unexpectedly dropped out of the race.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.900
A couple of factors were seemingly
involved in his abrupt ending:

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.266
rumors of an affair with a colleague circulated,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.300
and after the House established the
Select Committee on Benghazi

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.800
to allegedly investigate what happened
around the terrorist attack in Benghazi,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.567
McCarthy bragged that the committee
was destroying Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers.

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:07.033
[McCarthy] Everybody thought Hillary
Clinton was unbeatable, right? 

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:12.233
[McCarthy] But we put together a Benghazi
special committee, a select committee.

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:17.567
[McCarthy] What are her numbers today? Her numbers
are dropping, why? Because she’s untrustable.

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:23.333
Republicans weren’t thrilled with his admission,
and in October of 2015, McCarthy dropped out of the race.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:29.500
[McCarthy] I think we’re only going to be stronger, we fought hard to
win this majority and turn this country around.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.266
[McCarthy] And this will be our best-
step- best - foot - uh - foot step - forwar-

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:36.033
When news broke of the Russians hacking the DNC,

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:39.667
McCarthy openly discussed Trump’s
controversial relationship with Putin.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:43.600
In a private conversation between
McCarthy and Paul Ryan, McCarthy said,

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:51.233
And then he adds:

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.001
There’s laughter in the room and then McCarthy adds:

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.033
Paul Ryan is stepping down at the end of his term,

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:04.533
and McCarthy easily won an internal
party election against Jim Jordan

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.001
to take over as minority leader in January.

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.734
But McCarthy almost ruined his chances once again.

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:16.500
Ahead of the 2018 midterms, McCarthy posted a tweet asserting
that Jewish political donors like George Soros

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.066
were trying to buy the midterms.

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:22.100
McCarthy posted the tweet AFTER
Soros received a pipe bomb in the mail.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.100
When McCarthy takes over as Minority Leader in January,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.500
he is slated to work with Democrats,
so long as it’s not exposing the president.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.533
A big shift from what he was willing
to do with the previous president.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:41.500
[McCarthy] I think when we watch a president stand in the well and
say ‘I’ll use my phone and my pen to go around the constitution’

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.767
[McCarthy] and people stand up and applaud,
I don’t care if that person’s republican or democrat,

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:49.100
[McCarthy] that’s not the country or
what the constitution says to do.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.300
[McCarthy] So whether this person in the
administration’s republican or democrat,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.900
[McCarthy] I think you need to check and balance.
