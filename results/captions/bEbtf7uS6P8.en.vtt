00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.240
[Rhonda]: Today's guest is Dr. Matthew Walker,
author of New York Times best selling book

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.030
Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep
and Dreams, Professor of Neuroscience and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.160
Psychology at University of California Berkeley,
and Director of the Center for Human Sleep

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.200
Science.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.900
YOU WILL NOTEâ€¦ This episode starts sort
of abruptly. The opening discussion is about

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.779
HOW SLEEP PATTERNS CHANGE DURING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,
especially around age 12 months, when motor

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.900
skill learning increases.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.710
Matt and I had planned on doing an intro but
the camera was rolling and the discussion

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.960
was so interesting that we just kept going.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.910
This is a good one, folks. Enjoy!

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.890
[Matt]: What's really interesting is if you
look at sort of sleep, and we've done some

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.200
of this work, and I maybe will speak about
it on sleep and motor skill learning, and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.340
that seems to be more dependent on this sort
of lighter form of non-REM sleep Stage 2 and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.399
particularly the burst of electrical activity
the sleep spindles, there's a really bizarre

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.850
bump in Stage 2 and sleep spindles during
development, it happens right around the 12-month

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.370
period, which is where, all of a sudden, you
start to see considerable limb or multi-limb

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.270
coordination. In other words, you start to
perambulate, you start to learn how to walk.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.159
It's almost as though there's like a homeostatic
response, which is that with the drive for

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.979
motor plasticity and learning comes a response
from sleep to say, "Oh, now we're into motor

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.640
skill learning? We need to consolidate." And
you get this...it's a really strange bump,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.700
and it dies away again after the...

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.509
[Rhonda]: What's the sleep, the spindles,
sleep two spindles, what stage is that?

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.950
[Matt]: Well, you see sleep spindles throughout
almost all of non-REM. So once you get past

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.250
the lightest sort of Stage 1 on REM, then
you get spindles throughout all of non-REM,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.860
but they are a prototypical feature of Stage
2 non-REM as well. Then Stage 3 and 4, which

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.820
is sort of like the deep sleep stuff, you
also get spindles there, too. But in our hands,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.880
at least, the strongest sleep stage and the
strongest electrical signature in your EEG

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.990
that is predictive of your motor skill learning
is Stage 2 and sleep spindles, both of which

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.209
seem to have this bizarre sort of, you know,
coincidental spike right around this developmental

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.549
phase of crawling, standing, walking.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.499
[Rhonda]: Yeah. So many things going on during
the development. I mean, it's so fascinating

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:21.599
to observe for sure.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.659
[Matt]: And language, too. I mean, when we've
looked at this as well with teaching adults

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:34.099
foreign languages, or even actually just mathematical
languages or artificial grammar, sleep is

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.590
a huge component in that. But they also saw
this fascinating thing with development, which

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.370
was about not just concrete learning of individual
facts but the generalization of knowledge.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.790
So this is sort of the thing that I think
separates us from computers, at least for

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.029
now, which is that computers are very good
at storing individual bytes of information

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:02.139
in a vertical way very clearly. And we can
do that, too, storing individual facts. But

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.819
what computers don't do, which is what we
do, is intelligently integrate and associate

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.339
them together so that we can extract overarching
patterns and schemas and statistical rules

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.329
about this thing called the world in which
we live.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.209
And, yeah, sorry, I was just gonna say that
you can, with infants, you can teach them

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.079
just these novel sounds, and each one of these
strings of sounds is unique and different.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.420
But there's something common about the grammar
that is binding and overarching across all

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.819
of them. There is an overarching schema that
you could learn in addition to each one of

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.030
the individual facts.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.459
After they've had a nap versus an infant that
has not had a nap, post-nap, the infants have

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.370
extracted and understood the generalized rules
of what they've been learning, not just the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.489
individual facts. Whereas infants that have
learned but haven't napped have not sort of

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.489
made the abstraction.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.019
[Rhonda]: So my being on nap nazzi, I should
be rewarded for that, right?

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.019
[Matt]: Absolutely.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.029
[Rhonda]: It's absolutely like...

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.060
[Matt]: And it stays from the, you know, infancy
all the way through to adulthood. So if you're

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.999
napping, I'm not gonna...well, there's a few
double-edged sword aspects of napping.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.820
[Rhonda]: So I wanted to ask you a question,
you're talking about basically being able

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.319
to connect the dots, you know, how would that
sort of differentiates us from what a computer

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.420
can do, I mean, one of the things. But is
there a certain...I remember reading in your

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.509
book, and this is probably the part of the
book that I was more skimming, you know, like...and

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:43.700
that was the importance of REM sleep and dreaming
and creativity. So is that, connecting...because

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.560
I feel like connecting the dots, you know,
requires some creative thought to be able

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.650
to kind of, like, put things together and
come up with a big-picture idea and figure

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.379
things out. So is it known? Is REM sleep important
for that?

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.950
[Matt]: Yeah, it does seem to be. So if there
is...So, I mean, we could take a step back

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.849
and think about how does sleep achieve memory
processing, learning, information processing.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.490
And sleep seems to be important in at least
three ways. First, you need sleep before learning

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.120
to actually get your brain ready to initially
soak up new information, to initially lay

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.180
down new memory traces.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.540
But you also then need to sleep after learning
to take those freshly-minted memories in the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.610
brain, particularly in a region that we call
the hippocampus, which you could think of

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.939
almost like the informational inbox of your
brain, but it's very good at receiving those

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:43.939
sort of new memory files. But you need sleep
after learning to take those new memories

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:49.479
and then essentially hit the save button on
them so that you don't forget those informational

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:56.100
pieces of the puzzle. So sleep before learning
to get your brain ready, to acquire information.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.240
Sleep after learning to hold on to those individual
facts.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.560
[Rhonda]: So let me get this straight. So
if you want, for example, short-term memory,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.819
right, because if you're sort of wanting to
store things in the hippocampus, even short-term,

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:10.930
that would be sleep before.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.930
[Matt]: That's right.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.190
[Rhonda]: And then if you want to then consolidate
it and have a long-term memory, that would

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.340
be your sleep after?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.340
[Matt]: Sleep after.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.340
[Rhonda]: Okay.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.909
[Matt]: So you can't cheat sleep on either
side of the memory equation. You've got to...You

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.180
can't pull the all-nighter and hope to be
able to continue to learn. And we did this

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.570
study. We said sort of, you know, "Is it wise
to pull the all-nighter before the exam?"

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.229
So we took a group of individuals, assign
them to one of two groups, a sleep group and

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.900
a sleep deprivation group. A sleep group,
they get a full eight hours of shut-eye that

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.590
we measure here at the sleep center. The deprivation
group we keep awake all night under full supervision.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.460
And they don't get any naps. There's no caffeine.
It's miserable for everyone involved.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.069
[Rhonda]: Wow. No caffeine.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.492
[Matt]: No caffeine at all. And then the next
day, we place them inside an MRI scanner,

00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:04.990
and we had them try and learn, and cram, essentially,
a whole list of new facts into the brain,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.030
into the hippocampus. And the first result
was that the sleep deprivation group was about

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:18.939
40% more deficient in their learning ability.
So they learned 40% less, four zero, which

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:19.939
is...

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:20.939
[Rhonda]: That's astronomical. That's a huge...

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.900
[Matt]: Non-trivial. I mean, if you want to
put that in context, I guess it's the difference

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.330
between acing an exam and failing at miserably
40%. What was interesting, though, is what

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.560
was going on in the hippocampus, this informational
inbox of the brain. When we looked at that

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.400
in those people who'd had a full night of
sleep, you saw lots of healthy learning-related

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.030
activity. It was beautiful.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:47.940
In the sleep deprivation group, we actually
couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:55.249
And so it was almost as though sleep deprivation
had sort of shut-down-your-memory inbox and

00:07:55.249 --> 00:08:00.090
any new incoming files were being bounced.
And we put forward a theory as to why that

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.900
was. Perhaps that the hippocampus being a
short-term reservoir of memory has a limited

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:11.099
storage capacity, perhaps a little bit like
a USB stick.

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:18.760
And you have maybe, in humans, a 16-hour recording
capacity for information acquisition before

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.270
you have to sleep. Because it's during sleep,
then after learning. So that's sort of the

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.550
story before learning. It's not great. We
can show it. We know in the brain what part

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.039
of the brain is failing to produce those impairments.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.089
[Rhonda]: In that study, you were testing
the ability to acquire new information.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:41.419
[Matt]: Exactly, to sort of lay down those
fresh memories and just to grab hold of them.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:47.470
And you can't do that well without sufficient
sleep. And that seems to be in part related

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:52.519
to your non-rapid-eye-movement sleep or your
non-REM sleep.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:57.040
But then, what we've also done in lots of
these, and we and lots of other people have

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.560
now replicated this finding, sleep after learning
then takes those memories and it sort of it

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.000
hits the save button on them. It's a little
bit crass. Actually, what really happens is

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.029
that during sleep, there is a file transfer
mechanism that takes place at night, that

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:19.220
we shift memories from that short-term vulnerable
storage reservoir, the hippocampus, and we

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.180
move them out to the long-term storage site
within the brain, which is the cortex, which

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.820
essentially acts like a hard drive.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.899
And that means that when you wake up the next
day, there are two delightful benefits. First,

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.579
having shifted those memories from the short-term
vulnerable reservoir to that more permanent

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:42.890
sort of safe storage haven in the brain. They're
protected, and they're safe, so that you're

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.130
going to remember rather than forget.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:50.650
The second benefit, however, is that sort
of having cleared off those files from the

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:56.300
hippocampus, almost like shifting files from
the USB stick, you've cleared out all of that

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.190
fresh memory encoding reservoir, so that when
you wake up the next morning, you can start

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:07.480
acquiring new files all over again. So it's
this sort of elegant, symbiotic system of

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.269
memory that happens.

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:10.680
[Rhonda]: Yeah, beautiful.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.570
[Matt]: Yeah, absolutely. Sorry.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.389
[Rhonda]: We'll, of course, use all this.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:19.779
[Matt]: I'm ethically sealed[sp]. It's bizarre.

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:26.070
[Rhonda]: I remember reading somewhere that
when you sleep, and this is related to what

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:31.450
you were just talking about, that your brain
sort of replays, like, electrical-activity-wise,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.510
it looks like you're literally, like, reliving
the same thing you just learned or something.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.510
Is that...

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.470
[Matt]: That's absolutely correct. So these
studies firstly happened in animals, and we've

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.970
now been replicating some of them with brain
imaging, with MRI scans in humans. Hard to

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.820
believe, but we can do it. But the original
findings were fascinating. They would place

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.139
electrodes into that structure that we spoke
about, the hippocampus, which also rats have

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:01.910
as well, and it helps rats learn spatial navigation.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.529
And they would place lots of electrodes into
this part of the brain. And as the rat would

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:11.440
run around the maze and learn the maze, individual
cells would fire, and they would spatially

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.170
code which part of the maze the rat was in.
So different cells are mapping different parts.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:22.079
It's like sort of navigating a route from
your home to work. Different sort of cells

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.250
are coding the journey along the way.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.880
[Rhonda]: Yeah. I'd probably would suck at
doing that, but...

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.839
[Matt]: I think, yeah, yeah. I lost that.
Yeah, some people say it's a male aspect of

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:35.160
the gene, but I definitely lost it. Anyway,
but what is delightful was that you could

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.590
sort of hang, you know, a sound tone on each
one of these electrodes. And what you would

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:47.501
hear, and this is just, you know, for audio,
you would hear sort of "buh buh buh bump,

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:50.720
buh buh buh bump, buh buh buh bump," as the
rat was running around the maze, as these

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.490
cells were learning, encoding, and creating
this kind of memory circuit essentially.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:01.440
And, yeah, you know, "buh buh buh bump," off
it goes. But what was genius is that they

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:09.350
kept recording. And as the rat fell asleep,
what did they hear? And it wasn't just static

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:16.209
random firing, which is what we thought typically
happens during sleep. In that static of electrical

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:22.700
impulses at night, in a sea of electrical
noise, came out a very clear, predictive,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:29.160
message, which was "brrrmp, brrrmp, brrrmp."
It was exactly the same temporal sequence

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.910
"buh buh buh bump, buh buh buh bump, buh buh
buh bump," but it was sped up. And we now

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:40.130
know that it's during sleep that we replay,
but we replay at somewhere between 10 to 20

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.110
times the speed.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.860
So it's as though you're kind of, you know,
you've done the, you know, recording of whatever

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.310
happened during the day, but then it gets
replayed but at times 20 or times 10. "Brrrp,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.310
brrrp, brrrp, brrrp, brrrp."

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.550
[Rhonda]: Wow. So is this is a long-term potentiation
part? Is this where it's solidifying?

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.550
[Matt]: Yeah.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.870
[Rhonda]: Now what stage of sleep is that?
I know you mentioned...

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.149
[Matt]: So that's during deep non-REM sleep.

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:01.149
[Rhonda]: Deep.

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:02.149
[Matt]: Yup, that we see that.

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:05.209
[Rhonda]: It's the sleep I'm always trying
to optimize for, and it's just so difficult.

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:09.610
[Matt]: And it's difficult, you know, I think...Well,
sleep in general is difficult for so many

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.589
people, and we can speak why. So this starts
to come back to your original question about

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:20.899
REM sleep, though. So we get this memory replay.
It's absolutely fascinating. We can now see

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:25.370
it in humans. We can even manipulate it, which
is amazing.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.860
So if I teach you some information on a screen.
Let's say it's about a particular object,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:37.290
like a fire engine, and you have to try and
learn both the object and the spatial location

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:43.529
of that on a screen. And then tomorrow, we're
going to sort of come back. And I'm just going

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:48.819
to show you the image and say, "Do you remember
seeing it or not, yes or no?" And if you do

00:13:48.819 --> 00:13:53.259
remember seeing it, you've got to place where
you thought it was on the screen. So you have

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:56.360
to learn the item, and you have to learn the
associated location.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.380
But here's the great part. During the initial
learning session, before you slept, not only

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.440
do you see the fire engine but we play the
sound of the fire engine, like a fire engine

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.040
ring. And then we show you a kettle. It's
whistling. We show you a cat. It's meowing.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.680
So each of these items that you're making
has a contextual cue associated with it, a

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.139
sound. And it's a congruent sound, fire engine
sound, fire engine, kettle sound.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:29.930
And here's the fun part. I can teach you a
hundred of these items, and then during sleep,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:35.940
I'm going to replay those sounds that you
heard as if I'm trying to get into your brain

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.019
and I'm selectively reactivating each one
of those individual memories. But I'm only

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:48.250
going to reactivate and replay half of those
memories. I'm gonna go to replay 50 of 100

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.759
things that you've learned.

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:54.360
And then the next day, we wake you up, and
we test you. And firstly, your memory is better

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.769
after sleep. And that's what we found. What's
interesting is that for those items that I

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:06.279
replayed during sleep, they are almost twice
as superior in terms of your memory retention.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.980
[Rhonda]: So the playing of them doesn't disrupt
the sleep at all or...?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.930
[Matt]: Well, that's the key. You have to
play at a sub-threshold-awakening sound. So

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:20.320
we will test your auditory threshold, and
we will then play the sound at a level that

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.420
we know is below your awakening threshold.
So it's still just enough to get in to penetrate

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.820
into the brain and tickle the memory and reactivate
it...

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.820
[Rhonda]: That's fascinating.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.949
[Matt]: ...but it's not enough to wake you
up. So now, you know, you could imagine, you

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:38.820
know, I've got these science fiction ideas
of thinking, well, I learned all of this information,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.000
and maybe I can just put my favorite playlist
on, you know, at night at low sound and, you

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.259
know, stimulate these memories. Or could it
be a study aid where you, you know, help students,

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:49.329
like, sci-fi stuff?

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:53.810
[Rhonda]: So you think coupling different
sounds maybe with, you know, learning facts,

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.089
it may actually help...

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:56.089
[Matt]: Yeah.

00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:59.660
[Rhonda]: Like irrespective of replaying them,
like, during sleep, do you think just even

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.730
the coupling of the sound somehow can help,
can remember your...?

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.639
[Matt]: As long as those sounds have been
coupled and bounced to specific information.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:11.950
And this is what we call context-dependent
or key-dependent memory. This is well known

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.839
in psychology over about 100 years. If you
study in the room that you're going to take

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:22.140
the exam, you do better, because you actually
use cues, contextual cues from around the

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.000
room that are triggers to help you better
remember.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
[Matt]: We're just doing that with sleep.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.470
[Rhonda]: What about caffeine? So if you study
caffeinated and you don't take your exam caffeinated.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.180
Is this kind of the same concept?

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.700
[Matt]: We don't know about caffeine. It's
an interesting thing. Caffeine may be a...it's

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:45.139
a nonspecific stimulant, whether it works
with ingested substances. We know, however,

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:49.920
this works also with odors. So have you ever
had that experience where you're sort of in

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.430
an airport and you're sort of tying your shoelaces
at the security, someone walks past with that

00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:00.520
cologne or a perfume of a person you knew,
and it instantly unlocks that memory, as if

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.810
the sound has triggered the reactivation of
the memory, and it comes flooding back.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.340
Well, you can do the same thing with this
memory and sleep trick, where I teach you

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:15.540
stuff during the day, and we can puff certain
odors up your nose and associate the smell

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.870
with the learning material. And then during
sleep, you reperfuse the odor up the nose...

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:21.870
[Rhonda]: Oh, really?

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:25.430
[Matt]: ...and you can get the same benefit
as well, the same doubling of the benefit.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.650
[Rhonda]: Wow, that's fascinating. I remember
this study that was done, that was coupling

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:35.730
an odor, it was like a cherry blossom odor,
with an electrical shock. So those, you know,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:42.790
classical fear studies that they do in mice,
it was in rodents. And there was some sort

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:49.090
of epigenetic change that the breathing of
the odor, or the cherry blossom, was inducing.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:54.140
That was like changing some receptor on the
glucocorticoid receptors. So it was getting

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.120
passed on to, like, the next generation. And
so even though the next generation didn't

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.480
have the shock and the coupling of the smell,
you know, if they were exposed to the smell,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480
they have the fear.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.380
[Matt]: The critical memory was translated
from one generation to the next.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.690
[Rhonda]: Yeah. So, anyways, it'd be fascinating.
You don't know what role sleep plays in the

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.800
epigenetic transfer.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.430
[Matt]: Right. So if we all start doing this,
you know, are our children going to be incredible

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.010
memory replayers, you know, by the way of...But
to come back to your...I'm sorry I've taken

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.810
a desperately long time to answer your original
question, which was what about REM sleep.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.900
So what we've spoken about is the first two
of the three stages of memory processing with

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.060
sleep, sleep before to get the brain ready
to lay down memories, sleep after to grab

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.950
a hold of those individual memories and cement
them into the neural architecture of the brain.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:44.540
Once you've done that, though, there's a final
step. And that seemed to not depend on deep

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.930
non-REM sleep but instead depend on rapid
eye movement sleep or REM sleep, which is

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.060
what most of us know as dream sleep.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:58.060
And it's during dream sleep that your brain
essentially performs informational alchemy,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.680
is what I would describe it as. It's a little
bit like group therapy for memories that sleep

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.670
has gathered in all of the information during
the day. And during non-REM sleep, which always

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.370
comes first, by the way, in our sleep cycle.
We always have non-REM sleep first, then REM

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.280
sleep second, then non-REM sleep again, then
REM sleep second.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.470
And we don't know why there is no good explanatory
data suggesting why non-REM sleep always comes

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:30.320
first and REM sleep comes second. But I've
put forward the theory that, for information

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.280
processing, it makes sense. Which is that
non-REM sleep first to just get what you've

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.290
learned and lock it into the brain. REM sleep
then comes along, and REM sleep starts to

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:48.030
fuse all of the information that you've recently
learned with the entire back catalog of information

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.250
that you've got stored up across a lifetime
of experience.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:58.890
And it's this sort of...Essentially, REM sleep
is creating a revised mind wide web of associations.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.000
And I'd like to sort of think of what's going
on with REM sleep. And we've done lots of

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.090
these studies to look at this and these clever
ways that you can look at sleep and associative

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:15.970
memory processing and building new novel connections.
And it's almost like memory pinball, where

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.830
you take these new memories and you sort of
launch them up, and you start bouncing them

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:26.250
around into the architecture of information
within the brain. And you're starting to test

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.460
associations. You're starting to say, you
know, "Should this new information be connected

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.160
to this? Maybe not. Should it be connected
to this? Maybe not."

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.720
Now some of that happens whilst were awake
during the day. We make obvious connections.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.540
But what's strange is that we make connections
during REM sleep but they're not of the same

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:50.750
kind. The connections that we're making during
REM sleep are the longshots. This is the bizarre...

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.790
[Rhonda]: The bizarre, right.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.010
[Matt]: ...strange. You know, it's sort of...it
would be the equivalent of saying, during

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:59.770
the day, we take this information, and the
connections we make are like a Google search

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:05.310
gone right, which is the first page is all
of the things that are most related. And it's

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:10.940
very obvious. Page 1, that's directly related
to what I inputted.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.200
During REM sleep, it's almost as though you
input the search term and you're immediately

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.100
taken to page 20 of the Google search, which
is about some field hockey game in Utah. And

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:28.340
you think, I don't understand. Oh, that's
interesting. I see what you're talking about.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:35.400
So we make these bizarre leaps of associative
memory processing faith during REM sleep.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.990
And that's why we now understand that it's
REM sleep that helps us divine remarkable

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.790
creative insights into previously impenetrable
problems.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:52.140
And you can see this throughout the history
of human beings, this dream-inspired insight,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:58.120
scientific demonstrations. You know, August
KekulÃ© divined the idea of a benzene ring,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.810
these double carbon rings by dreaming of a
serpent that swallowed its tail. Dmitri Mendeleev,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:11.160
you know, came up with the Periodic Table
of Elements by way of dream inspiration. And,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.400
you know, people have won Nobel Prizes, Otto
Loewi won the Nobel Prize for the demonstration

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.850
of chemical transmission across nerve cells.
And he dreamt of the experiment that helped

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.590
improve that. He didn't dream of the concept
itself, but he dreamt of the experiment to

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.520
prove it.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.930
Wonderful, artistic demonstrations of this,
too. You know, Paul McCartney has written

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:38.610
innumerable songs, it turns out, by way of
his dreams. Keith Richards came up with the

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.810
opening chords of Satisfaction by way of dream-inspired
insight.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:49.590
So REM sleep takes that third component of
information processing. And I think it's what

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:57.690
defines us differentially from computers in
part, which is that deep sleep is about knowledge,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.240
which is gathering all of the information
and holding on to it. REM sleep, I would argue,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.310
is about wisdom, which is knowing what it
all means when you fit it together, you know.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.260
That's what I want from a good student. Don't
just give me dry-book learning. Do you really

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.230
understand it? Can you apply it? Are you creative?
That's dream sleep.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.700
[Rhonda]: Right, a deep thinker. Why do you
sometimes not remember your dreams and sometimes

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.370
you do remember your dreams? Do you have any
idea?

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:29.480
[Matt]: Yeah. So some of it seems to be about,
if you wake up out of that dream sleep period

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.530
and then you go back into sleep, the awakening
can sometimes help you commit that experience

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.530
to memory.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.750
[Rhonda]: Oh, okay.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.111
[Matt]: But there are people who say that
I never remember my dreams, you know. We can

00:23:41.111 --> 00:23:44.420
bring those people into my sleep center, and
we can, you know, wake them up in the middle

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.141
of dream sleep, and they'll say, "It's remarkable.
For the first time, I was dreaming." And the

00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:51.920
answer is no. It's not the first time that
you are dreaming. It's just the first time

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.130
that you've actually remembered a dream, because
it's the first time you've typically woken

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.130
up.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.170
[Rhonda]: Okay. My mother-in-law, you know,
claims that she doesn't dream. And, of course,

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.450
I'm like, "No, you have to dream."

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.450
[Matt]: Yeah.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.450
[Rhonda]: That must be...

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.640
[Matt]: There are a selection of patients
that have a lesion in a part of the prefrontal

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.460
cortex, in their white matter, which are these
big sort of informational fiber tracts that

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.930
communicate impulses. If you get a lesion
deep down there, we do seem to genuinely see

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.370
a cessation of dreaming in those patients.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:26.570
By the way, I would...I didn't even feel confident
to write this in the book, and it's still

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:33.680
a theory that I've never really heard in public,
but go with me on this. Which is, I think

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.120
that we may actually remember all of our dreams,
or it's possible that there's a tenable theory.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.170
The problem is we don't have access to those
dreams. Those dreams are memorized, and they

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.870
are available. They're just not accessible.
I think what happens as we wake up is that

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:56.170
we lose the IP address to those memories.
And the reason I believe this to be potentially

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.990
true is have you ever had the experience where
you wake up and you think, I was dreaming,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.330
and I know I was dreaming. And you try as
hard as you can. The harder you try, the...

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.330
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.800
[Matt]: ...worse the memory-recall goes? And
then you think, forget it. Two days later,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.720
you're walking along, and you see a street
sign, and all of a sudden, it triggers the

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.710
unlocking of that dream memory. You think,
oh, that's what the dream was about.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:23.690
As a neuroscientist, that tells me that the
memory was present. The memory was available.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:30.210
The problem was accessibility. You couldn't
gain recall access. So the information is

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.950
there. It's just not accessible. If that's
true...

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.850
[Rhonda]: It's happened to me just even after
I've, you know, when I go to bed. You know,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.910
later that night, I hit the pillow, and all
of a sudden, I remember the dream right as

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:41.910
I'm hitting the pillow.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:42.910
[Matt]: Right.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:43.910
[Rhonda]: That's happened to me more than
once. But you're right.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:49.220
[Matt]: Right. It sort of tells you that there
is...it's almost a scary prospect, which is

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.230
that maybe every single one of our dreams
throughout life are stored and are present

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:00.570
and determine our behavior to some degree,
because we know that there is an enormous

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.720
amount of information that changes our behavior
or decisions that goes on below the radar

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.200
of consciousness, implicit memory. That could
be true for dreaming, too.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.370
And I think I've got an experiment that we
may be able to design to actually get at this.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.830
And if that's true, it should, hopefully,
radically change our view of dreaming, that

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:24.280
dreams are ephemeral, that they dissolve quickly,
they're forgotten, and they don't influence

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.740
us as human species.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.960
[Rhonda]: That would be pretty groundbreaking.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.960
[Matt]: Yeah, we'll see.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.350
[Rhonda]: You just had a study that I just
read, I think, yesterday on sleep and it affecting

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.990
behavior, loneliness, or...

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:41.820
[Matt]: Yeah, so we just published a sleep
study demonstrating that sleep loss will trigger

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:48.030
viral loneliness. And it was a three-part
study. I mean, firstly, the reason that I

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:54.260
got into this was loneliness is a killer.
We know that there is a massive epidemic of

00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:01.050
loneliness now in industrialized nations.
Being lonely increases your mortality risk

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:07.810
by about 45%. In other words, being lonely
is twice as risky for your death concern than

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.810
obesity...

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.810
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:10.810
[Matt]: ...which is striking.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:16.980
[Rhonda]: Yeah. There was actually a study
showing loneliness changes, like, a massive

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:23.370
amount of gene expression and, like, up-regulates
NF-kappaB, cortisol, like all these pro-inflammatory

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.170
genes. So it makes sense that it'd be associated
with...

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.230
[Matt]: And what's bizarre about loneliness...By
the way, I'm taking a complete...this has

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:34.350
got nothing to do with sleep. But if you look
at the profile of your gene expression and

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.830
your immune system, you've got some immune
components that will go after viruses. And

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:46.120
viruses can only be transmitted from one human
being to another by way of touch. They can't

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.390
live outside of our bodies. Bacteria, so if
you scrape yourself on a fence, like, you

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:55.200
know, walking past it, you can get a bacterial
infection because bacteria can live outside

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.260
of the body.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:05.340
When you become lonely, your gene expression
shifts you away from a profile of immunity

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.570
that normally deals with viruses and pushes
you to more towards a bacterial defense profile.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.570
[Rhonda]: Really?

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.570
[Matt]: Isn't that incredible?

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.600
[Rhonda]: Yeah, you should send me that study.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.600
[Matt]: That your psychology...

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600
[Rhonda]: Yeah, that's fascinating.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.080
[Matt]: And there's a couple of folks at UCLA,
who, if you ever have interest in this area

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.810
of how loneliness, the mind, the mood...

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.810
[Rhonda]: Oh, totally. Yeah.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.640
[Matt]: Okay, I've got to give you these people.
I'm a complete fan of...

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640
[Rhonda]: Please do.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.420
[Matt]: ...their work. And they did this study.
And it just blew my mind. How could a concept

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.570
that is so sort of, you know, out there, and
some people almost don't, you know, believe

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:45.090
in loneliness. Toughen up. What's wrong with
you? Go out make some...How could that change

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:51.800
the expression of your genes and even alter
how you, the organism, fend for yourself from

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.190
an immunological perspective shifting you
from viral to bacterial defense. But, anyway...

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.190
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.490
[Matt]: So coming back, I was desperately
concerned about the state of loneliness. What's

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.620
interesting, I was reading a lot at the time,
because we do a lot of work with sleep and

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.110
psychiatric disorders including anxiety, and
when I was reading the studies where they

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:16.110
would take animals and they would deprive
them of sleep, you've got this anxiogenic

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:23.040
profile where you got cortisol increasing,
you got shift in insulin and glucose regulation,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.940
all of the bad things that you would not wish
to happen, an anxiety increase, they had fear-like

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.020
behavior all by way of just sleep restriction.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.100
But what was also interesting is that sometimes
the researchers would know, despite not measuring

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:42.360
it systematically, that the animals, who would
often be secluded by themselves in the cage,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:49.850
even when they were with other conspecifics,
and other conspecifics would not approach

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:50.850
them either.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:51.850
[Rhonda]: Okay.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:57.020
[Matt]: And so it seemed to me just from reading
this, I thought, well, this seems like an

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:03.230
animal phenotype of human loneliness. And
it seems to be caused by a lack of sleep.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.080
So we decided we had to do the study.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.290
So the first part of the study, we took a
group of individuals, and they went through

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.530
the study twice. They were either deprived
of sleep for an entire night, or they got

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:19.640
a full eight hours of sleep. The first test
was do you have a social repulsion boundary,

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.270
and that boundary is increased when you are
sleep-deprived. So I think everyone has that

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.370
sense that if I start moving closer to you,
you think, okay, do you know what, at some

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.840
point, that's kind of enough. That's about
my close distance.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.920
What's interesting is that if I ask a sleep-deprived
an individual to stay put, and I ask you,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.580
as an experimenter, to walk towards the sleep
deprived individual, and the individual says,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.490
"Stop," when they feel comfortable relative
to when that very same individual has had

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.870
a full eight-hour night of sleep. When you're
sleep-deprived, you decide to push people

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:57.600
a further distance away from you. So you have
a lower desire for social proximity and social

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600
interaction.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:05.280
Second, we then replicated that finding, but
now we had them inside the MRI scanner. Because

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.861
we wanted to see what was changing the brain
to produce this social repulsion. What we

00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:13.270
found was that the regions of the brain that
are essentially an alarm network, which is

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.040
a sort of a stay-away-from-me network that
is sort of in the parietal cortex and the

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.920
premotor cortex, it's sort of what we call
the near space network. So it creates your

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.240
comfort of boundary. And when objects start
to approach you, it alarms to say, "Incoming.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.910
Be cautious. Be wary." That part of the brain
became hyperactive when people were sleep-deprived...

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:34.910
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.850
[Matt]: as if you were getting this repulsion
signal from the brain. If that wasn't bad

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:45.320
enough, the other parts of the brain that
have been called the theory-of-mind network,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.880
which sort of helps you understand the intent
of other people, it's a pro-social network

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.840
in the brain, it cooperates pro-social interaction,
that part of the brain was shut down by sleep

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.490
deprivation. So it's a double-edged sort of
sword.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:07.110
So we weren't satisfied with that. Next, we
wanted to say, "Could someone who just looked

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:13.000
at these sleep-deprived individuals, could
they actually judge them as being lonelier

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.580
and looking lonelier and beaten, sort of perceived
as lonely, even though they knew nothing about

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.780
the experiment?"

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.770
So in the experiment with the sleep-deprived
individuals, we also did videotaped interviews

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.071
with them. And we just asked them general
questions. Tell us about a movie that you

00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:31.420
watched? Or what was happening in the news
this week? Just bland stuff. And then we got

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:39.390
1,000, I think was it was over 1,000 people,
1,083 people online. And they knew nothing

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.020
about the experiment. They didn't know it's
about sleep, sleep deprivation, knew nothing.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.250
And we showed them just a 60-second clip of
these people when they'd have a good night

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.790
of sleep and when they were sleep-deprived.
And we just asked them, "How lonely does this

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:55.660
person appear to you?" And they knew nothing.
But despite knowing nothing, they consistently

00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:01.570
and reliably rated the sleep-deprived version
of the individual as seeming lonelier.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.870
We also asked them, "Would you socially interact
with this person? Would you friend them on

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:10.320
Facebook? Would you work with them in a business
environment?" And they consistently rated

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.330
that they would prefer not to engage and interact
with them.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.310
[Rhonda]: Is that because they just looked
unhappy or looked...?

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.210
[Matt]: Well, we actually think it's a collection
of things. It's that their appearance, but

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:24.770
also their vocal tone, is very different.
We think there's a lot of...This is now one

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.440
of the key things. What's communicating this
asocial profile?

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.070
[Rhonda]: Oh, so they are listening to them
speak?

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.520
[Matt]: So they watched them, and they listen
to them speak. So they could hear them as

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:41.200
well. So we demonstrated that. There was,
unfortunately, the social repulsion on both

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.750
sides of the equation. When you're sleep-deprived,
you yourself don't want to have anything to

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:50.070
do with other people. And that perhaps wouldn't
be so bad if people would only at least come

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.650
to your rescue, because they would see you
in need. The opposite is true. People find

00:33:54.650 --> 00:34:01.480
you socially repulsive as a consequence. So
there's a push from both sides of the social

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.820
dyad.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:08.379
The next thing, we asked those people who
were rating the sleep-deprived individuals,

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:14.389
we also said, "Look, how lonely do you feel
after just the 60-second clip?" And they themselves

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:20.099
felt lonelier after interacting with sleep-deprived
individuals. In other words, this contagion

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.690
of sleep-deprivation-induced loneliness.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:26.389
[Rhonda]: So I wonder how much of this can
be translated to, like, someone that, say,

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:31.409
for example, gets only five or six hours of
sleep versus, of course, not getting a full

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:35.029
night sleep. You know, maybe there's, like,
a little, just a little bit of this penetrating...

00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:38.470
[Matt]: We then ask that question. That was
the final part of the study, which is that

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:43.510
we said, "Okay, this is extreme sleep deprivation,
and most of the population does not undergo

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:49.220
this. What about a more ecological version?"
So we tracked hundreds of people across two

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:56.520
nights of sleep. And we asked, just by a subtle
variation of nature, our small perturbations

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.329
of sleep from one night to the next, do they
predict how lonely you experience yourself

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:07.589
to be from one day to the next? And these
are small minute changes in sleep efficiency,

00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:10.670
just small reductions in sleep of tens of
minutes.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.819
Lo and behold, even just that small change
in your sleep from one night to the next,

00:35:15.819 --> 00:35:21.940
we could measure, predicted how lonely you
would experience life the next day from one

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.010
day to the next. So it doesn't even take,
you know, two hours of sleep reduction.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.010
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.010
[Matt]: Small minutes.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:34.240
[Rhonda]: I remember reading somewhere, too,
that isn't the, like, amygdala, like hyperactive

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.710
or something happens, there's not an inhibitory
signal that occurs if you're sleep-deprived

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.710
or...?

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.710
[Matt]: That's right.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:40.710
[Rhonda]: Is that correct?

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.710
[Matt]: Yes.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.559
[Rhonda]: So then you're feeling more...you're,
like, alarmed and, you know, just anxious

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:47.650
and feeling that in a, say, threat...

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.650
[Matt]: That's right.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.789
[Rhonda]: ...that ongoing threat that really
isn't there.

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:56.849
[Matt]: Exactly, yeah. So we published the
study in 2007 where we, again, sort of sleep-deprived

00:35:56.849 --> 00:36:02.079
people, put them inside an MRI scanner, and
we showed them increasingly negative and aversive

00:36:02.079 --> 00:36:06.950
and unpleasant images. And what we saw is
that, relative to people who'd got a full

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:13.310
night of sleep, the amygdala, this sort of
emotional epicenter for the generation of

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:18.910
strong, emotional, impulsive reactions, that
deep emotional center was 60% more reactive

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.769
under conditions of a lack of sleep.

00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:28.359
And then we asked why. Why is your emotional
brain so sort of sensitive and erupting with

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:34.680
such extraordinary activity? And what we then
went to find, or went on to find out in later

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.500
work, was that another part of your brain
called the prefrontal cortex that sits directly

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.470
above your eyes here, and particularly the
middle part right between your eyes, that

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:49.760
part of the brain acts almost like the CEO
of the brain, of your emotions, and your hedonic

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:55.420
impulses. And it sends sort of an inhibitory
top-down regulatory control. It's sort of,

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.010
like, the brakes on the gas pedal of your
emotions.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.720
That part of the brain was shut down by sleep
deprivation, and you'd lost that communication

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.589
to the amygdala. So now you, from an emotional
standpoint, you were all emotional gas pedal

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:13.210
and too little regulatory control brake as
it were.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:19.020
[Rhonda]: It's really interesting. This work
kind of reminds me of...I'm not sure if you're

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.440
aware of any of this research. A lot of it
has been done by Dr. Molly Crockett, who,

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:30.390
I believe, now she's at Harvard. But she has
done a lot of studies looking at serotonin

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:36.089
depletion in the brain. And basically, you
can induce that by giving acute tryptophan

00:37:36.089 --> 00:37:41.710
depletion, giving someone like branched-chain
amino acids to compete with transport for

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.829
tryptophan in the brain, which then basically
drops serotonin levels. I mean, you can drop

00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:48.430
your serotonin levels down to, like, 10%.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.569
[Matt]: And mood is...

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:54.839
[Rhonda]: And the same thing happens where,
exactly what you were describing, the inhibitory

00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:01.000
signal that happens from the prefrontal cortex
onto the amygdala is, like, stops. And so

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.070
people become extremely impulsive. Terrible
moods, a little more aggressive, their long-term

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.470
planning shuts down, and they just, like,
going for the short-term gratification. Very

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:17.319
similar. So it'd be kind of interesting...I
don't know how serotonin would be related

00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:20.119
to all that, but there must be some sort of
connection.

00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:23.470
[Matt]: Yeah. I mean, and I think there's
a number of different, I think, neuro chemicals

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:27.710
that can produce that same kind of neural
phenotype and as it were. But what struck

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:33.920
me was that when I looked at that neural signature
of sleep deprivation for the emotional brain,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.671
it was not dissimilar to numerous psychiatric
conditions. And that then now, gosh, 11 years

00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:45.660
ago, I'm showing my age, but that set sort
of, you know, the sleep center off on a completely

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.890
new trajectory of work. And we're doing a
lot of this work in sleep and psychiatric

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.890
disorders.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:55.500
And I think one of the most fundamental things
that I can say at this point is that we have

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.020
not been able to discover a single psychiatric
condition in which sleep is normal. And so

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:07.940
I think sleep has a profound story to tell
in our understanding, maybe our treatment,

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:13.400
I don't know about prevention, but possibly,
of grave mental illness. And psychiatry has

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.049
known this, by the way, for, you know, 40
or 50 years. It's always been documented that

00:39:18.049 --> 00:39:21.079
sleep disturbance goes hand-in-hand with psychiatric
disturbance.

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:24.650
[Rhonda]: Maybe there's some sort of complex
gene environment interaction. A few people

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.760
that are more genetically susceptible and
are getting...losing the sleep, or, like,

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.380
the ones that are kind of pushed into a disease
state.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.130
[Matt]: And we've seen this, too, that if
you look at that emotional brain reaction

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:40.210
signature that I just sort of described, and
you repeat that, but with people who are high-anxious

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.799
and low-anxious, and we know some of the genes
that are associated with being high-anxious

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:50.309
and low-anxious. So we're using anxiety as
a sort of a proxy for perhaps a particular

00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:56.690
genotype here. What you see is that it's those
high-anxious people who are the most vulnerable

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:01.769
to this impact of a lack of sleep. Those who
are low-anxious still have a bad outcome,

00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:07.339
but it's nowhere near as bad. So there seems
to be sort of interactions here between sleep

00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:13.170
loss and your basic trait levels of being
sort of a nervous, anxious type to begin with.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:14.170
[Rhonda]: That makes sense.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.710
[Matt]: And those are the people who are,
sadly, the people who typically don't get

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.760
a good night of sleep anyway.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.220
[Rhonda]: Right. So you're saying anxiety
is, like, one of the things that stops me

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.220
from sleeping.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.339
[Matt]: It's the principal trigger of insomnia.

00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:25.339
[Rhonda]: Yeah, really, true.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.690
[Matt]: It's the model of insomnia right now,
is that you get...And if you look at the nervous

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.940
system, that's how we understand insomnia
right now, is that its principle is...I think

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:38.970
ultimately we'll find that there are multiple
flavors of insomnia, different forms. We already

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.900
categorized two of them. We've got what we
call sleep onset insomnia and sleep maintenance

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.460
insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty
staying asleep. They're not mutually exclusive.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.769
You can have both, or you can just have one
or the other.

00:40:52.769 --> 00:41:00.779
But coming back to it, I think the overarching
biological red thread narrative of insomnia

00:41:00.779 --> 00:41:05.720
is an amplified fight-or-flight nervous system,
that your nervous system is split into these

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.759
two branches, what we call sort of the sympathetic
and parasympathetic parts of your autonomic

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:16.210
nervous system. The sympathetic is anything
but sympathetic. It's poorly named. It's the

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:21.549
fight-or-flight branch of your nervous system.
It ramps you up, charges you up, releases

00:41:21.549 --> 00:41:23.119
cortisol, adrenaline.

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:29.950
You constantly see an overactive, sympathetic
nervous system in people with insomnia. And

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.200
when you measure their cortisol across the
24-hour period, in most of us, just as we're

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.400
getting to our natural bedtime, cortisol just
starts to now drop down. We start to see that

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.940
cycling down of cortisol. The opposite happens
in people with insomnia. You get a continued

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:51.030
rise right around that bedroom period. And
it seems to be very predictive of sleep onset

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.599
problems.

00:41:52.599 --> 00:41:56.579
If you look throughout the night, cortisol
then starts to plummet, and it drops beautifully

00:41:56.579 --> 00:42:00.730
down. It's part of the reason why deep sleep
is the best form of natural blood pressure

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:07.529
medication that you could ever wish for. Your
heart rate drops down, your vessels relax,

00:42:07.529 --> 00:42:12.500
cortisol drops down. But in other insomnia
patients, we see this bizarre spike in cortisol

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.839
in the middle of the night. And it predicts
nighttime awakenings. It predicts sleep maintenance

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:18.839
insomnia.

00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:24.519
[Rhonda]: I have experienced...So that's one
of the problems that I actually have. It's

00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:30.279
much, much better now that my stress level
is, like, maintained. At graduate school,

00:42:30.279 --> 00:42:34.309
I would get nighttime awakenings where my
heart would start racing. And I would wake

00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:39.569
up thinking that there was a spider or some
kind of threat. And I would scream, and sometimes

00:42:39.569 --> 00:42:44.849
fly out the bed. I mean, you know, and just...it
would scare my husband, you know. At the time,

00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:50.240
we weren't married. But, I mean, you know,
these nighttime awakenings, it was something

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:56.470
that's dated back for quite some time. But
really, it manifested during a very stressful

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.760
period, and that was graduate school.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.760
[Matt]: We see that...

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760
[Rhonda]: Got much better.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.760
[Matt]: ...so frequently.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.999
[Matt]: But if you can think about that as
sort of, you know, a stress management component

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:11.880
to insomnia, you know, it's part of what we
call cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.499
which is sort of dealing with that stress,
you know, meditation. There's great apps out

00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:19.279
there, like Headspace, for example.

00:43:19.279 --> 00:43:24.710
And the data on meditation and insomnia is
very very powerful. You know, I'd known about

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:30.109
it a little bit, but I hadn't read really
all of the studies until I started researching

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:35.130
it for the book. And I was so convinced that
I started meditating. And I haven't stopped

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:39.390
since. Because it was, you know...Typically,
I'm not a bad sleeper. I'm a light sleeper.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:45.650
I'm a pretty good sleeper. I found it hugely
useful for times when I was under stress,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.249
or when I was traveling and jetlag. It's very
beneficial, too.

00:43:49.249 --> 00:43:55.180
But that underlying theme, I think, as a message
for insomnia, it's not the only cause of insomnia,

00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:01.400
but it seems to be if there's one common sort
of rule that binds many of the patients with

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.190
insomnia together, it's this overactive fight-or-flight
branch of the nervous system. And if you can

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.839
settle that down, you are certainly on the
path towards better sleep.

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:14.220
[Rhonda]: Right. And to kind of just...Another
point that you made talking about, you know,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.970
the hormonal response and the cortisol rising
typically when it's supposed to be falling,

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.890
that kind of prevents you from falling asleep,
there is some interesting research that I've

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:28.400
read where, and I know you and I have talked
about how the importance of bright light exposure...Bright

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.990
light exposure for six hours a day...I mean,
no one does that nowadays. We're always inside.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.529
So it's rare unless you're, like, working
out in a nature park or something.

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:38.980
[Matt]: The irony of these things...

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980
[Rhonda]: Right, you know.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.089
[Matt]: Yeah. It's for the camera. I promise.

00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:46.779
[Rhonda]: Right. But, actually, it was shown
to lower cortisol by 25%.

00:44:46.779 --> 00:44:47.799
[Matt]: Yup.

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:53.849
[Rhonda]: So this is, like, you know, another
kind of I don't know if that would even help

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:56.079
someone with the anxiety or, you know...

00:44:56.079 --> 00:45:01.560
[Matt]: No, I think it's...there's no studies
testing it yet, but there are studies...So

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.800
just sort of to go back to make this point,
we normally have a circadian rhythm, this

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.911
beautiful sort of 24-hour rhythm. And we human
beings were diurnal, and we like to sleep

00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:15.999
at night, be awake during the day. We have
this awesome upswing of our circadian rhythm

00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:21.279
sort of once we wake up sort of 7, 8, 9, 10,
11. It starts to peak during the day. It drops

00:45:21.279 --> 00:45:25.119
down a little bit in the mid-afternoon. And
that's why you sort of get around meeting

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:28.920
tables in the middle of the afternoon these
sort of, you know, head nods. It's not people

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.799
listening to a good music. It's like, actually,
it's a pre-programmed dip in your alertness.

00:45:33.799 --> 00:45:37.849
And then it rises back up, and then it drops
down at night.

00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:42.470
And one of the ways that you can get this
sort of what you would want, which is a nice

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:47.599
sinusoidal wave, you want a nice strong peak
of the circadian rhythm during the day so

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:51.420
that you're awake and you're active during
the day and you're productive, and then you

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.990
want an awesome sort of trough throughout
the night so that you sleep soundly, deeply,

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:00.020
and in a stable fashion.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.450
And the way that you can sort of help your
circadian rhythm have that wonderful peak

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:11.569
and delightful trough is by getting lots of
daylight during the day but lots of darkness

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:17.520
during the night. And we are a dark-deprived
society in this modern era. And it is a huge

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.430
problem in the evening.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:25.270
But I think people have underestimated that
we are a light-deprived society during the

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:31.940
day. So what happens is that your brain goes
through life in this kind of almost stupor

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.930
state where it's not getting enough daylight
to really keep it ramped up throughout the

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:41.769
day so you're sleepy throughout the day and
you're tired, but then we've got too much

00:46:41.769 --> 00:46:48.000
light in the evening so you end up being awake
at night, and then you're sleepy during the

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.569
day, you're awake at night.

00:46:49.569 --> 00:46:54.499
And so, you know, almost like, I'm gonna call
it a seesaw. I think we call it teeter-totter

00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:59.660
here. You know, during the day, you want daylight
to come in and force you all the way on to

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.680
the on switch and you're active and awake.
And then at night, you want the signal of

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:08.210
darkness to come in to trigger the release
of a hormone called melatonin to shift you

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:13.319
all the way into the off position so you go
into deep sleep and a sound sleep.

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:18.220
But now, with artificial light and staying
out of bright light, so the teeter-totter

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.609
has just pushed a little bit to one side,
and then sort of with not enough darkness

00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:26.640
at night, it's only pushed a little bit down
on the other side. So you kind of have this

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.859
flip-flop switch that...it's like a dimmer
switch that is basically just on dim for 24

00:47:31.859 --> 00:47:36.470
hours rather than light and complete darkness,
if that makes some sense.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:37.470
[Rhonda]: Yes.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.470
[Matt]: It's terrible analogy, but...

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.660
[Rhonda]: Do you have any idea, like, how
much bright light exposure, like, you know...Let's

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.180
say, you know, a lot of people work in, like,
a little cubicle where they could don't even

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:51.049
have windows. I mean, they're just like in
the middle of this, like, little rooms with

00:47:51.049 --> 00:47:56.160
no actual sunlight coming in, you know, is
something like if you wake up in the morning

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.339
and you go outside for 30 minutes or an hour
first thing in the morning, like...Most people

00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:04.099
are drinking their coffee. Well, maybe what
you need is bright light exposure instead

00:48:04.099 --> 00:48:05.650
of your coffee, or drink your coffee outside.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.990
[Matt]: Right, yeah. Take the coffee on...

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.380
[Rhonda]: Yeah. Do you know how much light
you need? And if you don't have light outside,

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:16.180
let's say you live in London, and you're in
the winter, and there's no...It's just gray.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:23.630
[Matt]: Even that, even on a cloudy day, the
lux intensity of light far exceeds that that

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:28.529
you would have from incandescent light or
at sort of typical lights inside of a building.

00:48:28.529 --> 00:48:31.410
[Rhonda]: Okay. So now my second question,
the lux amount, so do you know?

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:36.279
[Matt]: Yeah. So I think, I mean, if you look
at the studies, once you get over a sort of,

00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:42.510
you know, about 5,000 to 10,000 lux, you can
have a pretty powerful effect. I don't believe

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:47.250
there's...and I could be wrong. And Satchin
Panda, our good friend, who is just A plus...In

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.819
fact, yeah, if you're watching this, like,
stop watching this now. Just go and watch

00:48:50.819 --> 00:48:57.910
the Satchin Panda podcast. He's much more
powerful and eloquent than I am. But they

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:04.059
have looked at the degree of exposure to outside
light, not necessarily the intensity of light

00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:06.890
during that outside exposure time.

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:12.440
So I don't think we yet understand exactly
what the dose response is in terms of lux

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:19.319
intensity. What we do know is that getting
30 to 40 minutes of outside morning light

00:49:19.319 --> 00:49:24.559
is critical. But here's the trick. Here, in
California a lot of people make this mistake,

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:29.200
but even in London, it happens despite cloudy
day, people put shades on in the morning.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:37.039
Don't do that. I know it looks good. But don't.
Let that natural light penetrate your eye.

00:49:37.039 --> 00:49:42.339
There's a retinal mechanism that goes through
to your thalamus that then goes through the

00:49:42.339 --> 00:49:47.660
hypothalamus that regulates your circadian
clock. You need that light penetration. You're

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:51.390
losing all of that good stuff if, or some
of it, if you put shades on.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:57.239
Wear some protection, that's fine. Just nix
the shades in the morning. In the afternoon,

00:49:57.239 --> 00:50:02.499
reverse the trick. And this is actually a
very good tip for jet lag. Jet lag is essentially

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:07.980
an extreme form of what most of us have, which
what we've been describing this diluted amount

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:13.599
of light during the day and then too much
light at night. Jet lag, you really should

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:18.190
get out in the morning, 40 minutes of daylight,
no shades. And in the afternoon, it's fine

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:23.230
to go out. But when you go out, now is the
time to put shades on, because you can start

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:29.309
to encourage even then the release of melatonin,
which is that hormone of darkness, which signals

00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:30.900
the timing of healthy sleep.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.190
[Rhonda]: So about what time in the afternoon
would you say shades are...?

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:37.150
[Matt]: So I would say, you know, probably...it
depends on your bedtime, if you're a morning

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:41.230
owl or an evening lark, and we can speak about
chronotypes. So it really depends on when

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.369
you're planning on going to bed. But let's
say that you're planning on going to bed at

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:50.039
about 10 p.m., I would say, if you're sort
of going out after about to 4:30-ish, now

00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:54.390
is a good time to maybe start to help dilute
down some of that light.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:51:00.749
But then, you know, in the evenings, you know,
we are so bathed and saturated in light. And

00:51:00.749 --> 00:51:06.089
yes, we can speak a lot about LED screens,
and they are impactful, and there's been lots

00:51:06.089 --> 00:51:11.970
of work on that, some of which haven't replicated
but many of which have. I think the bigger

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:17.090
problem is just overhead lighting in general.
We're just infused by, in every room that

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.090
we go.

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:23.539
And my recommendation has now been, in the
last hour before bed, just turn off half of

00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:28.579
the lights in your house, you know. We don't
necessarily need all of them blazing in the

00:51:28.579 --> 00:51:35.359
last hour before bed. And when you do that,
it's quite surprising how soporific and somnogenic

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:39.960
it actually is, you know. And I want to do
the experiment, although someone beat me to

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.980
the experiment, and they did it...you know,
it's one of those studies when I read it,

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:49.130
I just thought, my first reaction, I'm not
a big person. My first reaction was, oh, I'm

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.130
so jealous.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:51.130
[Rhonda]: Oh, yeah.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.849
[Matt]: I was like, oh, I wish I've done...And
then I just thought, this is a brilliant paper.

00:51:53.849 --> 00:51:58.119
I can't wait to teach it. They took a group
of people. They looked at their habitual amount

00:51:58.119 --> 00:52:02.430
of sleep that they would typically get. And
these people are getting sort of seven and

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:06.349
a half to eight hours. And they would ask,
you know, "When are you gointo sleep?" And

00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:11.299
sort of most of them would go to bed like
11 and sleep through till 7.

00:52:11.299 --> 00:52:15.339
And then they took them out of that typical,
you know, modernity environment, and they

00:52:15.339 --> 00:52:18.619
took them out to the Rockies. And they had
sleep tracking equipment on them. They took

00:52:18.619 --> 00:52:23.720
them there for several weeks. And there was
no electricity whatsoever, not even a torch,

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:29.240
not even a headlamp from a car, nothing. And
then they look to see what changed.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.210
The first thing was that these people went
from sleeping, you know, an acclaimed seven

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:37.210
and a half or seven hours of sleep that was
their norm. It was actually just below seven,

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:41.200
saying, "That was fine. That's all I needed."
To then, actually, when they had no watch,

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.339
they didn't know when to wake up, no alarm
clocks, they ended up sleeping closer to nine

00:52:45.339 --> 00:52:49.470
hours a night, which is what we typically
see when you saturate sort of people away

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.010
from or dislocate them from modernity.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:54.760
[Rhonda]: So would you say that's a good sleep
duration?

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:59.059
[Matt]: Well, I think somewhere between seven
to nine is what we recommend. But I think

00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:02.890
when you do this in a healthy, young people,
and these were healthy, young people, they

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.609
seemed to acclimate to a sleep amount that
was somewhere between sort of eight to nine

00:53:06.609 --> 00:53:12.230
hours of sleep. So I think it's good evidence
that, you know...You can look at how hunter-gatherer

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:16.829
tribes were sleeping. And we've studied, you
know, these people. And they actually sleep

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:22.779
in a strange manner. We can get back to that.
And people have tried to use them as the gold

00:53:22.779 --> 00:53:24.589
standard as to how we should be sleeping.

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:27.000
[Rhonda]: They're a lot more active and...I
mean, they're so different, right?

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.739
[Matt]: I don't think it's a good control.
I think we should say, "Let's take modern

00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:36.309
human beings and let's just take them out
of all context of modernity. And let's see

00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:43.170
how they're sleeping. Let's just sort of put
them on an ad-lib buffet of sleep. And they

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:47.940
can just sleep as much as they want. They're
not told when to wake up and sort of when

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:53.450
to go to bed." And they seem to sleep what
we now think of as a natural amount, which

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.891
is somewhere between, if you look at the distribution,
seven to nine hours.

00:53:56.891 --> 00:53:58.210
[Rhonda]: And these are younger individuals?
Sure.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:02.559
[Matt]: Yup. And we can speak about, and I
hope we speak about sleep and aging. But what

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:06.960
was also interesting is when they slept, not
just how much they slept. They started to

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.759
go to bed earlier and earlier and earlier,
and they started to wake up a little bit earlier

00:54:12.759 --> 00:54:18.760
and earlier. And the total duration of sleep
expended. But where that expanded amount of

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.849
sleep was positioned on the 24-hour clock
was dragged back because they weren't influenced

00:54:23.849 --> 00:54:28.599
by these cues of, you know, too much daylight
at night. Temperature is another one that

00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.980
I'd love to speak about, too.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.440
But what's fascinating is that when you look
at hunter-gatherer tribes, all these experiments

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:44.609
of sort of true nature, the natural point
of middle point of sleep, the middle phase

00:54:44.609 --> 00:54:49.099
sort of time of that eight to nine hours sleep
phase, came somewhere between midnight and

00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:53.529
1:00 p.m. And I often ask people this question,
you know, "Have you ever thought about what

00:54:53.529 --> 00:55:00.890
the term midnight actually means?" You know,
it means the middle of the solar night, which

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:04.500
is the time when most of us should be in the
middle of our sleep phase.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.819
But now, in the 21st century, we've gone through
the, you know, the agrarian sort of, you know,

00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:15.590
pushed into the industrial era, and now into
the digital era. Now midnight is the time

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:19.769
when we maybe check Facebook for the last
time or think about sending that last email.

00:55:19.769 --> 00:55:27.359
So not only has the duration of our sleep
decreased through the influence of the modern

00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:31.770
times but also when we're sleeping has been
dramatically shifted, too.

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:38.619
[Rhonda]: Right. I know I've made some changes
a few years ago to my place, where now, I

00:55:38.619 --> 00:55:42.960
was telling you, I have Philips hue lights
that turn on red light. And they come on actually

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.299
quite early. They come on around 5 p.m. In
fact, when we have visitors, they start to

00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:51.059
go crazy when sunset, and it's like red, and
they're like getting sleepy, you know. It's

00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:55.410
like, "Why is it so dark in here? Can we turn
the lights on?" And it's like, "No, because

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:57.960
that's what you should...You're supposed to
be getting the sleepy right now. You're supposed

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:03.809
to be...It's 6:00, 6:30." Well, depending
on what time of year it is, you know, "The

00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:06.420
sun is setting. You should be getting sleepy."
It's phenomenal.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.579
[Matt]: Yeah. It's one of the few triggers.

00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:10.220
[Rhonda]: Yeah, it really works.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.940
[Matt]: Temperature is the other key trigger
that...I think that's probably, you know,

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:18.019
in the past three years, that's what we've
really understood, is that temperature is

00:56:18.019 --> 00:56:24.769
as powerful a trigger of sleep organization
and sleep depth as light is.

00:56:24.769 --> 00:56:25.859
[Rhonda]: And sleep depth.

00:56:25.859 --> 00:56:32.650
[Matt]: And sleep depth as well. So what typically
happens is that, for you to fall asleep and

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:38.140
stay asleep, your body needs to drop its core
temperature by about 1 degree Celsius or about

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:43.250
sort of 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. And that's
the reason that you will always find it easier

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:47.990
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than
too hot, because the room that's too cold

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:52.599
is at least taking you in the right thermal
direction for good sleep. It's dragging your

00:56:52.599 --> 00:56:55.640
body down into a cooler realm.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.269
And when you look at these hunter-gatherer
tribes, you know, the San in Namibia, you

00:57:01.269 --> 00:57:05.630
can look at them, whose way of life hasn't
changed for thousands of years, they don't

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:11.039
go to bed and necessarily as immediately as
the sun goes down. They usually go to bed

00:57:11.039 --> 00:57:16.339
maybe sort of 8 or 9 in the evening, several
hours after sundown.

00:57:16.339 --> 00:57:22.099
But when they do start to go to bed is when
the temperature drops. As the sun drops, the

00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:26.500
ambient temperature remains for a little while,
and then it starts to drop, too, as the land

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:31.089
cools, and the ambient temperature cools with
the land because darkness has ensued. That

00:57:31.089 --> 00:57:35.510
seems to be a thermal trigger for them getting
sleepy and falling asleep.

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:41.839
Then, when you look at when they wake up,
they typically wake up 15 to 20 minutes before

00:57:41.839 --> 00:57:49.170
dawn. So it's not light that seems to be necessarily
the trigger instigating the awakening. It's

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.690
actually the rise of temperature.

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:53.349
[Rhonda]: And that's on a circadian rhythm,
right?

00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:58.229
[Matt]: And that's on a circadian...So what
is training us to our natural sleep rhythms

00:57:58.229 --> 00:58:04.869
is both temperature and light. So this comes
back to our modern homes, where we go into

00:58:04.869 --> 00:58:10.569
offices, and we don't necessarily have the
rising warmth of the day to activate us because

00:58:10.569 --> 00:58:15.380
we're set at 70 degrees, and then we go home,
and our thermostats are set at 70 degrees

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:21.470
again or whatever your standard temperature
is. And we don't get the thermal cue through

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:26.740
our bodies to say, "It's time for sleep."
So no wonder our sleep is worse.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:33.109
And if you manipulate people's core temperature,
and you can do this through showers, hot baths,

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:39.499
you can do it through saunas, but there's
a great experiment where they essentially

00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:44.819
designed what it looked like a kind of a wetsuit.
And throughout the wetsuit were all of these

00:58:44.819 --> 00:58:51.359
plastic veins running through them. And the
researchers were able to exquisitely control,

00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:56.769
through water at different temperatures, the
temperature of any part of your body. So would

00:58:56.769 --> 00:59:01.489
I want to warm your hands and your feet? Or
would I want to warm your core?

00:59:01.489 --> 00:59:07.249
And so what they were able to do is...These
people I mean talk about being stripped of

00:59:07.249 --> 00:59:10.309
your dignity, you know. You get into this
like wetsuit, you zip it up, and you say,

00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:15.240
"Right, I'm off to bed." In you go. And then
they would manipulate core body temperature

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.759
exquisitely. And lo and behold, when they
dropped the core body temperature, they were

00:59:19.759 --> 00:59:26.029
able to induce sleep quicker, and the amount
of deep sleep, what we call slow-wave sleep,

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:30.940
which is deep non-REM sleep or Stages 3 &amp; 4,
also called slow-wave sleep because of these

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:38.190
big powerful slow brainwaves, that deep, rich
non-REM sleep was increased somewhere between

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:40.829
about 10% to 20%, which is non-trivial.

00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:41.829
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:46.380
[Matt]: Then they said, "Well," this is in
sort of, you know, young healthy people, "what

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.539
about people with insomnia, and people who
are older." Because older people struggle

00:59:50.539 --> 00:59:55.190
with sleep and, of course, insomnia. And they
were able to get even greater of mileage out

00:59:55.190 --> 01:00:01.220
of the thermal manipulation with those cohorts,
too. So I think it's a very interesting intervention

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.710
possibility to try and augment and manipulate
human sleep.

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:08.779
[Rhonda]: So do you think those things, like
the chili pads that are out there, you think

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:10.839
those can potentially help deep sleep?

01:00:10.839 --> 01:00:15.140
[Matt]: Yeah. I don't know of any data from
them yet. All I know is the experimental data

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:20.489
that we've looked at, you know, with manipulation
of body temperature. They did this in rats

01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:26.599
awhile back, by the way, which is they would
warm their paws. And when they warm their

01:00:26.599 --> 01:00:29.339
paws, the rats fell asleep quicker and stayed
asleep.

01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:33.299
And you think, hang on a second, you just
told me that you need to cool the body, but

01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:38.039
you're talking about warming them up. And
this is the reason why probably saunas work,

01:00:38.039 --> 01:00:42.380
hot baths work, and showers work for the opposite
reason that most people believe them to work.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.960
You think, you know, I get out of a hot bath,
and I'm nice and toasty, I get into bed, and

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.230
I fall asleep faster.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:53.580
That's not true. What happens is that you
get into the bath, you get massive vasodilation.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:01:00.009
All of the vessels open up on the surface
of your skin. That draws, it almost charms,

01:01:00.009 --> 01:01:06.220
the blood out from the core of your body to
the surface. And your skin and your hands

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:11.230
and your feet especially act like these wonderful
thermal radiators. And they dissipate the

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:17.000
heat. So you get out of the bath, and your
core body temperature actually plummets, and

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.130
that's what you need for good sleep.

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:22.480
And I suspect this the reason that saunas...I
mean, I think you've had experience it too.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.810
[Rhonda]: Yeah, definitely. It definitely
affects my sleep. And going from a sauna into,

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:32.460
like, an ice cold shower and then doing kind
of like going back and forth really really

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:38.339
helps sleep. And I've used that also going
to other countries. Getting in the sauna and

01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:42.119
going the cold shower and then back in the
sauna.

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.119
[Matt]: And triggering it back.

01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:44.119
[Rhonda]: It helps with my jet lag.

01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:45.119
[Matt]: Yeah.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:47.319
[Rhonda]: I mean, it's an end of too, because
my husband experience the same thing. But,

01:01:47.319 --> 01:01:49.940
you know, there's definitely something...there's
something there. And what you're saying absolutely

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.769
happens. The sauna increases vasodilation,
blood flow goes to the skin, and so dissipation

01:01:54.769 --> 01:01:56.869
of heat. That all makes perfect sense. So
hot bath...

01:01:56.869 --> 01:02:00.719
[Matt]: I'm just gonna, very quickly, just
grab a quick mouthful of water.

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:08.180
[Rhonda]: The hot baths and hot showers are
good before bed.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:15.450
[Matt]: Yeah. And I'll just mention, I think
one thing that's I think fascinated me, though,

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:22.849
about the benefit of exercise...so exercise
also has a really nice, powerful benefit on

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:28.299
sleep, although it's a two-way street, and
remind me to talk about that, in a good way.

01:02:28.299 --> 01:02:33.319
But something else has occurred to me with
saunas, too. And I was thinking about this,

01:02:33.319 --> 01:02:38.750
because I think I know that you're a fan.
I think you've mentioned this before. One

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:44.910
of the ways that you can induce sleep is that
you can increase a lot of the immune factors,

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:50.989
things like cytokines, you know, things also
like TNF-alpha, or...

01:02:50.989 --> 01:02:52.819
[Rhonda]: IL-6.

01:02:52.819 --> 01:03:00.319
[Matt]: IL-6. IL-1 even more so, but IL-6
is part of that equation, too. We've known

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:06.989
this for some time that if you infect an animal,
it will create an immune antibody response,

01:03:06.989 --> 01:03:13.779
a cytokine cascade. Those cytokines have a
direct communication pathway into brain structures,

01:03:13.779 --> 01:03:20.960
including things like the hypothalamus, which
regulates sleep. And it's that immune cascade

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.260
that is actually a trigger in dialing up the
amount of sleep. So when animals get sick,

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.489
just like when humans get sick, the thing
that you want to do is just curl up in bed

01:03:30.489 --> 01:03:31.489
and go to sleep.

01:03:31.489 --> 01:03:36.920
And in fact, you get sleepier as a consequence
of being infected. Why is that? The reason

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.799
is because there is nothing better...Sleep
is the Swiss Army knife of health, that no

01:03:41.799 --> 01:03:43.339
matter what the ailment...

01:03:43.339 --> 01:03:44.339
[Rhonda]: That's so cool. I don't know...

01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:48.440
[Matt]: You know, there is something more
than likely in the armament of sleep toolbox,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.900
sort of as it were, that will deal with that,
and so, and I promise I'm not going off an

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.839
attention here, so the idea is that these
immune factors are sleep-instigating.

01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:00.619
[Rhonda]: This is awesome. Wow.

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:05.040
[Matt]: They are sleep, sort of, you know,
they're somnogenic, you know. Somno-sleep-genic

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.749
increased genesis improvement. So what I've
been thinking about is whether or not the

01:04:11.749 --> 01:04:18.079
sauna, the benefit of the sauna, is both thermal,
but is also, by way of this powerful immune

01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:19.079
pathway...

01:04:19.079 --> 01:04:20.079
[Rhonda]: It does.

01:04:20.079 --> 01:04:21.079
[Matt]: ...that you get this.

01:04:21.079 --> 01:04:22.079
[Rhonda]: That's phenomenal.

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:26.309
[Matt]: And I've read some of the studies,
and I'm blanking on his name, you will probably

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:33.730
remember his name, they've looked at some
of essentially sort of, you know, the sauna-induced

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:34.730
immune responses.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:36.660
[Rhonda]: Yeah, so that Charles Raison has
been doing that work.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660
[Matt]: Thank you. Yeah.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.660
[Rhonda]: Yes.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.660
[Matt]: Thank you. Brilliant. Yeah, so I've
read some of Charles's papers.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.019
[Rhonda]: Yeah, we had him on the podcast.
He was talking about how the sauna induces

01:04:43.019 --> 01:04:47.799
IL-6 and some of that stuff. And the same
thing that happens with exercise. So that's...

01:04:47.799 --> 01:04:50.710
[Matt]: Yes. So that's why I mentioned exercise,
which is that I think...

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.009
[Rhonda]: Wow, that's so fascinating.

01:04:52.009 --> 01:04:55.710
[Matt]: So now we're all starting to sort
of, you know, realize how the sleep system

01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:01.079
is augmented, one of those paths, you know,
is light. The other is darkness. The other

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:07.089
is temperature. But here's a fourth one. The
immune system. And we know that you can inject,

01:05:07.089 --> 01:05:12.250
you know, some of these cytokines into animals,
and you can almost induce sleep. It's that

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.250
powerful.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:14.250
[Rhonda]: That's so cool.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.460
[Matt]: So now I'm starting to think, I wonder
if some of the sauna-based benefits and some

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.710
of the exercise benefits, because when you
exercise, you also typically get some of these

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:27.530
pro-inflammatory cytokines that sort of get
released to perhaps deal with some of, you

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:32.670
know, the essential distress. And, you know,
I think we've both spoken about this that...

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:36.849
[Rhonda]: So that way, like if you're exercising
a lot, you do seem to require more sleep,

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:37.849
or you sleep more?

01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:39.640
[Matt]: Well, we don't know that, but that's
my current theory...

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640
[Rhonda]: Yeah, it's a great hypothesis.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.310
[Matt]: ...which is that, you know, you possibly...

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:43.950
[Rhonda]: Are you gonna test that? That's
awesome.

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:47.609
[Matt]: Yeah, we're going to test. So we've
just actually been looking at studying not

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:53.549
with exercise or with saunas but we've had
been looking at sleep and pain. And when you

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:58.920
deprive people of sleep, you get a chronic
release of these pro-inflammatory cytokines,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:04.900
which is not a good situation. Acute, great,
somnogenic, good for the body. But chronic

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:11.029
long-term, we're starting to piece together
a brain-body-sleep-pain interaction, which

01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:15.099
I think has, we haven't published this yet,
but should have marked implications for the

01:06:15.099 --> 01:06:19.220
hospital environment. Because the one place
where you do not get a good night of sleep,

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.339
where it's architected against the night of
sleep, is the one place where you need sleep

01:06:23.339 --> 01:06:27.729
the most, and it's usually the one place where
you are in pain the most.

01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:32.809
And I want a revolution to happen regarding
sleep in hospitals. And I'm desperately trying

01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:38.390
to work with folks. For example, the NHS in
the United Kingdom, National Healthcare System

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:43.849
there. I would love to work with any hospital
system in the U.S. to solve this crisis, I

01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:45.749
think, of sleep in the hospital environment.

01:06:45.749 --> 01:06:52.369
But, to come back to your point, this is a
great experiment to do. You know, is exercise-induced

01:06:52.369 --> 01:06:58.299
acute inflammation, and is sort of, you know,
heat/shock sensitive, you know, induction

01:06:58.299 --> 01:07:03.539
of immune responses by way of saunas or hot
baths, are those a pathway triggering good

01:07:03.539 --> 01:07:08.329
sleep? And if so, can we find novel therapeutics
for, you know...

01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:11.519
[Rhonda]: I'll put you in touch with Dr. Jari
Laukkanen too. He's in Finland.

01:07:11.519 --> 01:07:12.519
[Matt]: Okay.

01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:13.789
[Rhonda]: He's, like, the leading researcher
on saunas and...

01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:15.519
[Matt]: Has he done some of the stuff on longevity?

01:07:15.519 --> 01:07:18.960
[Rhonda]: He's the guy doing all the longevity,
Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease...

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.529
[Matt]: Yes, yeah, yeah. I've read some of
his work. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:23.869
[Rhonda]: Yeah, I mean, and he's a friend
of mine as well. So I'll put you in touch

01:07:23.869 --> 01:07:24.869
with him.

01:07:24.869 --> 01:07:25.869
[Matt]: Okay.

01:07:25.869 --> 01:07:26.869
[Rhonda]: Because that would be really cool
if you guys could...

01:07:26.869 --> 01:07:30.210
[Matt]: If we can start tracking their sleep,
you know, and see perhaps. And you can sort

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:34.730
of put this into a statistical sort of triangulation,
which is called the mediation analysis. And

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:39.509
you could see, you know, what's causing that
longevity benefit. Because we know for example

01:07:39.509 --> 01:07:43.750
that the shorter your sleep the shorter your
life, that short sleep predicts all-cause

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:48.069
mortality. It's also probably one of the most
significant lifestyle factors determining

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:52.109
whether or not you'll develop Alzheimer's
disease. And all of these things I know have

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:56.969
been linked to, for example, sauna, which
is longevity, decreased susceptibility to

01:07:56.969 --> 01:08:02.279
development of dementia and cognitive decline,
is part of that...I'm not trying to say it's

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:05.690
all about sleep. But, the part of it about
sleep, you know...

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:09.619
[Rhonda]: Really, you know, one of my major
interest is aging, increasing health span,

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:15.289
as well as performance, without the trade
off, and every time I always come back to

01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:19.850
sleep. The studies, I mean, it just constantly
coming back in my face how important sleep

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.680
is for all those things.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.859
[Matt]: It's the superordinate lever that
transacts all health benefits, you know. It's

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:32.570
the tide that rises all of the health boats.
And I think it's wonderful that folks, you

01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:38.330
know, here in Silicon Valley are going after,
you know, individual pathways of disease,

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:42.770
trying to manipulate, you know, immune pathways
or trying to manipulate mTOR for sort of,

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.990
you know, longevity.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:50.160
But I think what's been missing in this equation
is that there is, you know, an Archimedes

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.190
lever here. There is one superordinate node,
that if you pull that lever, all of the other

01:08:55.190 --> 01:09:00.840
pathways are instigated, activated. And that
superordinate node or lever is this thing

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.210
called sleep. You know, there is no physiological
system that we've been able to measure that

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:10.090
isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you
get it, or demonstrably impaired when you

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:11.090
don't get enough.

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.180
[Rhonda]: Right. I kind of wanted to go back,
because you were talking about the effects

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:21.609
on how the immune system can be, you know...what
did you call it? I mean, it induces sleep.

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:22.620
[Matt]: Somnogenic.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.330
[Rhonda]: Somnogenic, yes. How it's somnogenic.
So interesting. I had no idea that the cytokines

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:34.000
were responsible for that, and it makes perfect
sense. So, anyway. But also, so the opposite

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.450
is true where sleep also affects the immune
system, or a lack of sleep also, right?

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:38.450
[Matt]: It does, yeah.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:42.630
[Rhonda]: And that is something, you know...Your
immune system is the first line of defense

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:45.920
against, even pretty much everything, right:
cancer, viruses, bacteria.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920
[Matt]: Yeah.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.800
[Rhonda]: And I think in your book, you were
talking about the effects on, some studies,

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.790
on natural killer T cells. I mean, I was just,
like, blown away by some of the numbers.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:10:00.890
[Matt]: This is a frightening study. So it's
done by my colleague Mike Erwin. You take

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:04.620
a group of individuals, and you're not going
to deprive them of sleep for an entire night.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:09.910
You're simply going to limit them, restrict
them to four hours of sleep for one single

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:15.020
night. And then we're going to measure the
amount of reduction in natural killer cell

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020
activity.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.500
So just to take a step back, natural killer
cells are a critical part of your immune defense

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:28.050
arsenal. And today, both you and I and everyone
listening to this podcast, we all have cancer

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:33.120
cells that have emerged in our bodies. But
typically, what prevents those cells from

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.580
becoming this disease that we call cancer
is, in part, these natural killer cells. So

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:44.870
what you wish for is a virile set of these
sort of immune assassins, these sort of James-Bond-like,

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:49.580
you know, that they will annihilate these
foreign organisms. You want a virile of those

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.530
at all times.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:57.840
So take a group of healthy people, limit them
to four hours of sleep for one night, and

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.690
what you see is a 70% reduction in natural
killer cell activity, seven zero. That is

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:08.690
an alarming state of immune-deficiency. And
it happens quickly essentially after one bad

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:13.580
night of sleep. So you can imagine, you know,
the state of your immune system after weeks,

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.020
if not years, of insufficient sleep. And it's
now the reason I think that we probably are

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:24.640
finding, at the epidemiological level, significant
links between short sleep duration, not getting

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.700
enough sleep, defined as six hours or less,
and your risk for the development of numerous

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.310
forms of cancer. Currently, that list includes
cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate,

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:35.420
cancer of the breast.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.030
And the link between the lack of sleep and
cancer is now so strong that, recently, the

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:45.780
World Health Organization decided to classify
any form of nighttime shift work as a probable

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:51.510
carcinogen. So in other words jobs, that could
induce cancer because of a disruption of your

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.510
sleep-wake rhythms.

01:11:52.510 --> 01:12:00.120
So, you know, that's the immune system in
cancer. But it doesn't stop there as well.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.861
Another great study that was done by Aric
Prather [SP], who is over at UCSF, another

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:09.670
good colleague of mine, he did this brilliant
study that I write about in the book. He basically

01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:14.470
measured the sleep of a group of healthy people
for a week before using these wristwatches

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:21.100
that are accurate. And then he quarantined
them in a hotel, in a set of hotel rooms.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:26.880
And then he proceeded to stuff up their nose,
squirt up their nose, rhinovirus, essentially,

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.140
a flu virus. And then he quarantined them
for a week. And he measured how many of them

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:38.010
became infected. And he was measuring all
sorts of stuff. He collected every ounce of

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:42.600
snot that they blew out of their nose, all
of the mucus, everything.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.990
And what he found was that those people who
were getting five hours of sleep or less in

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:54.540
the week before they came in and were infected
relative to those who are getting seven hours

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.900
of sleep or more, those people who were getting
five hours of sleep in the week before they

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:05.120
got infected were four times more likely to
end up developing the flu than those people

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.460
who are getting seven hours or more.

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:12.500
The final nail in that sort of immune coffin
for me is a study that was done by Eve Van

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:17.120
Cauter, who's a wonderful endocrinologist.
And I'd love, by the way, to speak about sleeping

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.150
diabetes and glucose regulation, too. She's
doing some great work there. But she did a

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:28.001
great study. She looked at the amount of sleep
that you were getting in the week before you

01:13:28.001 --> 01:13:30.480
get your flu shot.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.500
And what she found is that if you're getting
sort of less than five or six hours of sleep

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:41.260
in the week before you get your flu shot,
you only produce half of the normal antibody

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:47.620
response, rendering that flu shot largely
useless, which stuns me that, you know...And

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:54.890
here's his work technology could revolutionize
healthcare. You know, what if Kaiser, you

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:59.030
know, had access to a sleep tracker or had
its own sleep tracker. And Kaiser, for those

01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:02.530
not familiar, is a health care provider here
in the United States.

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:07.940
But what if, you know, any healthcare provider
or system in any country had access to your

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:14.000
sleep in a non-Big-Brother way. And it was
tracking your sleep. And through an app, it

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.830
would say, "Hey, you've had a great week of
sleep this weekend in December," or "this

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:24.680
week in November. Now is the time to come
and get your flu shot. I've listed out three

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.640
appointments. Just tap on the one that you
want."

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.330
Or it says, "Look, I know that you scheduled
yourself for a flu shot. You haven't quite

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:37.080
got the good sleep that you need this past
week. Let's try again next week." And if you

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.890
get the sleep next week, then you give them
access to getting the flu shot. Because otherwise,

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:48.190
we're wasting money. And the flu, you know,
cost the United States, the flu season cost

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:53.940
the United States about $10 billion directly
in terms of healthcare burden. Even if I could

01:14:53.940 --> 01:15:00.120
nudge that by just 1% or 2% by understanding
people's sleep and helping architect a system

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.860
that co-opts around sleep time and management,
we could save hundreds of millions of dollars

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.270
to the U.S. economy.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:12.600
[Rhonda]: Wow. Speaking of the flu, I think
I even told you this in a previous conversation,

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:18.451
like, I almost never get sick. Maybe once
a year, I'll get a little runny nose for a

01:15:18.451 --> 01:15:22.970
couple of days. I've got a really good immune
system generally speaking. But this last year,

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:29.130
I had a baby, and along with having a baby
comes sleep deprivation. And there's absolutely

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:34.280
nothing I can do about it. I mean, you have
to wake up multiple times to feed your baby.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.570
And so that's what I was doing.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:43.650
And, I mean, I got the flu. I got a cold.
I mean, I was sick, like, every month. I mean,

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:49.090
it was crazy. I've never experienced...of
course, my baby luckily was getting all my

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:53.070
antibodies and didn't get sick, thankfully.
But it was, like, completely connected to

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:54.070
my sleep.

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:55.070
[Matt]: It's impressive, isn't'?

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:56.070
[Rhonda]: Yeah. I mean...

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:59.050
[Matt]: It's the same wisdom that, you know,
mothers would sort of say, you know, that

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.990
speech. You're getting sick a lot. Are you
sleeping enough? You know, and I've often

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:09.170
thought that people like me, sleep scientists,
all I'm really doing is putting the data behind

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:13.670
everything that your mother and Shakespeare
ever told you about sleep. You know, I'm just

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:19.430
putting data. They have knew it all long before
the data came along. But you see that exact

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:26.440
same thing in parents. Sickness is rife in
those early years. You see it in medical resident.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.640
I think a friend of yours, who I enjoy this,
too, a lot, Peter Attia, was saying this about

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.270
when he was in medical residency, and you
see this in residence, too, you know, sickness

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:42.120
rates, you know, increased dramatically. There
is weight gain, the diabetic profile, you

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:47.900
know, in terms of their ability to manage
glucose becomes markedly impaired. We know

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.800
that testosterone in men plummets when sleep
gets short. In fact, men, who are sleeping

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.350
five hours or less will have a level of testosterone
which is that of someone 10 years their senior.

01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:59.350
[Rhonda]: Wow.

01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:02.690
[Matt]: Which, in other words, a lack of sleep
will age men by a decade in terms of that

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.450
aspect of virility and wellness.

01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:06.880
[Rhonda]: How quickly does that happen? Do
you know? Is that like...?

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.690
[Matt]: So you can see that within almost
days once you start to dose people on that.

01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:16.940
It comes about quite rapidly. You can see
hormonal change. I mean, I think that's what...if

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.800
there is a major access...oh, sorry, axis
within the body that is altered by sleep it

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.650
is the hormonal axis. I think that principally,
through the root of the autonomic nervous

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:34.270
system, that is the lens through which almost
all sleep and sleep deprivation effects can

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:35.270
be viewed.

01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:40.480
And I'm just starting to write up a theory
paper about this, which is an encompassing

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.130
theory about sleep deprivation within the
human brain and the body. And I think there

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:50.890
is a common, central dictating governing pathway,
which is the autonomic nervous system through

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:55.310
which there is a manipulation of many of the
hormone systems, which then give rise to the

01:17:55.310 --> 01:18:00.090
whole host of deficits that we see by way
of a lack of sleep, which then ultimately,

01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:04.860
through chronic exposure of sleep loss, give
rise to all of the diseases that we know are

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:10.230
associated with a lack of sleep. And every
single disease that is killing us in the developed

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:14.120
world has causal and significant links to
a lack of sleep.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:20.850
[Rhonda]: One that I'm particularly interested
in is Alzheimer's disease. It's something

01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:25.470
that I've been researching for a while. I'm
about to get published thankfully soon.

01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:26.470
[Matt]: Congratulations.

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:27.470
[Rhonda]: Thank you.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:28.470
[Matt]: Was this a review paper?

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.470
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:30.470
[Matt]: Oh, please send it to me.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:35.251
[Rhonda]: And it happens to do with a gene
called apoe4. And I found out that I have

01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:40.250
one copy of this of this allele. And when
I found that out years ago, I was like...it's

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:45.110
probably the biggest risk factor for late-onset
on Alzheimer's disease besides age.

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:50.450
[Matt]: Yes. So I think one of those alleles,
it's about sorts of two to threefold risk.

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:51.450
[Rhonda]: Two to threefold.

01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:52.810
[Matt]: If you have two of them, it's like
an 8 to 12.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:57.700
[Rhonda]: Yeah, it's, like, pretty bad. And
25% of the population in the United States

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:02.540
has at least one allele. So it's definitely...And
just because you have it doesn't mean you're

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.860
necessarily gonna get Alzheimer's disease.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:04.860
[Matt]: That's right.

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:09.430
[Rhonda]: Not everyone has it. But there's
a huge interaction with, you know, diet and

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:15.980
lifestyle. Probably the biggest lifestyle
interaction with this gene is sleep. And so

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:22.020
that was that was where I became very interested
in how sleep affects the brain, and how it

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:26.060
affects, you know, Alzheimer's disease, and
all that. So I'd love to kind of talk a little

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.060
bit about that.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:32.490
[Matt]: Yeah, so we've been doing a lot of
this work. We have a large research program

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:37.440
here at UC Berkeley at the Sleep Center that
is devoted to aging and Alzheimer's disease.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:45.250
And we've been very fortunate to get many
grants from the NIH here to study this. I

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:51.720
think that the story is fascinating because
it's a bi-directional relationship between

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:57.270
sleep. And the pathology that we know is associated
with Alzheimer's disease.

01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:03.380
So in Alzheimer's disease, there are at least
two protein culprits that we believe are underlying

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:08.120
of the brain pathology that seems to create
this thing called Alzheimer's. One of them

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:14.060
is a sticky toxic protein called beta amyloid
that accumulates in these clumps outside of

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:20.850
brain cells. And that creates these amyloid
plaques that seem to be correlated with your

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:24.830
disease risk and disease severity.

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:29.760
The other is a protein that we know probably
less about, which is a protein called tau

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:36.630
protein. And that sits inside of cells. And
it creates a support structure for communicating

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:41.420
and funneling many of the critical ingredients
up and down your nerve cells to keep them

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:48.170
in rude health. And during Alzheimer's disease,
that protein starts to sort of fall apart

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:55.960
and dismantle. And you get these sort of tau
tangles. And the structure of the nerve cell

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:01.420
and its ability to transport all of the ingredients
that it needs to operate starts to collapse

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.760
and fails like a tunnel collapsing down.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:15.380
So one of the discoveries that we made back
in 2013 was that I was looking at the distribution

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:20.050
of this sticky toxic protein called amyloid
in the human brain. And what's fascinating

01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:25.820
is that it doesn't build up in the brain in
homogeneously. Amyloid builds up in some parts

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:31.370
of the brain far more severely and early in
the course of Alzheimer's disease. And other

01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:38.500
parts actually remain completely uninvaded
by this thing called amyloid. In fact, parts

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:43.780
of the motor cortex, for example, or parts
of the visual cortex, you see almost no amyloid

01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:48.360
in our Alzheimer's patients. And that's probably
the reason why their motor functions and their

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.140
vision is unchanged.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.080
But one of the earliest places were beta amyloid
builds up and then built up most severely

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.740
in late stages is back, again, in that medial
prefrontal cortex that sits right there in

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:08.390
between the eyes. Why was I interested in
that? I was interested because when we were

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:13.370
doing studies where we would map, with all
of these electrodes over your head, we would

01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:16.670
map the deep sleep that you were having.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:20.780
And we could do some clever mathematical modeling
of those deep sleep brain waves. And we could

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.630
try to triangulate where was the electrical
epicenter of those electrical deep brain waves

01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:31.270
of deep sleep. And it seems as though they
come from all over the brain, but the principal

01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:36.270
epicenter that generates your deep sleep sits
right there in the middle part of the prefrontal

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:42.740
cortex. It is exactly the same part of the
brain that accumulates toxic beta amyloid

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.210
protein.

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:48.800
Then we've done studies, and other people
have done studies before us, that demonstrated,

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:54.780
as we age, our sleep gets worse. But just
any type of sleep. Especially that deep quality

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.490
of sleep that we know and we spoke about is
critical for saving and learning and retaining

01:23:00.490 --> 01:23:06.350
new memories. So all of these jigsaw pieces
started to get put together in my head. I

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:13.000
thought we need to do some studies. Is it
possible that the amount of amyloid that you

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.190
have in the brain in this sleep-generating
center, it should directly predict the deficit

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:23.700
in the amount of deep sleep that you get?
If it predicts the deficit in the amount of

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:29.570
deep sleep, it should predict the deficit
in your ability to hold on and retain new

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:34.750
memories, which is a hallmark cognitive feature
of Alzheimer's disease, difficulty learning,

01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:36.140
difficulty retaining.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:41.440
So we did the study, and it's exactly what
we found. The more beta amyloid that builds

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.230
up in this central frontal part of the brain,
the less the deep sleep that you have. The

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:53.790
less amyloid-related deep sleep that you had,
the more forgetful you were the next day rather

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:59.080
than the more that you remembered. So this
was the first part of the Alzheimer's sleep

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:04.650
equation, which is that Alzheimer's disease
attacks the deep-sleep-generating regions

01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:11.630
and you have a diminution of deep sleep, which,
in turn, blunts your learning and memory abilities

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:13.330
and you become more forgetful.

01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:20.411
A far more important discovery was made by
an another group, far more important than

01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:26.540
the one we made, which was essentially the
reverse direction, which was to say, "Rather

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:33.310
than amyloid sort of decreasing sleep, could
sleep actually decrease the amount of amyloid

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.310
that you get?"

01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:41.920
And this is a discovery that was made in rats
back in 2009, I believe, was the first evidence

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:49.660
that was published in science. A colleague,
[inaudible 01:24:09], who is out on the east

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:56.950
coast at the University of Rochester, and
she made two wonderful discoveries. The first

01:24:56.950 --> 01:25:01.120
was that we've known for a long time the body
has a waste sewage system called the lymphatic

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:07.430
system. But the brain doesn't have its own
lymphatic system. The lymphatic system does

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:13.970
not penetrate the brain. So where does all
of the garbage, the metabolic garbage go that

01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:17.850
your brain cells produce? Where is the sewage
system for the brain?

01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:22.770
And she discovered it. It's actually made
up of a set of cells called glial cells, which

01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:27.710
are these supporting brain cells. And so she
called it the glymphatic system rather than

01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:32.980
the lymphatic system. So your brain does have
its sewage system, this glymphatic system,

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:36.520
and that's the discovery that she made. Remarkable.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:43.370
Then, and I'm not quite sure what motivated
her to do this, she started to measure how

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:49.730
efficient that glymphatic, that waste system
was when the rats were awake and when the

01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:58.350
rats were asleep. And what she found was that
it's during deep sleep that these brain cells

01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:03.710
actually shrink by almost 60% when we sleep.
Blows my mind.

01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:04.710
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:08.090
[Matt]: It's almost like, you know, all of
the buildings in New York all of a sudden

01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:13.190
shrink, and it leaves these much greater,
large areas for the cleaning crews to come

01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:18.641
in and clean up all of the metabolic detritus
of the city's activity during the day. It's

01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:24.550
exactly what happens during sleep. And the
cleaning solution is what we call cerebrospinal

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:32.960
fluid. And through a pulsatile mechanism during
sleep, you get a 10% to 20% increase in the

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:40.390
bathing of cerebrospinal fluid through the
brain, which washes away all of the metabolic

01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:46.140
byproducts that have been building up. One
of those metabolic byproducts is beta amyloid.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:53.190
And, in fact, if you deprive those rats of
that deep sleep, you immediately get an increase

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:56.020
in toxic beta amyloid.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:00.910
So now we've linked these two. I'm sorry it's
a long story. But if you're not getting

01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:06.310
Enough deep sleep at night, you're not giving
yourself the chance for the kind of good night

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:12.190
and sleep clean process to remove the beta
amyloid. So more beta amyloid builds up. Where

01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:16.970
does it build up? Tragically, in the very
same regions of the brain that generate the

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:22.250
deep sleep that you need to clear out the
toxic amyloid. So you start getting less deep

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:27.590
sleep, so you get more toxic protein, more
toxic protein, less deep sleep, less deep

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:33.550
sleep. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, and
it's a nonlinear exponential curve.

01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:37.220
If you look at how amyloid builds up in the
brain, and if you look at the trajectory of

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:43.880
Alzheimer's disease, it is a nonlinear exponential
curve. It fits exactly what the sleep-dependent

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.571
model of amyloid clearance would predict.
If you're not getting sufficient sleep, that's

01:27:48.571 --> 01:27:53.240
the reason why now insufficient sleep seems
to be one of the most significant lifestyle

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.400
factors determining that.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.950
Now you could say, by the way, those studies
were in rats, and you deprived from the sleep

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:05.940
for one night. What about humans? Like, surely...Well,
the study has now been done. Great study done

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:13.990
out of Wash U by a team of scientists. They're
led by David Holtzman. And they took a group

01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:18.980
of humans, and they did this very clever method
where they deprive them of deep sleep but

01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.950
they didn't deprive them of sleep.

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:26.920
And you think, it sounds paradoxical. I can
play you these auditory tones. Now this is

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:31.670
not like the memory reactivation where you
play a tone and then you leave the brain alone

01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:36.010
for a while. Here, I'm just going to keep
playing tones to your brain, really sort of

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:41.340
annoying tones. But I can play them at a level
that doesn't wake you up, but it lifts you

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.390
out of deep sleep and keeps you in shallow
sleep.

01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:50.460
So what's delightful about this method is
that I can selectively excise one type of

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:55.940
sleep, deep sleep, but I don't wake you up.
So there's no stress of awakening. You are

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.510
asleep for the same amount of time, but the
quality of sleep is decreased.

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:01.920
[Rhonda]: Can street noise do that?

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.340
[Matt]: We don't know. Although I will come
back to that when we speak about hopefully

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:15.470
sleep appetite regulation, sleep glucose regulation,
and sleep in low socio-economic cultures...

01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:16.710
[Rhonda]: This is a little terrifying.

01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:20.190
[Matt]: And I think that it's possible. I
think there's other factors that link poor

01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:25.531
sleep in low SES, socioeconomic backgrounds.
Is noise pollution one of them? I actually

01:29:25.531 --> 01:29:32.240
think it is. Untested as yet. But what they
did with these human participants, they selectively

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.540
remove deep sleep while keeping them asleep
so total sleep time has not changed. And then,

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.890
in the morning, they woke them up, they rolled
them over, and they did a spinal cord puncture,

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:48.170
a lumbar puncture, and they measured the cerebrospinal
fluid that was populated within the spinal

01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:52.420
cord, which also goes around the brain. And
you can measure the amount of beta amyloid,

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.040
which is a reflection of perhaps how much
amyloid is there within the brain.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:02.440
After one night of essentially a loss of deep
sleep, you saw an immediate rise in the amount

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:08.130
of beta amyloid. So it is a causal manipulation.
That insufficient sleep in rodents and in

01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:11.080
humans will lead to a rise in beta amyloid.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.570
[Rhonda]: Yeah. I think it was like 25% to
30%.

01:30:13.570 --> 01:30:14.570
[Matt]: It was.

01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:19.090
[Rhonda]: Yeah, it was definitely...So, of
course, that's all I could think about the

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:20.620
past nine months...

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.620
[Matt]: Showing that, yeah.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.620
[Rhonda]: And the buildup of amyloid.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.530
[Matt]: You know, I would tell you, that's
the last thing you should think about. You

01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:30.190
know, try not to worry too much about it,
you know, because it's not to say to diminish

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:34.620
the loss of sleep but simply to say that worrying
about it is not gonna do you any good.

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.620
[Rhonda]: Of course.

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:41.470
[Matt]: But how do you tell that especially
to people who, you know, have one ApoE allele...apoe-4,

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:47.030
sorry, allele. What I would also say that's
important for people, if you know your ApoE

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:54.910
status, and if you are apoe-4, be mindful
of snoring as well. Because people who are

01:30:54.910 --> 01:31:01.900
apoe-4-positive, they also have a significantly
elevated risk of a sleep disorder that we

01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:06.640
call sleep apnea, which is sleep disorder
breathing, which is heavy snoring and a cessation

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.330
of breathing entirely. And then you gasp when
you wake up again.

01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:16.870
Heavy snoring sleep apnea is a killer. It
is an outright killer. It increases your risk

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:23.900
of basically everything you don't want: cardiovascular
disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity. It

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:29.350
also increases your risk of immediate death
through a higher risk of car accidents.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:34.690
But one of the other problems with sleep apnea
is that you don't get the amount of deep sleep

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:39.190
that you need. And you have hypoxic damage.
Because you stopped breathing, your oxygen

01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:45.160
saturation goes down. You get hypoxia damage
particularly in a region that is most sensitive

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.350
to it in the brain, which is, drumroll, the
hippocampus, the very same memory structure

01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:53.000
that is attacked in Alzheimer's disease.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.240
So now you can see why I appeal for this sensitivity
in this danger to sleep apnea. Because if

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.600
you are apoe-4, you're already at high risk
of Alzheimer's disease, you need to pay attention

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:11.330
to your sleep. If you start snoring, and you
have sleep apnea untreated, you will get less

01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:16.670
deep sleep. So you're compromising the thing
that you need to try and lower your amyloid

01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:20.080
risk to begin with, because you're going to
build up that amyloid, because you're not

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:25.760
going to get the amyloid clearance elsewhere
in the body, for example, in the liver. And

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.770
then where still the part of the brain that
is attacked severely by Alzheimer's disease

01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:34.730
and atrophies, which is the hippocampus, which
is why memory fades, is a part of the brain

01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:39.200
that is damaged when you stop breathing because
of oxygen desaturation.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:46.700
So, as an appeal, even if you are not apoe-4-positive,
but you are snoring, or you know someone who

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:53.040
is snoring, go and see your doctor and get
a sleep apnea test. It is potentially life-saving.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.870
[Rhonda]: Actually, I had a sleep apnea test
because of my night awakenings. I didn't know.

01:32:56.870 --> 01:33:02.770
It was, like, maybe I have apnea and I couldn't...And
so I'm having this terror. And of course,

01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:07.260
that wasn't it. I don't have sleep apnea.
But I didn't know about the connection between

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:09.520
apoe-4 and sleep apnea. That's terrible because...

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.600
[Matt]: It's quite a dramatic...

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.050
[Matt]: I mean, you can bind those two together.
It's a real...I mean, itâ€™s gasoline on an

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.050
already started fire.

01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:19.490
[Rhonda]: People with apoe-4 also don't repair
damage and their brain as well as people with

01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:20.490
apoe-3.

01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:21.490
[Matt]: They don't.

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:23.730
[Rhonda]: So you're talking about hypoxic
damage in addition, you know, there's sort

01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:25.930
of just this potentially compounding effect.

01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:31.220
[Matt]: And I think that's, you know, that's
part of the reason...I mean, so I have some

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:36.090
family members that have been associated with
Alzheimer's disease, one recently passed away.

01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:41.500
And it's been a big motivation for me personally.
I started, you know, 20 years ago. My PhD

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:45.500
was looking at people with degenerative dementia.
That's how I actually got into sleep, because

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.660
I was seeing these sleep abnormalities.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:55.180
And, you know, I'm so desperately trying to
find ways to help and to combat that incredible

01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:00.670
epidemic of dementia. And that's why we've
started to try and develop things like electrical

01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:06.650
brain stimulation methods, to try and help
actually augment human sleep, an electrically-supercharged

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:11.480
sleep, as it were, to see if we could give
back some healthy quality of deep sleep to

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:17.600
patients who are aging or those with dementia.
Can we essentially, you know, amplify the

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.760
amount of deep sleep? And in doing so, can
we salvage aspects of learning and memory?

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.960
But better still, could we actually start
to increase, you know, the amount of glymphatic

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.150
clearance of beta amyloid?

01:34:29.150 --> 01:34:33.700
Now I suspect that when the disease is in
play and you've been diagnosed in those late

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:40.410
stages, I don't know how much sleep is electrically
charged even as it maybe could help. What

01:34:40.410 --> 01:34:46.290
we're now trying to do in our studies is actually
retrospectively find out, is there a particular

01:34:46.290 --> 01:34:53.590
decade of life or decades of life when a decline
in sleep makes you most susceptible to then

01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:59.010
developing a lot more amyloid later in life?
In other words, we're trying to now identify

01:34:59.010 --> 01:35:02.600
these vulnerability windows during the lifespan.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.310
The reason I want to do that is, if I can
scientifically convince myself of a knowledge

01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:12.330
base of vulnerability sensitivity to insufficient
sleep, my guess is that it's just across the

01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:19.070
lifespan, it gives me a chance to know where
is the inflection point of not late-stage

01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:25.120
life treatment but early-life prevention.
Because that's what medicine has to do right

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:30.470
now, I think. We've done a good job at extending
lifespan but a miserable job at extending

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:37.200
health span. Lifespan is probably about treatment.
Health span is probably about prevention.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.110
Sleep needs to be part of that discussion.
And sleep is usually absent in many of these

01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:45.950
conversations for either lifespan or health
span despite it having a demonstrable impact

01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:50.880
on both. But my hope is that to be able to
find that sensitive time when your risk for

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.820
Alzheimer's development by way of insufficient
sleep is present. That's where I go in and

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.830
start augmenting your sleep with electrical
brain stimulation or other methods that we're

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.050
trying to develop as well.

01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:07.370
[Rhonda]: I think, at least for the apoe-4-positive
individuals, by the age of 40, the amyloid

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.550
plaques start to really...

01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:09.550
[Matt]: That's right, yup.

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:14.750
[Rhonda]: ...you know. So, to me, it would
seem that, you know, before 40, and certainly

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.801
when you hit 40, you better have your sleep
optimized.

01:36:16.801 --> 01:36:20.390
[Matt]: I would say before. I mean, we can
see the decline of deep sleep occurring in

01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:23.540
people in their 20s. That's when your deep
sleep starts to decline.

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.540
[Rhonda]: Wow.

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.180
[Matt]: Which is, you know, frightening, isn't
it? It's sad. And at that point, it's in the

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:33.040
mail. You know, by the time you're 50 years
old, you've lost about 50% of the deep sleep

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.150
that you are having when you are a young teenager.
By the time you're 70%, there's only about

01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:43.610
5%...sorry, by the time you're 70 years old,
there's only about 5% of your deep sleep left

01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:48.920
that you had when you were young and healthy.
By the time you're 80, we almost can't detect

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.630
any of these deep sleep brain waves anymore.

01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:56.050
[Rhonda]: Do you know if there is changes
in the way your core body temperature regulates

01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.050
with age as well?

01:36:57.050 --> 01:37:00.400
[Matt]: There is. So what happens with age
is that your circadian rhythm that we've spoke

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.950
about before...I'm just going to...So your
circadian rhythm that we spoke about before,

01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:10.360
which in healthy people is nice and high and
peaking during the day, lots of activity,

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:16.380
and then drops down at night, lots of inactivity,
lots of deep sleep, that sinusoidal wave starts

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:21.611
to flatten out as if someone has compressed
it as we get older. So our circadian rhythm

01:37:21.611 --> 01:37:28.010
gets weaker. So we get we feel sleepier during
the day and not as alert as we used to do,

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:33.990
but we don't feel as though we are as sleepy
at night. We're more awake at night because

01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:36.530
our circadian rhythm is blunted.

01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:42.130
And so I think that's another area for aging
intervention, is how can we modulate the circadian

01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:47.530
rhythm. And it turns out that it comes back
to light. So one of my colleagues in the Netherlands,

01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:53.630
Eus Van Someren, did a great study where he
installed circadian-regulating light in an

01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:59.530
elderly care home, you know, in a home where
you care for the elderly. And many of them

01:37:59.530 --> 01:38:04.450
had cognitive decline. And he's now done some
of these studies with people in with Alzheimer's

01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:06.890
disease in some of these care homes.

01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:12.800
And when you start to create appropriate lighting
in the internal environment in these homes,

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.530
which if you go into them, and I used to go
into them all the time during my PhD, these

01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:21.530
sort of care homes, and I would be testing
my patience and seeing my patients there,

01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:26.350
they were grim environments with dim light.
And these patients never got outside. They

01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:30.810
rarely had a window. And Eus Van Someren,
the scientist in the Netherlands, he was able

01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:37.300
to really produce this strong bout of light
during the day inside the care home and then

01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:42.920
drop out that light in the evening. And he
regularized their light. And he improved the

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.590
circadian rhythm. And he improved cognitive
outcome measures.

01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:47.590
[Rhonda]: Wow.

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:50.330
[Matt]: Cognition got better in these Alzheimer's
patients.

01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:51.330
[Rhonda]: That's cool.

01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:55.350
[Matt]: Now you can look at that same manipulation,
that same lighting hack, at the beginning

01:38:55.350 --> 01:39:01.490
of life. So in the neonatal intensive care
unit, what we used to have when we go in there,

01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:08.390
you just have constant light on all of the
time, dim light on 24 hours a day, which prevented

01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:14.090
those infants getting the signal of a regulating
24-hour light-dark cycle.

01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:20.310
If you regularized light in the neonatal intensive
care unit, so light during the day, darkness

01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:27.530
at night, in these studies, what you see is
basically almost a 50% to 60% increase in

01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:32.171
oxygen saturation within the blood of these
neonates in the intensive care unit. Weight

01:39:32.171 --> 01:39:36.400
gain increases dramatically. And they end
up exiting the neonatal intensive care unit

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.410
at about five weeks earlier than they would
otherwise.

01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:45.510
Circadian regulation of sleep leads to better
health outcomes. It does so in neonates. It

01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:51.010
does so in the elderly. So I think there is
all manner of sleep possible interventions

01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:55.550
that we can think about across the lifespan
when it comes to modifying disease risk at

01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:56.840
any stage of life.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:02.660
[Rhonda]: Yeah. And I think, at least as far
as I've, you know, understood from our conversation

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:09.010
thus far, some of the main things for prevention
in optimizing your sleep really are preventing

01:40:09.010 --> 01:40:13.940
that emotional stimulation, that anxiety,
and getting particularly a few hours before

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.510
bed, the bright LED exposure early in the
morning, and then not having the bright light

01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:23.980
exposure, you know, about four hours before
bedtime. And then the cold, like, having your

01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:28.220
body temperature go down. So, you know, whether
that's through something like, you know, having

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:32.890
a hot bath or a hot shower or even possibly
the chili pad, which I'm gonna actually experiment

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:33.890
with...

01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:34.890
[Matt]: Yeah.

01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:38.100
[Rhonda]: Because now I've been using this
Oura ring that I've been tracking my sleep.

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:45.820
By the way, do you know how accurate, like...So
it tells me, in my app, the light sleep, the

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:51.470
REM sleep, and deep sleep. And I know there's
nothing going in my brain measuring any sort

01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:54.490
of brainwaves. So it must be movement, right,
that...

01:40:54.490 --> 01:41:01.190
[Matt]: Yeah, I won't say specifically even
though I know the folks at Oura and I know

01:41:01.190 --> 01:41:08.670
the folks at almost all of the sleep-tracking
companies, most of them right now use a combination

01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:14.250
of your heart rate, which you can pick up
through the pulse waveform either on the wrist

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:20.760
or on the finger, or if it's a bed sensor,
through the heartbeat, as well as respiration.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.620
And they'll use a combination of those things
together with movement to try and stage your

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.620
sleep.

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:30.440
Right now, without naming, you know, I don't
think there's anyone that is necessarily better

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.310
than the other, at least none of them have
published scientific evidence. We sleep scientists

01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:40.440
have actually looked at these devices relative
to gold standard, what we call polysomnography,

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.340
which is essentially like doing a sleep study.
If you were to, here at my sleep center, we've

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:47.192
got all of this equipment. You look like a
spaghetti monster with electrodes on your

01:41:47.192 --> 01:41:48.192
head.

01:41:48.192 --> 01:41:49.320
[Rhonda]: I don't know who can sleep with
that on.

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.909
[Matt]: Yeah, I know. But we can measure that
sleep with high precision, high fidelity.

01:41:52.909 --> 01:41:56.291
That's the gold standard. And when you compare
these sleep trackers, unfortunately, they're

01:41:56.291 --> 01:42:00.730
not quite accurate. They either overestimate
or underestimate sleep onset latency, how

01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:04.360
long it takes you to fall asleep. They either
overestimate or underestimate the amount of

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.250
time that you've been awake. Sleep duration
may not be bad with some of them, total sleep

01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:15.240
duration, but once you get into the sleep
stages, that's where things become more inaccurate.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.340
Their ability to separate non-REM from REM,
it is getting better. It could be in the region

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:27.400
of sort of 60% accuracy, possibly lower. But
right now, we're not there yet. Will we be

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.540
there in about four years' time? I actually
think we will be.

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.780
[Rhonda]: Because that's what...I'm really
interested in the deep. Obviously...

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:39.420
[Matt]: But also I would say REM sleep, too,
you know, I think REM sleep takes a backseat.

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:44.640
At sort of, you know, a bit of a neglected
stepsister in the sort of sleep conversation.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.380
REM sleep, we found all manner of different
functions, one of which is emotional first-aid.

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:55.910
It's incredible for palliative emotional benefit.
It's not time that heals all wounds, but it's

01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:58.930
time during REM sleep that provides emotional
convalescence.

01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:02.630
[Rhonda]: I guess that would also then be
important to help you sleep better, because

01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:07.870
if you are managing your emotions better,
you probably have less anxiety...

01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:11.810
[Matt]: Correct. Exactly. But also REM is
for the body, too, you know. It seems to regulate

01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:15.610
cardiovascular function. So REM sleep is critical
too.

01:43:15.610 --> 01:43:18.110
[Rhonda]: Oh, really? Is REM what's important
for lowering the blood pressure?

01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:21.950
[Matt]: No. Well, it's during deep sleep that
you get this lowering of blood pressure, and

01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:28.350
we've got some data right now that we're about
to publish that deep sleep provides actually

01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:30.460
a homeostatic recalibration of blood pressure.

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.040
What do I mean by that? If I measure your
blood pressure before sleep and then after

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.600
sleep at a matched circadian time, so we remove
the circadian fluctuation of which there is

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.870
a large one to your systolic blood pressure,
but we match it, and so the only thing that's

01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:47.790
different is the quality of your sleep, what
we've discovered firstly is that the amount

01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:53.860
of deep sleep that you have measured in these
big delta slow waves during deep non-REM sleep,

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:59.830
that predicts how much of a drop in your systolic
blood pressure you will have in the morning

01:43:59.830 --> 01:44:05.330
relative to the evening as if deep sleep provides
a recalibration of the cardiovascular system.

01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:06.330
[Rhonda]: Wow.

01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:11.290
[Matt]: If you're having higher frequency
brainwaves that are not like the deep sleep,

01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:18.470
that's what we call unrestorative sleep, if
you have a ratio of very little deep brainwave

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:26.340
activity and a lot of high-frequency wake-like
brain activity, what we call delta-beta ratio

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.780
that predicts very bad cardiovascular outcomes,
that if anything, your systolic blood pressure

01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:33.860
is even worse after sleep than it is the night
before.

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:38.240
And what we found is that during aging, now
we looked at this and healthy people, then

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.880
we replicated in older adults, and we found
that the older that you get, the less deep

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:47.690
sleep that you get, the more sort of wake-like
or faster-frequency brainwave activity, which

01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:53.090
isn't good during deep sleep. And that accurately
predicts the cardiovascular dysfunction that

01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:59.550
we see in aging. So we now think we understand
in part why poor sleep is linked into poor

01:44:59.550 --> 01:45:01.280
cardiovascular outcomes.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:08.530
One of the benefits of sleep is that it resets
cardiovascular tone and particularly systolic

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:13.220
tone. It doesn't stop there. There's lots
of other benefits, heart rate drops, etc.

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:18.070
But REM sleep also seems to have this strange
function where you go through these cycles

01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:21.860
where you get a massive activation of the
cardiovascular system, and then it falls silent,

01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:27.960
and then a massive escalation again. And you
get this really remarkable increase in heart

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.150
rate variability.

01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:34.480
And heart rate variability has been used as
a metric of health outcome, that if you have

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.050
high current rate variability, it's very good.
It predicts lots of health outcomes. That's

01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:43.060
what you get during REM sleep. So we should
be careful not to think of everything being

01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:49.050
all about deep sleep. It's about all stages.
Every stage of sleep that we have, we have

01:45:49.050 --> 01:45:55.510
ascribed a function to. Which makes sense,
you know, during sleep...Sleep is the most

01:45:55.510 --> 01:46:01.950
idiotic of all things in terms of a creation
from Mother Nature. You know, you're not finding

01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:06.400
a mate. You're not reproducing. You're not
eating. You're not caring for your young.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.490
And worse of all, you're vulnerable to predation.
So on any one of those grounds, sleep should

01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:16.480
have been strongly selected against in the
course of evolution.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:22.280
The exact opposite is true. Every species
that we've studied to date sleeps. What that

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:27.670
means is that sleepers fought its way through
heroically every step along the evolutionary

01:46:27.670 --> 01:46:32.770
pathway, which must mean that if sleep doesn't
serve an absolutely vital function, it is

01:46:32.770 --> 01:46:37.970
the biggest mistake that the evolutionary
process has ever made. And if any one of those

01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:42.180
stages of sleep could be removed, because
it was not important, because I want to, you

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.490
know, emphasize this type of sleep because
that other sleep must not be important, I

01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:52.570
promise you, mother nature would have thought,
I'm gonna excise that stage of sleep out because

01:46:52.570 --> 01:46:55.160
you're just too vulnerable.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:01.550
But I think, in your position, of course I
would be concerned about my deep sleep, thinking

01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:07.350
about things like apoe-4 Alzheimer's risk,
too. But I think the bottom line is that no

01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:12.300
matter which way you slice the sleep pie,
you just can't shortchange sleep.

01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:17.740
[Rhonda]: I just want to figure out, it'd
be nice to know what environmental factors

01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:23.651
are affecting, you know, different stages
of sleep, you know. So it's like, you know,

01:47:23.651 --> 01:47:28.190
if I do X, then that's gonna, you know, affect
my deep sleep or it's gonna affect my REM

01:47:28.190 --> 01:47:29.751
or it's gonna make me miss, you know.

01:47:29.751 --> 01:47:34.120
For example, if I were to go to bed, let's
say I usually go to bed at 9 or 9:30, and

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:40.700
if I were to go to bed instead at 11:30 or
midnight, because I had a social event or

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:44.820
something, and my circadian rhythm, usually,
well, my circadian rhythm these days is my

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:51.632
son. Wakes me up at 6 a.m. But let's just
say I could sleep longer if I...let's say

01:47:51.632 --> 01:47:56.430
I wake up at 6 a.m., but then I'm like, "Oh,
I went to bed at midnight instead of 9:30.

01:47:56.430 --> 01:48:02.260
I'll try to go back to sleep." Would that
be okay? Would I be able to, like, recover

01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:07.070
something that I'm missing from the 9:30 to
midnight? Do you see what I'm saying? Like...

01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:08.070
[Matt]: Yeah. So...

01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:10.460
[Rhonda]: Should I go back to sleep? Should
I try to go back or...?

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.761
[Matt]: You should try to go back to sleep.
So you should try to get the sleep that you

01:48:12.761 --> 01:48:13.761
need.

01:48:13.761 --> 01:48:14.761
[Rhonda]: The duration, yeah.

01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:19.010
[Matt]: Yeah, the duration. So there are essentially
four ingredients, and this is probably going

01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:26.550
to be my next book, which is essentially the
four pillars of sleep: depth, duration, continuity,

01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:32.470
regularity. If you shortchange sleep on any
one of those, you get a compromised deficit

01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:38.300
in brain and body. So depth is what we were
speaking about. It really should be depth/quality

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:44.010
of sleep. You need both the depth of those
deep sleep brainwaves but you also need all

01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:47.591
of these different brainwave oscillations,
these things called sleep spindles, and slow

01:48:47.591 --> 01:48:51.830
waves, and the coordination between those
two. It's all about the electrical quality

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:52.830
of your sleep.

01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:56.920
So you can have the duration of sleep, you
can have eight hours of sleep, but if it's

01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:03.940
not of the right electrical quality or depth,
you get deficits. But you can get lots of

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.310
high quality sleep, but if you're only getting
four hours of it, it's not going to be enough.

01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:11.660
So it's duration. Depth, duration.

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:15.910
Then it's also about continuity. This has
been probably, in the past five years, one

01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:21.610
of the explosions in the sleep field. If you
were to get eight hours of sleep but across

01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:27.400
a nine-hour period because you are awake for,
you know, 5 minutes here, 10 minutes here,

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.430
30 minutes here, 15 minutes here, that's very
fragmented sleep, which, by the way, alcohol

01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:38.690
is another thing that will fragment your sleep
very much like that. So the continuity of

01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:43.920
your sleep is poor. It's not continuous. It's
fragmented.

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.530
And even if you get eight hours of sleep in
a nine-hour period but it's fragmented versus

01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:55.680
you get eight hours of sleep all in a nice
one bout within eight hours, so in both of

01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.350
those scenarios, it's the same duration of
sleep, maybe it's even the same electrical

01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:05.970
quality of sleep, but if it's fragmented and
littered and punctured with many awakenings,

01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:09.510
the continuity of sleep is poor. And that's
not good either.

01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:14.760
And then, finally, the part is regularity.
This means going to bed and waking up at the

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:19.150
same time no matter whether it's the weekend
or the weekday. Go to bed at the same time,

01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:25.380
wake up at the same time. Those are the four
key pillars that we know of for sleep. And

01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:32.230
you can hold any three constant and manipulate
one of them and you get a deficit.

01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:37.990
Now we can't quite weigh the complete, you
know, is it, you know, this one is worth,

01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:43.950
you know, 40%. This one is worth sort of 20%.
We can't yet do that. But it's very clear

01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:47.040
that those are the four pillars of good sleep.

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:55.650
So I mentioned that just coming back to the
quality of sleep, when you position of the

01:50:55.650 --> 01:51:01.420
quantity of sleep on the clock face, on the
24-hour clock face, at an inappropriate time

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:06.780
according to your natural innate preference,
and I say that specifically rather than a

01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:12.300
particular time, you will not get the same
quality of your sleep. So an extreme version

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:18.490
of this is a night shift worker, where they
may get eight hours of sleep in bed but they

01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:23.780
are sleeping during the day, not during the
night. So it's a complete reversal. The quality

01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:28.050
of their sleep is not good. They don't get
the same amount of deep sleep nor do they

01:51:28.050 --> 01:51:30.240
get the same amount of REM sleep.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:35.860
But let's kind of walk that back a little
bit to your scenario, which is much more subtle.

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:41.120
Let's say that my chronotype, and your chronotype
simply determines whether you're a morning

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:47.050
person, an evening person, or somewhere in
the middle, about 30% of the population is

01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:54.250
an extreme morning type or a morning type,
about sort of 40% percent is sort of neither

01:51:54.250 --> 01:52:00.790
strongly morning or evening, and about the
remaining 30% is an evening type, we call

01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:04.180
them owls and larks.

01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:08.590
So if you're a morning type, you like to go
to bed, let's say, like, 9 p.m. And wake up

01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:13.670
at 5 or 6. If you're an evening type, you
may want to go to bed at 1 a.m. And wake up

01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:20.860
at 9 a.m. The next morning. So when I'm saying
the optimal position of sleep, I'm saying

01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:25.091
with the optimal for your chronotype, this
is your chronotype...And by the way, it's

01:52:25.091 --> 01:52:30.010
genetic. You don't get to decide whether you're
a morning type or an evening type. It's hardwired

01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:34.300
into your genes. We know the genes. It's not
your fault. If you're an evening type and

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:40.780
you're listening to this, and society, which
is strongly architected against your chronotype,

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:46.420
we reward and we favor the morning types,
it is not your fault. It's not a choice. And

01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:49.610
there's not too much you can do about it.
You can push and pull the system by about

01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:53.720
30 minutes, 45 minutes, but not much more.

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:59.010
So coming back to it, when we position that
sleep on that eight-hour period, whatever

01:52:59.010 --> 01:53:03.860
is optimal for you, you will get a nice distribution.
You'll get all of the deep sleep that you

01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.420
want and all of the REM sleep that you want.
And earlier in the conversation, I said that

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:11.650
we go through these 90-minute cycles, we,
human beings, it's different for different

01:53:11.650 --> 01:53:16.900
animals, you always go into deep non-REM sleep
first and then you always have REM sleep second.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.780
And that repeats every 90 minutes throughout
the night.

01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:26.970
What changes, however, is the ratio of non-REM
to REM within those 90-minute cycles as you

01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:32.470
move across the night such that in the first
half of the night, the majority of those 90-minute

01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:37.720
cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-REM
sleep and very little REM sleep. In the second

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.630
half of the night, that balance shifts, and
now you get much more REM sleep in the late

01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:45.990
morning hours and very little deep sleep.

01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:50.260
The reason I'm saying this is because let's
take someone who goes to bed at a substandard

01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:53.300
amount of time. Let's say that they go to
bed at midnight, and they're going to wake

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:58.470
up at 8. But instead they have to wake up,
because they've got an early morning meeting,

01:53:58.470 --> 01:54:02.660
so they go to bed at midnight and they wake
up at 6. And my question is how much sleep

01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:07.410
have they lost? And your response is, well,
they've lost two hours out of the eight hours,

01:54:07.410 --> 01:54:12.740
which means they've lost 25% of their sleep.
And your answer would be right in a way, but

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:17.820
it would be wrong as well, which is that they've
lost 25% of their total sleep but they may

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:24.350
have lost almost 80% of their REM sleep because
that's the REM rich phase of the night.

01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:30.320
And it also works the other way around, too,
that if you go to bed too late, you will...So

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.750
what happens is, because of the circadian
rhythm, the brain has a different appetite

01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:41.420
for different stages of sleep on the 24-hour
clock face. In the late evening and the early

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:49.170
morning hours, the brain has a dietary preference
for deep sleep. And it doesn't very much have

01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:53.360
an appetite taste for REM sleep. Through to
the second half of the night, that's when

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.620
it gets its appetite for REM sleep.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:02.550
So if you start sleeping at 4:00 in the morning
and you wake up it in the middle of the day,

01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:07.440
your brain has lost its appetite for deep
sleep. And so it won't get much. Now you will

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.691
probably get much more REM sleep as a consequence.
So you've got to be really careful. That why...

01:55:12.691 --> 01:55:15.940
[Rhonda]: So it's almost like your chronotype
may even dictate in a way how much deep sleep

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:16.940
you may get.

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.970
[Matt]: The chronotype will...If you sleep
naturally and you get the amount of sleep

01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:25.900
that you want, your chronotype will probably
mean that...your circadian rhythm is actually

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:30.970
shifted as your chronotype, too. So you will
still get, as an owl, if you get your eight

01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:36.820
hours when you want it, you will probably
get a similar sleep architecture as a lark,

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:42.330
who has gone to bed five or six hours earlier,
because your circadian rhythms are five to

01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:43.800
six hours different.

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:50.220
But you're right in the sense that owls typically
try to go to bed early. But because they are

01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:54.720
designed not to fall asleep at that time,
they're just gonna lie in bed. Many owls think

01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:58.930
that they have insomnia. They don't. They're
just not going to bed at the right time. Because

01:55:58.930 --> 01:56:03.490
they get into bed, and it's like a teenager,
whose rhythm is also shifted late, you tell

01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:07.080
them to go to bed because you've got to wake
up for early school start times, but there's

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:10.440
nothing they can do because their circadian
rhythm has shifted forward in time. And it's

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.990
the same for owls.

01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:17.340
So what will happen is that they will probably
stay awake for a while, then they'll get into

01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:21.400
deep sleep. But then they have to wake up
at an earlier time, and they will lose a lot

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.650
of REM sleep. REM sleep, for emotional well-being,
what the owls typically experience: depression,

01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:31.420
low mood, anxiety. So I think we're really
starting to put the pieces together on that

01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:32.420
component.

01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:39.550
[Rhonda]: And so for someone like me, I'm
somewhere in the middle, like, when I don't...pre-baby.

01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:45.150
Now I'm I guess you would call a lark because
I'm going to bed at, like, 9. My optimal time,

01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:49.080
if I can go to bed when my son does, and it's
like, you know, if I go to bed, like, at 8,

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:53.720
then I get the longer duration. That way,
if I'm a little more fragmented, then I, like,

01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:57.990
at least can make up for it somewhat. But
I'm up at 6 a.m. Now if it were up to me,

01:56:57.990 --> 01:57:00.350
I'd like to sleep...I usually would wake up,
like, 8 a.m.

01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:01.350
[Matt]: Yes, 8 a.m.

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:02.350
[Rhonda]: Like, that's my natural time.

01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:06.440
[Matt]: And the reason that you can probably
go to sleep sort of, you know, 9 p.m. Or even

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.450
8 p.m. Now is because you're chronically sleep-deprived.
And as a consequence, you've built up such

01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:16.870
as sleep debt that, you know, there is a lingering
what we call sleep pressure in your system.

01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:22.780
But, yeah, I think fighting your chronotype,
we found, it comes with deleterious health

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.691
consequences. Increased risk for poor cardio
metabolic outcomes. Things like, you know,

01:57:27.691 --> 01:57:33.960
C-reactive protein is higher. If you look
at, you know, A1C in terms of sort of a raw

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:40.090
shot review of blood glucose, your blood sugar,
not good. If you look at your propensity for

01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:47.660
being obese or being overweight, also not
great if you're an owl and you're not sleeping

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.660
according to your schedule.

01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.660
[Rhonda]: Telomeres are shorter.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:50.780
[Matt]: Telomeres are shorter as well.

01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:53.980
[Rhonda]: So let's talk about your, because
a lot of interesting researchers come out

01:57:53.980 --> 01:58:01.670
of your lab on the blood glucose regulation
front and, well, I guess more on the eating

01:58:01.670 --> 01:58:02.670
preferences...

01:58:02.670 --> 01:58:03.670
[Matt]: And appetite and eating.

01:58:03.670 --> 01:58:04.670
[Rhonda]: ...and appetite. Yeah.

01:58:04.670 --> 01:58:09.770
[Matt]: I mean, the way I see it, it's all
part of the energy intake expenditure system.

01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:14.470
And sleep, you know, if you think about like
a weighing scale between sort of energy expenditure

01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:20.840
and energy consumption, sleep, if you're not
getting it, just annihilates that balance.

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.020
And we can speak about any one of those things.

01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:31.630
But, you know, I think the blood glucose story
and sleep is very very well-worked out now.

01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:36.460
It started with epidemiological studies, where
we started to see that people who were sleeping

01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:42.130
less than seven hours were at significantly
higher likelihood of either being diabetic

01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:48.000
or going on to develop diabetes. Many of them
were already, you know, what we call a pre-diabetic

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:55.200
state, or they had what we now call sort of
metabolic disorder.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:59.890
And then the question became, well, is that
associational or is it causal? So the next

01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:04.530
studies that happened in this was work back
in...starts in the 1990s by Evan Carter at

01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:08.820
the University of Chicago. Wonderful studies.
It took a group of healthy people, started

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:12.840
to limit them to different doses of sleep
for a week, you know, five hours of sleep,

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.660
six hours of sleep, four hours of sleep, and
what she showed was that, essentially, after

01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:22.030
one week of short sleep, your blood sugar
levels are disrupted so significantly that

01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:27.300
your doctor would classify you at that point
as being pre-diabetic after one week of short

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:28.780
sleep.

01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:34.830
And the way that they do this is what's called
a glucose tolerance test, where you are fasted,

01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:39.840
and then you are given this sickly-sweet drink
of glucose, and then they are measuring from

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:48.070
your blood in the next three or four hours
how quickly is your body able to dispose of

01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:49.630
that blood glucose.

01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:54.470
So what happens when you drink or when you
eat a meal is that your blood sugar spikes.

01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:59.550
And you don't want that spike to stick around
very long. If your body is healthy, it deals

01:59:59.550 --> 02:00:04.670
with that raised level of blood glucose very
quickly, and it brings it back down very quickly.

02:00:04.670 --> 02:00:10.300
That's a healthy profile. That's what we call
good glucose management. So how good is your

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:15.530
body at disposing essentially of that glucose?
And the way it disposes it is that cells in

02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:21.680
the body, including muscle cells, will suck
up that glucose. And it's called your disposal

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:26.280
index, or your disposition index, it turns
out.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:32.580
So what she found, Evan Carter, with her studies,
was that, firstly, the way that your body

02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:38.480
knows how to absorb glucose and suck in that
glucose is that there is another chemical

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:44.500
called insulin, which is released by the pancreas,
beta cells of the pancreas, and that insulin

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:49.550
will instruct the cells of the body to open
up special glucose channels to absorb the

02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:53.600
glucose and your blood sugar drops, which
is good and healthy.

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:58.330
Firstly, what she found was that when you
are not getting sufficient sleep, the beta

02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:06.810
cells in your pancreas stop being sensitive
to the signal of high glucose. So the beta

02:01:06.810 --> 02:01:11.200
cells, which normally are listening for this
spike in glucose, and as soon as they sort

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.240
of, you know, hear...no, they're not hearing
it. They're sensing it. But as soon as they

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:20.540
sense the spike in glucose, they release insulin.
And that insulin will drop your blood glucose.

02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:28.860
But those cells had become insensitive to
glucose, what we call sort of glucose insensitivity.

02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:35.490
And so the beta cells of the pancreas stopped
releasing as much insulin. It didn't release

02:01:35.490 --> 02:01:42.130
enough insulin to drop blood glucose, so blood
glucose remained high. If that wasn't bad

02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:47.130
enough, we've since gone on to demonstrate,
and you can do this with really clever studies,

02:01:47.130 --> 02:01:56.150
taking tissue biopsies, the cells of the body
including muscle cells and fat cells, their

02:01:56.150 --> 02:01:59.720
receptors stopped being as sensitive to insulin.

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.860
So, firstly, you're releasing less insulin
when you're sleep-deprived. But what little

02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:11.070
insulin you do release is not instructing
those cells to open up the channels to take

02:02:11.070 --> 02:02:17.090
away the monsoon of the glucose that's flowing
in the channels of the body. So on both sides

02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:23.670
of the glucose regulation, on the release
of insulin, to instruct cells to absorb glucose,

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:31.070
and on those cells themselves to be sort of
instructed by insulin, those cells became

02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:37.740
less sensitive to the insulin signal. And
so, as a consequence, your overall ability

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:43.990
to deal with glucose became far more degraded,
and blood glucose remained higher, which sets

02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:46.280
you on a profile of looking pre-diabetic.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.100
[Rhonda]: Couple that with the standard American
diet, and, you know...

02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:50.560
[Matt]: And you're off to the races in terms
with...

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.520
[Rhonda]: Yeah, and eating late at night.
So, actually, are you familiar with the studies,

02:02:54.520 --> 02:03:00.520
I know Dr. Satchin Panda actually is the one
who told me about this, melatonin is actually

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:04.850
what is responsible for shutting down the
pancreatic beta cells from producing insulin.

02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:09.660
So I wonder how much of the sleep deprivation
the melatonin system is involved in that.

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:13.220
[Matt]: Yeah. So in those studies, what was
good is that they held constant circadian

02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:17.240
rhythms, they held constant ambient light,
and they even held constant physical activity.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:23.910
The control group was sort of they were in
bed for eight hours, but the people who are

02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:28.360
sleep deprived, limited to four or five hours,
during the eight-hour window where the other

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.290
people were actually sleeping, they had to
lie recumbent in bed with no physical movement.

02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:34.290
[Rhonda]: Oh, man.

02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:36.720
[Matt]: So you controlled, but it was a great
study because you control for physical activity

02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:43.330
as well. So we now really understand the link
between a lack of sleep and poor glucose management,

02:03:43.330 --> 02:03:48.120
and very very well indeed. And we also know
the stage of sleep that's important. It's,

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.790
again, deep slow-wave sleep. The study that
I described before, where you're playing those

02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:58.700
annoying tones just below the level of awakening
so I can remove your deep quality of sleep,

02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:03.390
you can do that same thing again, and you
essentially produce that same diabetic-like

02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:08.050
consequence just by removing or excising deep
slow-wave sleep.

02:04:08.050 --> 02:04:12.270
[Rhonda]: So you're doing that, and then on
top of that, some of your work has shown that

02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:18.170
you're now also gonna have a preference to
eat the very food that raises your blood sugar,

02:04:18.170 --> 02:04:19.170
right?

02:04:19.170 --> 02:04:20.170
[Matt]: Yup, yup.

02:04:20.170 --> 02:04:21.170
[Rhonda]: And it's something I've definitely
experienced...

02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:22.170
[Matt]: High glycemic food...

02:04:22.170 --> 02:04:23.170
[Rhonda]: Yeah, yeah.

02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:27.740
[Matt]: So this is a whole...So it all fits
in, I think, to this energy balance. So, you

02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:34.010
know, firstly, what we know is that your regulation
of blood sugar, of blood glucose is profoundly

02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:41.910
impaired by a lack of sleep. But what about
your calorie intake? What about your obesogenic

02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:47.120
profile, setting aside your glycemic profile?

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:53.140
So what we've discovered is that when you're
not getting enough sleep, two appetite-regulating

02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:58.710
hormones go in opposite directions. These
two hormones are called leptin and ghrelin.

02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:04.310
And I often, you know, think of them as, you
know, they sound like hobbits to me, at least,

02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:05.310
you know.

02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:06.310
[Rhonda]: That's hilarious.

02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:10.001
[Matt]: Leptin and ghrelin that, you know,
J. R. Tolkien would have written about them.

02:05:10.001 --> 02:05:15.490
But they're not. They're real hormones. Leptin
is a hormone that signals satiety. What I

02:05:15.490 --> 02:05:20.890
mean by that is, when you have high amounts
of leptin, it tells your brain you're full.

02:05:20.890 --> 02:05:26.450
You're satisfied with your food. You don't
want to eat anymore. Ghrelin is the other

02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:33.520
hunger hormone. When ghrelin is increased,
you feel unsatisfied by your food. You feel

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.740
hungry. And you want to eat more.

02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:42.340
So after you eat a meal, normally, what happens
is that levels of leptin increase and levels

02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:47.170
of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, you can think
about ghrelin as like a grumbling tummy, ghrelin

02:05:47.170 --> 02:05:52.260
goes down. And this means that you stop eating,
you don't want to eat anymore, and you're

02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:57.801
full for a duration of time period. When you
are sleep-deprived, levels of leptin, which

02:05:57.801 --> 02:06:02.530
normally signal to your brain you're full
and you're satisfied with food, that hormone

02:06:02.530 --> 02:06:09.540
is impaired by a lack of sleep. So you lose
the fullness satiety signal in your brain.

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:15.921
If that wasn't bad enough, the hunger hormone,
ghrelin, actually increases. So it's a double

02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:23.120
whammy effect here. What does that lead to?
It leads to a strong obesogenic profile of

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:29.250
energy consumption, of food consumption. So
what we, and Evan Carter, in fact, has done

02:06:29.250 --> 02:06:33.700
all of these pioneering studies, and we've
done some of them now, too, typically, you

02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:39.500
tend to over eat during main meals. So you
will typically eat somewhere between about

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:45.000
200 to 300 extra calories. If we give you
a meal, and we measure all of the food on

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.070
your plate, and we ask how much did you eat
at that one sitting, you tend to overeat by

02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:53.490
about 200 or 300 calories per main meal sitting.

02:06:53.490 --> 02:06:54.830
[Rhonda]: Wow.

02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:57.550
[Matt]: Now you could say...Well, actually...

02:06:57.550 --> 02:06:59.990
[Rhonda]: That's after a full night of sleep?

02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:04.910
[Matt]: Well, that's when you've been limited
to maybe four hours of sleep for a week. Now

02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:09.430
someone, and the reviewers of these papers,
you know, in the early days, said, "Well,

02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:15.480
that's because when you're awake longer, being
awake is more metabolically demanding, and

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:20.220
you're probably moving around more." Not true.
It turns out sleep, firstly, is a remarkably

02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:25.430
metabolically active state. You're very active
metabolically when you're asleep. In fact,

02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:30.830
the difference between being asleep versus
being awake is only about, for a whole night

02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:32.830
of sleep, the difference of about 140 calories.

02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:33.830
[Rhonda]: Wow.

02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:40.070
[Matt]: Just like a small cookie, essentially.
So, yes, when you're awake longer, you do

02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:47.860
burn more calories. But the amount of calories
that you increase in your intake far exceeds

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:53.540
anything that you expend by way of being awake
a little bit longer. If that wasn't bad enough,

02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:58.630
though, it's not the main meal where the trouble
lies with sleep. That's some of the problem.

02:07:58.630 --> 02:08:04.340
The other studies that are even more sort
of devilish are where you give these sleep-deprived

02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:12.310
subjects the same meal but then you give them
a snack bar. And it's an ad-lib food buffet,

02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:17.970
essentially. And you can eat as much as you
want. And they allow you to eat in a room

02:08:17.970 --> 02:08:22.830
by yourself, so there's no social pressure,
so you don't restrict your eating or...it's

02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:23.900
true eating.

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:30.370
And of course, we measure everything that
you eat. And it's snacking that is the dead

02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:36.651
giveaway here. You end up eating 300 to 400
additional calories by way of snacks. This

02:08:36.651 --> 02:08:43.120
is after they've eaten a 2,000-calorie meal
in one sitting. They will then go away, and

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:46.610
they will eat an additional 400 calories at
the snack bar.

02:08:46.610 --> 02:08:47.860
[Rhonda]: Wow.

02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:53.590
[Matt]: So, as a consequence, what you're
doing is you're increasing the total caloric

02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:59.980
intake, which sets you on a path towards being
overweight and obese. Then the discovery came

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:05.130
that it's not just what you eat...sorry, it's
not just how much you eat but it's what you

02:09:05.130 --> 02:09:11.430
eat. And what Evan Carter discovered in her
early studies was that if you give one of

02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:18.450
these sort of food buffets...and you can eat
anything. It goes from, you know, sugary treats

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:26.190
to salty treats like pretzels or potato chips
to heavy-hitting starchy carbohydrates, breads,

02:09:26.190 --> 02:09:33.200
pasta, pizza all the way to salad, what you
find is that you eat more of all of the food

02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:40.310
groups. But you eat mostly in terms of an
increase the starchy, heavy-hitting carbohydrates

02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:42.290
as well as the sugary foods.

02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:46.920
And if we know anything from the recent movement
in food, particularly from people like Gary

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.520
Taubes, who has written wonderfully about
this type of stuff, that's the food that sets

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:59.541
you on a path, again, down an obesogenic and
also a poor glycemic control profile. If you

02:09:59.541 --> 02:10:05.850
look at all of the cardio metabolic markers
of health when you're eating excessive carbohydrate-heavy

02:10:05.850 --> 02:10:14.380
rich or and particularly simplified sugars,
they're bad for your health profile in general.

02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:17.660
It's exactly the foods that you eat when you
are underslept.

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:21.950
[Rhonda]: Is there a feedback loop on those
foods affecting your sleep?

02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:22.950
[Matt]: There is.

02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:23.950
[Rhonda]: There is.

02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:28.530
[Matt]: So I would say this is probably, apart
from maybe the gut microbiome of which there

02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:33.850
is now some evidence, and we're starting to
look at this, too, at the sleep center, it's

02:10:33.850 --> 02:10:38.470
probably the least well understood. But the
bottom line is that if you're eating a diet

02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:45.240
that's high in carbohydrate, especially high
in processed simple sugars and low in fiber,

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.780
you tend to have worse sleep, you take longer
time to fall asleep, the amount of deep sleep

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:56.420
that you get is less, and you have more fragmented
awakenings throughout the night.

02:10:56.420 --> 02:11:01.110
Now I don't think there's enough evidence
right now for me to hang my hat on any dietary

02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:06.000
prescription for sleep. In five years' time,
I think we'll have a very different conversation.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.320
I think, you know, absence of evidence is
not evidence of absence. I think we'll get

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:13.580
there. And I think food is going to be a big
part of that equation. I think we have gut

02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:18.450
microbiome, too. I think that's what we've
seen when you, in a few of the studies where

02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:22.460
you limit people, you sleep deprive them or
you put them on a jet lag routine, you see

02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:30.310
the balance between the sort of bacteriodetes
sort of class of the microbiome versus the

02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:34.960
firmicutes. That ratio goes in a balance that
you don't want.

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.950
So, typically, in sort of obese people or
people with diabetes, you get a higher ratio

02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:47.940
of the firmicutes relative to the bacteriodetes.
When you modulate sleep and you shortchange

02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:54.260
sleep or you put sleep on a jet like profile,
that's exactly the same gut microbiome sort

02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.880
of dysregulation profile that you see. So
I think it's gonna be a great...And I think

02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.880
part of...

02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:01.560
[Rhonda]: Because they're on their own circadian
rhythm as well, the...

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:02.600
[Matt]: They are. Yeah.

02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.110
[Rhonda]: So is that why? Because their ratio
is changing and then...?

02:12:05.110 --> 02:12:11.460
[Matt]: I think it's possible that it could
be a circadian rhythm. I think it's also possible

02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:15.360
that it could be down to what we described
before, which is the fight-or-flight branch

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:21.180
of the nervous system, that when you are under
slept, it's, like, revving a car but in neutral.

02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:25.090
It's desperately bad for the engine. That's
what happens when you're sleep-deprived. You

02:12:25.090 --> 02:12:28.890
get this ramping up of your fight-or-flight
system, and it just stays there with chronic

02:12:28.890 --> 02:12:33.900
sleep deprivation for as long as you're chronically
sleep-deprived. And one out of every two adults

02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:36.510
in first world nations is chronically sleep-deprived.

02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:42.810
I think it leads to a release of stress chemistry,
particularly cortisol. Cortisol is known in

02:12:42.810 --> 02:12:48.500
the gut microbiome to produce this imbalance.
What's the pathway? I think it's probably

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:53.020
a bunch of nerve fibers from the brain into
the body called the vagus nerve. And we're

02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:58.170
starting to do a lot of work on this now.
I think the vagus nerve we know has a direct

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:03.160
mainline pathway or provides a mainline pathway
from your brain to your gut. And that's why

02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.240
there is a very powerful brain-gut relationship.

02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:12.150
I think that's one of the mechanisms by which
the gut is affected by sleep. Which gets me

02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:23.310
excited, because if that's true, flip the
equation, could the gut microbiome be a path

02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:28.481
through which we can reverse-engineer a signal
for better sleep in the brain? I think that

02:13:28.481 --> 02:13:32.520
now becomes a parsimonious hypothesis, and
it's one that I'd like to test as well.

02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:38.010
[Rhonda]: There was a really interesting study
looking at the effects of a particular strain.

02:13:38.010 --> 02:13:42.630
I think it was the rhamnosus strain that...they
produce GABA in the gut.

02:13:42.630 --> 02:13:43.630
[Matt]: Yes.

02:13:43.630 --> 02:13:49.450
[Rhonda]: But GABA doesn't cross the blood-brain
barrier as far as...I think most evidence

02:13:49.450 --> 02:13:50.680
suggests it does not.

02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:54.240
[Matt]: No. So the brain has GABA, but it's
not coming from the...

02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:55.370
[Rhonda]: Right, right.

02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:56.370
[Matt]: Yeah.

02:13:56.370 --> 02:14:00.760
[Rhonda]: But there was some studies that
were speculating that there's, through the

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.880
vagal nerve, because some of the efferent
neurons in the gut were stimulating it, and

02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.010
they were more, like, relaxed or something.
They were producing GABA in the brain through

02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:13.190
the vagal nerve. And GABA affects sleep, right?

02:14:13.190 --> 02:14:14.190
[Matt]: Yeah.

02:14:14.190 --> 02:14:15.800
[Rhonda]: So it sounds like there could definitely
be some sort of interesting...

02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:20.530
[Matt]: You know, that's one of...I think
the things in anxiety that we see is that

02:14:20.530 --> 02:14:25.280
it's a failure of the brain to dampen down
and basically invoke inhibition throughout

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.730
the brain to quiet down these regions.

02:14:27.730 --> 02:14:32.370
[Rhonda]: That particular strain of probiotics
was shown to help with anxiety. Small trials,

02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:38.290
clinical trials in humans. Of course, the
initial studies were preclinical in animals,

02:14:38.290 --> 02:14:40.710
but it has been shown to actually help improve...

02:14:40.710 --> 02:14:41.710
[Matt]: It does?

02:14:41.710 --> 02:14:42.710
[Rhonda]: Yeah. [inaudible 02:14:04]...

02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:47.100
[Matt]: My guess is that, if that's true,
if you were to look at sleep, I would be surprised

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:53.020
not to see a sleep benefit by way of an anxiety
reduction. I think, I mean, in my lab, that's

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:57.030
probably one of the most reliable things that
we see when we deprive people of sleep, of

02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:58.030
any dose.

02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:59.250
[Rhonda]: That anxiety goes up?

02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:03.730
[Matt]: Anxiety goes up. We've done the dose
response curve. We've looked, you know, hour

02:15:03.730 --> 02:15:10.190
by hour by hour. And as soon as you get past
probably about 14 or 15 hours of wakefulness,

02:15:10.190 --> 02:15:14.740
anxiety starts to increase. The further you
go into that sleep deprivation period, the

02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:19.180
more anxious that you get. It's a very robust,
reliable effect.

02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:22.420
[Rhonda]: So what do you think...It sounds
like if you were to give people, like, some

02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:28.860
of the main things, you know, the main interventions
they can do to help improve their sleep, a

02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:32.780
lot of people are interested in prevention,
a lot of people listening and watching are

02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:36.840
really interested, including myself, in prevention.
And it sounds like things that lower anxiety

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:40.000
are obviously important for...

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
[Matt]: Critical.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.480
[Rhonda]: Yeah, for improving sleep.

02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:48.680
[Matt]: Yeah. I think the prescription I would
have...Well, firstly, I think it's good to

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:56.400
recognize the sort of those four pillars of
sleep that, you know, depth, duration, continuity,

02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:02.740
regularity, but I think there are five actionable
things that people could do tonight to start

02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:09.110
getting better sleep. And we've mentioned
many of them. The first is darkness. You really

02:16:09.110 --> 02:16:14.390
do need some degree of darkness at night to
release that hormone melatonin, which helps

02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:16.820
trigger the timing of the healthy onset of
sleep.

02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:20.010
[Rhonda]: And you would say about maybe four
hours before your bedtime, or what would you

02:16:20.010 --> 02:16:21.010
say...?

02:16:21.010 --> 02:16:23.820
[Matt]: Yeah, I would say three to four hours
is the time to start thinking about your light

02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:28.540
saturation exposure, certainly in the last
hour before bed. And there are ways that you

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:33.599
can do that you can install software on your
computer if you really have to look at it,

02:16:33.599 --> 02:16:37.590
but I would advise against that because I
think computers cause and trigger anxiety.

02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:42.380
I think, in fact, if anything, my estimation
right now is that the blue light from those

02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:48.399
screens is detrimental. I think the evidence
is favoring a blockade of melatonin and a

02:16:48.399 --> 02:16:49.399
reduction in REM sleep.

02:16:49.399 --> 02:16:53.179
They did this great study. They took people
with an iPad, one hour of iPad reading versus

02:16:53.179 --> 02:16:59.610
one hour of book reading. iPad reading dropped
or blunted melatonin by over 20%. The peak

02:16:59.610 --> 02:17:05.570
of melatonin didn't arrive until three hours
later. This is one hour of iPad reading. They

02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:06.750
had less REM sleep, and they...

02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:07.979
[Rhonda]: They were reading, like...?

02:17:07.979 --> 02:17:11.960
[Matt]: They were reading just a book under
dim light versus reading the same book on

02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:18.550
an iPad. When they woke up the next morning,
the people who read the iPad felt more unrefreshed.

02:17:18.550 --> 02:17:22.489
They subjectively knew that they had not slept
as well. What was interesting is that when

02:17:22.489 --> 02:17:27.550
they stopped the iPad reading, there was a
washout effect that was a blast radius of

02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:31.849
reading the iPad. And it's continued into
subsequent nights even though they'd stopped

02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:33.149
reading the iPad.

02:17:33.149 --> 02:17:38.880
So I think light is a feature, but I also
think part of the problem with computers and

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:45.380
iPads and iPhones...and I don't mean to sound
like a prude about this, but they do trigger

02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:53.199
anxiety. They are what I would describe as
anxiogenic pieces of hardware. Unless you

02:17:53.199 --> 02:17:57.639
are, and if you can do this, please write
to me and tell me how you do this, but most

02:17:57.639 --> 02:18:03.040
people get a lot of their anxiety infusion
in part through these devices.

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:07.540
A recent study in teenagers are actually demonstrated
that part of the reason that they were having

02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:13.740
sleep disruption by using phones was not necessarily
about the light but was because of FOMO, fear

02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:20.330
of missing out, that if you weren't online,
you would miss out on some key social communication.

02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:22.800
And they were suffering because of that, too.

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:28.159
But I digress. My first recommendation is
watch the light saturation, watch the light

02:18:28.159 --> 02:18:32.840
pollution. And you can think about it like
that in the evening. So an hour before bed,

02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.019
certainly, close computers down, try not to
stare at phones, and dim half the lights down

02:18:38.019 --> 02:18:40.939
in the house. It really is powerful.

02:18:40.939 --> 02:18:47.090
The second is temperature. Try to set your
bedroom temperature to somewhere between about

02:18:47.090 --> 02:18:53.019
63 to 66 degrees for most people is optimal,
colder than most people think.

02:18:53.019 --> 02:18:54.450
[Rhonda]: Yeah, that is definitely colder
than...

02:18:54.450 --> 02:19:00.710
[Matt]: Yeah. And if you get cold feet, it's
okay to wear socks, but cold it must be. The

02:19:00.710 --> 02:19:08.269
third thing is what I would suggest is walk
it out, which is don't stay in bed awake.

02:19:08.269 --> 02:19:14.689
This is one of the mistakes that a lot of
people make. In this era, I think most people,

02:19:14.689 --> 02:19:21.979
because of anxiety, were wired and tired.
And one of the problems when you are lying

02:19:21.979 --> 02:19:27.399
in bed awake for a period of time, and I think
more than 20 minutes is not great, because

02:19:27.399 --> 02:19:32.069
what happens is that your brain very quickly
starts to learn the association between being

02:19:32.069 --> 02:19:38.029
in bed is about being awake rather than your
bed being the place of sleep. And so it learns

02:19:38.029 --> 02:19:39.159
this association.

02:19:39.159 --> 02:19:43.250
And so many of the patients that speak to,
they'll say, "Look, you know, I'm falling

02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:47.599
asleep on the couch watching television, and
then I get into bed and I'm wide awake, and

02:19:47.599 --> 02:19:52.359
I don't know why." And the answer is because
you've made the association between your bed

02:19:52.359 --> 02:19:57.649
is the place of wakefulness, not your place
of sleep. So the answer is you need to break

02:19:57.649 --> 02:20:04.819
that association. Get out of bed, go to another
room, in dim light, just read a book, no computers,

02:20:04.819 --> 02:20:08.470
and only return to bed when you feel very
sleepy.

02:20:08.470 --> 02:20:13.279
And the first night this may mean that you're
awake for two or three hours. And it sounds

02:20:13.279 --> 02:20:17.609
bad, and it sounds strange coming from someone
like me, but that's better than staying in

02:20:17.609 --> 02:20:23.220
bed awake for those two or three hours. And
over time, gradually, by only returning bed

02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:27.390
when you're sleepy, your brain will relearn
the association that it once had when you're

02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:32.390
a child, and you can relearn it, which is
that your bed is a place of deep sleep and

02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:36.499
sound sleep. So that's the next thing.

02:20:36.499 --> 02:20:43.930
I think the final two things we've touched
upon a little bit, which is alcohol and caffeine.

02:20:43.930 --> 02:20:50.050
Caffeine, many people know, keeps them awake.
It's a stimulant. It's what we call psychoactive

02:20:50.050 --> 02:20:54.130
stimulant. It's the only psychoactive stimulant,
by the way, that we readily give to our children

02:20:54.130 --> 02:21:03.499
in an unregularized free way, which I think
is a problem. Caffeine has several problems

02:21:03.499 --> 02:21:08.270
with it. Firstly, because of it being a stimulant,
it can keep you awake and it makes it harder

02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:10.699
for you to fall asleep.

02:21:10.699 --> 02:21:14.109
A lot of people, though, will say to me, "Look,
I'm one of those people who can have a cup

02:21:14.109 --> 02:21:18.680
of coffee with dinner and I fall asleep and
I stay asleep, and I'm just fine." Even if

02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:22.899
that's true, we and others have done these
studies, if you give someone a standard dose

02:21:22.899 --> 02:21:28.039
of one cup of coffee in the evening, 200 milligrams
of caffeine, the amount of deep sleep that

02:21:28.039 --> 02:21:34.949
they have is reduced by 20%. You would normally
have to age an individual by 10 or 15 years

02:21:34.949 --> 02:21:40.949
to drop your deep sleep quality by 20%, or
you can do it simply by having a cup of caffeinated

02:21:40.949 --> 02:21:47.819
drink or coffee in the evening. So caffeine
is a problem.

02:21:47.819 --> 02:21:52.729
The other problem with caffeine is its duration
of action. Caffeine has a half-life of about

02:21:52.729 --> 02:21:57.830
six or seven hours. And a half-life simply
means the amount of time it takes for a 50%

02:21:57.830 --> 02:22:03.680
of the drug to still be in your system or
50% of it to be cleared. Caffeine has a quarter

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:08.270
life of about 12 hours. In other words, if
you have a cup of coffee at noon, a quarter

02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:12.149
of that caffeine is still circulating in your
brain at midnight.

02:22:12.149 --> 02:22:15.989
So if you have a cup of coffee at noon, it's
the equivalent of getting into bed at midnight.

02:22:15.989 --> 02:22:20.390
And just before you turn out the lights, you
snick a quarter of a cup of Starbucks, and

02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:24.249
you hope for a good night of sleep, you know,
it's probably not gonna happen.

02:22:24.249 --> 02:22:30.630
So the advice would be try to cut caffeine
off around about midday if you can. And even

02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:35.560
if you're someone who, you know, can fall
asleep fine, stay asleep, you should just

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:38.880
know that caffeine can still impact your sleep.

02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.420
It's what usually creates the vicious cycle,
by the way, that those people will wake up

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:47.460
the next day, they feel unrefreshed and unrestored
by their sleep, they don't remember waking

02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:51.420
up, so they don't think it's the cup of coffee,
but now they start reaching for two cups of

02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:55.979
coffee in the morning rather than one. They've
got now more caffeine in the system. The next

02:22:55.979 --> 02:23:00.160
night, they have even less deep sleep. The
next morning, they wake up even less refreshed.

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.510
And now they drink more caffeine. Self-fulfilling
prophecy.

02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:10.521
Final one is alcohol. Alcohol is probably
the most misunderstood sleep aid or sleep

02:23:10.521 --> 02:23:15.979
drug. It's what most people usually reach
for when over-the-counter medications have

02:23:15.979 --> 02:23:22.149
failed. Alcohol is a sedative. It's a class
of drugs that we call the sedatives. And sedation

02:23:22.149 --> 02:23:27.340
is not sleep. So when you drink alcohol, what
you're doing is sedating your cortex. You're

02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:32.540
just knocking yourself out. And that's why
you think that you fall asleep faster.

02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:37.130
There are two other problems with alcohol.
Firstly, alcohol will litter your sleep with

02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:41.159
many more awakenings throughout the night.
And in fact, some people can even see this

02:23:41.159 --> 02:23:46.290
on their sleep trackers even though they're
not necessarily as accurate as my sleep laboratory

02:23:46.290 --> 02:23:52.439
would be. Even with that less accurate measure,
you can still see the impact of alcohol in

02:23:52.439 --> 02:23:57.770
sleep. So it litters your sleep with awakenings,
fragmenting your sleep. So this comes back

02:23:57.770 --> 02:24:04.069
to the third of the four pillars of good sleep,
which is continuity. It takes away your continuous

02:24:04.069 --> 02:24:06.430
asleep, and it makes it fragmented.

02:24:06.430 --> 02:24:11.239
The final part of alcohol is that it's one
of the best chemicals that we know for suppressing

02:24:11.239 --> 02:24:18.130
REM sleep alongside marijuana. Now, by the
way, I should say that's THC-specific. If

02:24:18.130 --> 02:24:24.260
you look at CBD, the evidence seems to be
less clear. CBD actually doesn't seem to be

02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:28.270
as detrimental to your sleep as THC. If anything...

02:24:28.270 --> 02:24:33.369
[Rhonda]: Yeah, because a lot of people, I
mean, again, this is just anecdotal, talk

02:24:33.369 --> 02:24:37.020
about how marijuana improve their sleep.

02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:42.499
[Matt]: Yes, yeah. So marijuana...We have
two separate sort of the active from the inactive

02:24:42.499 --> 02:24:50.220
component. THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, is the
active component. And CBD is the sort of the

02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:51.810
non-hallucinogenic component of that.

02:24:51.810 --> 02:24:54.050
[Rhonda]: They're both in if people are taking
a whole plant here.

02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:58.840
[Matt]: Typically, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Now
with strains and drops that you can buy, you

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.630
can separate those out, you can play around
with the ratios, and you can get very low

02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:10.840
THC to very high CBD. THC does tend to decrease
the time it takes you to fall asleep, but

02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:14.660
it tends to make you sometimes wake up more
throughout the night, but it certainly does

02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:16.489
seem to block REM sleep.

02:25:16.489 --> 02:25:22.279
One of the other problems with THC dosing
of sleep is that you become dependent on that

02:25:22.279 --> 02:25:29.720
for sleep. And when you stop using THC for
sleep, you have quite bad rebound insomnia,

02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:33.790
which leads to then a perpetuating cycle of
dependency. And I think, you know, I'm never

02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:39.739
keen for dependency on anything, be it dependency
on, you know, any, you know, food substance

02:25:39.739 --> 02:25:45.569
or anything. I think you should, you know,
be able to generate all of the physiological

02:25:45.569 --> 02:25:49.449
pathways and processes that you need, you
know, naturally without dependency.

02:25:49.449 --> 02:25:54.999
CBD is interesting, though. There is nowhere
near enough data for someone like me to make

02:25:54.999 --> 02:25:58.850
any recommendation. So all I can do is tell
you the very limited data that there is right

02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:05.489
now. CBD does not seem to produce the degree
of REM sleep impairment that we've seen with

02:26:05.489 --> 02:26:13.710
THC. What's interesting is that low-dose CBD
actually seems to be wake-promoting. So you

02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:20.850
actually are sort of forcing yourself more
awake. High-dose CBD seems to help people

02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:23.920
sleep more consistently.

02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:28.729
I would have thought it would it be the opposite,
that low-dose would have been better than

02:26:28.729 --> 02:26:32.449
high-dose, but the opposite seems to be true.
Now we don't know about the dependency. We

02:26:32.449 --> 02:26:37.779
don't know about the long-term effects. So
I am not going to sit here and give any recommendations

02:26:37.779 --> 02:26:44.949
regarding THC use or CBD use. If you're using
any compound, be it alcohol, be it a sleeping

02:26:44.949 --> 02:26:49.210
pill, which are...sleeping pills, by the way,
come with deathly consequences and higher

02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:51.560
risk of cancer. Or you're using...

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.560
[Rhonda]: Really?

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.560
[Matt]: Yeah, markedly increased risk.

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.490
[Rhonda]: Is that because there's something
directly the sleeping pills are doing, or

02:26:56.490 --> 02:27:00.860
because the way it affects your...? What does
it do to your sleep, sleeping pills? A lot

02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:02.199
of people take Ambien.

02:27:02.199 --> 02:27:09.890
[Matt]: So in the past month, 10 million Americans
have swallowed some kind of sleeping aid,

02:27:09.890 --> 02:27:16.199
either a prescription or over-the-counter,
monumental amounts. You know, I often joke

02:27:16.199 --> 02:27:22.239
that I think, it's not really a joking topic,
but, you know, it took George Lucas about

02:27:22.239 --> 02:27:29.500
40 years to amass $4 billion in profit from
the Star Wars franchise. It took Ambien less

02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:35.310
than 20 months to amass $4 billion in profit.
That tells me everything about the insufficiency

02:27:35.310 --> 02:27:42.109
of sleep and the desperate need for sleep
in this modern 21st-century era.

02:27:42.109 --> 02:27:47.130
But the problem is Ambien isn't part of that
same class of drugs that alcohol is. It's

02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:51.869
what we call a sedative hypnotic. It works
on the same receptor, which is the GABA receptor.

02:27:51.869 --> 02:27:57.290
Now it tickles the GABA receptor in a different
way to that which alcohol does. But what we

02:27:57.290 --> 02:28:03.029
found is that sleeping pills, and I won't
name any names but including the one that

02:28:03.029 --> 02:28:08.140
you described, they are sedating the brain.
You're not going into naturalistic sleep.

02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:12.159
If I look at the electrical signature of your
sleep when you're on a sleeping pill versus

02:28:12.159 --> 02:28:16.000
natural sleep, it's not the same.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.439
Secondly, what we found is that those sleeping
pills can often come with a grogginess in

02:28:21.439 --> 02:28:27.949
the morning and some forgetfulness. Third,
what we've found is that in animal models,

02:28:27.949 --> 02:28:32.291
and this is work that was done by Markus Frank,
who's a wonderful friend and colleague, he

02:28:32.291 --> 02:28:37.210
was looking at how the brain rewires itself
during sleep. And the brain does, particularly

02:28:37.210 --> 02:28:39.680
during the development.

02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:45.569
And he has a model in animals, where, if you
sort of put a patch on one of the eyes when

02:28:45.569 --> 02:28:50.770
the visual cortex is developing, the visual
cortex shifts over to developing more wiring

02:28:50.770 --> 02:28:56.569
to the eye that remains open. And it's called
the monocular deprivation paradigm of brain

02:28:56.569 --> 02:29:01.850
plasticity, and it's a very well worked out
model of brain plasticity. If you give those

02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:07.859
animals some exposure once you patch the eye
to the eye that remains, you drive learning

02:29:07.859 --> 02:29:15.189
and plasticity, and then you allow it to sleep,
sleep will strengthen the synaptic connections

02:29:15.189 --> 02:29:17.680
that have been made during the day by about
100%.

02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:18.680
[Rhonda]: Wow.

02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:23.760
[Matt]: So sleep is almost as powerful as
experience during the day. That's how sort

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:31.350
of strong and powerful it is. But what he
then did was a study where he dosed those

02:29:31.350 --> 02:29:38.010
animals with Ambien. Now it turns out that
those animals slept even longer, if you look

02:29:38.010 --> 02:29:42.220
at the data, than the animals who weren't
dosed on Ambien. And the prediction would

02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:47.730
be, surely, they would have as much if not
more of that wonderful brain plasticity. The

02:29:47.730 --> 02:29:55.550
opposite was true. Ambien-induced sleep resulted
in a 50% unwiring of the connections that

02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:59.910
have been made during day rather than potentiating
them.

02:29:59.910 --> 02:30:04.380
That frightens me. Because if you look at
the prescription age of sleeping medications

02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:09.619
over the past decade, it's coming down and
down. I don't know how long it's going to

02:30:09.619 --> 02:30:15.040
be before prescription medication comes in
to a pediatric realm. And if those data hold

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:22.609
up, it makes me worried. So I'm coming off
topic a little bit, but we know that sleeping

02:30:22.609 --> 02:30:27.369
pills are associated with a markedly higher
risk of death, as well as cancer, as well

02:30:27.369 --> 02:30:34.669
as your susceptibility to infection, particularly
in pneumonia.

02:30:34.669 --> 02:30:41.380
But returning to alcohol, it is definitely
one of the most, I think, misunderstood drugs.

02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:49.189
But what I was saying regarding THC, alcohol,
sleeping pills, if you are using anything

02:30:49.189 --> 02:30:55.479
to help you sleep, I think you have to ask
yourself, are you just really treating, you

02:30:55.479 --> 02:31:02.569
know, an open wound and not really actually
trying to stitch it up? Because what that

02:31:02.569 --> 02:31:08.260
is simply doing is masking a problem that
you're not dealing with, you know. Why is

02:31:08.260 --> 02:31:09.510
it, like...?

02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:13.560
And this is not a criticism, I'm sorry if
my voice sounds like that, and it's not, you

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:17.820
know, I'm so sympathetic to people who have
sleep problems. We see them all of the time

02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:23.750
here. But you have to ask why. Why is it that
you're struggling with sleep? Is it because

02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:28.490
you're of a certain chronotype and you don't
understand your chronotype and you're sleeping

02:31:28.490 --> 02:31:34.989
at the wrong phase of the 24-hour period and
it's masquerading as insomnia. Or do you have

02:31:34.989 --> 02:31:42.199
too much anxiety in your life and you're blunting
that anxiety with things like alcohol or THC

02:31:42.199 --> 02:31:46.520
or sleeping pills? You know, you're just kicking
the can down the road. You're just hitting

02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:52.279
the mute button. But the movie is still playing
of damage. Whatever is causing that sleep

02:31:52.279 --> 02:31:56.979
disruption, you know, is still there. You're
just sedating your brain and trying to mask

02:31:56.979 --> 02:31:58.119
it.

02:31:58.119 --> 02:32:02.739
So I think people who are using those things,
if they're having sleep difficulties, you

02:32:02.739 --> 02:32:07.949
should ask yourself, could I examine my life
and really think more about what it is that

02:32:07.949 --> 02:32:13.979
is preventing me from sleeping. What's good
is that you don't have to turn to any of those

02:32:13.979 --> 02:32:18.510
because there is a non-pharmacological treatment
but is just as effective as sleeping pills

02:32:18.510 --> 02:32:23.739
in the short-term. It is completely safe.
And it is more efficacious in the long-term.

02:32:23.739 --> 02:32:30.499
And it's called cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia or CBTI.

02:32:30.499 --> 02:32:34.540
Based on its efficacious nature, and they've
been done lots of randomized clinical control

02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:41.160
trials, it is just as powerful as sleeping
pills in the short-term. But when you stop

02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.729
working with your therapist, and you work
with a therapist for several sessions across

02:32:44.729 --> 02:32:51.770
several weeks, when you stop working with
a therapist, you don't go back to the bad

02:32:51.770 --> 02:32:55.970
sleep that you have. You continue on with
your good sleep. Unlike sleeping pills, which

02:32:55.970 --> 02:33:00.479
is when you stop them, you have what we call
rebound insomnia, which is that you tend to

02:33:00.479 --> 02:33:04.739
go back to the bad sleep that you are having,
if not worse sleep that you are having before

02:33:04.739 --> 02:33:07.030
you started taking sleeping pills.

02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:12.600
And the danger surround sleeping pills and
their lack of true benefit above and beyond

02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:21.949
placebo, which is, if you look at these meta
analyses, in 2015 or 2016, the American College

02:33:21.949 --> 02:33:27.439
of Physicians made a landmark recommendation.
They said that sleeping pills must no longer

02:33:27.439 --> 02:33:32.319
be the first line recommended treatment for
insomnia. It must be cognitive behavioral

02:33:32.319 --> 02:33:39.420
therapy for insomnia because of both the deleterious,
deathly, and carcinogenic consequences of...or

02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:43.350
association with...I shouldn't say cause because
we don't yet know cause. But certainly they

02:33:43.350 --> 02:33:49.399
are associated with higher mortality risk
and higher cancer rates. CBTI, this cognitive

02:33:49.399 --> 02:33:53.220
behavioral therapy, must be the first-line
recommendation treatment.

02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:58.420
The problem is most doctors don't know about
it because most doctors get a less than two

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:03.029
hours of sleep education during the medical
curriculum. And this is another crusade that

02:34:03.029 --> 02:34:07.170
I am on. I am desperately trying to reach
out to all medical curriculum, not just here

02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:12.100
in the United States but in all nations where
you have medical programs. We need a greater

02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:17.819
degree of medical education. Our doctors are
not at fault at, you know, not understanding

02:34:17.819 --> 02:34:22.130
sleep. They have not been educated about sleep,
you know.

02:34:22.130 --> 02:34:26.450
So I teach a class here at University of California
Berkeley. It's usually around 500 or 600 kids.

02:34:26.450 --> 02:34:31.529
It's the Science of Sleep. And they get 25,
hopefully, meaningful lectures about sleep

02:34:31.529 --> 02:34:39.109
across the semester. They will have had somewhere
between 10 to 15 times more sleep education

02:34:39.109 --> 02:34:42.970
than the standard doctor that you will go
and see. You know, most doctors don't ask

02:34:42.970 --> 02:34:47.979
how much sleep that you're getting despite
it being this fundamental, you know...Sleep

02:34:47.979 --> 02:34:55.010
is a life support system, and it is mother
nature's best effort yet at immortality. And

02:34:55.010 --> 02:35:00.851
it's a key to disease, and it's a key to potentially
helping treat or even prevent disease. Most

02:35:00.851 --> 02:35:03.939
doctors don't ask because most doctors aren't
educated.

02:35:03.939 --> 02:35:06.840
[Rhonda]: Right. Nutrition is another one
of those areas.

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:08.789
[Matt]: It's right up that, you know...

02:35:08.789 --> 02:35:12.270
[Rhonda]: But thankfully, we have people like
you who are doing phenomenal research and

02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:18.779
also communicating that research quite nicely.
I read your book. It was a really great book.

02:35:18.779 --> 02:35:19.859
It's "Why We Sleep."

02:35:19.859 --> 02:35:20.859
[Matt]: Thank you.

02:35:20.859 --> 02:35:25.899
[Rhonda]: So if people do want to learn more
about your research, about sleep, about anything

02:35:25.899 --> 02:35:29.350
related to sleep or what you do, they can
find you...

02:35:29.350 --> 02:35:34.680
[Matt]: They can find me, unfortunately, all
over the internet. My handle on social media

02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:42.280
is @sleepdiplomat, all one word, so @sleepdiplomat.
You will find me on Twitter. You will find

02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:48.840
me sleepdiplomat.com on the web. My center
here at University of California Berkeley

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:53.470
is the Center of Human Sleep Science. If you
just google that, you will find that. And

02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:57.069
there's lots of content. And if you would
like an education on sleep, or you're just

02:35:57.069 --> 02:36:02.989
interested in sleep, or you're struggling
with sleep, the book which has been out now

02:36:02.989 --> 02:36:07.550
and it is out now in paperback, is called
"Why We Sleep." It is published by Scribner

02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:12.130
here in the United States, and it's published
by Penguin back in the United Kingdom.

02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:16.870
[Rhonda]: Well, Matt, thank you so much for
taking some time out of your busy day to speak

02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:19.279
with me. I really really enjoyed this competition.

02:36:19.279 --> 02:36:22.739
[Matt]: You're very welcome. Thank you so
much for being such a wonderful sleep ambassador.

02:36:22.739 --> 02:36:26.710
You know, I am on a mission. I'm desperately
trying to reach the public because I think

02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:32.869
this this message has been the neglected stepsister
in the health conversation of today. But I

02:36:32.869 --> 02:36:37.050
can't do it alone. I need to partner with,
you know, fantastic scientists and public

02:36:37.050 --> 02:36:42.070
figures, people like yourself who, you know,
provide this platform and this forum. So I'm

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:46.979
going to anoint you as a sleep ambassador
now as well. So thank you. But just generally,

02:36:46.979 --> 02:36:51.210
thank you for this opportunity to reach your
audience and speak about sleep. I really do

02:36:51.210 --> 02:36:53.209
appreciate it so much.
