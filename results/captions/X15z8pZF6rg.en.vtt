00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.572

Okay.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.984
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.555
Well, hello,
Steve.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.356
Yeah, uh,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.691
Yeah,
we've met before --

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.460

How -- How old
are you, man?
How old am I?

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.031
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.099
You know you can't tell
your age in show business,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.434
'cause then
you don't get parts.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.337
Really?
Yeah, you --
you know that.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:40.840
Anyway, Steve, I just wanted
to come out here and say hi.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.841
I love the show.
Do you really?

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:44.477
I do.
I love the show.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.846
You know, why am I talking
to him like he real?

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.115
[ Laughter ]

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.518
I'm so caught up --

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.086
I'm like
I'm into this dude, man.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.388
You know what?
What?

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.957
I-I feel the same way
when talking to you, Steve.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.225
Oh!

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.661
It's like
you're actually there.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.996
[ Laughter ]

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.298
So Walter wanted
to come out here

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.566
and help introduce the family.
Is that all right?

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.900
That'll be perfect.
Let's do it.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.736
Okay, good. Okay.
So, h-how do you do this?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.003
You go,
"Hey, this is so and so,"

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.304
and just
move down the line?

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.607
Well, I mean, Walter,
you came out here...

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.576
Yeah.
...so don't --
do you know everybody?

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.944
Do you think it was my idea
to come out here, Steve?

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:23.216
[ Laughter ]

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.118
I mean, but do you know
these people?

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.386
Oh, yeah.
Oh, of course I do.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.988
What do you think?
I paid for all their colleges.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.792
[ Laughter ]

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.493

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.661
[ Applause ]

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:38.230
Well, what you do
is just go down the line...

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.166
Oh.
...and just introduce
each one of them one at a time.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.170
Okay.
And you -- you try to say
something kind about people.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.171
Oh, oh, okay.
That ought
to throw you off.

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:48.173
That is a tough for you,
isn't it, Steve?

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.376
No, it's a tough one
for you.
Okay, I got it.
All right.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.044
You're the angry
old man, so --
I know.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.913
Well,

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:12.298

Yeah. Thanks for coming, man.
Glad to have you again.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.519
Yeah. Y-You know
how I learned to do that?

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.987
Just watching you,
Steve.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:37.457
Yeah, yeah. I teach
a lot of people stuff.
Yeah.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.326
Hey, Walter, what charity
are you playing for?

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.761
Oh. Go ahead, Walter.
You know this.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.696
Yeah, well,

It's, uh, Baby2Baby.

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.500
That's good.
Yeah, it is.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.803
And it benefits, uh, kids that
are from low-income families,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.105
and they get all the stuff
that they need like diapers

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.673
and all the stuff
for kids.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:56.009
Great.
