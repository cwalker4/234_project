00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.970
So we are back on this 30 by 40 garage and I'm gonna do my best to take you guys through

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.359
How we build these so that you know, this is the size of shop garage building

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.979
Whatever that I think just about anybody can build. Yes, you might not have a mega deck

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
You might not have a Kubota skid loader, but I've built these with none of those you can go rent an auger

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.439
put some holes in the ground and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.109
Most of this stuff is liftable by a couple guys. So 30 by 40

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.439
12 foot tall is what we're doing here. Not everybody needs that sometimes ten foot is all you need. So

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.899
First thing I'm gonna do is get the rotary laser set up last time

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.749
We were here. We dug the holes we set these and it's been a couple days now, so we're back

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.889
We're gonna start building on them. I am gonna even though we set all these off of a laser

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.829
I'm gonna go back around and I'm gonna get my laser

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.660
measurement to grade once again on each one of these brackets

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.640
Once the laser is set up. I'm going to I've already done this for the sake of TV

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.030
Found the highest bracket which one I get my laser mark is 41 and 3/8 now

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.369
I've also gone around and looked at the rest of them and what that means is my goal was to have these

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.340
concrete piers about 6 inches below

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.629
Finished concrete on the inside. Ok, this is gonna get a concrete floor

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.188
I wanted it about 6 inches below the top of the concrete, which means in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.309
Average is what I found is we're really close to 40 inches being my grade. So I'm gonna come in here

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.169
Or sorry 40 inches is where I want my actual grade board bottom to be so

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.189
Yep

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.189
You're my Blaser Greg

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.799
So at 41 and 3/8, I'm gonna mark this bracket

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.430
1 in 3/8 what that means is my post is gonna come up and add about 1 in 3/8 from the top of the bottom

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.970
Of that post that's where my grade board is gonna be and that's what's gonna be

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.409
Consistent that measurement is going to be consistent around all of these brackets

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
pretty simple

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.550
So 41 1516 which means 1

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.989
1516 so pretty simple. I'm gonna go around and do that all

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.660
Every bracket and then we'll go ahead and use these measurements on our story pole to make up our post

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.860
So now that we have every measurement for every post I've got it on my little block

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.280
I'm gonna put it on my horses and then these are

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.769
These are Ohio Timberland and these are three ply

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.580
Laminated two by sixes every board go through a mill to bring it to a true dimension

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.160
So when I take a tape measure to these posts

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.690
They're actually not five-and-a-half. They're only five and 3/8 and instead of four and a half. They're more like four and a quarter

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.660
But what that does is that allows us to know exactly that every post is perfect

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.460
The other thing you'll notice about these post a

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.070
Little little trick for you to metal banding you don't want to stand in front of it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.219
But just put your just put the clog the hammer in there

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.679
Break right in half. Anyway, what you'll know is they come with the center knotch

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.300
loose

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.309
So this way once we determine exactly where everything is we can cut this center block to accept our trust

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.720
That way we cut this to be perfect for our trust to go right in the inside and you'll see that later

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.080
so the key to the efficiency side of making up your posts on the ground is a story pole and

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.649
All that is is a two by four that are copy two by six

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.250
Whatever just some long piece of wood or whatever material that you're going to keep and use on every one of your post

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.959
And so what we're gonna do is first off the bottom of this 2x4 is gonna be our grade

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.200
okay, that is when we were doing our laser marks on our

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.289
brackets that dimension that plus one and three-quarters one and five sixteenths that is

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.469
From the bracket plus one in five sixteenths is at the bottom of this board on our post. So hopefully that makes sense

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.410
It'll probably make more sense as we go but I'm gonna hook my bottom of my story pole. This is a 12-foot wall

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.710
So I'm gonna mark 12-foot

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.280
Now what that is is that is gonna be the heel of our trust. That's the bottom of our trust on

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.829
Every post the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to determine the top of our post which I already know

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.179
But I'm gonna do it here on the I got a calculator app. I use it's called builders helper on iOS

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.900
and

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.490
basically, I'm gonna do

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.000
12-foot okay, because I know that's our height of our that's the height of our post or the height of our wall

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.010
I'm going to add

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.719
15 and a half inches, which is the height of the heel of our truss and then I'm gonna add three and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.390
eleven

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.060
Sixteenths and I see eleven. Yes, eleven sixteenths. That is the dimension

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.549
Height-wise of a two-by-four went on a 4-12 pit. So without going too deep

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.620
You know, you can always DM me or ask me later if you want to get more in depth into this

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.400
That is 13 7 and 3/16 now that is the very highest point of the framing on our wall

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.709
I then I'm going to take away our

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.289
Overhang pitch, which is a 4:12 pitch roof. We got a 1 foot overhang. So on that 1 foot

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.989
I'm going to go down the hill four inches. So I'm gonna take away 4 inches then I'm going to take away

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.740
the

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.199
Fascia dimension which we use a 2 by 6. So I'm gonna take away another 5 and a half inches, so that leaves me

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.979
That leaves me with 12 foot 9 and 11 16. So now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mark 12 foot nine

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.819
Eleven sixteenths what this is

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:35.019
That is the top of our last dirt on our post and that is also at is the top of our soffit

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.650
so what we do is we mark this on every post we put a two by six here and

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.209
We know when we go to run our soffit trim as long as it's flush on the top of this board

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.380
It's going to be perfect where we want it. Okay. So now the next thing to do

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.349
And this is where

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.468
Consistency and efficiencies help save you time

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:01.029
We always go 39 inches for the bottom of our wainscoting a ler. So that's always going to be 39. I know that

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.949
And the reason we do that is our wainscot will come up

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.769
Onto this two by six in a good dimension that we'll be able to put our trims and everything works out real nice

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.509
Now the next thing I always do is I take from that wainscot mark

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.589
To the top of our soffit nailer which this is about 115 inches

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.799
And I'm always trying to determine a good dimension for our wall Gert spacing

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.009
So I already know that these are 30 inch spacings because it just works out good. So now all I'm gonna do is from this

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.049
Wainscot nailer is I'm going to mark every 30 inches. So 30

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.930
60 90

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.380
And then the next one is gonna be our soffit nailer

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.399
Go ahead and square these all around

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.690
And that's our story poles so now what we can do is I've got

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.889
I've got all the dimensions of all of our posts. I'm gonna hook the bottom of the column and I'm gonna go one

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.910
3/4 square that line

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.509
That is the grade measurement that we always talk about I then take my story pole. I

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.840
Set it to that grade mark and I come through

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:45.379
And I mark every mark on this post I

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.019
Forgot to mark my cutoff height we were talking about

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.569
All these dimensions, but this is where we're gonna cut off the tops of our post

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.159
So by having that dimension we are able to have a consistent top cut on the pitch of all of our posts

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.890
so

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.799
All I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna do that same process on every one of these post right here and then we'll get them

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.640
Over to the building so we can start building the walls

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.539
we're gonna take all of the grade marks from earlier put them on the bottom of these post and then use our story poll to

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.690
Quickly and efficiently make the exact same marks on every post

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.619
Now that all of our columns are marked from our story poles

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.179
It's time to make them up and there's a couple different steps that I have to do at the end one being

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:50.479
What you see me doing here where I'm cutting the ears back to a fourth-wall pitch and that is going to line up

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:56.810
With the tops of our purlins for the most part, I like to do that just because it makes it look more professional

00:09:57.329 --> 00:10:01.759
One of the other steps we have to do is I have all of our columns come with that Center notch

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.360
knocked out and not glued in or fastened so I can pull it out real quickly like this and wherever we

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.579
Designated our heel mark on the post. I'm gonna cut it right there once this is cut

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:16.189
I'm gonna actually put it right back in in the pocket and

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.859
That will now be the height of our truss and so obviously with the story pole with the laser

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:29.989
this is gonna allow us to guarantee that our trusses are all installed at the exact same height and obviously that's important for

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.709
Many reasons but we like to use some 20 penny nails

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:39.319
This is kind of a part where we could use the Jumbo nailer to do this a little bit quicker

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.749
But I actually enjoy just swinging the hammer a little bit. So we're gonna cut our ears off we're going to

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.539
Just repeat this process many times

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.849
But all in one spot on some saw horses not up in the air

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.149
a lot of guys will

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:59.779
Put their posts up long wild and then come back through later and cut them at the truss height

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:01.939
I'd prefer to do it now. It looks better

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:07.909
It looks more professional and when you leave for the night, the customers are looking at it. They just think everything looks good

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.709
So what I'm doing here is putting a interior board and this is going to define our corner and we do it now instead of

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.670
Later once again

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:44.509
it's efficient and easy here versus when the walls are already stood up and what this what this board is doing is because

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.850
Really hard to explain but basically we're trying to build out the corner to a five and a half dimension

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.989
So when our wall Gertz on the inside come into the corner, they will hit this

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.630
two by six right here

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.259
And what we're using to is these are twenty penny

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.600
Ring shank galvanized nails we use all galvanized that wasn't will corrode in any treated lumber

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.360
Even though this is supposed to be non, correct?

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:28.520
So then we've got our our story pole that we also mark the inside mark so we can have all of our

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.410
To the heal on my corner board

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.140
Market

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.119
What you're seeing us do here is a little bit different than the side wall columns

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.489
These are our end wall columns in order to be efficient

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.300
I go ahead and order the exact same size columns for all posts

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.809
But I want my end wall columns to go all the way up to the top of the trust

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.609
So I use that Builders app to get a calculation for height and I extend

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.150
My Center notch

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.389
To go all the way up to the top of the trust and I do that to add a lot of strength to the end

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.569
Wall and get a connection from ground to the top of the truss

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.539
Once all of our columns are made we're gonna lay them out to the corresponding bracket and

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.529
Then lay out our wall Gertz on all those designated marks from our story poll

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:24.409
And this is where a lot of efficiency comes into play instead of sanding each column individually

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:30.170
We do the wall as a unit and it makes it a ton easier. I swear this is still the same day

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.839
We just got back from lunch put on my buddy Hashmi constructions assurity sent us

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:43.310
Greg's got one the did the sleeveless framer look for us today because it is a little bit sultry out here

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.690
We got the Itachi compressor fired up, which means the Jumbo

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.240
nailer from fast goes coming out

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.729
You can see it right here. This is

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.209
definitely not something that your average homeowner is going to have this thing shoots up to a six and

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.690
Three-eighths nail you can see it's quite large

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.430
F91

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:10.489
And what we're shooting these are four inch ring shank galvanized

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.089
they have the diamond coating which makes the nail go in easier and

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.320
holds stronger also full round head

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:23.719
That's going to increase holding power. I tell you what, this is a legit fastener

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.029
It holds way better than a hand driven 20 penny ring shank. So

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.810
Time to get to work we'll get all these nailed up

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.919
We'll be able to stand up these walls in one section at a time. So

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:43.398
No worries about any splices, but right now working on the ground that is what's going to be efficient

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:47.899
it's going to be easy you're gonna be able to be precise and you can control a lot of variables by doing it on the

00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:49.899
ground

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.029
What I like about the Jumbo nailer is

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.759
Connections like this driving a nail

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.070
Out like you do when you drive a nail but

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.800
when we get to these top four

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:25.320
Where we have to put a nail in this year instead of using the gun and having a possible blowout like a hand drive

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.780
This connection so we'll come back hit back

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.559
One thing we also always try to do this. Let us consider

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.070
This nail our row right? Here is the

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.740
wainscot nailer and

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:42.960
This is the one everybody looks down. This is the one that you want it straight in classical. So try to get the best

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.259
material possible out of your pile

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.529
You got this bro

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.890
Now a lot of people might be saying it will dial

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.689
Nail guns have been around for a long time. Like why are you saying it's big deal? Welcome toaster a typically

00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:18.019
you're not going to use a nail gun, like a pass load or even the Hitachi or DeWalt cordless for that matter because

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.360
You can't shoot a big enough nail

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.860
You can't shoot a large enough diameter nail or a big enough ring shank nail

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.539
And you really need that in the post frame because that's where the strength is that these connection

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.949
We got the walls all put together

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:40.219
Look at the split e with the Jumbo nailer now, we're gonna go ahead and rig it up to the Cheyenne

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:45.529
Tella boom that sucker is priceless on the post frame jobsite

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:50.269
especially when it's buildings usually 48 foot and

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.870
Thinner I guess I would say since we're talking with

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.040
48 foot or less. We'll use the lead Pella

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.159
Boom, even though I think it's good up - we've done 60 wives

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:05.089
So we're just going to wrap a couple post pick this thing right up

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:11.568
and once again the point of this process as I about tripped and died the point of this process is to

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:16.579
Do all the work on the ground use a machine to lift your material into place and hold?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:22.010
It while you can make sure things are level straight plumb all that good stuff

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:25.939
Get it fast into then let go of the machine that way you're doing very minimal

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.859
Manual labor. It's a lot of hard work out here and the less you have to do physically

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.720
challenge your mind make it simpler in the

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.080
labor side
