00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.438
Is there a supernatural
dimension,

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:07.641
a world beyond the one we know?

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:13.714
Is there life after death?

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.483
Do angels exist?

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:22.789
Can our dreams contain messages
from Heaven?

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.528
Can we tap into ancient secrets
of the supernatural?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.531
Are healing miracles real?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:37.671
Sid Roth has spent over 35 years
researching the strange world of

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.406
the supernatural.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:51.618
Join Sid for this edition of
It's Supernatural.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.120
Hello.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.187
Sid Roth here.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:59.226
Welcome to my world where it's
naturally supernatural.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.928
Now let's be real.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.630
Have you prayed, have you
fasted,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.301
have you moaned, have you
groaned for your physical

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.938
healing and it didn't happen,
and year after year,

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.775
after year passed and it didn't
happen?

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.945
My guest knows why.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.013
Anyone interested?

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:31.224
So you're 19 years old.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.893
You wake up one morning.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:38.065
You go to the mirror to shave
and you see a lump the size of

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.101
an egg coming out of your neck.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:46.139
Now you had a Catholic
background,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.243
so you believe the basics of the
Gospel,

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.447
but you didn't have what the
Messiah said is necessary,

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.148
and so few have this.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.919
This is what our Messiah said in
the original language: "This is

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:04.057
eternal life that you might have
experiential knowledge of me."

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.426
He didn't have experiential
knowledge.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.129
He had no grid for miracles, so
to speak.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.298
So what did you do?

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.800
When I discovered that lump and
was diagnosed with

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.670
cancer I did not know what to
do.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.773
I just felt fear and terror.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:25.746
But something within me caused
me to cry out to the God

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.347
that I heard about.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.816
I didn't know him personally,
but I heard about him.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:35.756
And so I went to the beach to be
alone and nobody was there.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.157
It was a cloudy day.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.993
I sat on the beach and I looked
up at the sky

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.063
to the God out there somewhere.

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:50.504
So from my belly a very simple
prayer came and it consisted of

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.371
only two words.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.640
I said to the God out there
somewhere,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.841
"Teach me."

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.112
And I forgot about that day.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:01.882
But three months later, God
did not forget about that day.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.050
He did not.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.717
What happened?

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:08.588
I met a man who I can tell you
emphatically with

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.658
great confidence is a true
disciple of Jesus Christ.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:14.561
He's a man that was born in
South Korea.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.299
And I went to him looking for
alternative methods of getting

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.902
well, and I asked him, I said, I
told him,

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.237
I said, "I have cancer."

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:27.574
And he continued to smile at me
and then I thought he must not

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:32.746
know English because everybody
that you tell them you have

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.514
cancer, oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.216
But he just smiled at me.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.053
Now I know he smiled because he
knew that God sent me to him.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.523
And when I asked, "What books
can I study?

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.358
What things can I go research?"

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.361
He says, "You don't need many
books.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.464
You only need one book."

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:53.166
He had been reading when I
walked in.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.169
He slid that book across the
table and it was covered with

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.006
black leather, gilded pages, and
I realized it was the Bible.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.743
And I said, "What does this have
to do with me being sick?"

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.046
I'm thinking medical science is
here.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:09.116
A prayer is far away over there.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.017
There is always alternative
health, too.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.085
That's right.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.987
And so when I asked that
question,

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.556
what does the Bible have to do
with me being sick,

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.492
he leaned across the desk.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.827
He looked in my eyes and he
said, "Everything."

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:25.432
That started a five-hour Bible
study.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.868
You sat there for five
hours.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:28.401
For five hours.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.505
Sid, it felt like five minutes,
but I was there for five hours.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:35.675
And the way that he introduced
the Bible to me was unique.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.244
It's not something I had
experienced.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:40.947
He would open it and pointed to
a verse and he'd say in his

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.015
Korean accent, "Read it."

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.150
I'd read it.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.518
He'd flip the Bible.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:45.318
"Read it."

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.920
And we went through this
process.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.024
He was allowing the Word of God,
literally the words of God to

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.093
speak to my heart.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.630
And I found out that day I had a
bigger problem than cancer.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.199
I found out that day that I had
sin,

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.570
it was not washed clean and I
was going to Hell.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.942
So that day, I understood for
the first time who God is,

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:13.113
who Satan is and who I was.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:19.119
And I learned that the Messiah
offered me payment for all my

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.724
sin, but more than that, I
learned that by removing my sin

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:29.529
opened the gate to experience
complete healing,

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.266
mentally, physically and
spiritually.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.835
What was going on inside of
you while

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.804
he was explaining this?

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.706
You know, it's an interesting
question because

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.509
there was a side of me that was
filled with expectation.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.745
As I was reading the Word of God
I didn't know.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.348
You had no expectation
before you started teaching.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.115
I didn't.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:53.353
But the Word of God was so clear
to me that day that it was

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.921
creating the expectation.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:58.491
I was reading about where cancer
comes from,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.993
the root of sickness.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:03.697
I was reading about how Jesus
healed everyone.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:08.902
I was reading a promise that he
died on the cross not just for

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:11.771
my sin, but that I would be
healed,

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.540
that he took my pain.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.708
He took my sorrow.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:20.380
So the scriptures, not the
tradition of man that I had been

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.282
exposed to my whole life, but
the scriptures

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:25.185
set my expectation.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:28.021
But he declared to me that day,
"Today,

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:33.059
Steve, you will be healed."

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.794
Didn't he realize you had
cancer,

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:38.265
you had some radiation, your
body was destroyed by the

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:40.634
cancer, your body was destroyed
by the radiation?

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:41.768
Didn't he know that?

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:42.836
He knew it all.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:46.973
I told him all the details and I
was the kind of person that

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:52.012
wanted people to know how bad it
was and what could happen,

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:54.714
and none of that mattered.

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.416
And I understand now why.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:01.554
He cared so little about what
the devil was doing because he

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.291
was so focused on what God had
done through

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.693
Yeshua on the cross.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:13.333
He was consumed with the love of
God and the promise of God,

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.634
and the covenant of God.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.605
So he knew that day what had
happened was irrelevant.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.208
What was about to happen, that
was relevant.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.209
What happened?

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.312
He took me through the process
of saying,

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:27.213
well now that you've give your
heart to God,

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.517
all the promises, not some of
them,

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:34.321
but all the promises are yes and
amen in Jesus.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:37.457
He immediately, without any
other learning,

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.893
I just heard the covenanted
promise,

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.962
he stood me up, he laid his
hands on my head,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.364
which I had never seen before.

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.133
But he laid his hands on my head
and he commanded,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.337
"In the name of Yeshua, Jesus,"
he

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:52.872
commanded the cancer to leave.

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:56.276
Sid, immediately, I had no
context,

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:57.911
no experience.

00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.913
I didn't know there was
Christian television.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:03.216
I never went to a Christian
church before like this.

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:06.886
But power filled the room and
filled my body.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:11.858
I remember wondering what is
happening because the power was

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.393
coming from everywhere.

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:20.567
And then a circle of entities
appeared around us that now I

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.302
understand were angels.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:26.139
And he began with such
vehemence,

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.908
with such authority, with such
power,

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:34.814
he began to command, and I knew
from the soles of my feet power

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:38.418
was coming up and all the evil,
all the cancer,

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:41.421
all my fears, I didn't just have
cancer.

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:42.922
I had OCD.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.023
I had fears.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.058
I had great anxiety.

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:47.527
But these things people don't
care about

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.130
as much as cancer. But God does.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.767
And that day, I felt all of
that,

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.070
all that which was cursed
separating from my body.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.073
When he commanded it to go in
the name of Jesus,

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:05.912
every unclean spirit, everything
was broken in a moment and it

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.914
departed from my body.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:14.521
When we come back, many
people have a disconnect between

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.858
the promises of God and the
provision of God.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.194
It shouldn't be that way.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:27.534
Come on back and it won't be.

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:31.538
We'll be right back to It's
Supernatural.

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:07.607
We now return to It's
Supernatural.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:15.915
So Steve not only got
totally healed of all the fear

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:20.053
and everything he had, God
totally healed of all the cancer

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:23.857
he had, but at that moment, even
the bad effects of the radiation

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:26.192
disappeared from his body.

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:32.599
You have a passion to share that
same connection that allowed you

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.668
to be totally set free for
everyone,

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:39.539
and it starts with something
that people

00:10:39.539 --> 00:10:40.974
just take for granted.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.610
It's called the Bible.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.544
Yes.

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:48.448
Tell me what God has shown
you about the Word of God.

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:52.352
Sid, we don't know the treasure
that Heaven

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:56.723
has entrusted to us when he gave
the 66 books of the Bible.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.926
The Bible is the most
misunderstood,

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.729
mistaught, misrepresented thing,
I believe,

00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:06.966
in all the Christian faith,
because people say I believe the

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.135
Word of God, but they know not
truly what it is.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:14.140
So God over time began to teach
me that the Bible is not the

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.976
black leather book people think
it is,

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:21.748
but rather that the Bible
contains the very mind,

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:27.754
spirit and word, and heartbeat
of the Father.

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:31.257
You believe the Bible is
alive.

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:31.925
I do.

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:32.659
I do.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:33.860
I'm persuaded of it.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.496
You know, before there was ever
the earth,

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:40.166
before there was ever paper,
there was ever leather to bind

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.969
that paper, God said, before
anything else,

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:46.072
he said, "Let there be light."

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:51.778
I was studying one day and the
Lord asked me or put on my

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:53.112
heart, what language did I
speak.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.148
There was no Hebrew.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.049
There was no Greek.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.017
There was no English.

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:58.851
There was no Spanish.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:03.223
What God showed me was in First
John,

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:06.859
the Bible says that God is light
and in him there is no darkness.

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:10.430
So in Genesis, he said, "Let
there be light."

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.799
Sid, God began to teach me.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.168
When God said let there be
light,

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:20.073
he was saying let there be me
there.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.541
He was releasing himself.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:27.513
So the revelation of the book we
call the Bible is actually the

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.783
very release of God himself from

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:33.753
the heavens into the earth
realm.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:41.728
So when Peter walked on
water,

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:46.899
you say God showed you something
even higher.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.700
Yes.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.401
What?

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.703
Peter had an intimacy with
Jesus.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.973
He didn't have an intimacy with
just religious protocol or

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:54.874
traditions of men.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.676
He was with Jesus.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:13:00.446
And in the middle of a storm, a
scary time,

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:04.484
they see Jesus come walking on
the water

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:06.886
and they cried out for fear.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.822
They never expected Jesus to
appear

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:13.393
as the supernatural God that he
is.

00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:17.697
And Peter, in his boldness, from
his faith,

00:13:17.697 --> 00:13:23.269
said, "Lord, if it's you,
command me to come out to you."

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:27.173
There's a lot of revelation in
this because Peter was saying,

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:30.576
bring me under the command of
your voice.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:34.347
Bring me under the power of your
voice.

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:39.419
If I come under your word I'll
enter the realm of Glory that

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.853
your word is in.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:45.892
And so a lot of people think
that Peter was walking on water,

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:50.663
but in reality his prayer was,
"Command me to come."

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:56.536
It's very interesting that Jesus
explicitly answers Peter exactly

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:58.571
according to his prayer, and
Jesus says,

00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.605
"Come."

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:02.075
Peter didn't really walk on
water.

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:09.782
He walked on the command of God
given by his Word,

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:14.887
and that was the key that moved
him from a life lived,

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:19.726
tossed in the boat, to walking
on top of the circumstances that

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.928
was beating that boat.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:23.930
Just that little revelation
that he shared,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.200
that little nugget that he just
shared,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.303
you dust off that little black
book you got for your Bar

00:14:30.303 --> 00:14:35.208
Mitzvah or you got for your
confirmation and realize that he

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:39.412
has just said that black book is
God himself.

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:47.453
And when you value God himself
your heart cries out to him and

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:49.021
there will be a connection.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.059
In fact, I'm going to have him
share a couple more revelations

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.362
and then pray for you to walk on
water.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:59.198
Whether it's cancer, heart
disease,

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:04.937
tumors, anything, God says all
of his promises

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.573
are yes and so be it.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:12.478
Be right back.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:15.615
We'll be right back to It's
Supernatural.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:51.871
We now return to It's
Supernatural.

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:55.541
Okay.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:58.344
It's wonderful that Steve
Hannett has his miracle.

00:17:58.344 --> 00:18:04.417
It's wonderful that he now knows
how to have the disconnect

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.853
removed and just connect into
the power of God.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:13.392
But when he teaches this, so
many people have the plug

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.895
plugged in for the power of God.

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:20.099
Tell me about one member of your
congregation that heard your

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:24.437
teaching that had a tragedy
turned into a blessing.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.304
Yes.

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:29.208
We had a husband and wife come
to us who were pregnant and they

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:32.378
were very disheartened and
filled with fear.

00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:37.583
They came and they told us that
the first ultrasound of their

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.920
baby revealed all the markers
for Down's syndrome,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.523
for echo bowel syndrome, a flat
nasal,

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.525
cysts on the brain and other
abnormalities.

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:52.198
The condition of the child, the
medical professionals said was

00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:56.802
so bad they recommended that
they abort the child.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.272
They came to us and they shared
the news that we had.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:05.177
By the grace of God, we knew it
did not matter what the devil

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:08.814
was busy doing, we knew what God
had already done on the cross

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.949
through his son Yeshua.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:14.220
And we began to teach them the
principles and

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.322
the covenanted promises of God.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:19.625
They took these promises and
they began to pray them.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.894
They began to take the
revelation that

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.763
the Word of God is created.

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.064
It changes things.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:28.167
They went from the revelation
that this is a black book

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.568
to the Living Word.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:32.471
They went back to the doctor and
they told the doctor.

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.773
"We're going to have the baby."

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:37.309
The doctor happened to be an
atheist and with a certain

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.678
degree of anger, the way they
described it to us,

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.381
was that the doctor said, "I
don't care how much you pray,

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:45.117
this is not removing Down's
syndrome."

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.054
The woman, praise God, filled
with faith,

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:50.589
turned to the atheist doctor and
said,

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:53.692
"You don't know my God."

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:59.698
It was time to deliver the child
and they were so convinced that

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.434
the child was going to have
these abnormalities they had

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:04.603
special medical personnel around
to whisk the baby away.

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:08.340
But what was going on with
this couple during that time?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.643
They were laboring in the Word.

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:13.379
They told me sometimes it was
easy and sometimes it was hard.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.181
There was a struggle, but they

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:17.183
were praying the importune
prayer.

00:20:17.183 --> 00:20:19.385
They were praying like Jacob, "I
won't let go

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.721
of thee until you bless me."

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.723
And they prayed that way until
the delivery.

00:20:24.723 --> 00:20:28.994
Did they believe that perhaps
the doctors were correct

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:32.264
that their baby would be Down's
syndrome?

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.968
They knew in the natural that
what the doctors

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.137
were reporting was accurate.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:44.543
What they knew in the Spirit
that what God Almighty was

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.746
reporting was accurate.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:52.685
They believed the right voice
and they had the facts that

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.887
their child was going to be
deformed,

00:20:54.887 --> 00:21:00.392
but they had the truth that
God's Word was going to rectify

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:01.160
it and change it.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.230
The day of delivery came.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:11.637
The child was born and the
atheist doctor said,

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.740
"This child is perfect."

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.875
Ha!

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.010
No Down's syndrome,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.813
no echo bowel syndrome, no flat
nasal.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:25.885
God did a creative miracle and
this little girl runs around our

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:29.021
church with curly hair, dancing
and praising the Lord,

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.457
and completely healthy to this
day.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.560
That's the power of the Word
God.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.694
Okay.

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:40.032
Speaking of the power of the
Word of God,

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:44.503
you say we're not waiting for
God,

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.540
God is waiting for us.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:54.046
I want you to pray right now,
but tell me what will happen

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.481
when you pray.

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.515
What is going to happen?

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:57.416
Will people be healed?

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.152
People will be healed and they
will be healed

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.922
because that's the will and
covenant of God.

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:06.859
Sid, God, people are praying,
maybe

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:08.494
you'll give me a little
blessing, God.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.563
They don't understand their
Father nor his goodness.

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:12.164
Heaven can't wait.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:13.199
The Father can't wait.

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:14.600
The son can't wait.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.801
I can't wait.

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:16.702
You pray.

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:17.703
Amen.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:18.737
Listen.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:22.107
Believe with me right now as I
pray.

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:25.811
In the name of Jesus Christ, God
wants you well.

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.146
He's a good Father.

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:31.417
In the name of Jesus, I speak
according to the covenanted work

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:36.522
of God through the Messiah on
the cross that by the stripes of

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.259
Jesus the Messiah, you will be
healed and

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.328
I command every sickness.

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:44.430
I command every disease.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.567
There is somebody with a band of
pain around their head,

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:52.404
the Lord showed me, that pain is
going to disappear.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:57.243
There are people with vision
problems that right now there is

00:22:57.243 --> 00:22:58.177
pain behind your eye.

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:01.180
It's a bad pain right behind
your eyeballs.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.781
It's very, very intense.

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:03.749
It will leave.

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:08.454
In the name of Jesus, I command
every sickness,

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:15.961
every unclean thing to depart in
the name of Jesus Christ the

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:16.695
Messiah.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.864
Amen.

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:22.368
Do you know what I'm
reminded of?

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:29.141
The word "gospel" was originally
used because a king would have a

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:32.011
messenger come from the battle
to report

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:34.046
what happened in the battle.

00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:36.348
And guess what the word "gospel"
means?

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:41.053
Good news, a victory.

00:23:41.053 --> 00:23:44.123
You cannot lose.

00:23:44.123 --> 00:23:46.825
You were created to win.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:51.330
As long as Jesus is your Messiah
and Lord,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.334
as long as you believe he died
for your sins,

00:23:55.334 --> 00:24:00.673
as long as you ask him with the
spoken word to live inside of

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:05.577
you and forgive you of your sins
then you have the true gospel,

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.915
the good news, the good news of
victory.

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:12.251
I say victory for you!

00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:13.319
Amen.

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.768
Next week on It's
Supernatural.

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:57.509
When you put three world class
prophets together there is a

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:03.215
synergy of the Spirit that I'm
expecting things to happen that

00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:05.083
they've never thought of.

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:11.356
I'm expecting you to have an
amazing encounter with God.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:18.897
Anyone interested in finding out
what they see for 2017?
