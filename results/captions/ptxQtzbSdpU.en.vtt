CONTROL SHE HAS OVER HER NEW

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:22.131
PARTY.

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:27.636
THE FINAL ANTI-HATE MEASURE DID

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:31.640
NOT MENTION OMAR BY NAME.

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.008
TELLING FOX NEWS OUR PROBLEMS

KEVIN MCCARTHY BLASTED NANCY

PELOSI FOR FAILING TO REIN IN

LEADERSHIP.

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:46.922
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE DEMOCRATIC

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.858
PARTY WE HAVE COME TO KNOW.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.861
THE TRANSITION IS NOW COMPLETE.

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:54.496
THE DEMOCRATS, SOCIALIST WING OF

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:57.833
THE PARTY CONTROLS THEIR OWN

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:58.233
LEADERSHIP.

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.437
&gt;&gt; BRIAN, NANCY PELOSI REALLY

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:03.973
OWES HER NEW SPEAKERSHIP TO THE

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:06.241
NEW FIRE BRANDS BUT TO THE

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.543
MODERATE THAT WON IN SWING

00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:09.211
DISTRICTS AND BEAT REPUBLICANS.

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:10.846
NOW IT'S LIKE THE ONLY ONE THAT

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:11.914
CAN GET ATTENTION ARE THE

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:13.615
FRESHMAN MEMBERS MAKING A LOT OF

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:13.916
NOISE.

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:16.785
&gt;&gt; IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:20.289
IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS LIKE

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.459
LOOK HOW POWERFUL SHE IS.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.727
THEY THOUGHT CAN SHE GO TO THE

00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:26.462
MIDDLE TO MAKE SURE THE

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:28.097
MODERATES KEEP THEIR SEATS.

00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:31.133
NOW THE STORY IS HOW DID SHE GET

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:34.403
THIS SO OUT OF CONTROL SO THEY

00:01:34.404 --> 00:01:37.673
NEEDED A RESOLUTION THAT SAYS

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:38.674
ANTI-SEMITISM IS WRONG.

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:42.812
NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:46.048
SOMEBODY TOLD US, THIS MINNESOTA

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.017
FRESHMAN, OMAR, WHEN SHE SAID, I

00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:50.186
WILL LET YOU CHANGE THE RULES

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:53.589
BECAUSE I WILL BE WEARING THIS

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.990
HEADDRESS.

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:55.625
181 YEARS NO ONE COULD WEAR

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:58.427
ANYTHING ON THEIR HEADS.

00:01:58.428 --> 00:02:00.563
NOW THEY SAID LINDSEY GRAHAM IS

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:00.963
COMPROMISED.

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:02.665
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:04.567
WE FIND OUT ABOUT HER PAST

00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:06.969
TWEETS AND BACK TRACKING.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.239
NO ONE CAN REIN THEM IN.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.807
I THOUGHT SHE CHOSE IN THE

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:13.509
BEGINNING NOT TO, NOW I REALIZE

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.010
SHE CAN'T.

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.346
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT OR

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.649
DO YOU THINK NOW THEY CAN PULL

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.349
THINGS BACK TOGETHER?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.617
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE

00:02:21.618 --> 00:02:22.118
GOTTEN PAST.

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.889
IT THE RESOLUTION WAS A JOKE.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.226
EVEN DEMOCRATS CRITICIZED IT

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:34.564
EVEN A JEWISH MEMBER OF CONGRESS

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.433
CALLED THEM OUT FOR FAILING TO

00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:38.134
ADDRESS ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:39.636
NANCY PELOSI IS FACING THIS BIG

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:40.236
CHALLENGE.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:43.640
THE PARTY IS GEARING TOWARDS THE

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:43.940
LEFT.

00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.108
YOU LOOK AT MEDICARE FOR ALL

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.643
THAT BERNIE SANDERS INTRODUCED

00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:49.512
IN 2016.

00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:51.247
THAT WAS CONSIDERED OUTSIDE OF

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:52.081
THE MAINSTREAM.

00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:54.751
NOW YOU SEE THE FRONT RUNNERS

00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:56.486
FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:59.022
ELECTION EMBRACING IT.

00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:02.025
YOU LOOK AT THE GREEN DEAL.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:04.427
THE PARTY IS GOING TO THE LEFT.

00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:06.162
THE PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS IS A

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:09.599
LOT OF THESE MODERATE DEMOCRATS

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.835
WHO REPRESENT REPUBLICAN LEANING

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:13.102
DISTRICTS WHO COULD BE JEOPARDY

00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:18.475
IN 2020 AND ALIENATING

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:20.377
INDEPENDENT VOTERS IN 2020 AND

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:21.912
CRITICAL STATES THAT DEMOCRATS

00:03:21.913 --> 00:03:23.647
NEED TO WIN.

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:25.048
&gt;&gt; EVEN NANCY PELOSI SHE TAPPED

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.154
THE BRAKES ON IMPEACHMENT AND

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.023
MEDICARE FOR ALL AND THE GREEN

00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:33.323
DEAL.

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:34.858
YET THAT'S GETTING ALL THE

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.225
ATTENTION.

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:36.259
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MEDIA.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.494
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE THING.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:38.428
THIS IS A CONTROVERSY.

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.697
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING

00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:41.064
ABOUT.

00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:43.533
TO MY MIND, THE BIG SLIP UP HERE

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:45.969
IS WE WOULD BE DISCUSSING THINGS

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.805
LIKE THE REPUBLICAN REVOLT

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:49.873
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT ON THE

00:03:49.874 --> 00:03:51.074
EMERGENCY CLAIM FOR THE BORDER.

00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:54.311
OR WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:03:54.312 --> 00:03:56.046
DEMOCRATIC BILL WHICH TRIES TO

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:58.515
LAYOUT NEW RULES WITH REGARD TO

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:01.018
ETHICES AND CAMPAIGNS AND

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:01.351
VOTING.

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:03.453
THEY HAVE RUN OVER WHAT PELOSI

00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:04.454
WANTED TO BE THE MESSAGE AT THIS

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:04.755
TIME.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:07.157
I WILL SAY THIS, I THINK PELOSI

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:08.759
DID A GREAT JOB.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.427
I DON'T THINK SHE SURROUND THE

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:11.261
PRESSURE YOU DESCRIBE.

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:14.531
SHE HELD HER CAUCUS TOGETHER.

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:15.532
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID IF YOU WON'T LISTEN

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.534
TO ME I WILL LEAVE.

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:18.302
SHE LEFT.

00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:22.372
&gt;&gt; 23 VOTES WENT AGAINST THIS

00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:22.773
RESOLUTION.

00:04:22.774 --> 00:04:27.077
NOT ONE, NOT EVEN PEOPLE SAID BE

00:04:27.078 --> 00:04:30.047
MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT

00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:30.481
ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:04:30.482 --> 00:04:34.284
NOT ONE DEMOCRAT VOTED AGAINST

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:34.551
IT.

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:36.720
IF THEY HAD SPLIT WE WOULD

00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:40.491
REALLY BE FOCUSSED ON PEOPLE

00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:43.293
ESPECIALLY IF A JEWISH MEMBER

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:44.695
VOTED AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION.

00:04:44.696 --> 00:04:47.931
&gt;&gt; LET'S GET GREG IN HERE.

00:04:47.932 --> 00:04:53.204
&gt;&gt; NO, THANK YOU.

00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:56.807
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

00:04:56.808 --> 00:05:00.244
MICHAEL JACKSON SEGMENT.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.314
OMAR SLAMMED PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:03.614
TODAY.

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.616
&gt;&gt; OMAR SAYS THE HOPE AND CHANGE

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:08.886
OFFERED BY BARACK OBAMA WAS A

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:09.253
MIRAGE.

00:05:09.254 --> 00:05:12.890
THE CAGING EVER KIDS AT THE U.S.

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:14.992
BORDER AND THE DEMOCRATIC

00:05:14.993 --> 00:05:18.095
PRESIDENT OPERATED WITH THE SAME

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:23.067
BROKEN FRAMEWORK AS HIS

00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:29.808
REPUBLICAN SUCCESSOR AND SAID:

00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:30.508
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.876
BACK TO WHAT I WAS SAYING.

00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:33.344
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING].

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:35.880
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL JACKSON -- NO ONE IS

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:36.580
SAFE.

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.582
INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.017
SHE SLAMMED PRESIDENT OBAMA.

00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:42.386
DOESN'T SHE KNOW THAT'S OUR JOB?

00:05:42.387 --> 00:05:43.154
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING].

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.690
&gt;&gt; THERE IS TURF IN THIS PLACE.

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.960
SHE IS COMING IN OUR TURF.

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:50.529
THIS IS WHAT THEY DID THAT WAS

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.663
HILARIOUS AND CLEVER.

00:05:51.664 --> 00:05:52.531
THE DEMOCRATS.

00:05:52.532 --> 00:05:53.665
SHE DOES SOMETHING WRONG.

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:57.035
SHE HAS A LITANY OF ANTI-SEMITIC

00:05:57.036 --> 00:05:57.502
SLURS.

00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:59.771
INSTEAD OF PUTTING HER NAME UP

00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:01.072
THERE LIKE WITH STEVE KING, THEY

00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:04.676
THREW IT INTO A BUCKET OF OTHER

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:07.879
WRONGS WHICH DILUTES THE

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.313
CONDEMNATION.

00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:11.016
THAT'S THE STRATEGY BY INSERTING

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:13.451
IT WITH OTHER KINDS OF HATE

00:06:13.452 --> 00:06:16.421
CRIMES AND HATE THOUGHTS AND SO

00:06:16.422 --> 00:06:17.155
ON.

00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:20.392
IT'S LIKE TAKED A BRUISED APPLE

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.828
AND PUTTING IT IN A PILE WITH

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:24.062
OTHER BRUISED APPLES.

00:06:24.063 --> 00:06:25.464
THEY LOOK THE SAME.

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:26.398
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S CLEVER.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.100
I THINK IT'S A WIN FOR HER.

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:28.667
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:32.537
&gt;&gt; A FLAT OUT WIN FOR HER.

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:34.906
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S CLEVER BECAUSE YOU

00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:36.174
HAVE THE REPUBLICANS CAN POINT

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:40.245
TO YOU, AND SAY YOU REPUBLICANS

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:43.014
DIDN'T VOTE FOR AN ANTI-HATE

00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:43.682
BILL.

00:06:43.683 --> 00:06:45.717
YOU MUST BE HATERS.

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:46.985
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING:

00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:54.559
IT'S AMAZING HOW TRADITIONALLY

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.632
LIBERAL THE LEFT AND OLD SCHOOL

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:02.367
CONSERVATIVE THE RIGHT IS.

00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:03.769
YOU HAVE PEACE TALKS IN NORTH

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.436
KOREA.

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:05.737
THE DEMOCRACY CAN'T AGREE ON

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:06.171
ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.739
THEY WANT A COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.040
AGAIN.

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.042
NORTH KOREA AND THE SAUDIS AND

00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:11.210
THEY WANT TO SHUTDOWN DIALOGUE

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:12.578
ON CAMPUS.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:14.646
WE HAVE A FLIP-FLOPPED WORLD.

00:07:14.647 --> 00:07:16.281
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:07:16.282 --> 00:07:18.584
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.084
DEFENDING OBAMA.

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:20.285
&gt;&gt; JUAN, THEY WANT US TO GET

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:23.689
THIS OTHER TOPIC IN.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.391
THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS

00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:31.096
ARE SPLIT OVER THE PARTY'S

00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:32.931
POSITION SHOULD BE.

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:34.767
THE LATEST ELIZABETH WARREN

00:07:34.768 --> 00:07:36.502
WANTING TO BREAK UP BIG TECH

00:07:36.503 --> 00:07:38.470
GIANTS INCLUDING GOOGLE,

00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:40.606
FACEBOOK AND AMAZON.

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:43.709
SHE CLAIMS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.344
POWER.

00:07:45.345 --> 00:07:53.152
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE

00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:53.652
POCAHONTAS STUFF.

00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:54.687
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WILL GO

00:07:54.688 --> 00:08:00.059
ON LEGALLY TO BREAK UP GOOGLE.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.493
YAHOO.

00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:02.228
THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD.

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:03.796
TAKE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING

00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:06.332
ABOUT AMERICA AND DESTROY IT.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.467
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO RUN.

00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:12.338
KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO LEGALIZE

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:15.641
PROSTITUTION, SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:18.444
OR MEDICARE.

00:08:18.445 --> 00:08:19.879
SHE'LL PICK OUT SOMETHING ELSE

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.147
THAT MAKES HER UNIQUE.

00:08:21.148 --> 00:08:23.949
I DON'T THINK THIS WILL RESONATE

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.418
WITH ANYONE WHO HAS A RESPECT

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.386
FOR THE FREE MARKET.

00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:29.689
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO PEOPLE SHOULD BE

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.657
LOOKING AT IS BERNIE SANDERS.

00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:32.959
HE IS THE ONLY DEMOCRAT WHO

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.527
THREW HIS NAME IN THE HAT THAT

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:36.362
IS GENERATING EXCITEMENT ON THE

00:08:36.363 --> 00:08:36.662
LEFT.

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:38.030
YOU ARE SEEING --

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:42.702
&gt;&gt; WHO IS GENUINE.

00:08:42.703 --> 00:08:44.470
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:46.305
HE COMES ACROSS AS AUTHENTIC.

00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:49.008
WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A CROWDED

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:52.011
PRIMARY FIELD UNIQUE SITUATIONS

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:52.345
HAPPEN.

00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:53.413
BERNIE SANDERS IS THE ONE THAT

00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:56.716
EMERGES AS THE FRONTRUNNER IN

00:08:56.717 --> 00:08:59.886
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:02.956
&gt;&gt; SHE GETS CREDIT FOR DOING

00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:03.890
SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE.

00:09:03.891 --> 00:09:05.358
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:09.429
SHE IS ALL ABOUT CO-OPTING

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.765
SOMEONE ELSE'S CHARACTER.

00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:12.732
NOW IT'S AOC.

00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:15.068
SHE IS TRYING TO BE AOC.

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:17.470
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS IN LONG ISLAND CITY

00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:18.238
MAKING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:19.239
&gt;&gt; THAT IS FUNNY.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.708
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING].

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:24.644
&gt;&gt; GET ME A BEER.

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:28.515
&gt;&gt; AND THANKING HER HUSBAND.

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:30.550
&gt;&gt; IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:31.117
DEMOCRATS.

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:33.820
THEY WERE VERY PRO-THESE

00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:34.821
HIGH-TECH FIRMS.

00:09:34.822 --> 00:09:36.956
THEY GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO THE

00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:37.324
DEMOCRATS.

00:09:37.325 --> 00:09:39.859
WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES AND WE

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.928
HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK WITH

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:43.563
FACEBOOK, LOOKING AT THE PRIVACY

00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:45.298
AND TRYING TO REVAMP.

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:46.566
&gt;&gt; THEY KNOW IT'S COMING.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.902
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU ARE WRONG, BRIAN.

00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:50.470
I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE

00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:51.872
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO SAY YOU HAVE

00:09:51.873 --> 00:09:53.573
TO REGULATE.

00:09:53.574 --> 00:09:59.013
YOU SEE THE EUROPEANS SAYING
