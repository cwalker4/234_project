00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.710
NARRATOR: The
surface of the moon

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.830
is scarred with
tens of thousands

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.170
of impact craters
of various sizes.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.330
Scientists suggest
this is due to the fact

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.040
that there has never
been an atmosphere

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
on the moon to help protect
it from bombardment by space

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.620
debris.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.580
There are no natural erosive
forces, like wind or flowing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.920
water, to affect its surface.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.750
And there is little geologic
activity to conceal damage done

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.880
throughout the moon's history.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.750
PAUL DAVIES: When you study
the distribution of craters,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.330
you find the surface
is totally saturated.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.170
That is, that there are craters
within craters within craters,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.420
right down to the
smallest scale of size.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.210
MIKE BARA: One of the things
that's really interesting

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.750
about lunar craters is that,
even though some of them

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.380
are very large and some
of them are very small,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.330
they all seem to
have the same depth.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.040
And that really shouldn't
happen on a planetary body.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.250
There should be
variation in depth.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.880
So why are the moon's
craters so uniform?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.290
It's really, really
unusual, and it's really not

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.580
explainable in terms
of conventional

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.420
or established geophysics.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.290
Some of the
craters on the moon

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.040
are nowhere near similar to
what they should look like.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.540
In fact, they are
incredibly wide craters.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.080
And wherever the
impact point is,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.120
they're convex,
which means there's

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.620
still the bulge of the moon.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.460
So this doesn't make any sense.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.120
It's likely that there is
something under the lunar

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.250
surface which is very resilient,
and which is preventing craters

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.750
going any deeper than they do.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.620
This could only really be
either much harder rock, which

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.080
it can't be because of
the mass of the moon,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.080
or, alternatively,
a metal sphere

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.830
of some kind which is
preventing more damage.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.080
[music playing]

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
NARRATOR: Does the uniform
depth of the craters on the moon

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.000
suggest some sort
of metallic barrier

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.420
underneath moon rock and dust?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.000
But if so, why
wouldn't mainstream

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.120
scientists acknowledge this?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.000
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that, by doing so,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.960
they might also
have to acknowledge

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.000
that the moon may be hollow.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.170
MAN: (ON RADIO) Yankee
Clipper, Houston.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.170
NARRATOR: November 20th, 1969.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.170
During their ascent back
to the command module,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.380
Commander Charles Conrad Jr.
and lunar module pilot Alan Bean

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.880
release the Apollo
12 launch vehicle

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.620
and crash it back to the moon.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.960
MAN 1: (ON RADIO)
Apollo 12, Houston.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.710
The LM is on its way down.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.540
MAN 2: (ON RADIO) Roger.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.540
NARRATOR: Upon impact, something
very unexpected happened.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.880
The moon was said
to have seismically

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.960
reverberated like a bell
for more than an hour.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.000
WALTER CUNNINGHAM: With Apollo
12, people referred to a crash.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.330
It wasn't really a crash.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.540
It was an aimed deorbit
of the rocket used

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.420
to lift off the lunar module.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.670
And the crew separated
the launch vehicle

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.750
and crashed it back
into the ground

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.580
right close to where they had
had a seismograph that they

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.580
had installed down there.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.000
Well, it vibrated.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.920
So it was kind of an
early clue as to how solid

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.750
was the surface of the moon.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.420
What was amazing
about this is that,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.420
suddenly, the moon began
to ring like a bell,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.750
and did so for nearly an hour.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.250
Dr. Wernher von Braun, who
was then the head of NASA,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.710
decided that, for
Apollo 13, they

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.540
were going to
intentionally crash

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.460
a heavier portion of the
rocket into the lunar surface.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.120
And when they did this,
the moon ran like a gong

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.960
this time, for over three
hours and to a depth

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.460
of over 20 miles.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.750
ALAN BUTLER: This
was not expected,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.040
and it still puzzles a
lot of scientists today.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.790
The inference is that the moon
must be hollow because the moon

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.540
is made predominantly,
on the surface, of a kind

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.380
of rock called basalts.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.210
Although it's a very
lightweight rock,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.420
it also absorbs
impact extremely well.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.000
And so if the whole of the moon
was made of that kind of rock,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.920
you wouldn't expect
it to reverberate

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.830
when a large impact took place.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.120
The reason that
this is played down

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.960
is because the idea of
the moon being hollow just

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.830
contradicts what we
know about physics.
