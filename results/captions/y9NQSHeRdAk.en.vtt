00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.860
Last week, the
polar vortex caused

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.960
some of the coldest
temperatures in US history,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.080
making the city of Chicago
colder than Antarctica.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.300
Our next guest used money
out of her own pocket

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.180
to buy hotel rooms for more
than 100 homeless people

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.300
in her community.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.514
She did it with no expectation
of anything in return.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:17.430
And that is the type of
person I want to meet.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.248
From Chicago, Illinois,
please welcome Candice Payne.

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:20.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:21.831
[MUSIC - BEYONCE - "HALO"]

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.238
You're everything I need more.

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.728
It's written all over your face.

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:29.214
Baby, I can feel your halo.

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:32.200
I know you won't fade away!

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.700
I can see--

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.190
Hi!

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.182
Hi.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:41.170
So nice to meet you.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.610
Candice, you're just
amazing, you're awesome.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.640
OK, you live in Chicago.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.420
And how cold was it, actually,
when you started this idea?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.330
On Tuesday, it was
negative 20, already.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.580
And Wednesday, we were
looking at negative 50.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.080
So freezing.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.620
Wow.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.510
So you planned on staying in.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.230
And then what happened?

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.390
What changed your mind?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.430
Because this is just
brilliant, what you did.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.930
So I called my office and
told my assistants, look,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.987
don't come in tomorrow.

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:13.070
It's going to be too cold.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.490
Because I'm not coming in.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.030
And this is just going to be a
regular workday in the house.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.750
I get to watch TV.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.230
And then I started thinking,
what about the people

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.830
who live outside, who
don't have a home to go to?

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.494
And it was a no-brainer.

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:29.410
I picked up the phone.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.650
In my mind, I'm like, OK, I can
go and charge 20 hotel rooms

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.540
on my American Express.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.390
And as I get to calling
around, no one wanted them.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.360
It wasn't good for business.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.860
And--

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.050
None of the hotels
wanted homeless people.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.241
They were not-- no.

00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:45.740
Yep.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.540
No.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.660
One motel actually,
when I called--

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.800
it's the Amber Inn--

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.280
the manager picked up and said,
absolutely, whatever you need,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.540
whatever you want.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.370
The Amber Inn Motel.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.685
Good for you, Amber Inn Motel.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.130
All right, so how many
rooms did they have?

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.919
I asked her how many
she had available.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.000
And I think--

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.920
I don't remember the
number that she had.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.047
But I know I secured 30 of them.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:17.380
And then, as I get off the
phone with her, I'm thinking,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.550
like, OK, now, how do I get
these people to this room?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.880
I got one truck.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.940
So I went to social media.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.710
And I posted, hey, I just
secured 30 rooms, 30 hotel

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.850
rooms for the homeless.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
And I'll pay you if you
have a truck or a van

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.520
to come help me transport them.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.260
That post went viral.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.915
It was absolutely amazing.

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:41.540
That's amazing.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.040
OK, so now, it seems like
you needed more rooms.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.960
So then what happened?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.460
Yeah.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.450
So with that particular
post, it also

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.370
got people to coming
in, pitching in,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.050
helping to purchase rooms.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.530
So initially, I started
off with 30 rooms.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.320
And it was only going
to be one night.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.470
By the time that
we looked up, we

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.990
were able to secure five
nights and 72 rooms.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.408
We helped over 122,
it was 122 people.

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:19.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.820
And describe some of the
people that were homeless.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.551
You said there was a pregnant
woman, or pregnant women.

00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:26.050
Oh, yeah.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.100
We had all type of people.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.110
We had pregnant women.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.190
We had children.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.940
We had disabled people.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.930
We had people who just
got out of the hospital

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.970
from having surgery
and, was just going

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.870
to try and live on the street,
and was really overwhelming.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.460
You know, we've
got to do something

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.940
about the problem
of the homeless.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.000
Because I know you
have a relationship,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.967
that your boyfriend was.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:53.550
Is that right?

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.850
Yeah.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.370
Homeless.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.230
He was homeless.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.590
And the misconception
about homeless people

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.470
is they think that they're lazy,
or they just don't want a job.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.140
And truth be told,
a lot of people

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.290
are one paycheck away
from their same situation.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.640
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.750
I mean, I think, now, more than
ever, with the weather the way

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.881
it is, all the disasters, people
losing their homes in fires,

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.589
there's a lot of
reasons-- like you said,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.672
they're one paycheck away.

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:21.100
So we have to do something
about this homeless situation

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.029
and help them.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.160
And the fact that
you did this is--

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.010
just out of the
kindness of your heart.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.980
And I know that you went to
Walmart for a lot of supplies

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.110
to help them out.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.680
Walmart heard about this.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.650
And they want to give
you a check for $25,000

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.272
to thank you for [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:42.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:42.044 --> 00:04:44.449
Oh, my god.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.892
More Candice after this.

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:46.729
We'll be back.

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:47.770
OK, what is next for you?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.360
Now, what are you going to do?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.790
So two years ago, I
started a not-for profit.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.030
It's called to Action for Calls.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.290
I didn't do anything with it.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.680
Because I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.544
Feeding homeless
or buying hotels,

00:05:01.544 --> 00:05:02.710
I can do that out of pocket.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.630
I didn't know what
I was doing with it.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.450
I've now found my new purpose.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.700
And I'm in real estate.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.970
So I can use my
passion for real estate

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.580
to help house the homeless.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.260
So I'm buying multi-units,
and I'm rehabbing them.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.502
I'm buying distressed
multi-units, rehabbing them.

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:21.460
And I'm going to give--

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.840
I'm going to house homeless.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.580
And hopefully, others will
jump on the bandwagon and help.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.390
I bet they will.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.590
I mean, it's a great idea.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.090
And especially being
in real estate,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.410
you know what's available.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.460
And you can get things for a
good price, and rehab them.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.090
And, well, I decided during
the break, I made a phone call.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.260
And I called Walmart.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.510
And I asked them to give
you another $25,000.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.940
So I--

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.740
Oh, my god!

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.940
I know!

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.640
You're already up [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.240
Oh, my god!

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.140
Thank you so much!

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.840
Thank you so much!

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.040
Help out Candice Payne.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.190
