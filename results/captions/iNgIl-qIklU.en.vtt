00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.872
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.552
What if I told you
were a hologram?

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:11.350
Or maybe I'm getting
ahead of myself.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.640
In my quest to become better
acquainted with reality,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.598
I decided to get the
perspective of someone who

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.730
devoted their life to
discovering the true nature

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.790
of the universe.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.260
Leonard Susskind is one of
the founders of string theory

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.540
and Scientific America's
bad boy of physics.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.450
I'm a professor of physics
at Stanford University.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.620
And I think about physics.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.300
CRAIG: Like many
physicists, Susskind

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.020
spends his days
trying to understand

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.170
how the universe works.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.850
But physicists
don't always agree.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.790
And about 40 years
ago, a major battle

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.460
began in the physics community
that lasted for decades.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.430
And winning the battle
required rethinking

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.550
the very nature of reality

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.904
CRAIG: There are two
prevailing theories,

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.070
the theory of relativity
and then quantum mechanics,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.987
that seem to be at
odds with each other.

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:59.320
Well, Yeah, they do seem to
be at odds with each other,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.710
and always had from the get go.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.459
But they can't be at
odds with each other,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.542
because they're both true.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.380
We've got to make them fit.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.220
We've got to make
them fit together.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.784
CRAIG: So in 1915,
Albert Einstein

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:12.450
published his general
relativity theory,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.409
which explains how gravity
and space-time work.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.616
And quantum mechanics was
developed a few years later

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:17.430
by these people.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.305
LEONARD SUSSKIND: You
know, quantum mechanics

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:21.670
is about very, very
small and light things

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.140
which are so delicate that
any way that you touch them

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.800
or any way that you
observe them, they change.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.430
Relativity is about gravity.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.960
Gravity is about
very heavy objects.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.750
MATT: So relativity
is great at explaining

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.250
the motions of big things,
like stars and planets,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.370
but not so good at tiny
things, like particles.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.870
CRAIG: Yes.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.740
And physicists are always on
the lookout for one theory that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.615
explains everything.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:45.990
But in the day to day life of
a cosmologist or a particle

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.980
physicist, you're usually
dealing with very big things

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.290
or very small things.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.260
So for the time being
two theories was OK.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.820
That is, until a young physicist
who was studying black holes

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.115
had a brilliant idea that
screwed everything up.

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:00.490
LEONARD SUSSKIND:
Stephen Hawking

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.680
put his finger on
a very important,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.160
what's called a paradox.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.220
A paradox means something which
apparently looks contradictory.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.980
What he recognized
is that things

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.610
that fall into a black
hole are lost completely.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.480
They're lost, and they
can never come out.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.130
On the other hand,
quantum mechanics says,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.930
and this is one of its very,
very basic ingredients,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.110
that nothing can
ever really be lost.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.610
Information, the
distinctions between things,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.000
can't really be lost.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.650
But what does he
mean by information?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.090
I mean, I lose
information all the time.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.715
I can't remember
where I parked my car,

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:37.850
my dog ate my book report.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.540
That's a little different.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.060
When Susskind talks
about information,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.310
he's referring to
the distinctions

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.970
between the fundamental
particles that

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.900
make up the atoms in our bodies
and the rest of the universe.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.130
For instance, I could take
this book and burn it.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.260
Hey, I'm not
finished with that.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.900
I'm not going to burn it.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.620
But if I did, you wouldn't
be able to read it,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.540
because it would be a
pile of ash and smoke.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.360
However, from a
physics perspective,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.410
the atoms that make
up the paper and ink

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.430
in the letters and
the tragic love story

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.267
would still be there and could,
theoretically, be recombined

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:03.350
if we had the right tools.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.460
In fact, I think
of it as more basic

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.220
than any of the other
principles of physics.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.530
The most basic
principle of physics

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.730
is that distinctions
never disappear.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.924
Now, take that same book,
toss it in a black hole,

00:03:14.924 --> 00:03:16.340
and you've got
yourself a problem.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.089
According to Hawking,
all that information

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.490
is irretrievably lost.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.407
Why is that, exactly?

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:22.823
Well, it has something to do
with what Hawking discovered

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:23.610
about black holes.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.650
Well, maybe we should explain
what a black hole is first.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.340
Go for it.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.330
A black hole is a
region of space composed

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.200
of super densely packed matter.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.980
Because of it's mind-boggling
density, it's pull of gravity

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.190
is so strong that nearby planets
and stars can get sucked in.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.100
And nothing, not even
light, can escape

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.700
once it's gone beyond the
black hole's event horizon.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.680
So it's a point of
no return, in a sense.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.760
It's a point of no return
in which when anything falls

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.450
through it, it simply
cannot get out,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.220
because in a sense space is
moving inward at faster than

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.120
the speed of light.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.017
So in 1974.

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:57.600
Stephen Hawking basically said
that all matter and information

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.317
that goes into a black
hole is lost forever.

00:04:00.317 --> 00:04:02.400
And I guess Susskind
wasn't too happy about this.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.990
No way.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.490
He actually wrote
a book about it.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.470
The Black Hole War, My
Battle with Stephen Hawking

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.280
to Make the World Safe
for Quantum Mechanics.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.720
Yeah.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.220
Right.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.140
Could you describe
this battle, and why

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.140
it was a war you felt it
was necessary to fight?

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.930
Well, as I said, Stephen was
basically a gravity physicist,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.329
a general relativist.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.970
And he believed
in the principles

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.410
of general relativity.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.330
Nothing else mattered.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.570
I was always a
quantum physicist.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.980
And when Stephen said that
it looks like black holes,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.150
because they lose
information into them,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.360
violate the principles
of quantum mechanics, I

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.350
and a couple of my friends,
in particular a physicist

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.350
by the name of Gerard 't Hooft,
a very famous Dutch physicist,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.630
said, no, that can't be right.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.540
And we didn't know
why he was wrong,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.970
but we knew he was wrong.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.490
He held his ground.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.720
We held our ground.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.490
But eventually, we began
to make sense of in what

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.880
way Hawking was wrong.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.450
It's a basic
principle of the way

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.360
we think of classical
physics, that a thing can only

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.720
be in one place.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.030
If it's here, it's not there.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.830
If it's there, it's not here.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.720
What was going on is
that, in some funny sense,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.680
quantum mechanics
was requiring that it

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.601
could be in the sense in
two places at the same time.

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:21.100
What?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.310
How is that even possible?

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.040
Yeah, what's he talking about?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.460
We begin to get the idea,
in particular, 't Hooft

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.450
and myself, that what was
going on on the horizon

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.980
of a black hole was
similar to a hologram.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.160
That the surface
of the black hole,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.880
the horizon of the black hole,
was like a photographic film.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.720
And what fell into
the black hole

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.030
was like the image created,
a three-dimensional image

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.531
created.

00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:47.404
CRAIG: So their idea
was that any matter that

00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:49.530
falls into a black hole
remains trapped inside.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.460
But at the same
time, an exact copy

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.400
is perfectly preserved
on the horizon.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.156
This by itself was a
revolutionary idea.

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:56.780
But Susskind and his
crew soon realized

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.410
that the holographic principle
doesn't necessarily only

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.450
apply to black holes.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.620
Once we understood
that what was inside

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.330
falling into the black
hole, inside the black hole,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.560
was a kind of projection
of the horizon,

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.280
we began to understand
the idea was more general,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.740
that the entire three
dimensionality of space

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.000
is a projection of a
very distant horizon that

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.060
surrounds us.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.920
And not the horizon
of a black hole, it's

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.710
the horizon of the universe.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.970
And instead of being
on the outside of it,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.350
like we would be if there
was a black hole here,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.790
we were on the inside of it.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.300
And so you could say that
we on the inside of it

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.360
are a projection of this
film-like thing that's

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.929
on the boundary of the universe.

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:41.970
So while we stand here
in The Good Stuff studio,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.120
and while you watch this
video at home, or at work,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.010
or in prison awaiting trial,
whatever you're doing,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.270
we are actually projections
of equivalent versions

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.630
of ourselves that live on the
outer surface of the universe.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.960
Whatever happens here,
happens there, and vice versa

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.090
and vice universa.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.610
So I'm a hologram?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.850
This isn't real?

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.140
Oh my god.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.130
Is the real me just
a battery that's

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.660
powering a universe-wide
simulation?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.020
No, Matt, you're
not in the Matrix.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.811
There is no spoon.

00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:12.520
It's just that you're here,
and you're sort of over there

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.150
as well.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.370
Well, if we're here and also
there, are we the projection,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.170
or is the outer
surface the projection?

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.460
Which one's reality?

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.050
Are we on the inside
of the universe,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.610
or have we actually been in the
outer surface this whole time?

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.540
That's your choice.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.240
You decide.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.310
But the mathematics
says they're equivalent.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.340
I feel like I'm here

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.520
Yeah, but so does your
image on the boundary.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.690
It's also saying, I
feel like I'm here.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.477
Oh, man.

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:37.060
Right, right.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.780
But the mathematics doesn't care
which way you think about it.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.620
It says there's an equivalence.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.290
That's about all we can say.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.700
Physicists do not
like the word reality.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.670
We may talk about
it all the time.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.810
But when it comes
down to it, we really

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.340
don't want to say this is
reality and that's not reality.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.300
There are mathematical
connections between things.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.570
And that's got to be it, because
we don't have insight enough

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.910
to be able to tell
which is reality.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.200
That's pretty wild.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.160
It is pretty wild.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.660
And not surprisingly, the idea
of the holographic principle

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.530
was initially met with
a bit of skepticism.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.790
This was a wild idea at first.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.630
Nobody really accepted it.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.120
I think for the most part the
reaction of our colleagues

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.300
were, those guys used
to be smart guys.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.130
I think they've
lost their marbles.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.820
The world is a hologram?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.410
That's too crazy.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.210
Eventually, the idea got put
into a very, very precise form

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.450
by a young Argentinian physicist
by the name of Juan Maldecena.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.169
Juan Maldecena is now one of the
great physicists of the world,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.320
maybe the greatest
physicist of the world.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.290
It's now gone from being
a wild-eyed conjecture

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.120
to being an every-day
working tool of physics.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.270
After Juan Maldecena's
mathematical realization

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.772
of the holographic principle,
Hawking conceded defeat.

00:08:51.772 --> 00:08:53.980
He admitted that he was
wrong about information being

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.150
lost in a black hole, calling it
his biggest blunder in science.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.949
So how does Susskind
feel about Hawking

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:00.240
after he admitted he was wrong?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.460
All of these ideas were
put in place as a response

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.270
to a very, very deep question
Stephen Hawking asked.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.980
He was incredibly
perceptive to see that there

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.750
was this tension there.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.440
And all of the ideas
of modern physics

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.130
that are exciting
all of us now trace

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.150
right back to his question.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.870
So to say he was just
wrong is a pale reflection

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.870
of what really happened.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.560
So does Stephen Hawking
now fully support

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.643
the holographic principle?

00:09:28.643 --> 00:09:31.180
As far as I can tell
he supports these ideas.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.856
But that's kind of irrelevant,
because the rest of the physics

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:35.480
community does.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.360
You know, we get old.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.420
Steven gets old.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.860
I get old.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.880
At some point it doesn't
matter what he or I think.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.560
OK, so the physics
community generally

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.067
accepts this is a
plausible theory.

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:48.400
That's all well and good, Craig.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.680
But how can something so
insane-sounding be true?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.430
Well, maybe you just
don't understand it.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.346
I don't understand it.

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.370
Well, why is this stuff
so hard to understand?

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.170
When people ask me
about these things,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.110
I always give the same answer.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.270
Our neural wiring, the
thing that we inherited

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.220
from our ancestors,
and I don't mean

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.650
our ancestors our
grandparents, I mean, you know,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.960
the worms in the muck.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.300
Through evolution, the neural
wiring that we inherited

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.650
was not built for
quantum mechanics.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.260
It was not built for
higher dimensions.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.520
It was not built for thinking
about curved space-time.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.330
It was built for
classical physics.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.880
It was built for
rocks and stones

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.970
and all the ordinary objects.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.900
And it was built for
three dimensional space.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.380
And that's not quite
good enough for us

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.180
to be able to visualize
and internalize

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.450
the ideas of quantum mechanics
and general relativity

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.320
and so forth.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.260
So instead, what do we do?

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.120
We use mathematics.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.530
Eventually, in time we
develop intuitions out

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.050
of the abstract mathematics.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.120
We get better at it.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.020
And we begin to think that way.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.280
But that can be
extremely frustrating

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.090
when trying to explain
to the outside world.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.560
The outside world
by and large has not

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.780
had that experience of
going through the rewiring

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.330
process of converting
their minds

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.310
into something that can
deal with 5 dimensions, 10

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.660
dimensions, or the quantum
mechanical uncertainty

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.680
principle, or whatever
it happens to be.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.700
And so the best we can do is
to use analogies, metaphors.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.500
And the holographic
principle is a metaphor.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.890
The way I've described
it in terms of a hologram

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.260
is not precise.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.030
It's not exactly accurate.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.640
It's close.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.250
It captures some of the ideas.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.820
But there is a whole raft
of mathematics behind it

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.771
that I can't easily
transfer to you.

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:45.270
Yeah.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.210
I should've paid more
attention in math class.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.711
Well, it wouldn't
have been enough.

00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:49.210
Yeah.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.084
I know what you mean.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.970
Like, even learning
about relativity,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.540
just learning about
how time works

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.830
and how time is a dimension, it
took me a while to fully grasp.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.830
No, you would get it.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.840
You would get it if you
took a couple years.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.080
I mean, I don't know what your
level of mathematics is, but--

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.410
I was good in high school.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.243
That's good enough.

00:12:06.243 --> 00:12:08.710
If you were good in
mathematics in high school,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.030
then within a year
or two of effort

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.731
these ideas could be conveyed.

00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:15.230
Yeah.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.930
But to do so in my living room
here in an hour, all we can do

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.120
is try to use metaphors
and analogies.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.636
Right.

00:12:22.636 --> 00:12:24.260
So it's possible that
after a few years

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.890
of rigorous
mathematical training,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.040
we could potentially
understand these principles.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.720
Still, Susskind admits
that not everyone

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.070
will be able to understand,
or even want to.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.820
And that's OK.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.740
In my experience there's
a lot of people out there

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.100
who understand that they
can't understand it,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.080
and are very glad
that somebody can.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.130
There's also people
who are very resentful.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.880
They're resentful.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.280
They think there
is a conspiracy,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:58.040
a conspiracy that the priesthood
of science is hiding something.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.100
Can you tell them no?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.570
Can you tell them?

00:12:59.570 --> 00:12:59.900
No, no, no.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.983
We're not hiding anything.

00:13:00.983 --> 00:13:04.300
We want more than
anything else that people

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.290
should listen to us, and
understand what we're saying.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.360
But we're stuck with this
obstacle of mathematics.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.110
So if you want to
understand the universe

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.319
beyond the basic stuff
that we can see and touch,

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:16.360
you gotta learn the math.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.670
Right.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.930
But it's also OK if you don't
know the math, because there

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.471
are people out there
who have devoted

00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:21.994
their lives and
years of research

00:13:21.994 --> 00:13:23.160
to understanding this stuff.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.660
And they're doing
a pretty good job.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.320
Science is a constantly
evolving field.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.030
But there is plenty
that they do know.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.980
And they're getting better and
better at making predictions.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.240
So what did Susskind
think is in store

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.940
for the future of physics
and our understanding

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.606
of the universe?

00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:35.300
Yeah, I think this
holographic idea

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.530
is permanent in the
vocabulary of physicists.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.570
It's in the textbooks.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.070
It's going to stay
in the textbooks.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.520
But how the whole story
is going to play out,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.990
the universe, how
quantum mechanics

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.070
fits together with
gravity and so forth,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.970
I think there's only one
thing that's certain,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.550
that there will be surprises.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.510
Some of them will
come from experiments.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.960
Some of them will come
from giant telescopes.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.840
And some of them will come from
mathematical and theoretical

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.760
thinking about how
things fit together.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.460
And I think one
can be pretty sure

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.370
that anybody who thinks that
they have the final answer

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.040
now is smokin' something bad.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.668
Or maybe they should be
smoking something better.

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:17.880
Ha-ha-ha.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880
Don't do drugs, kids.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.260
But I think
there's every reason

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.380
to believe that the future
will hold surprises.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.780
So for me to sit here and to
predict how physics will evolve

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.610
in the next century or so
is a total waste of time,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.030
because I'll be wrong.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.740
Good answer.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.960
So there's still a
lot to be discovered.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.690
But there's no way to
know how our understanding

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.520
of the universe is going
to change in the future.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.560
And, as we've learned
throughout the episode,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.760
it's hard to even know
what's happening right now.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.720
So what are we supposed to do?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.040
Well, I guess we
just have to trust

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.050
that there are people out there
who are diligently working

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.350
to figure out how our world
works, where we come from,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.382
and where we're going.

00:14:53.382 --> 00:14:55.590
And at the same time, we
have to be a little cautious

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.840
dealing with people who claim
to have all the answers.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.876
Great summation, Craig.

00:14:58.876 --> 00:15:01.106
Thank you.

00:15:01.106 --> 00:15:02.194
Pretty nice day out.

00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:04.235
Want to go outside and
throw the football around?

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:06.840
That's some classical physics
I can wrap my head around.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.860
Let's go buddy.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.736
