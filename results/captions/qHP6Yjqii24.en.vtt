00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.639
This is the story of

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.860
two lions. Bella the lioness we rescued from Romania five years ago,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.090
and Simba a male released from a French
circus and then taken

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.410
to a Belgian sanctuary.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.600
Recently, Simba made the journey from
Europe

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.670
to Malawi in the heart of Africa.
At the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.489
Simba found a safe haven and for the
first time in his life

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.489
also experienced company of a lioness.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.060
Born Free felt

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.790
these two magnificent lions had been
without a companion for too long.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.180
"We've had a female here now for some
considerable time.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.250
She's been very lonely and so we decided,
as we had the opportunity to rescue

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.040
Simba, we thought this would be the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.450
ideal moment to bring him over give her
a mate."

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.660
But the course of  true love doesn't
always run

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.040
smooth. Bringing solitary lions together

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.040
can be exceedingly dangerous.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.400
"We're all here for the obvious reason
that we're going to try and integrate

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.010
these two lines tomorrow.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.760
There are a few criteria that we have to
ahere to.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.340
The first one is lions can change very
quickly, 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.100
as you can hear."

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.229
Despite his life if captivity, Simba

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.109
is in his prime. Bella hasn't been so
fortunate

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.960
and her body bears the scars of her early
captive life.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.469
"She has one eye missing. She has

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.829
a spinal deformity and she is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.069
twelve-years-old, so she's getting on.
Born Free and always wanted her to have

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.629
a mate,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.209
and she's been quite lonely here for the
last few years. One of things that we

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.099
have to take into consideration

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.349
is when and how we intervene. It might
look pretty horrendous to you what's

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.120
going on in there,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.650
and I'm telling you to lay off. The fact is,
I've got to make my mind up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.900
as to when they start to really hurt
each other and when they just posturing

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.030
and playing around,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.090
making an awful noise." 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.223
"What is the plan?
We've actually got two plans.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.810
in Malawi in general are almost
extinct, they're not a lot

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.290
anymore in the wild in Malawi as well.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.160
These two lions would be
perfect ambassadors

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.489
for lions in Malawi."

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.959
"There's an awful lot riding on tomorrow, not the least for the animals,

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.590
who've been waiting to have mates for some considerable time and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.410
all the supporters of Born Free and of course, the staff

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.049
are hoping this wind up with a
really happy ending.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.800
But, tomorrow

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.800
is the moment of truth."

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.040
Today, Simba is going to into

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440
Bella's night room. This will be the first time

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.440
that the pair will be in the same
enclosure.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.970
"Does anyone know how long it takes for a lion to do 100 metres?"

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.530
For Tony and his team, it's make-or-break day.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.440
"Usain Bolt can run 100 meters in under
10 seconds,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
these lions are capable of doing it in 4!

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.150
So, we have to have great respect that there is no way we can run away from them.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.540
We have to make sure that we're secure all the time."

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.190
It is vital that every precaution is put in place.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.250
"We have a couple a fire extinguishers
just in case

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.470
the lions actually do start a big
fight with each other and we had we need

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.790
something to split them up.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.790
Of course, we can go in and yelling or
anything, it won't

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.729
make any difference.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.780
With a fire extinguisher we can put huge

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.050
water pressure on them and hopefully it will
scare them enough

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.450
to actually split up. As
long as they are separated again

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.660
they hopefully will be fine." 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.860
"You're all

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.750
ready to accept what we're going to do?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.590
You all understand that there is a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.229
risk? We take more precautions to see that there's

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.150
no more we can do; everything seems to be right

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.440
for the introduction. 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.740
always quite nervous of being
introduced to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.169
males, because they're very inferior in
strength.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.870
Males can kill female large very easily,
so

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.320
although he's very laid back and he's
doing everything we want, when we open the gate

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.669
and she actually is in his face; that
is the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.590
the moment of truth."

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.250
Tony knows that the time is right. 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.629
Tony's raised hand is all that's
coming between the tussling Lions

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:21.629
and a blast from the fire
extinguishers.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.379
Bella's turn to make the first move

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.759
"She's

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.499
not rushing back to him so that's good.

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.639
We might just let him go back for tonight

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.210
and try again in the morning.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.260
So, we haven't the perfect scenario of two

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.590
lions together, so what we're going to do,
tomorrow morning we're going to come back

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.589
and

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.740
do a much softer

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.680
introduction by releasing her into the
outside,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.580
opening his den and letting him follow her.
We feel that

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.840
outside will give them a more natural advantage

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.840
and make them feel more relaxed."

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.529
Once bitten, twice shy, Simba refuses

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:52.589
to venture outside.

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:53.269
are lions

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:57.589
which for most of their lives have been alone. Simba has never,

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:00.709
ever met another female, probably in his whole life.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:03.720
This is actually the first time he has met a female,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.250
so it's not very strange that he takes his time"

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.790
A new day and Tony has a new plan.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.809
"The only way we can get him to come
outside

00:09:42.809 --> 00:09:47.459
was to let him go out into his
territory first. We then

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:50.569
released her into his territory.

00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:53.779
So, we took a chance and

00:09:53.779 --> 00:10:00.779
the result is this."

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.720
"We have a situation where the animals
laying, probably

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.950
less than 3 meters appart and

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.580
although I'm there is tension there..."

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.590
"This is a natural progression

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:30.250
to lions becoming accustomed to each
other.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.230
I'm exceedingly happy and so are all the staff at Lilongwe

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:41.230
and it appears that it's all going to turn out really well."

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.260
As the days and weeks pass

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.600
since Bella &amp; Simba first met, their
relationship continues to evolve

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.490
at their own pace. Everyone is working to
ensure they both continue to enjoy the

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.660
tranquility

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.720
and space their new African home

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.890
the way at its best for them.
