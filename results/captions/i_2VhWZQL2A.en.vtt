00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.066
- A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.366
WE INTRODUCED YOU
TO SARAH HOIDAHL.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.200
SHE'S AN AMAZING WAITRESS
FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.366
TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.300
- I ALWAYS END EACH SHOW
BY SAYING

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.366
"BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER,"

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.833
AND OUR FIRST GUEST IS
A WAITRESS

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:13.233
FROM HENNIKER, NEW HAMPSHIRE,
WHO DID JUST THAT.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.533
I THINK WE HAVE A COPY
OF THE NOTE,

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
BUT IT SAYS, "THANKS TO
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.833
"PEOPLE LIKE YOU
THAT PROTECT THIS COUNTRY

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:18.833
"ARE NOT GETTING PAID.

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.133
"HOWEVER, I STILL AM.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.133
"LUNCH IS ON ME.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.366
"THANK YOU FOR SERVING, LADIES.

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.366
HAVE A GOOD DAY."

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.366
THAT'S WHAT YOU LEFT.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.433
[cheers and applause]

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.466
HOW MUCH?

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.600
- THE BILL WAS $27.75.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.733
- $27.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.166
ONE.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.700
TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700
WELL, THERE'S 27.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.700
$27.75?

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:45.200
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
A CHECK RIGHT NOW.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
[cheers and applause]

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.133
YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.333
I LOVE HER.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.633
I JUST LOVE WHAT SHE DID.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.633
I LOVED HER.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:02.933
SARAH'S STORY WAS PICKED UP

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.033
BY HUNDREDS OF NEWS OUTLETS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:06.400
SARAH IS AT WORK RIGHT NOW,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.366
WHERE SHE WORKS AT RUBY TUESDAYS
IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.033
SHE THINKS SHE'S TALKING TO
A REPORTER FROM THE LOCAL NEWS,

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.166
BUT WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW,

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.166
THOSE ARE OUR CAMERAS.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.866
THAT'S ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.300
AND WHEN I SAY, GO,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.466
HER BOSS IS GONNA WALK IN
WITH A PHONE

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.633
AND SAY SHE'S GOT A PHONE CALL.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.133
I'LL BE ON THE OTHER END.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.533
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.533
[applause]

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.566
ALL RIGHT, GO.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.800
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.766
- SARAH, I'M SORRY,
YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.766
- HELLO?

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.266
- HEY, SARAH.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.266

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.266
- IT'S ELLEN.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.266
I'M JUST CHECKING IN.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.266
WHAT YOU DOING?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.666

OH, MY GOD, IS THIS REALLY YOU?

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.000
- YEAH.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.066
- OH, MY GOD,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.633
- HI.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.033
HI.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:53.366
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:57.300
- I WAS JUST SITTING TALKING TO
SOME--SOME VERY NICE MAN HERE.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.966
- YEAH, THAT'S--THAT'S A VERY
NICE MAN WHO WORKS FOR US.

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.066
THOSE ARE OUR CAMERAS.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.400
THAT'S DEREK.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.966
HE'S NOT A--
HE'S NOT--

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:04.966
HE'S NO REPORTER.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.966
- [laughs]

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.966
- WE HAD A NICE CONVERSATION,
VERY GOOD.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.300
- OH, MY GOD,
I'M GONNA START CRYING AGAIN.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.266
- HI, DEREK.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.266
- HI, EL.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.266
- I'M GOOD.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:17.266
IT'S A LITTLE WARM IN HERE

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.366
IF YOU COULD TAKE CARE OF THAT.

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:21.700
HEY, WE'RE TAPING THE SHOW
RIGHT NOW,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.766
AND YOU'RE ON IT.

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.166
AND I WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU'VE BEEN

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.366
SINCE WE SAW YOU LAST.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:28.133
WHAT'S--THERE'S A LOT GOING ON,
RIGHT?

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.433
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN CRAZY,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.400
BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S BEEN SO MUCH FUN.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.200
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600
- YEAH.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.433
SO YOU GOT MESSAGES FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.700
WHO HAVE YOU HEARD FROM?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.200
- OH, MY GOSH, I'VE HEARD
FROM PEOPLE IN THE U.K.,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.466
GERMANY, IRELAND, SWITZERLAND,
AFRICA, LIKE, EVERYWHERE.

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.766
IT'S BEEN SO INSANE.

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:52.766
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:54.266
I MEAN, ALL THAT BECAUSE

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:56.766
YOU DECIDED TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMEBODY'S BILL AT LUNCH

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.366
'CAUSE YOU KNEW
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT,

00:02:58.366 --> 00:02:59.900
AND LOOK WHAT A GOOD DEED DOES.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.033
SO, RUBY TUESDAYS,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:04.100
THEY'VE BEEN GREAT THROUGH THIS,
RIGHT?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.466
- OH, MY GOD, THEY'VE BEEN
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:09.533
THEY--THEY LET ME TAKE
THE TIME OFF FROM WORK,

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:14.566
AND THEY GAVE ME
A VERY GENEROUS BONUS, AND--

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:15.566
- GOOD FOR THEM.

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.566
[cheers and applause]

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.566
- THE VICE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
CAME IN.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.700
- WELL, GOOD FOR THEM.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700
THAT'S AMAZING.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.500
SO WE GAVE YOU A $10,000 TIP,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.766
AND I HEARD A LOT OF THAT
IS GONNA GO TOWARDS--

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.833
OR SOME OF IT IS GONNA GO
TO A CAR

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.366
THAT YOU AND YOUR MOM SHARE,
RIGHT?

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.166
- YEAH, YEAH, WE DO.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.066
- HOW'S THAT CAR DOING?

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.300
- UM...

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.500
[laughs]

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.933
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S GOT
FOUR WHEELS,

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:40.566
AND IT GETS US
FROM POINT A TO POINT B

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.433
SO WE'RE DOING GOOD.

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.400
- BECAUSE SHE DROPS
YOUR SON OFF,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.600
OR YOU DROP YOUR SON OFF.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.633
WHO--SOMEBODY USES IT,
AND YOU SHARE THE CAR.

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.233
- SHE DROPS MY SON OFF
AT DAY CARE

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:52.233
AND THEN GOES TO WORK,

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:53.733
AND USUALLY I HAVE--

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.733
I HAVE GREAT,
WONDERFUL FRIENDS

00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:57.933
THAT WILL PICK ME UP
AND BRING ME TO WORK.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.666
EVEN ON THEIR
DAYS OFF SOMETIMES.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:00.800
- THAT'S AMAZING.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.200
WELL, THAT'S GOOD
TO HAVE THE HELP.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.466
I'M SORRY, I'VE JUST GOT

- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.133
I DON'T HAVE IT.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.433
JEANNIE, WILL YOU
GIVE IT TO HER?

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:21.833
I FORGOT,
I GAVE IT TO JEANNIE.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:22.833
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.400
