00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.610
Lula Cora Hood
In 1970, a single mother named Lula Cora Hood

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.590
left her home in Galesburg, Illinois after
a family argument and never returned.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.410
She left behind her 15-year-old daughter.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.450
Cora suffered from mental health problems
and was in and out of her children's lives

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.770
even before she disappeared.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.230
But this time she never returned to her family,
who believed they would never hear of her

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.230
again.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.770
There were no leads, no tips, no sign of what
had happened to her.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.170
She simply vanished.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.690
Then, 15 years ago, mushroom hunters found
human remains in a Galesburg brickyard.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.780
After making a facial reconstruction, detectives
believed that the bones belonged to Lula.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.710
However they were unable to confirm this through
DNA analysis as testing on bones could not

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.239
be done at the time.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.030
Nonetheless Cora was assumed dead and the
family buried the remains and held a memorial

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.229
service to say goodbye.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.880
It seemed as if the mysterious vanishing had
at last been solved.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.100
For 13 years that grave would be considered
to be Lula’s, and the mystery would be case

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.720
closed, Untill 2009 when a fresh DNA analysis
showed the remains interred 15 years ago were

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.450
not those of Lula’s at all, and belonged
to another unidentified individual.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.120
After DNA ruled out Cora as a match for the
remains, police reopened their investigation

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.409
with an online database search using her first
and middle names and her date of birth.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.960
Authorities were able to discover that an
84-year-old woman living in Florida was in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.740
fact the long missing Lula Hood, and that
she had a new family and had eventually had

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.229
14 children.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.320
Even though Cora did not remember her daughter
after all these years, they eventually reunited.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.130
Incidentally, in 2013, the female remains
were finally identified as another missing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.560
woman named Helen “Ruth” Alps.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.660
2.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640
Wendy Von Huben
Sixteen-year-old Wendy Von Huben lived in

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.780
Woodstock, Illinois, with her family.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.540
She was dating a nineteen-year-old boy named
Jesse Howell, who had recently moved into

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.909
his own home.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.969
On February 22, 1997, Wendy told her parents
that she was staying over at a friend's house.

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.609
In reality, however, Wendy and Jessie ran
away, after Jesse promised to take her around

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.939
the world.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.349
When wendy didn't come home the next day,
her parents reported her missing.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.849
They later learned from her school that she
had skipped classes up to a week prior to

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.860
her disappearance.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.379
Wendy and Jesse went on a trip along with
another couple.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.370
During the trip, they slept in their friend's
car and stopped in different states.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.999
They ended up in Bradenton, Florida where
they parted ways with the other couple.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:05.909
Shortly after they ran out of money and lived
under a bridge near Dade City for few days.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.129
On March 19, Wendy called her parents and
asked for $200 for a bus ticket back home

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.650
for her and Jesse.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.889
A few days later, Jesse called his parents
from a nearby truck stop.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.409
He said that they were on their way home.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.810
However, two days later, on March 23, Jesse
was discovered bludgeoned to death near the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.870
railroad tracks in Marion County, Florida.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.430
He had been struck from behind and there was
no evidence of a struggle.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.980
There was still money in his pocket and a
half-smoked cigarette on the ground.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.129
A small drop of blood on his jacket was believed
to belong to Wendy.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.719
However wendy was nowhere to be seen.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.589
Several weeks later, on June 4, Wendy's parents
received a phone call from Wendy in which

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.189
she said, "It's me, Wendy!" and then hung
up.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.579
She then called again and told her father
that she was at a gas station in Kankakee,

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.579
Illinois.

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.370
However, the conversation was so short, her
father was not sure that it was actually her.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.029
Police tracked the phone to a Phillips 66
gas station.

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:12.479
After viewing surveillance videotape, they
spotted a teenage girl that matched Wendy's

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.569
description.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.269
Her parents watched the tape and agreed that
the girl was Wendy.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.220
Police estimated that the tape was filmed
within minutes of the phone calls.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.030
Some local drifters told police that Wendy
was travelling with a one-legged railroad

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.240
car rider known as "Bob," who has since been
identified as Bobby Ray Taylor.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.760
In April of 1998, the drifter named Bobby
Ray Taylor was located.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.280
He denied ever being with Wendy and it was
determined that he was not involved in the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.690
case.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.910
In July of 2000, Angel Resendiz, also known
as "The Railroad Killer", confessed to killing

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.590
Wendy and Jesse.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.550
He claimed he met Wendy and Jessie on March
21, 1997, in a large railway yard in Baldwin,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.930
Fla., where hobos and the homeless are known
to live.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.460
Sometime that night, they got on a grain car
heading south.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.120
Wendy and Jessie began asking Resendiz where
they could get jobs without having identification.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.580
He told them he was going to work the orange
fields and told them he could show them where

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.980
they are.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.770
By March 23, they had traveled about 85 miles
when the train stopped just short of Ocala.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.850
Resendiz got off, and Howell followed him.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.610
Resendiz then took a rubber hose lined with
heavy metal that is used to connect rail cars

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.020
and hit Howell over the head, killing him
with one or two blows.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.770
Resendiz said he got back on the train alone,
and he and Wendy went on.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.470
Wendy didn't knew what happened to Jessie
at this point.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.960
Resendiz told investigators he and wendy got
off the train in Oxford, where he tied her

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.730
up, then choked her to death with his arms
about 35 feet from the tracks.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.340
He said he covered her body with a military
jacket he was wearing and a blanket.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.900
Resendiz led police to Wendy's remains, which
were found fifteen miles from the spot where

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.930
Jesse was found.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.780
DNA and jewelry found on the remains confirmed
her identity.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.360
Resendiz confessed to at least nine other
murders.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.750
Police believe he was responsible for at least
fifteen murders dating back to 1986.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.970
He was executed in June of 2006.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.270
3.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.931
Pamela Jackson And Cheryl Miller
ON the evening of May 29, 1971, 17 year-old

00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:29.180
Cheryl Miller and 17 year-old Pamella Jackson
were on their way to a high school party in

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.650
Vermilion, South Dakota, driving in a beige
1960 Studebaker Lark.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.030
The car was Cheryl's grandfather's.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.000
The girls stopped at the local church and
talked to some boys after visiting Cheryl's

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.900
grandmother in the hospital earlier that day.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.960
The boys were going to the same party Cheryl
and Pamella were.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.060
They agreed to follow the boys to the party
in their own car.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.060
However, the boys missed a turn and accidentally
drove past the party.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.830
When they turned around they no longer saw
the Studebaker’s headlights.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.950
They figured the girls had simply lost the
nerve to attend the party.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.510
The celebration went on, but the girls and
the Studebaker would not be seen again, until

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.550
2013.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.740
In the following weeks, volunteers and law-enforcement
officers searched the gravel pit, surrounding

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.680
roads and even the nearby Missouri River.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.570
But their efforts yielded nothing.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.470
The mystery persisted, year after year, for
more than four decades.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.670
Authorities had their theories about the girls'
disappearance.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.850
At first, they believed the girls to be runaways
because of their ages.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.380
Other thought they runaway to a hippie commune
in California.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:44.160
Soon, A man named, David Lykken, already serving
a prison sentence on unrelated charges was

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.790
indicted for murder in the deaths of Miller
and Jackson in 2007.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.340
However, the charges were dropped after it
was found out an inmate faked his confession

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.180
about Lykken's involvement in the case.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:03.490
Then, on September 23, 2013, a fisherman who
was fishing by South Dakota's Brule Creek

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:09.050
noticed two wheels sticking out from the creek's
embankment.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.950
Investigators recovered the car from the embankment,
which was caked with mud.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.260
The location of the creek is in an area that
is rarely traveled.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.070
It is 30 miles east of Vermillion, almost
right on the Iowa border.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.260
Record flooding followed by a drought is what
brought the upside-down car into view.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.980
Days later, it was reported that their were
two sets of skeletal remains found inside

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.110
the car.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.000
The remains were later confirmed to be those
of Miller and Jackson.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.399
According to officials, the victims' vehicle
was stuck in a third gear, the lights were

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.060
on, and their skeletal remains were in the
cabin.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.340
One of the tires on the car was damaged.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.870
The car keys were found in the ignition.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.370
Investigators also recovered Miller's purse,
which contained her driver's license, photos

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.740
and notes from her classmates.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:02.850
Those factors pointed to an accident and the
case was finally closed after 43 years.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.850
4.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.019
Lucy Johnson
In 1965 Lucy Ann Johnson, mother to a son,

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.440
David, and a daughter, Linda, vanished.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.069
Her husband Marvin Johnson reported her missing
from their home in Surrey, British Columbia,

00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:24.480
near Vancouver, Canada, in 1965, but upon
further investigation police were alarmed

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.029
to find that, after talking to various neighbors,
it seemed Lucy had not been seen since September

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.269
of 1961.

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.620
Based on witnesses reporting that Marvin had
been digging a septic field in the yard a

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.720
few months prior, the Surrey Royal Canadian
Mounter police dug up the yard of the home

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:49.420
which was located near 103rd Avenue and 145th
A Street in North Surrey, but found nothing.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:56.699
Lucy Ann Carvell, born in 1935 in Alaska met
her first husband Marvin Johnson and married

00:09:56.699 --> 00:10:00.170
in Blaine, Washington, later moving to Surrey.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.769
After reading a profile of her mother, considered
British Columbia’s oldest missing persons

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:10.899
case, Linda evans, decided to take matters
into her own hands.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:16.100
Knowing that had her mother been alive she
would have been in her late 70s, Linda Evans

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.130
committed herself to uncovering the truth
of her mother’s disappearance before she

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.529
herself got too old.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.490
Linda’s father remarried after her mother’s
disappearance and later passed away in the

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:32.749
late 1990s, and Linda’s brother David died
as a teenager, so Linda knew she was the last

00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:35.180
chance at finding out the truth.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.089
Utilizing the bare bones facts she knew, (Linda
was only seven or eight years old when her

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:44.079
mother disappeared) Linda set out on her own
investigation.

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:49.619
She posted an advertisement in a local newspaper,
the Yukon News near her mother’s birthplace

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:55.709
giving her mothers name, birthdate, birthplace
and physical description (5’5, olive complexion,

00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:58.760
dark hair) as well as her grandparents names.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.740
Linda hoped to make contact with somebody,
anybody, who might know her mother’s fate.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:09.430
In 2013, Shortly after posting the ad she
received a call from a woman from Yukon, in

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.430
the Northwesten Territory of Canada, next
to Alaska, who believed that Linda’s mother

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.470
might be her mother as well.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.079
Linda was shocked to find that her mother
was not only alive but that she had a new

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:24.550
family, With three sons and one daughter.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:30.160
Weeks later, Linda flew that 1,200 miles from
Vancouver to the Yukon Territory where her

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.749
mother now resides.

00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:36.860
When asked why she vanished, Johnson claimed
that her husband Marvin, Linda’s father,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.959
deceased in the late 90s, was abusive and
unfaithful and unscrupulously banned her from

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:44.559
the house without informing the children.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:48.630
Linda is not sure if she believes the story
as it seems highly unlikely that a mother

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:54.389
would leave her children so voluntarily.

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:59.240
Linda was skeptical at first but she ended
up believing her mother.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.499
Linda, now in her late fifties, is considering
moving to the Yukon Territory to Live near

00:12:05.499 --> 00:12:08.139
her mother and make the most of their years
left together.
