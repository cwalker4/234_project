00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.360
Nimitz has been symbol of United State’s
military might, and has been used to project

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.990
power far from its coastlines.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.150
Ford class super-carriers are being built
to replace some of the United States Navy's

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.180
existing Nimitz-class carriers from 2017.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.410
The first ship of this class is Gerald R.
Ford is commission &lrm;on 22 July this year.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.710
It has many key improvements over Nimitz class
like Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.240
and much more onboard power.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.690
Russia’s 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile
is expected to enter into production in 2018.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.840
The new weapon is capable of speeds of more
than Mach 6 is currently in final stage of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.850
testing.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
The missile is specifically designed to take
out high value targets like aircraft carriers

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.340
and destroyers.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.080
In this video, Defense Updates checks out
if USS GERALD R FORD is capable of defending

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.820
itself against ZIRCON MISSILE.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.500
Lets get started.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.000
Zircon missile weights 5 tons.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.760
It is equipped with a scramjet engine type,
which compresses air before it enters the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.220
combustion chamber.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.750
The scramjet is an innovation on the ramjet,
in which the combustion chamber is specially

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.360
designed to operate with supersonic airflow.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.160
Ramjet engine powers the Indo Russian Brahmos
supersonic cruise missile that can travel

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.340
at speeds of 2.8 to 3 Mach.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.100
Scramjet is simply an acronym for 'supersonic
combustion' ramjet.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.470
Scramjet powered Zircon has a speed of Mach
6.2 (6,500 km/h) at a cruising altitude of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.470
30 km.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.220
So it is much faster than a bullet fired from
a sniper rifle, actually twice the speed of

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.780
a sniper’s bullet.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.160
The kinetic energy alone will rip a ship apart
like a tin can.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.750
The range is around 400km (250 miles), though
some sources say it could be up to 1000 km

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.750
(620 miles).

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.970
The Zircon has both radar target seeker and
an optical-electronic complex, to trace and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.500
detect targets.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.680
The missile can be equipped with a High Explosive
(HE) warhead or even a tactical nuclear warhead.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.900
Ford class carriers like Nimitz class have
a layered anti missile defense system.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.980
1. The RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM)
is a development of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.540
missile used to protect ships from attacking
missiles and aircraft.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.570
ESSM is designed to counter supersonic maneuvering
anti-ship missiles.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.720
It also has the ability to be "quad-packed"
in the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System, allowing

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.700
up to four ESSMs to be carried in a single
cell.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.040
It has speed of more than 4 Mach and has a
range of 50 km.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.260
2/ The RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile is a
small, lightweight, infrared homing surface-to-air

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.480
missile It is used primarily as a point-defense
weapon against ant ship cruise missiles.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.940
The missile has a speed in excess of 2 Mach
and has an operational range of 9 km.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.600
3. The Phalanx CIWS is a close-in weapon system
for defense against anti-ship missiles.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.410
It is intended to provide last-ditch defense
when the primary two options have not successfully

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.620
intercepted the incoming missile.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.750
It consists of a radar-guided 20 mm Vulcan
cannon mounted on a swiveling base.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:59.480
It has firing rate of 75 rounds/second, range
of 3.5 km and muzzle velocity of 1,100 m/s

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.400
For years, military planners have grouped
carriers with other ships armed with missile

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.319
defense systems, using their own radars and
interceptor missiles to protect the massive

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.070
carriers from existing projectiles.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.449
So at any time the Ford will have a net of
destroyers and or frigates around it.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.250
Also, US Navy carrier groups have Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) that fly

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.639
ahead to look for potential threats.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.070
It is likely that the Zircon will be detected
as soon as it is launched.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.050
At a distance of 400 km the Carrier Group
will have only about 3.5 minutes to react.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.710
The problem with intercepting will come because
none of the current 3 anti missile defense

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.960
system available are meant to destroy hypersonic
missiles, these can work against supersonic

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.210
missile though the success rate even in that
case will depend on many factors.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.040
As per most analysts, a swarm attack with
of 5 to 6 highly maneuvering supersonic Brahmos

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.860
missile is expected to saturate the defenses
and 1-2 is likely to score a hit.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.570
In case of Zircon, the chances of penetrating
the defenses are much higher owing to the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.400
massive speed.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.500
Even if the missile is broken up or detonated
by close-in weapons, the debris will have

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.449
so much kinetic energy that the ship may still
be badly damaged.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.389
There has not been any specific comment from
American military about Zircon missile but

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.340
sources in Britain have ringed the alarm bell.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.400
In March this year, one senior British Naval
source said: “Hypersonic missiles are virtually unstoppable”.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.840
The Royal Navy’s Sea Ceptor missile defense
installed on the latest Queen Elizabeth class

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.690
carrier like the US counterpart is designed
to shoot down missiles travelling at supersonic

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.300
speeds not hypersonic speed.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.640
As discussed, the current defense system will
be found wanting against Zircon.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.930
But US military has already stepped up the
game.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.540
One of the most important upgrades in Ford
class compared to Nimitz class is the available

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.540
power.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.630
2 Bechtel A1B nuclear reactors are installed
in Gerald R. Ford.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.830
Each one these are capable of producing 300
MW of electricity, triple the 100 MW of each

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.980
Nimitz-class reactors.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.430
These have been installed so that the Ford
class can be equipped with Laser guns in coming

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.500
days.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.490
The LaWS, an acronym for Laser Weapons System
is currently in testing phase and it is expected

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.990
that in future its variants will be installed
in US navy ships.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.940
Laser weapons begin with an advantage no other
weapon ever invented comes even close to matching.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.850
It moves, by definition, at the speed of light.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:01.240
For comparison, that is more than 50,000 times
the speed of an incoming missile like Zircon.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.360
LASER weapons will be the apt answer for defending
against Zircon missile.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.270
In current state, the Zircon missile is a
mighty adversary to US Navy carrier groups

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.100
and will potentially make the US carriers
stay out of its range.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.680
In future, laser weapons will be able to level
the playing field.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.979
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) has recently published its report

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:34.270
on military spending of 2016.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.300
US still dominate the space and on a grand
scale, the report showed.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:46.330
Total US military expenditure of $611 billion
is over one-third of world military expenditure.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.949
This is nearly 3 times the level of China’s
spending, which is ranked second, and 9 times

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.680
the spending of Russia which is ranked 4th.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.880
It is clear that Russia cannot match the US,
platform to platform in military hardware,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.479
for example it cannot build so many aircraft
carriers to equal the US carrier fleet.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:08.729
Hence, it is focusing on developing asymmetric
warfare capabilities and Zircon is designed

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:10.250
keeping that in mind.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.980
As of today, Zircon missile costing few million
dollars is technically capable of taking out

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.480
a newly build 13 billion dollar carrier.
