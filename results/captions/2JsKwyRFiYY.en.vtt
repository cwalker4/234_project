00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.119
Thanks Pat, thanks to the Royal Institution for having me back

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.010
This is one of my favourite places to come visit

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
and I thought that I would in the tradition of

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.009
Michael Faraday and Humphrey Davy, and all the greats. Who've stood more or less in this place

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.949
Begin the lecture by doing an experiment

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.468
Now I'm a theoretical physicist. I'm not an experimenter, so don't get your hopes up too high

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.590
But I would like to do an experiment that illuminates the fundamental nature of motion

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.409
Ok so you see here. We have an object

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.889
It's a book you can buy it and the finest book stores everywhere

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.939
And we're going to observe what happens to the object

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.199
Nothing much happens to the object is the short answer to it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.629
it just sits there, but I can if I push on the object get it moving and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.040
Then if I stop pushing it stops moving the nature of motion there being demonstrated to you right there

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.209
so if you were the kind of systematic thinker that lets say

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.259
Aristotle was you would go from a demonstration like that

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.019
To a very deep picture of how the world works at a fundamental level you would say that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.389
There is something called the natural state for the book to be in which is just sitting there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.110
motionless

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.569
You would say that if you don't do anything an object stays in its natural state

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
But if you apply a force to it in impetus

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.459
You can change its natural state you can cause it to start moving and you notice when I then stopped pushing

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.549
It stopped it returns to its natural state

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.519
So you invent what at what philosophers would call an ontology or a metaphysics of?

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.919
Fundamental view of what the world is made of it's made of things that have natural States

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.509
And if they're not staying stationary and unchanging in their natural States

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.229
It is because something is changing them when there is motion

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.569
there is a mover and you can go from this simple idea - a theory of physics as

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.340
Aristotle did and you can in fact go beyond that to a theory of metaphysics that explains

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.400
Not just the motion of things but more or less

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.159
How everything changes and transforms at all you can even go all the way back you can say well, okay

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.710
This thing is moving because this other thing is pushing it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.689
But what causes that other thing to be moving if you trace the chain of?

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.099
Motion and movers backward you eventually would need to reach an unmoved mover and thereby prove the existence of God

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.880
Without ever leaving the lecture hall right here

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.240
this way of thinking is not only a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.659
Systematize ation of some very simple physics experiments you can do it also sort of accords well with our everyday

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.010
experience when you see something moving or not moving it's because something is moving it or not moving it so there became a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.190
philosophical tradition, which tried to go from the physics of it to a deeper understanding

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.520
Claiming that everything that happens whether it's motion or otherwise happens for a reason

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.499
This is not just a bumper sticker you can buy this is a very venerable

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.529
Philosophical maxim known as the principle of sufficient reason so here you have Aristotle

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.569
Spinoza followed up with his version of the principle of sufficient reason and then live nets on the right german philosopher who also invented calculus

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.490
They all put forward this idea that we can understand how the world works at a deep level by providing

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.499
Explanations for everything we see in it nothing happens randomly nothing just happens

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.990
There's always a purpose a cause a reason why?

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.329
Things happen you might be forgiven for thinking that the ultimate purpose was ever more grandiose hairstyles for professional philosophers

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.149
Even if live Nets sort of had some artificial help there in in in his

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.710
coffer

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.189
The problem is that this is not right?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.170
The problem is that the world does not work this way at a fundamental level

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.959
There's two problems one is it's not right the other is

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.559
Despite the fact that it's not right we haven't abandoned it yet

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.200
So we have learned a lot about how the world works because of the progress science and philosophy

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.970
but we still talk a language that is handed down to us by

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.470
Aristotle Spinoza and Leibniz now people have tried to fix the language here is a Bertrand Russell a more modern philosopher

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.480
Trying to point out that the very idea of cause and effect is no longer

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.830
Fundamental in our understanding of the world he says the law of causality I believe

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.659
Like much that passes muster among philosophers is a relic of a bygone age

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.649
Surviving like the monarchy. He couldn't resist right like I'm just the messenger here. This is not. I'm not saying this

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.679
Surviving like the monarchy only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.489
Now many people would be surprised to hear the news that science has done away with the principle of cause and effect

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.130
But I'm not gonna undo that it's actually true

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.689
It's not that there is no such thing as causing effect. It's that it is not a

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.219
Fundamental principle of how reality works it is a very useful helpful way of thinking it about things at a macroscopic

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.950
What we will call an emergent level of reality

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.660
but it is nowhere to be found in the most fundamental laws of physics and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.839
That difference puts us in the position of Wiley coyote a famous American cartoon character

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.920
I don't know how popular the roadrunner is in uh in the UK good

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.339
So wily coyote you will remember if you're of the right age

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.559
had this thing that he did every single episode where he would run off a cliff and

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.499
Because it's cartoon physics not either Aristotelian or Newtonian physics. He would not fall down

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:09.029
Until he noticed that he was not standing on anything. He would look around and then oh and then he would fall down, okay

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.760
We are all Wiley coyote in some sense and in the following sense this

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.939
Cliff this solid surface that we used to be walking on is our old fashioned

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.729
Aristotelian at all notion of causes and effects and purposes and meanings in the world

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.410
We have left that behind the fundamental rules of nature according to our best scientific understanding. Don't work that way

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.039
but we haven't adapted we still speak a language as if cause and effect purpose and

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:49.140
Goals, and reasons. Why are the fundamental way the world works so one of our challenges should be to reconcile?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.689
The deep down vocabulary of the world given to us by physics and modern science

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.859
with what philosophers call the manifest image the

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.370
immediately accessible view of the world we have after all

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.749
Physicists love to make fun of Aristotle and say how wrong he was but look

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.109
The book does stop moving, right?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.380
That's not a mistake

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:18.420
That is an accurate way of talking about the world cause and effect are accurate useful ways of talking about the world you can be

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:26.370
Accurate without being fundamental our goal is to show how at different levels of analysis different levels of squinting at the world?

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.770
reveal different rules

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.560
regularities and even vocabularies for speaking

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:38.249
So I like to trace the origin of this shift from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell for example

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.549
It's actually a long series of very very interesting

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.639
Thoughts and experiments over hundreds of years between Aristotle and let's say Isaac Newton

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.520
I like to give some credit to this guy even Cena

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.810
Who sometimes?

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.810
Romanized or latinized as Avicenna

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.010
He was a persian polymath in the Islamic Golden Age and around the Year 1000 and as a modern day

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.400
Theoretical physicist I find even Cina extremely annoying

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.760
Because his day job was he was a doctor

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.789
He was his interests were in health and human anatomy and he wrote many books about the human body and on

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.069
Weekends he invented new fundamental laws of physics

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:25.559
We can't do that anymore, it's more work now the low-hanging fruit has been picked so even Xena was thinking about

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.630
Aristotelian notions of motion and so forth and what he pointed out for the very first time was that this idea that the book stops

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.140
moving

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.140
shouldn't be thought of as

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.840
the book returning to its natural state of motion

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.439
Because if the book was not on the table here in a room

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.489
But rather out in space like the spacecraft if it were in the vacuum

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.990
The book would just keep moving at a constant velocity what we now call

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.529
conservation of momentum or servation of inertia now

00:08:55.989 --> 00:09:00.509
Even Sina didn't like this idea. He didn't even like the idea of a vacuum in the year 1000

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:02.410
We weren't sure whether there were any vacuum

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.679
Vacuums so he put forward this idea, but it was seized upon by later thinkers

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:14.099
There's no such thing as natural motion versus being pushed the natural motion of things is just to keep moving

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.230
You don't need to keep things

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.769
pushed and of course Galileo helped develop this idea he pointed out that if you think of the

00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:27.479
fundamental starting point of motion as constant motion with the uniform velocity

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.619
And then put in things like friction and dissipation and air resistance

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:37.558
Afterward you get a much more accurate precise quantitative feeling for what happens in the world

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:44.219
So the secret thing that sneaks in is not just a new way to torture first-year physics

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.179
students with inclined planes and pulleys and so forth there's a

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:52.378
Fundamentally new way of looking at the world the world is not made of

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.899
motions that have a mover

00:09:54.939 --> 00:10:00.629
Effects that have causes there are things that are doing their thing according to some rigorous

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:06.988
mathematical laws of physics some conservation laws very often such as conservation of momentum and

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:11.368
of course once Isaac Newton came along and put together his theory of

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:18.238
physics and motion and mechanics we had a much deeper version of conservation

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:23.819
But you could call conservation of information and even though it's sort of in some implicit

00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:29.099
Sense due to Isaac Newton it was really Pierre Simone Laplace who stuck his neck out and really

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:32.219
understood the implications of Newtonian mechanics

00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:37.558
Laplace points out the following thing let's imagine that we believed Newton's laws of motion

00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:40.048
Which they did at the time and in fact?

00:10:40.049 --> 00:10:46.739
I'll point out we updated them since then but it's not in a fundamentally another way that really changes this particular analysis

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:51.719
Laplace says look think of two billiard balls bouncing into each other and scattering off now

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.809
He think takes these in the tradition of even Cena and Galileo and so forth to be physicists billiard balls

00:10:57.809 --> 00:10:58.860
They make no noise

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.079
They have no air resistance or on a frictionless surface

00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:07.739
So they scatter off and they go their own way the traditional question we would ask of our students is if you

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.520
Gave me the information

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.270
at the start of the experiment

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.759
So where the balls were and how they were moving I?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.909
Could tell you I could solve the equations and tell you how they would evolve

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.720
thereafter

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.029
But what Laplace points out is that in fact you could give me the?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.200
Information about what the billiard balls are doing at any moment in time you

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:35.070
Could not only tell what's going to happen next according to Newton's laws. You could say what did happen before that?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:43.529
The information necessary to tell you what's happening in those billiard balls is contained equally well in every moment of their

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:47.189
Existence so he says imagine a vast intellect

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.830
Later commentators thought that vast intellect was insufficiently sexy, so they said imagine a demon

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.529
Which we now call Laplace's demon and of course if we had been at 20 if a 21st century commentator would have been

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.810
Imagine a really big computer

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:07.859
That knew the position and the velocity of everything in the universe and all the laws of physics and had apparently infinite

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.320
calculational abilities computational capacity

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.070
to this vast intellect Laplace says

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.250
There is no difference between the present the past and the future the future in the past or equally

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:25.049
Transparent and known as the present is because they are determined by the laws of nature

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:32.099
So this sets up a whole long centuries long debate about determinism and freewill and etc

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.919
But there's something deeper that gets glossed over sometimes it is worth bringing out

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:44.069
It's not that anything goes, but the vocabulary has changed

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.650
Aristotle would have said if things are moving. There's something moving them. There's a cause or a reason why they are moving

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.259
Laplace as they just obey equations

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.200
What that means is that rather than a cause-and-effect relationship?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.510
we had patterns in the universe think about the

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.670
Integers write the number zero one two three and also negative minus one minus two minus three

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:10.409
There's a pattern there if you tell me any one number if you say three

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:16.350
I know what the number before that was was two I know the number after that's gonna be it's gonna be four

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.820
But I don't think that three is the cause of four or vice-versa

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:27.810
There's just a pattern that relates all those numbers to each other Laplace is saying the laws of physics are like that

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.800
It's not that there is an impulse an enchantment a guiding force

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.870
it's just there's a pattern that says if this then that and vice versa and

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:42.780
This way of thinking about how the world works at a deep level is something we have yet to truly absorb of

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.459
Course Laplace was not right. He didn't know about the true laws of physics

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.019
He thought that Newton's laws were more or less correct it every reason to believe that was true

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.600
But since then we have relativity and quantum mechanics

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.690
And so forth so we have a better idea now of what the law is

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.660
Fundamentally are in fact one of the bold claims

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.009
I want to make and you're willing to disbelieve me if you want, but you would be incorrect

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.000
is

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.209
That the laws of physics underlying

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.079
Everyday life are today completely known

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.840
Here, I put on a slide just in case

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.910
This sounds very much like one of those incredibly

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:26.489
Dopey pretentious statements that scientists have made for hundreds of years right scientists especially

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:33.419
Physicists my tribe are very very famous for saying you know any day now. We'll have it all figured out

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.200
We'll have the theory of everything

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.539
This is especially common in the late 19th century people were saying yes

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.459
We have you know mechanics and thermodynamics and electromagnetism any day now

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.220
We'll have all the physics figured out and then of course it all

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.579
Went to hell because they invented relativity and quantum mechanics and so forth

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.700
I'm not saying that I'm not making any statement whatsoever about how close we are to

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:03.090
Understanding all of the laws of physics or everything we are made of what I'm saying is we know some of the laws of physics

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:10.259
some of the things that we are made of and more importantly the regime that we do understand the domain of

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.480
validity of our current knowledge

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.730
includes everything in this room

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.359
Includes everything that you experience in the everyday

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.250
Regime of your life as long as your everyday regime is not that of an experimental particle physicist

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.959
But you you are made of atoms you are made of particles

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:33.540
Electrons protons neutrons those protons, and neutrons are made of quarks up and down quarks

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.919
And these particles feel forces and there's basically four forces that are relevant here. Gravity pulling everything together

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.559
electromagnetism pulling together unlike charges and pushing away like charges

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:54.180
There's a strong nuclear force that binds those quarks together to make the proton in the neutron and there's a weak nuclear force which is

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.340
Almost dil rel almost irrelevant except it

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.269
Helps the sunshine so that's kind of important the weak nuclear force converts

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.840
Protons to neutrons and vice versa by spitting out a particle called a neutrino

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:12.930
Okay, so for particles electron up quark down quark neutrino four forces gravity electromagnetism strong and weak

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.930
And that's it

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.530
We know there are other particles. There are muons. There are top quarks etc

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:24.359
You can argue over the exact cutoff for everyday life, okay?

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:30.840
But you're made of these particles and everything you see with your eyes touch with your fingers taste with your tongue

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.039
Made of these particles and the statement. I want to make is that?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.859
understanding of what you're made of the particles and the forces the laws that they obey is

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.890
True it's not gonna go away

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.829
it's not like epicycles or

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.309
Phlogiston or caloric these ideas that we had in the past that we showed later were completely wrong

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.030
It's an idea that a thousand years from now or a million years from now

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.009
We're still going to believe that these particles exist that the rules that we now know are

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.959
Accurate ways of talking about how they behave inside you we might get a deeper understanding

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:11.309
You might realize that space and time themselves aren't fundamental

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.880
We certainly don't know how to take these laws and build them up to make biology in chemistry and economics or anything like that

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.400
but at this particular level

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.709
What are the particles and forces that you and I are made out of what are the equations that tell us how they behave?

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.900
we know that and

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.820
I know that you don't believe me because I'm just showing you a cartoon. You're thinking to yourself

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.050
I'm not gonna believe this until I see the equation so here you go

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.399
This is the equation I'm very grateful to the Royal Institution for giving me these six hours, so I can explain

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.169
All of the terms in this equation in great detail, but that's okay

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.529
you don't need to know all the details as you see from the labels on the

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:59.460
equation this is a single equation that more or less is the information that the modern-day version of

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.840
Laplace's daemon would need to tell you what happens in the world

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.149
This is the answer to the question you tell me what the configuration of stuff in the world is right now

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.430
This equation tells you what it will be a little bit in the future what it was a little bit in the past

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.680
It's a quantum mechanical

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:23.970
equation so if you observe the system one of the things about quantum mechanics is you can only predict probabilities not certainties

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.850
But this is the equation that tells you what those probabilities are it includes quantum mechanics space-time

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.580
All the matter particles that were made of as well as all the forces that we know about and of course the Higgs field

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.590
Lurking in the background that we finally had evidence for back in 2012

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.800
What you don't see in this picture?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:51.090
Is anything that Aristotle would recognize as a final cause or anything that Leibniz would recognize as the?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:58.200
Reason why a certain event is happening the language being spoken here, is that of patterns and differential equations?

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.170
not of causes purposes

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:09.060
Meanings, and there's no values here. There's no judgments this equation what we call the core theory of physics

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:15.269
Which has all the particle physics and also all the gravity that we know about the core theory doesn't pass judgment on you

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.200
Or me, it doesn't tell us. What is right from wrong. It just tells you what is going to happen?

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.399
Now even though. I show you the equation you might still not be happy because you say well

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.650
I only trust equations that can fit on a t-shirt

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.350
So I had the experimental evidence that

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.189
The core theory can fit on a t-shirt. We're in good shape now

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.850
I

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.589
Know what you're thinking. I've given this talk before different forms

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.660
You're thinking fine you guys you physicists you have your particles and your forces

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.999
But it's just the same kind of hubris to say that we're not going to discover new

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.979
Particles and forces that you don't know about yet. How do you know that there's not new particles mr.?

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:59.369
smartypants physicist, and of course, there's two answers for that one is it's almost certainly true that there are

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.880
New particles and forces that we've not yet discovered

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:09.780
remember all I'm claiming is that we've discovered the particles and forces relevant to our everyday lives as a

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.729
Working theoretical physicist, I certainly hope there are new particles and forces in understanding

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:20.790
I'm I'm just saying that whatever we discover along those lines is not going to affect your biology

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.610
It's not gonna affect your psychology

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:29.489
It's not gonna affect the motion of the particles that do make up you that we know about right now

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.729
So how do we know that that's a very grandiose claim?

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:40.110
It's one that we really could not have made in years past it turns out to be a very specific feature of the way

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:46.619
That this equation works, it is based on the principles of what we call quantum field theory field

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:52.530
theory is the idea that what you think is a particle like an electron or a photon is really a

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.440
vibration in a field filling all of space

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.129
Why does it look like a particle instead of looking like a field?

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.440
That's where the quantum comes in quantum says that when you look at these things that make up the world

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.390
They come to you in discrete packets of stuff we call those packets of stuff

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.589
Particles so quantum field theory says the world is made of fields

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.600
But quantum mechanics gives us the rules for observing them so we can talk about them in terms of particles

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.310
And then it goes on to draw implications from that idea

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.440
So here's one simple implication of quantum field theory called crossing symmetries that

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.650
Usually taught is a little technical tool in quantum field theory, but it actually has extremely profound

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.880
implications

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.869
So let's say we imagine that there is a particle or a force or a field that we haven't yet found in our

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:50.160
Experiments that might in fact play an important role in human biology or neuroscience. How would that work?

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.910
Well the first thing that a physicists would do given the proposition that there's a new particle is started drawing these pictures

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.969
What are called Fineman diagrams named after richard fineman my predecessor at Caltech my most famous?

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.290
Accomplishment as a physicist is I sit at the desk at Richard iemon used to sit at it

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.519
Is the desk given to the most senior theoretical physicist at Caltech?

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.100
Who is not senior enough to get a brand new desk when they get there so I got that one

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:24.239
These fireman diagrams do two things the number one show us what can happen they are pictures of actual

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.829
Processes so the diagram on the left you have an ordinary particle at the bottom

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:34.199
Let's say a proton at the top the red line is some new particles some particle that we've hypothesized

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:41.340
And we're imagining there's some new interaction or some old interaction maybe electromagnetism or the weak nuclear force

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.590
via which this new particle can interact with the particle that we know about the proton

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.959
so you read the diagram from left to right it says that the new particle comes in a

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.710
proton comes in and they scatter off of each other by exchanging

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:00.749
Some bows on some photon or some new boson that we haven't heard about okay

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:08.009
Number one the diet the diagram tells you that can happen but number two there are rules for attaching numbers to these diagrams

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.610
So if you're a graduate student in physics this diagram

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.460
Will strike fear into your heart because you go oh no

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.929
I have to calculate a scattering amplitude and the diagram lets you do that it tells you the probability

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.720
the two particles will come in and scatter off

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:30.029
Now crossing symmetry is a feature of quantum field theory that says given this diagram given some new particle

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.200
They could in principle interact with an old particle that I know I have inside me

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:40.200
I can rotate the diagram by 90 degrees and I get a new diagram

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.360
That is a little bit different when I rotate it. You know time goes from left to right in these diagrams

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.230
There's this

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.230
There's a little

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.649
technical rule that if a line gets flipped from going left to right from to going right to left I

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.810
exchange a particle with an anti particle

00:23:54.810 --> 00:24:02.789
We're not at that level of detail here, but the point is that rotated diagram gives me a new process with the same probability

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.930
The same quantum amplitude as the old process has in other words if the thing on the Left can happen

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:16.469
where the new particle and the old particles scatter off each other then the thing on the right can happen where to

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:23.459
existing particles two protons or two electron or something like that can annihilate into each other and

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.640
create this new particle you can produce the new particle it can't hide from you and

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.239
This idea that we smash particles together and look to see what comes out and hope that new particles comes out

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:41.880
That is what particle physicists do we've been smashing particles together for decades

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:47.310
electrons and other electrons electrons and positrons protons and protons protons and antiprotons

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.829
Neutrons, we've smashed everything together that we have in the core theory of particle physics

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.110
We've seen what comes out?

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.910
That's how we discovered the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 is

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.570
It possible that there are particles that exist that haven't yet been produced in this way sure

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.480
But we know what that would mean either

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:15.120
They interact with ordinary matters, so weakly that you can't make them

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:21.719
Then you smash literally billions of particles together and no none of these new particles are created. That's possible

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:28.020
But if that's possible then they're not gonna play an important role in you there. You can't make them

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.310
They're just irrelevant to the processes that describe the atoms and the molecules inside you

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.720
The other possibility is that you do make them, but then they quickly decay away

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:44.130
That's what happens with the Higgs boson for example the Higgs boson you make it then it decays away in one Zepto second

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.149
Zepto second is a very short period of time

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:57.060
10 to the minus 21 seconds so we say we've discovered the Higgs boson at CERN. We've never seen a Higgs boson

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:04.320
We've seen the thing the Higgs bosons decay into and if that's the way that these particles have avoided being seen then again

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.109
They're not relevant to you. And me if you did have any in your brain. They would decay away in a Zepto second or less

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.290
This is why we can make this kind of statement about our knowledge of the laws of physics underlying everyday life

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:21.030
It's certainly you're welcome to imagine other new particles and forces

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.180
But if they were there, and they were strongly interacting enough with you and me to be relevant to our everyday lives

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.999
We would have seen them already and we do not

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.389
So we know what you and I are made out

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.429
What is remaining to do is to match this underlying core theory?

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:46.709
equation to the everyday life that we see and that's where this principle called emergence comes in that we have different

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:51.870
Vocabularies different stories we can tell about the world at different levels of detail

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:58.740
The story of the core theory with the particles the electrons and the quantum fields bumping into each other. That's the microscopic

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:05.100
Version of reality our best current microscopic description we may in the future do get even deeper layers

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.940
But the layer that we have right now won't go away and that

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.889
microscopic description is a story of particles fields differential equations the

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:20.159
macroscopic world that we are familiar with in our everyday lives that Aristotle knew about

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.860
Speaks a completely different language

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.409
There is dissipation there's cause and effect

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.550
There's a natural state for things to move in there are reasons why?

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.350
Things happen rather than not happen and much of this is due to this first

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.360
Item on the list here the arrow of time the difference between past and future

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.889
The arrow of time is something that is absolutely central to how we think about the world it is so central that you don't notice

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.580
It is a thing

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.559
Aristotle who wrote books on absolutely everything from metaphysics to drama

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:59.219
Never talked about the arrow of time of course the past is different from the future. That's just an obvious thing. What is it?

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.220
What are you even asking that question about?

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:08.159
But there's no arrow of time in the core theory equation there was no arrow of time in Newton's

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.630
equations for describing the world

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.929
The best since the time of Isaac Newton the best ways we have of describing the world at the most fundamental

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.730
Microscopic level do not distinguish between past and future in any way

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.899
Despite that the world in which we live obviously does

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:31.110
Just doing distinguish between the past and future in many ways we remember what happened yesterday. We don't remember the future

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.449
I hope nobody here remembers the future

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.519
You can make choices right so like right now you could decide

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.790
That you think this is the most boring lecture you've ever heard you can leave you don't need to be here for the next half

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.550
of the lecture

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.799
But you cannot right now decide not to have come to the lecture you

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.069
Cannot make a decision that affects the past right there's an asymmetry of influence where does that come from?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.970
If the underlying law is to treat the past and future symmetrically

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:05.309
Well, it's all comes down to this egg breaking if you understand the egg breaking you understand

00:29:05.309 --> 00:29:12.209
Why all these things are true this egg breaking illustrates the increase of entropy or disorderliness the second law of?

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.949
Thermodynamics, which is going to be a theme of the Royal Institution advent calendar

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.600
entropy increases

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.329
You clean your room you leave it to its own devices your room gets Messier over time

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.740
That's a fundamental law of physics of course you can clean it again

00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:33.719
But that's because your room is not a closed system in an isolated system or in the universe as a whole

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:37.138
entropy increases the universe becomes more disorderly

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:41.219
the reason why is because there are more ways to be

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:43.269
Low and more ways to be high

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:49.289
Entropy than to be low entropy you give me an orderly arrangement like an unbroken egg. It is easy to break it

00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:53.579
There's a lot more ways to arrange the molecules in the egg in the form of a broken egg or scrambled eggs

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.749
Then there are in a very delicately chosen arrangement of the unbroken egg

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.860
That's half of the reason why there is an arrow of time

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:08.610
There's more ways to be high entropy to be low entropy, but the other half is the universe was low entropy in the past

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:15.959
That's more of a puzzle. Why was the universe lower entropy more orderly yesterday than it is today?

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.559
I can tell you the answer. It's because it was even lower

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.080
Entropy the day before yesterday

00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:27.989
And the reason why that's true is because it was even lower entropy the day before that and this logic goes back

00:30:28.539 --> 00:30:30.539
13.8 billion years to the Big Bang

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:38.519
there's no fundamental arrow of time or just like there's no fundamental arrow of space in the laws of physics if you were an

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.259
Astronaut doing experiments, there'd be no difference being up down left right forward backward in front of you

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.079
You could rotate yourself out there in space it wouldn't make any difference

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:52.169
Here in this room. There's an arrow of space if I let go the book it falls. I could predict

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:56.878
What direction it's gonna fall in it goes down? We don't think that's built into the nature of reality?

00:30:56.879 --> 00:31:01.748
We think it's because we live in the vicinity of an influential object namely the earth

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.240
What I'm telling you is that the arrow of time is exactly the same way. It's tempting

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:13.149
It's natural to think that the difference between past and future is somehow inherent in the net in the nature of reality

00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:19.449
But it's not it's because we live in the aftermath of an influential event the Big Bang

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.200
That had a very low entropy was a very organised system

00:31:23.659 --> 00:31:27.579
We don't know why if you want to know why well no one knows

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:33.279
Why if you want to think about why I wrote a book that was the first book I wrote from eternity here

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:35.279
You can buy that that's where this figure is from

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:39.939
So what this is revealing to us. Is that unlike an Aristotelian view which was?

00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:48.038
Teleological things were directed toward a future goal. They were headed toward going back to their natural state of being if

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:50.799
Anything the macroscopic world is?

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:57.278
Economical which is from the greek words start or beginning the special state of the universe was where it began?

00:31:57.529 --> 00:32:02.888
We don't know why it began in such a special state, but since then it's just been winding down

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:07.179
That's all it's been doing. There is no future goal or place toward which we're going

00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:09.789
that increase of entropy is

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.860
Sufficient to explain all the differences between past and future

00:32:14.869 --> 00:32:18.519
And we can't go through all of them that would require another book or another lecture

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.539
But let's think about the idea of a memory or a record

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:30.099
Some artifact some feature of the present day that gives us knowledge of the past in a reliable way

00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:33.219
So maybe that's literally a memory in your head, maybe it's a photograph

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.840
maybe you're walking down the street on the sidewalk you see a broken egg I

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.549
Claim that the evidence that you have there's an egg broken on the sidewalk

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:49.990
Gives you different leverage over the past than over the future you can ask yourself. What is the future of the egg hold?

00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:55.268
Well many things are possible right it could just sit there someone could clean it up

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:59.079
But dog could come by and eat it. It could be washed away. There's many different possible futures

00:32:59.899 --> 00:33:07.419
What was the past of the egg probably like well with very large probability there was an unbroken egg and somebody dropped it

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:08.149
right

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:13.599
We can say something much more specific and informative about the past given this evidence of the egg right now

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600
Then we can about the future. Why is that?

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:24.189
Again, if all you knew were the deepest laws of physics that equation I showed you or Newton's laws or whatever your ability to extrapolate

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:31.840
Toward the past and future would be identical you have some knowledge of the worlds present state, but it is incomplete you have this macroscopic

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.429
configuration of the egg

00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:35.679
But you don't know what all the atoms and molecules are doing

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.840
the number of things the egg could possibly do toward the future is exactly equal to

00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:46.179
The number of things that could have been doing in the past if all you know is the fundamental laws of physics

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.520
But you know something else you know that the early universe had a low entropy you know that our past

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:59.139
Something that philosophers have sadly labelled the past. Hypothesis is most boring label. I've ever heard, but the past. I pathi says

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.999
the universe started with low entropy and that provides an anchor that provides an

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:09.879
Asymmetry between what we know about the past and what we know about the future so you have not only the present information

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.080
But also that past anchor and that lets you infer

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.689
features of what actually happened in the past

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.489
If you have an egg broken on the sidewalk there used to be an unbroken egg if you have a photograph of you

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:26.589
Ten years old wearing a red sweater. You probably were wearing a red sweater that day

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.889
we all know that we've all heard right that there's this general tendency of the universe to wind down and

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:39.789
Evolve toward its heat death over time and there is in my country. There's a controversy over

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.820
What is called creationism?

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.359
Some people think that if you think that there's a fundamental feature of the world

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:52.179
where things just go to more more disorderly states that is incompatible with the

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.469
appearance over a cosmological history of things like you and me

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:05.049
Because we're not low entropy how is it possible that such highly organized things like you and me could just pop into existence in

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.040
a world that is generally becoming more and more disorganized and

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:15.399
Scientists have an immediate glib answer to this the earth and its biosphere is not a closed system

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.160
It's not isolated. You can clean your room

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:25.540
There are things called refrigerators if you put your bottle of champagne in the refrigerator its entropy will go down as it cools, okay?

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.629
So therefore there's no contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:35.450
That low entropy things like you and me came to be as the universe expanded and cooled on the other hand

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.750
Just because you can clean your room doesn't mean you will

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:43.129
Clean your room some of you may have experienced this with children or even yourselves

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:45.089
so

00:35:45.089 --> 00:35:50.839
The fact that the earth is not a closed system allows for the appearance of organized systems like you and me

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:55.729
But it doesn't explain. Why it happened the explanation is of course incomplete

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.809
We don't know the full answer

00:35:56.809 --> 00:36:04.579
But it relies on the fact that there's a difference between simplicity and complexity there's an axis if you like between

00:36:05.009 --> 00:36:11.749
simple systems and complex systems another axis between low entropy organized things and high entropy

00:36:12.089 --> 00:36:17.508
Disorganized things being disorganized does not mean being simple or being complex

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:23.389
Think about one of my favorite examples mixing cream into coffee on the left, you have a low entropy

00:36:23.609 --> 00:36:26.749
situation all the creams on the top all the coffee's on the bottom as

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:34.219
Time goes on the cream mixes into the coffee on the right you have a high entropy situation everything is mixed together

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:38.209
That's a natural flow of time from past to future

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:45.048
But think about the system on the left it is very simple here the technical definition of simplicity vs.

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:48.319
Complexity is how long do you have to talk to me?

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.460
To describe the system in full detail how many bytes of information?

00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:59.239
Do you need on the Left all the creams on the top all the coffees on the bottom? It's very simple on the right?

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.950
Everything is mixed together

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.950
It's also very simple

00:37:04.049 --> 00:37:10.518
It's in between it's where those tendrils of cream and coffee are mixing together in some intricate fractal pattern

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.979
That's when things look complex

00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:18.409
So there's a natural tendency as the universe ages for entropy to increase

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:23.809
But at the same time complexity first increases and then decreases

00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:29.119
It's not only that complex complex systems are allowed to come into existence

00:37:29.789 --> 00:37:34.758
When entropy is increasing in a very real sense they do come into existence

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.559
Because entropy is increasing or at least they can maintain themselves

00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:43.479
They can maintain structure in order and self-repair

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.570
Because we're in a very low entropy universe that is only gradually becoming more and more disorderly

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:54.879
And it's not just cups of coffee and cream that this is true for this is true for the universe

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.609
So here is the history of our observable universe and a very brief presentation it started out

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.969
We don't know what happened at the Big Bang, but one second after the Big Bang

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.270
We know what the universe was like it was hot dense and smooth

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:15.039
That's it. That's a very simple explanation a very simple description. I didn't take that many bites to give it to you as

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.560
the universe expands and cools

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:22.060
It becomes increasingly lumpier because gravity pulls things together

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.649
So a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang we get the cosmic background radiation

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.129
A snapshot of what the universe looked like when it first became transparent

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.749
Tiny variations in density from place to place, but still pretty smooth

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:42.520
Now fourteen billion years after the Big Bang the universe is very complicated. We've formed galaxies and stars and planets and

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.840
Biospheres and lecture halls. It's a very complicated part of the universe

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:53.109
But we can keep going we discovered in 1998 of the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:55.989
It's expanding faster and faster, which means it's never gonna stop

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.579
According to our best current theories what will happen is the stars will burn out?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:05.649
10 to the 15 years 1 quadrillion years from now the last star will stop shining

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.770
Sorry

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:12.039
All those stars are gonna fall into black holes and

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:17.140
Stephen Hawking taught us in 1970s that even black holes don't last forever. They give off radiation

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.529
So 10 to the 100 years from now

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:26.290
What used to be called a Google before the search engine took over the term 10 to 100 years from now?

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.609
There'll be nothing left in the observable universe it will literally be nothing but empty space

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.030
Nothing, but empty space is very simple

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:39.849
But it is very high entropy everything's very far apart, so there's lots of different arrangements for the things that do exist in the universe

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.430
So the entropy of this universe just increases, but the complexity first increases and then decreases

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.670
This is a natural robust generic way that complexity can come into being

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.939
Well we want to do that's the easy part well

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.830
we want to do is take that natural bust simple story and apply to the real evolution of

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.820
complicated structures like life here on earth so

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.870
For me the Epiphany was one day

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:12.489
I was taking a plane ride to a conference and I was actually interested in the origin of life

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.469
I was reading a paper a technical paper on the relationship between physics and the origin of life

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:23.409
So I'm sitting there reading my paper the guy in the plane seat next to me starts talking

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:28.390
And you know as a theoretical physicists and cosmologists you need a lot of people who have furies

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.959
About the universe that they would like to explain to you

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:38.080
So this guy looks at my paper, and he says oh, yes, I'm familiar with that work in fact

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080
I can tell you the purpose of life

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:48.219
Like okay, long plane ride ahead lay it on me. He said the purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.189
Not what I expected his theory to be

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.419
Turns out the guy sitting next to me was dr.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:01.030
Michael Russell the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena one of the world's leading researchers on the origin of life

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:10.540
What are the odds we turns out we're going to the same conference so it's not completely a coincidence everything happens for a reason remember

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:18.820
So Mike Russell's theory which is not universally accepted. We don't know how life began there are different competing ideas

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.649
He has one of the good ideas his idea. Is that in certain environments of the early Earth?

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.350
Were in a low entropy configuration

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:34.240
In particular all the carbon atoms were in the form of carbon dioxide which happens to be relatively low entropy

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.640
Given all the water and hydrogen around them. They could be in the form of methane ch4

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.220
That would be a higher entropy

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.290
configuration in some sense

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.870
To be a little bit poetic about it it wants to be in the form of methane that would be higher entropy

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:52.239
But there is no simple chemical reaction

00:41:53.030 --> 00:42:00.519
That goes from carbon dioxide to methane while increasing the entropy all along there's a barrier in between

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.779
You need to first lower the entropy to get to the higher entropy state

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.919
So Mike Russell's idea is that even though? There's no simple chemical reaction?

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:16.209
There is a network of complex chemical reactions that could do the trick and that in the right circumstances that could happen and be

00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:19.568
self-sustaining and that self-sustaining

00:42:20.299 --> 00:42:25.299
Metabolism could then break free of its original environment and become the precursor to life

00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:29.199
So it's more than just a pretty story. He actually made a prediction

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.699
He's a geologist by training

00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:37.329
And he said you know if this is true there must exist under the ocean floor certain kind of geological formations warm

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:42.218
alkaline hydrothermal event hydrothermal vents where this kind of

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:48.548
Chemistry is going on and after he made the prediction they found them. This is what you live for in science

00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:55.419
This is a picture of the lost city hydrothermal formation deep underneath the Atlantic Ocean in the mid-atlantic ridge

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:01.209
It's been it lasts for tens of thousands of years so Mike Russell and other people think that maybe

00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:04.059
This is the kind of place where life began

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:09.609
We don't know I'm not pushing this theory necessarily what I'm pointing out is that rather than saying?

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:14.169
But entropy increases why should something as complex as life ever come to be

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.789
The it's very very plausible that the appearance of life

00:43:19.339 --> 00:43:22.538
Depended on the fact that entropy tends to increase

00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:26.889
so you actually find the complexity depends on entropy increasing and

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:32.228
vice versa the reason why entropy could increase in this system is only because you had a complex

00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:39.008
Network of reactions and that of course continues to the present day. We live in an open system

00:43:39.009 --> 00:43:41.379
We live here on earth you ask yourself

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.209
What good is the Sun?

00:43:43.209 --> 00:43:48.639
What does the Sun do for us here on earth you might think well we get energy from the Sun?

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.599
But that's not quite right

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:53.139
It's true that we get energy from the Sun go we give the same amount of energy back

00:43:53.449 --> 00:43:59.139
To the universe we radiate back into the universe the same amount of energy that we get from solar radiation

00:43:59.449 --> 00:44:03.428
The difference is that for every one photon of light we get from the Sun

00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:09.549
Visible light we radiate twenty photons of infrared light back to the universe

00:44:09.799 --> 00:44:12.909
with on average one twentieth of the energy each

00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:16.059
But twenty times the entropy

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.959
The thing that the Sun gives us is not just energy, but energy in a concentrated low entropy form

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.160
and we then

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:32.590
photosynthesize chew our cod eat our cows give lectures write books all of that all those processes

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:38.830
Increase the entropy of the universe along the way then we give it back to the universe in the form of infrared radiation

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:46.629
So we are sustained by increasing entropy back in the 1800s. It was a reasonable hypothesis that life

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.770
Was a thing

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:54.729
We thought for instance that heat was a thing if you put a hot object next to a cold object they equilibrates

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.659
They come to the same temperature, so people said well, that's kind of like putting two

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.879
Vessels with a fluid in it the fluid comes to the same level there must be a heat fluid that flows

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.260
From the hot thing to the cold thing not true. Don't believe anything

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.840
I just said heat is not a fluid heat is a feature

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.739
It is a way of talking about the motions of the atoms and molecules

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.679
Life is the same way life is not a force or a substance that is in your body

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.840
And then leaves it is a feature

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:29.259
It is a way of talking about what is happening inside you the bad news is that that means it will end someday

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.129
But we'll get to that in a second. I have lots of bad news. Don't don't worry

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.010
The good news is that once this happens once you get life

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:43.719
once you get this chemical reaction that sustains itself and reproduces and

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.129
Wants to keep going there's this wonderful thing that kicks in called evolution

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:54.909
If there's different ways the chemical reaction could arrange itself and some of them will more robust and more likely to survive

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.119
Professor Darwin would tell you that's what's going to happen

00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:02.829
Those more robust ones are likely to dominate the future ecosystem in that particular environment

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.300
And what that means is that we can once again change our?

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:15.339
vocabularies just as we change our vocabulary - going from particles and atoms to eggs and entropy and and time

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:23.080
We can change our vocabulary when we start talking about biology and evolution because the new words that creep into our

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:26.109
Vocabulary are words of purpose and reasons why?

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.770
Why is it that a giraffe has a very long neck?

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:36.879
You could say if you want to be annoying about it. Well because of the laws of physics and the initial conditions of the universe

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:40.269
That's why giraffe has its long necks. That's the answer to every question

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.840
Why is something true laws of physics and the initial conditions of the universe?

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.400
But it's not the only possible answer in fact. It's not a very sensible

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.759
Answer right there's another answer that says well

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:58.150
Giraffes had mutations in their genes and some of them got longer necks and those were able to reach

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:05.620
Sources of food up on trees that other animals with which they were competing were not able to reach and therefore over successive

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.590
generations the longer and longer necks survived and flourished

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:15.339
And they were naturally selected to be like that so in a very real sense the purpose of the giraffes long neck

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.449
Is to help it reach food sources that it couldn't otherwise reach?

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:27.129
Where did that purpose come in did it did someone put it there? No it evolved naturally, but that doesn't mean it's fake

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.580
It doesn't mean it's an illusion

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:34.150
It is a useful emergent vocabulary for talking about what happens at the macroscopic level

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:41.679
And you're probably willing to believe that if I'm just talking about life and biology. It's where it comes to thinking and

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:48.250
Neuroscience and consciousness that people tend to get off the bus and of course just like with the origin of life

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:53.770
We don't understand the origin of consciousness or what it really is well. We can do is suggest

00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:02.259
occasional steps in the history of life which might help us understand why consciousness became an interesting part of

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.220
Biology this guy up here the C elegans

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.029
Nematode kind of flat worm is a little model organism

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:15.219
That biologists like to study in your brain the cells doing the thinking are the neurons

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:23.439
There's something like 85 billion neurons in your brain and different neurons are connected to each other and a big project for modern

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:28.719
Neuroscience is studying the connectome the way that all the neurons in your brain are connected to each other

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.150
We're gonna start with a simpler system. We're going to start with C elegans. We have its connect on

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:37.119
We've mapped it out C elegans flatworm has exactly

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.810
302 neurons

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:43.509
So you can actually count them, and then now you counted them and see how they connect to each other

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:49.630
We're trying to figure out what they're for what they do in the flatworm. There is a paper that came out

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.349
I'm not sure if it's correct or not theoretical physicists remember

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:58.209
But there's a claim that is very interesting one that says they can identify one of those neurons

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:04.929
Whose job it is to tell the nematode whether it's looking at itself or the rest of the world

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.970
Is this thing in front of me is this dirt does this water, or is this just my tail right?

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:15.190
This this one part of one neuron its job is to sort of

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.480
Have a little bit of self-awareness a little bit of well

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:24.459
This is me not the rest of the world and you can see why if that developed just through the natural

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:31.839
Fluctuations and mutations of evolution it would be an advantageous thing to keep around we have much more highly developed

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.080
Self-awareness and you can imagine other steps along the way

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.990
Malcolm McIver who is a mechanical engineer at Northwestern he studies fish and

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.350
How in particular fish sense their surroundings?

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:49.719
So he points out that a fish with its eyes eyes are very ubiquitous in life

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.330
They developed multiple independent times in the course of evolution

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.749
But eyes aren't that great if you're underwater

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:01.209
you know you can see tens of meters at most the attenuation length of light is just not that far and

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.669
You're swimming at meters per second

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:09.669
So if you're a fish every time you see something new you have seconds to react to it

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:15.580
Maybe a second right so the evolutionary pressure is to make a decision really quickly is this

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.209
Food is this friendly, or is this foe and I should run away

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.410
So you don't need to think too much if you're a fish, but when you hop onto land

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:29.650
Now the attenuation length of photons is kilometers. You can see off to the horizon. You can see essentially forever

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.479
It's possible that you now see something coming long before you need to react

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:42.430
So there's a new evolutionary pressure that starts exerting itself that if you just threw the randomness of evolution

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.649
develop the ability to contemplate different hypothetical scenarios

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:56.079
Then you have a new way of winning the struggle for survival that is to say up on land it pays to develop an imagination

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.589
not just an awareness of yourself, but the ability to put yourself

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:06.289
Hypothetically into different situations and say what is the right thing to do? We don't know if any of this is right, okay?

00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:12.649
We don't know how consciousness evolved or even we don't even know the right definition of consciousness, but you can imagine

00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:16.938
stories like this will be put together by the progress of

00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:22.159
biology and neuroscience over the years the only thing that I really care about I really want to stress

00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:24.569
is that there's nothing that we know about?

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:31.399
Consciousness that is incompatible with the idea that we are made of the particles and fields of the core theory obeying that equation

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:36.979
Here I have a picture of my brain. This is actually my it's not my brain

00:51:36.979 --> 00:51:41.839
it's the skull so I was in it's not to scale either but I

00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:48.978
was in a machine M eg Magneto and cephalo gram machine and there were

00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:54.978
Sensors placed on my skull that looked for magnetic fields you've seen fMRI

00:51:55.559 --> 00:51:59.238
Pictures which are able very very good at locating things spatially in the brain

00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:01.819
But their time resolution is not very good an M

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:04.369
eg has great time resolution because what happens is

00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:10.788
Your brain is made of particles in the core theory in that includes your neurons so when your neurons talk to each other

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.140
electrically charged particles

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:19.219
race down the neurons and as people who stood at this desk long before me could tell you when charged

00:52:19.289 --> 00:52:21.948
particles start moving you create a magnetic field so

00:52:22.469 --> 00:52:26.719
This sense is the magnetic field that those blue, and red splotches are the magnetic

00:52:27.239 --> 00:52:31.938
Fields the south and north poles coming in and out of my skull when I think a thought

00:52:33.719 --> 00:52:39.469
This is just a reminder of something you already know which is that thoughts are associated with real physical things

00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:40.880
happening in your brain

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.509
They're not abstract things outside our physical bodies there used to be a theory that they were right Rene Descartes

00:52:47.849 --> 00:52:50.119
very famously promulgated a theory of

00:52:50.849 --> 00:52:52.410
mind-body dualism

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:57.400
He was a skeptic and he came up with a "Cogito, ergo sum" argument, I think therefore I am,

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.248
I cannot doubt the existence of my mind because it is the thing doing the doubting

00:53:02.219 --> 00:53:05.299
But he says it's very easy for me to doubt the existence of my body

00:53:06.089 --> 00:53:08.029
so if I can doubt the existence of my body

00:53:08.029 --> 00:53:13.399
But not the existence of my mind they must be two separate things he wrote books about this became very famous

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.029
died a tragic death in the cold, but that's a whole another story, so...

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.580
There weren't a lot of tenured faculty

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:25.639
ositions at the time of Descartes in the 1600s so one had to be nice to potential patrons

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.360
So he got to know this young lady Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.320
His his aim wasn't very good. They were in exile and didn't have a lot of money

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:40.460
Princess Elizabeth and her family, but fortunately Princess Elizabeth was a genius. She was a wonderful thinker very highly educated

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.530
She devoured de cartes books and she didn't agree with what he said

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.429
And they struck up a correspondence which is a wonderful thing to read I encourage you to go look up

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:54.469
Princess Elizabeth's correspondence with Descartes and Elizabeth says look this mind-body stuff

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.729
I just don't know you're saying that there's a mind that is literally

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.159
Immaterial that has no location in space and yet it clearly

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:09.619
Influences what our bodies do when I talk presumably my mind has something to do with the words, I'm saying

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.550
So Elizabeth wants to know how does the immaterial mind?

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.089
causally affect the material body and

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.490
Descartes in response drew pictures like this. This is yeah. It was back in the days

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:27.679
They were just begin to open people up right so they knew that your brain came in two different hemispheres

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:31.010
There seemed to be one organ in the brain that there's only one of them

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:37.429
It was not broken into that was the pineal gland that little teardrop shaped thing right there, so Descartes says well

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:43.100
You only have one mind one soul so I bet that the soul talks to your body via the pineal gland

00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:48.229
Yeah, no one else believed that either in the 1600s. It was not a very effective

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:55.579
Hypothesis for understanding. What was going on and so Elizabeth kept pushing on him, and he never really gave a very good answer

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.390
today

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.980
We would have a much sharper version of Elizabeth's question

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:07.699
Remember this I know you love this equation right if Princess Elizabeth were here today. She would say Renee

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.760
Tell me how the immaterial mind pushes around

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.060
the quantum fields of the core theory this

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.939
Equation tells me what's going to happen in the quantum fields of the core theory without any reference to an immaterial mind

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:26.330
So you must be saying this equation is wrong in some way. Tell me how and there's still no answer to that

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.810
So the conclusion that I want to draw is not that I understand what consciousness is or how it came about

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.260
But that we should be able to understand it without invoking

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:39.459
violations of the physical laws that make up you and me

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.279
Does that mean that we are

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:46.179
non-autonomous robots?
Well,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:51.129
I don't think so so the philosophy that I try to elucidate in the book is called poetic naturalism

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:55.389
The idea is that there's naturalism says there's only one world the natural world

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.119
But poetic means there's many ways of talking about the world

00:55:58.119 --> 00:56:03.249
there's many different levels of description whether it's atoms versus gas in a room or

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:09.340
Emergent purpose for the neck of the giraffe or even things like making choices

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:17.139
you can describe yourself as a set of particles and forces obeying the core theory or you can describe yourself as a person and

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:22.570
People make choices if you choose to describe yourself using only

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:28.060
Atoms and molecules, then there is no such thing as free will and there's no such thing as the ability to make a choice

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:34.450
But if as real actual people do you describe yourself as a person then you can't help?

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.419
But attribute to yourself the ability to make choices

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:43.449
So if you want to say can free will the ability to make choices be real and true even though we are made of atoms

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.790
Yes, of course it can in the same way that any emergent property can be real the different vocabularies work within

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:56.710
themselves you can't start a sentence in one language, and then end it in another one and

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:02.109
Once you accept that then the same thing goes true for more judgmental

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:03.950
value-laden

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:11.230
Propositions is there right and wrong is there a way to live in the world with meaning and compassion. Well yes

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.050
It's nowhere to be found in the fundamental atoms

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:20.979
but nowhere to be found in fundamentals of tables either or water right these are higher level emergent properties and

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:24.279
carrying an meaning and purpose are the same kind of thing

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:31.810
Now that bothers people because they want things like right and wrong to be objective right even the most hardcore

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:38.349
Scientifically minded person wants to say well. I will someday do so much science that I will tell you right from wrong

00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:43.609
I will discover how to live as a human being I'm here to say that it's never going to happen more bad news

00:57:44.119 --> 00:57:45.539
Sorry

00:57:45.539 --> 00:57:47.539
The good news is that you can choose

00:57:47.849 --> 00:57:54.828
What to label right and wrong and no one can stop you you construct your own morality the analogy

00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:56.829
I like to use is think of the rules of chess

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:02.480
The rules of chess are not fixed by the laws of physics. We made them up

00:58:02.519 --> 00:58:07.939
We all agree on that, but that doesn't mean they're arbitrary that doesn't mean you could make up any old rules

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.359
And they'd be just as good

00:58:09.359 --> 00:58:12.379
When we made up the rules of chess we had goals in mind

00:58:12.509 --> 00:58:17.719
And when we make up the rules of right and wrong and living together in the world we likewise have

00:58:17.819 --> 00:58:23.778
Goals in mind we will not always agree there will always be people who would rather play go than play chess

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:30.889
We might have to sort of come to an understanding of what our overlap is, but that doesn't mean that we're adrift

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:35.569
It doesn't mean that just because the universe doesn't tell us how to behave there is no way to behave

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:42.619
All right the final piece of bad news. I already sort of foreshadowed this, but you are all going to die

00:58:43.769 --> 00:58:44.970
so

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:53.300
Biologists like to study these scaling relations. How one biological property depends on another one so it turns out that larger animals live longer

00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:58.200
But their hearts beat slower, and it is particular kind of animals like mammals

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.749
for example, these effects cancel out, in mammals very roughly speaking

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:07.819
Every mammal is granted one and a half billion heartbeats for their lifetime

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:10.109
on this

00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:13.008
axis you can figure out you tell me how heavy an object is a

00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:15.379
Mammal is I will tell you how fast its heart beats

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.619
And how long it's gonna live now we human beings heart beats

00:59:18.619 --> 00:59:24.588
and you know once per second right 60 or 70 times a minute so that puts us at about 40 years and

00:59:25.259 --> 00:59:26.299
That's about right

00:59:26.299 --> 00:59:30.079
That's how long we used to live back in the state of nature of course these days we have

00:59:30.269 --> 00:59:32.479
Obamacare and the National Health and pasteurized milk

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.240
So we have increased our lifespan

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:42.470
We live twice as long as we should so that gives us three billion heartbeats to our lives before we die

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:47.059
And if you believe in the core theory do you believe that we are made of particles obeying the laws of physics?

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.479
Then there is no life after death there's no place for the information

00:59:51.089 --> 00:59:56.469
That is contained in your neurons to go when you die because I think neurons and the atoms that are there

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:59.649
they stay in your body even when you you die and

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:05.319
That can be sad you you might want to be I would have liked to live not maybe forever forever is a long time

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:09.880
But I think I could keep things interesting for a few hundred thousand years before they got boring

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.839
I only get three billion heartbeats and three billion is an interesting number

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.120
It's sort of a big number, but it's not that big. I mean you've squandered a couple thousand heartbeats

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.400
Just over the course of this lecture

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.299
Knowing that you have about 3 billion heartbeats allocated to you

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.900
Makes every heartbeat seem precious, right?

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.109
It's not just like a little thing that will grow into something

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.610
After we die because this is it every one of those heartbeats is meaningful to you

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.190
Because you only have a finite number

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:45.519
So the good news. This is not going to sound like good news after all that bad news, but the good news is

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.460
On the one hand we are very very small

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:56.620
ok this is the famous Hubble Ultra Deep Field an image of galaxies if you take us telescope and point it at the sky and

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.249
You click the shutter on the camera, and you just leave it open

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.079
This is what you will see if your telescope is the Hubble Space Telescope. This is what you will see

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:12.190
Our universe is alive with galaxies our our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.360
Before last week I was able to say there's about a hundred billion

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:19.720
Galaxies in the observable universe, I don't know if you following the news

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.129
But they discovered that the density of galaxies is actually 20 times higher than we thought it was

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:26.710
There's about two trillion

01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:28.990
galaxies in the observable universe

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.889
Every one of these dots even tiny dots. That's a galaxy with a hundred billion stars

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.290
Who knows how many royal institutions?

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:40.330
They have where there's a lecture going on there with a picture of us up there. We seem very small

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.509
That's the that's the last piece of bad news the good news is

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.930
We took this picture

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.309
Right we're exactly there. You go appreciate the good news

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:56.110
We are very very tiny insignificant the universe is not about us if the universe was about us

01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:00.789
There was some purpose to the world that was for our greater. Glory. We would not be

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:08.649
Around a medium sized planet around a medium sized star in a galaxy with 100 billion stars in a universe with two trillion galaxies

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.360
We'd be more central

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.640
And if you look at the ancient pictures of the world we were always much more central than the modern view had it

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.300
despite that

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:24.880
we are the little part of the universe in this age when things are complex and interesting that has developed the capacity for self-awareness and

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:29.799
Reflection and thinking and rational thought and writing books and buying books by the way

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.660
and

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.100
that

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.509
Should make us feel pretty good. We don't always do very well at it

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.610
I think both in my country in yours there are examples in recent political history where things have gone

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.430
Not right

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:53.049
But we have the ability to be rational to think to invent to discover to create new things to care about each other in ways

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:59.289
That other parts of the universe just don't care about each other and that's that capacity that we have as fleeting as

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:01.570
Life is it's up to us

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.999
What to make of it the fact that we are made of atoms and particles obeying the laws of physics doesn't stop us

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.030
From caring about ourselves the rest of the world our legacies the people next to us right now

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:17.590
So that's a choice that we can make completely compatible with the laws of physics

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:21.160
I urge you all to choose very wisely. Thank you
