00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.100
Space is the worst.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.720
It’s got hostile radiation, a total lack
of atmosphere, near absolute zero temperatures,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.610
problematic gravity wells, and worse.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.090
In order to keep your spacecraft alive in
that environment, you need electricity to

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.090
keep it warm.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.340
Not to mention all the power to run scientific
instruments and the transmitters to send that

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.660
data home.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.679
Getting enough power in space is a big problem.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.880
There are three ways of generating power in
space: solar panels, radioisotope thermoelectric

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.110
generators, and nuclear fission reactors.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.630
Each have their pros and cons.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.880
Let’s start with solar panels.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.790
This technology has been around for decades,
and works by using photons from the Sun to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.260
knock electrons free from atoms.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.210
These electrons are harvested and provide
electricity for a spacecraft to operate.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.200
Solar panels need to be big to supply usable
energy to a spacecraft.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.640
The International Space Station’s eight
solar arrays contain thousands of solar cells

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.960
and take up an area half the size of a football
field.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.530
Its arrays can produce up to 120,000 watts
of energy, enough to power 40 homes.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.670
Solar panels designed to fly to space are
much more expensive than ground-based panels.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.970
Because weight and volume on the spacecraft
are at a premium, they use high-efficiency

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.840
cells.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
Space agencies have pioneered many of the
technologies used in solar panels.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.920
The European Space Agency recently announced
that they enabled a very thin solar cell,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.630
just 0.1 millimeters thick, that provides
30 percent efficiency by sandwiching together

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.060
4 different layers of materials and can absorb
wider wavelengths of sunlight.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.940
The most efficient panels on the commercial
market only convert 22.5 percent and most

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.940
are in the 15-17 percent range.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.590
NASA’s Opportunity Rover, set down on the
surface of Mars back in January, 2004.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.709
It’s now spent more than 5,000 days exploring
the Red Planet, searching for evidence of

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.060
past water.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.599
At night, Opportunity experiences temperatures
that go as low as minus 105 Celsius.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.670
No matter what happens, Opportunity always
needs to keep its batteries above -20 Celsius

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.930
when they’re supplying power to the rover,
and 0 Celsius when they’re recharging.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.560
In order to keep its electronics warm, Opportunity
has 8 tiny pellets of decaying plutonium as

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.670
well as electrical heaters.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.989
If Opportunity can’t get at least enough
electricity to keep its batteries warm, it

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.669
can’t recharge, and it’ll die.

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:57.480
In the best conditions, its solar panels generate
about 140 watts during the Martian day.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.950
It needs about 100 watts if it needs to drive
anywhere.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.639
Dust falling on the solar panels was expected
to reduce its power to below what it needed

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.150
to to keep operating within a couple of years,
but surprisingly, dust devils have cleaned

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.079
off the panels and allowed it to keep going.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.150
Eventually its batteries will run down, it
won’t be able to keep itself warm enough

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.699
on a bitterly cold Martian night, and the
rover will be lost for good.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.389
Solar panels like this are equipped on many
spacecraft throughout the inner Solar System,

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.269
where enough radiation from the Sun can be
captured and used to power instruments, heaters,

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.760
and even ion engines.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.969
While the solar energy at Earth is about 1300
watts per square meter, the intensity drops

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:49.359
to 1/25th, or 50 watts per square meter by
the time you get to Jupiter.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.200
This is all thanks to the inverse square law,
where the intensity at any distance is equal

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.330
to the inverse square of that distance.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.959
This is why NASA’s Juno spacecraft, is such
a feat of power engineering.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:10.230
The spacecraft is equipped with three solar
panel arrays 9-meters long, covered with 18,698

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.919
separate solar cells.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:18.250
If Juno was at Earth, it would be able to
generate 14000 watts of electricity, but out

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.430
at Jupiter, it can only generate 500 watts.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.280
This has given Juno the electricity it needs
to run all its science experiments, no to

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.770
mention capturing these amazing images of
Jupiter when it orbits the planet every 2

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.629
weeks.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:41.710
But Juno is the first spacecraft to ever get
this far from the Sun using solar panels.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.509
The previous 8 spacecraft that ever got this
far out have used radioisotope thermoelectric

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.509
generators.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.030
Let’s go out the edge of the Solar System,
to NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.400
In order to just communicate with these probes
from Earth, signals need to travel for almost

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.270
20 hours moving at the speed of light.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.030
The Voyagers have the same problem as Opportunity,
they need to keep themselves warm, but they’re

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.340
much farther from the Sun, and they need to
have enough power to run their science instruments

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.780
and transmit their discoveries back to Earth.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.650
Each Voyager is equipped with three radioisotope
thermoelectric generators (or RTGs), which

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.870
are really just a chunk of Plutonium-238 which
is slowly decaying.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.360
This decay releases alpha particles, which
bombard the surface of their container, heating

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.360
it up.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.009
And this heat energy is converted into electricity.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.270
At the beginning of the mission, the three
RTGs supplied each Voyager with 470 watts

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.480
of electrical power.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.950
The RTGs on board the Voyagers have been running
for over 40 years now, but the amount of usable

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.819
heat is steadily decreasing.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.250
It’s expected that they’ll get so low
within the next decade that the spacecraft

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.700
won’t be able to power up their transmitters
any longer.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.729
RTGs provide ample power deep out in space,
but they come with their own set of problems.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.520
The first is the fact that they require a
dangerous element like plutonium, strontium

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.569
or polonium.

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.220
They’re highly radioactive, and dangerous
if they get released into the environment.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.879
In fact, this was one of the reasons Cassini
was crashed into Saturn, to minimize the chances

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:31.009
that its RTGs could harm life on one of its
icy moons (not to mention infecting it with

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.860
its Earth bacteria).

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.520
The other problem is that that RTGs release
radioactive particles that can interfere with

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.539
the spacecraft’s electronics, adding unnecessary
noise to its data gathering.

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.409
For this reason, the RTGs are usually mounted
on a boom far away from the spacecraft and

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.330
its instruments.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.680
The Voyagers used a type of generator called
the multihundred-watt radioisotope thermoelectric

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.699
generator.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.300
Newer spacecraft like Galileo, Cassini and
New Horizons used a modified design called

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.120
the General Purpose Heat Source, which could
generate about 300 watts of power, using 7.8

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.840
kg of Plutonium-238.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.530
Space missions built after 2010, like NASA’s
Curiosity, use multi-mission RTGs.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.349
Their heat source is plutonium-238 dioxide,
generating 125 watts at the beginning of the

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.870
mission and falling to 100 watts after 14
years.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.289
After the end of the Cold War, the US stopped
producing plutonium-238, and ironically had

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.749
to start buying the material from Russia.

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.470
And then Russia stopped making it too.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.550
With a dwindling supply, the US Department
of Energy actually banned NASA from including

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.360
thermal RTGs in many missions.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.270
This limited the amount of power they could
produce, and pretty much ended science for

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.590
the outer Solar System.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.660
Earlier this year, though, NASA announced
that the ban was over, and upcoming mission

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:04.759
proposals for 2018 and beyond could include
up to two multi-mission RTGs on a spacecraft.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.689
Solar panels and decaying radioactive materials.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.069
Is there anything else out there to supply
power to a spacecraft?

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:15.789
There’s one more, nuclear fission reactors,
and we’ll get to them in a second, but first

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:17.060
I’d like to thank:

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.330

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.999

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:23.909

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:28.669
And the rest of our 812 patrons for their
generous support.

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.960
If you love what we’re doing and want to
get in on the action, head over to patreon.com/universetoday.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:39.210
We’ve talked about solar panels and nuclear
batteries, but did you know there are more

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.060
than 30 spacecraft were launched with nuclear
fission reactors?

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.920
One from the US, and the rest from the Soviet
Union.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.970
Space-based nuclear fission reactors are similar
to the kinds of reactors used down here on

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.930
the surface to supply electricity.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:01.160
They use uranium-235 as a fuel for a fission
reaction, where the nucleus is split, releasing

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
energy.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.390
A kilogram of uranium can provide as much
energy as 3 million kilograms of burning coal.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:15.000
The United States launched their SNAP-10A
spacecraft in 1965, and it operated for 43

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.080
days before it stopped functioning.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.310
It’s now in a slowly deteriorating orbit
that’ll take another 3,000 years or so before

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.770
it crashes back to Earth.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:30.060
Don’t worry, its nuclear material should
be largely decayed by then.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.170
During the space race, the Soviets equipped
31 of their RORSAT reconnaissance satellites

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.710
with BES-5 fission reactors.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.730
These could generate 3,000 watts of usable
electricity.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:47.980
They also equipped two TOPAZ satellites that
could produce 5,000 watts of electricity.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.890
The Soviets had a few mishaps, though.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:58.170
In 1977, they launched their Kosmos 954 spy
satellite which had a BES-5 fission reactor

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.980
with 50 kg of uranium-235 on board.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.750
The spacecraft suffered a series of malfunctions
and they lost control of it.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.090
Soviet officials assured the world that the
spacecraft would burn up in the atmosphere

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.830
or hold together when it crashed into the
ground.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.230
Because it had been launched into an extreme
65-degree orbital inclination, it had the

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.740
potential to crash into almost any population
center across the world.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.280
When it came down, in 1977, the reactor came
apart almost immediately as it struck the

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.810
atmosphere, coating itself in radioactive
material.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:38.370
Then it broke up into large chunks which fell
to Earth over a 600-kilometer track in Canada’s

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.280
Northwest Territories.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.680
Canada was only able to find, clean up and
dispose of about 1% of the radioactive spacecraft

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.810
chunks, the rest is still out there.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.770
Fortunately none of the other fission reactors
are expected to return to Earth anytime soon.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:02.310
Like SNAP-10A, they’ll take hundreds or
thousands of years to re-enter the atmosphere.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.950
Considering the dangers, no space agencies
have launched spacecraft with fission reactors

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.310
in over 30 years, but it looks like the technology
might return again soon.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.810
NASA recently announced that they’re working
on a new space-based fission reactor technology

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.180
called Kilopower.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.470
They held a press conference in May, 2018
announcing that they’d completed their ground

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.430
tests of a new kind of fission reactor that
could supply 1000 watts of electrical energy,

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:36.610
and up to 10000 watts for installations on
the Moon, Mars or even for use in spacecraft.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:41.540
The reactor consists of an enriched uranium
core that’s undergoing fission decay.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.990
Heat pipes extend out from the reactor and
connect to Sterling engines which convert

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.450
the heat into electrical energy.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.910
The whole system is self-regulating.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.970
If the reactor overheats, the engines can
draw off more power to cool it back down.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.360
If it’s too cool, the core contracts, increasing
the rate of fission again.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.480
With the ground tests complete this year,
NASA’s next step is to test them in space.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.040
If all goes well, future Moon or Mars explorers
will have all the power they’ll need to

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.940
survive on other worlds, run their science
instruments, and transmit the results back

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.820
home.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.470
NASA also thinks they could install these
kilopower reactors onto spacecraft that use

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:26.760
ion engines, provide the electricity they
would need for extended missions.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.600
Solar panels, RTGs and fission reactors are
the three methods that space agencies have

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.880
used to power their spacecraft.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.430
And who knows, as new technologies are perfect
down here on Earth like fusion reactors, maybe

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.930
someday we’ll see those implemented in space
too.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:48.970
Until then, getting anything done, especially
anywhere far from the Sun is going to be incredibly

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.950
difficult and slow.

Have you got any ideas for space-based power
systems?

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.200
Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.430
Once a week I gather up all my space news
into a single email newsletter and send it

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.430
out.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.060
Go to universetoday.com/newsletter to sign
up.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.400
