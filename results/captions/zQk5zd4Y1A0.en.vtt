This is David Harvey and you're listening
to the Anti-Capitalist Chronicles: a podcast

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.130
that looks at capitalism through a Marxist
lens.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.620
This podcast is made possible by Democracy at Work.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:25.900
On January 2nd, 2019, after the stock market was closed, Apple Computer announced that

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.960
it was not going to meet its sales targets
particularly in China.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.239
There was an immediate crash in Apple's stock,
and the following day, the stock market that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.309
had already lost a lot of money, declined
by another 2.5%.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.680
Now the interesting thing about this was that
it was Apple Computer sales in China, and,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.840
of course, Apple computers are made in China,
but it also has a significant market there.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.300
And the main, official explanation of this
was that the consumer market in China was

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:13.610
softening because economic conditions there
were a bit more perilous for a number of reasons:

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:23.250
one, it was said, was because of the Trump
assault upon tariffs, but, actually, the other

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.860
which came in small print and later reporting,
was that for some time now, in China there

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.120
had been a cutback in consumerism for a variety
of reasons.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.200
But then it turned out, when we started to
look were much more closely at what happened,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.730
it turns out that Apple computers were no
longer as popular as they had once been, and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.900
it turned out that Apple's share of the China
market had been reduced to a mere 7%.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.840
The other 80% was covered by Chinese computer
companies with names like Huawei, others that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.999
I have difficulty pronouncing, but Xiaomi,
Oppo, Vivo-- companies that nobody had really

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.140
ever heard of, and it turned out that most
of these companies did not exist in 2010.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.980
So there has been a huge increase in Chinese
production of iPhones, and computers, and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:44.050
the like; and that huge increase is producing
at a much lower rate of cost and [with] much

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:53.480
easier systems to follow so that increasingly,
in about four years in China, just preceding

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.620
all of this, many cities (and I experienced
this myself firsthand) went from a cash economy

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.670
to a cashless economy within the process of
three years, where everybody just took their

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.069
iPhone, and put it against a reader, and I
couldn't even pay for a cup of coffee while

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.460
I was there with cash, and in some places,
it becomes hard to use cash anymore.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.120
Now I mention all of this because there is
a significance to China's presence in the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.879
global economy, which is not really made very
central, in many of the accounts we have of

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:42.629
what's going on in the world, yet as evidenced
by this last incident, what is happening in

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.170
China is going to be pretty determinate for
global capitalism in general.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.950
And, in fact, I want to argue: it has been
really determinate, particularly since the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.840
crisis of 2007/2008.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:10.120
In general, I want to argue that capital--
capitalism, in general, was rescued in 2007/2008

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.840
by an expansion of the Chinese economy.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.579
And the other reason, I think, is you have
to come to terms with the size of China's

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.820
economy, and we have come to terms with the
speed of transformation.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.280
I mentioned, for example, that in three years,
major cities in China (the one I visited:

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.280
Nanjing) went from a cash economy to a cashless
economy in a space of three years.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.820
There are other speedier things as well, which
I will talk about in a little bit.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.940
But the size of the Chinese economy is something
that really needs to be recognized at the outset.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960
You're dealing with the second largest economy
in the world by conventional measures of GDP.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:16.330
If you take the price parity measure, which
is a measure based upon what a local currency

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.889
is worth and what it can buy, then it turns
out that the Chinese economy is, in fact,

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.740
right now the largest economy in the world.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.480
And if the Chinese economy flourishes, then
the rest of the world flourishes.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.300
If the Chinese economy goes into a recession,
which there are signs that it's going into

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.069
a gentle version of recession right now...
if that is the case, then this has a tremendous

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.400
impact upon the evolution of capital.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.320
But the other side of this, and this is why
it's so important to think about it from an

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.540
anti-capitalist standpoint, is that China
is still formally committed to its Marxist position.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.020
It is still governed by a Communist Party,
and while many people will kind of say the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.000
Communist Party is, in fact, a sort of a capitalist
class party, but it's still a communist party.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.100
They still believe in the heritage of Marx,
of Lenin, of Mao, Deng Xiaoping, and now,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.680
Xi Jinping, as being absolutely central to
their ambitions.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.860
At the last Party Congress, they declared
that they plan to be a fully socialist economy

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:38.490
by the year 2050, and that fully socialist
economy will be characterized by equality,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:50.800
by democracy, by a benign relationship to
nature, by a cultural world of beauty and

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.120
excellence, and this is all going to be accomplished
through the agency of the Communist Party.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.740
The declaration made very clear that there
was no chance of democracy right now; that

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.229
the domination of the party was absolutely
crucial, but it was the party that was going

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.920
to be the instrument for this transition to
socialism with Chinese characteristics.

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.979
So if we are interested in the future of socialism,
I think we need to take what is happening

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:28.780
in China seriously and to see it with two
questions in mind: to what degree does the

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.010
future of capitalism actually depend upon
what is happening in China, and if so, what

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.500
kind of future will it be?

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.110
The second question is: will the future of
socialism be determined by what might happen

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:50.169
in China, by this programmatic transformation
of its own economy towards a socialist economy

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.980
with Chinese characteristics?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.460
And I think that, actually, for anybody on
the Left, we should pay attention to this

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:06.430
because in a sense, we live in a world where
what Marx called the “coercive laws of competition”

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.569
play a very important role in defining who
we are.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:15.729
And we are very much in competition with China,
and China is very much in competition with

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:20.620
us, and I think that this is one of those
things that, of course, the Trump administration

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.961
has brought forefront into our consciousness,
so that we now think about China, and have

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:29.320
to think about China in a more coherent way.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.060
Now I'm not an expert on China.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.889
I wish I knew much more about it.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.690
I wish I knew the language.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:43.500
I've been there a few times, and I've just
worked, read a great deal, and I try to follow

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:52.180
what's going on in the press, but I have t say that I have not got a very clear answer to those questions.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.380
And I have not got either a very clear analysis
of everything that is happening there, and

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.430
I think there's a very complicated society,
but there are certain things that I think

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.920
we should look at as background to looking
at those those issues.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:18.260
The first thing is that the big transition
occurred in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping and a

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:22.320
group of young people who actually got together
and looked at the situation and said, “we

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.020
have to change something and we have to change
it in ways which are going to actually allow

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:34.940
us to increase productivity in the economy
dramatically” because the economy was stagnant.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:43.200
And they were faced with the following situation:
that a mass of the population in China were

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.620
living under conditions of abject poverty.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.320
The World Bank in 1980 did a survey, and they
estimated that something like 850 million

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.680
people were living under conditions of abject
poverty in China.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.180
Now that is one thing-- the other thing that
that is important to this is that China was

00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:10.410
surrounded by countries that were developing
very fast and improving the standards of living

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.440
of everyone very quickly.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:19.649
Japan had done so, South Korea had done so,
and even more important Taiwan, which Chinese

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:23.890
considered this part of China, had done so.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:31.860
Also Hong Kong, which, of course, at that
time was still part of China had done so,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.580
and Singapore had done so.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:40.699
So you had a Chinese diaspora out of the country
that was flourishing: becoming very, pretty

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.940
wealthy, and you had a stagnant economy on
the China mainland itself.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.740
And I think that party leadership saw this
as a very threatening situation, leaving aside

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.020
the attacks that might come from Imperialist
powers and all of those sorts of things.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:09.440
They realized, just to take Marx's phrase,
“the world of freedom begins when the world

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.470
of necessity is left behind”, and they had
a huge gap in terms of covering the necessities

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:19.740
of the Chinese population before they could really start to say they were a developing country.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.860
And it was in that context that they decided
to introduce one of those elements into the

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.889
economy which was going to become critical
for the years that followed.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:37.620
That is, they were going to actually start
to make economic entities compete with each other.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.040
There were going to introduce market forces
into the economy.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:48.740
In so doing, of course, they did consult with
Western economists; Milton Friedman visited

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.340
there in 1980.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.880
There was a considerable revision in the way
in which economics was taught in universities

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:02.240
so that if you go to China right now, you'll
find very few people who've studied Marx.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:08.320
And very carefully, most of the economics
departments are staffed by people who've got

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.640
Ph.D.'s from MIT, and Stanford, and places like that.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:18.640
Their neoclassical economics is very well
understood in China, and so their method of

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.140
analysis of the economy started to shift;
their policies started to shift.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:34.540
So there was this introduction, and whatever
you think of it, it was astonishingly successful.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:42.540
If you take any of the other countries that
moved out of communism or socialism into capitalism,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:48.600
you think of what happened to all those countries
that were in this ex-Soviet Empire, then you

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.920
would say that they all went through a period
of chronic disaster.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.260
China developed very rapidly.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:04.190
The World Bank estimated by 2014, that whereas
there had been 850 million people in abject

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:10.920
poverty in 1980, there were now only about
40 million people in abject poverty.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.560
And most recently, China has argued that it
is going to make sure that there's zero poverty

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.040
in the country by 2022.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:27.240
So whatever you may think of this, there's
no question that the standard of living of

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:34.300
people in China-- their access to commodities
and goods and so on has increased very very

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:42.210
substantially, and that it is, therefore,
an astonishing achievement to bring 800 million

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:47.360
people out of poverty in a period of 20 or
30 years.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.000
This is, I think, China's accomplishment.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.569
But it's not only done that; it's also developed
completely new ways of living, and in particular,

00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:08.259
one thing we would see is a rapid urbanization
of Chinese society.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:14.840
By the time you get to mid 1990's there are
hundreds of cities which have more than a million inhabitants.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:27.240
You now will see a rate of urbanization which
is about 15% per year, and a tremendous migration

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.360
of populations from rural areas in into the city.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:38.700
There were estimates in the 1990's, for example,
that something like 300 million people had

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:46.259
actually moved from the countryside into the
cities over the last 10 or 15 years.

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:50.899
Now, if you look at the total migration from
Ireland to the United States you're looking

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:59.400
at about 30 million people or something like that.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.380
When we start to compare what is going on
in China with what has happened globally and

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.460
what's happened elsewhere, the speed of transformation
is enormous; the scale of it is enormous.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.320
And let me give you here I think one of the
crucial examples, which is important for the

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.740
saving of global capitalism.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.000
In 2007/2008, you get the global crash.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.420
A global crash crashes the consumer market
in the United States.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.769
The crash of the consumer market in the United
States means that those companies in those

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:37.290
countries feeding that consumer market are
in recession.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:44.009
China, it is said, lost around 30 million
jobs in 2007/2008.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:48.350
There was a tremendous labor unrest in China
during that time.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:57.930
There are reports on the numbers of incidents
of labor protests in China, and during that

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:04.029
year a lot of companies went bankrupt; they
didn't pay wages that they owed for six months;

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:11.279
people were left on the streets with nothing,
so there was a tremendous problem in China.

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:18.650
Yet having lost what many people said was
something like 30 million jobs-- by 2009,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:27.279
there was a survey done by the IMF and the
ILO to say what was the net job loss from

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.410
the crash of 2007/2008?

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.829
The net job loss in the United States was
around 14 million people, and the net job

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:36.910
loss in China was 3 million.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:42.150
So somehow, rather, China had created 27 million
jobs in one and a half years.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:47.730
Now, again, that is something which is absolutely
phenomenal, and when I was writing about this,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.320
I was saying, “nobody's ever heard of this
or anything before” until I started to read

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:59.160
further, and I read actually: China, right
throughout 2000 was creating 20 million jobs a year.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.520
I mean, again, this is a huge transformation.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:13.000
Now, in 2007/2008, they couldn't create jobs
in the export industries because the export

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.490
industries were dead, and many of them were
going bankrupt.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:24.080
So what China did was to expand something
which had been beginning in the 1990s, which

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.799
was to expand infrastructure &amp; investment.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:35.760
And I have a graph I often use to illustrate
this, which is the consumption of cement in China.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:42.299
Now, cement is used in construction, so if
a lot of cement is consumed, it means there's

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:51.950
a lot of construction going on, and actually,
China, after 2007/2008, tripled its consumption

00:17:51.950 --> 00:18:03.039
of cement to the point, where in between about
2009 and 2012 China consumed more cement in

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:08.080
those two or three years than the United States
consumed in 100 years.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.460
Now, living in the United States, there's
a lot of cement consumed.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:21.571
But China was consuming at an astonishing
rate, and they were building new cities, they

00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.840
were building new roads and highways, &amp; they
built a high-speed rail network-- they had

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.750
zero miles of high-speed rail in 2008.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.429
By the time you get to 2014, they've got around
15,000 [miles] maybe.

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:38.140
Now they've got around 20,000 miles high-speed
rail.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:44.420
All of this takes a lot of materials, so China
boomed in terms of its infrastructure and investment.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:52.360
Now, if you remember what happened after 2007/2008,
there was a proposal in this country to say,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.640
“Look, we can put everything back to work
we have all of these bridges that are falling down.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.360
We should be investing in infrastructure,
long term investments, etc.”.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.620
But politically it wasn't allowed to happen
because the Republicans, in particular, said, “We need austerity.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.320
You can't expand the budget, you can't do
those things”, so a politics of austerity

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.960
set-in in the United States, a politics of
austerity set-in in Europe, and a politics

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.210
of austerity [set-in] in Japan.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.010
So you have this politics of austerity in
the capitalist world saying the crisis of

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.530
2007/2008 was a debt crisis.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.550
We've got to pay off the debt; how are we
going to do that through a politics of austerity?

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:37.660
People have to suffer in order to retire their
debt and get the economy back onto onto a good basis.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.540
And then you look at well you know what that
meant for countries like Greece and you see

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:46.090
that appalling kind of politics.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.940
The Chinese did exactly the opposite.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.750
They said, “okay we've got this problem:
we've got all of these people milling around

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.900
with tremendous social unrest.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.550
We have to put these people back to work;
We've got to create millions of jobs and do

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.550
it very fast.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.210
We're going to do it in construction.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.570
And we're going to build, and build, and build.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.420
How are we going to pay for it? We don't care.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.360
We're actually going to pay for it indebtedness.”

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:16.779
And the Chinese borrowed in their own currency,
not in a foreign currency, and this then allowed

00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:19.700
them to get out of the crisis.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.770
Now, as they got out of the crisis, of course,
if you're building like crazy then, you need

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.779
raw materials to build, and one of the consequences
was that all of those countries and all of

00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:34.279
those economies that were actually supplying
raw materials to China came out of the crisis

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:36.980
of 2007/2008 fairly quickly.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.260
Australia, for example, provides a lot of
mineral resources to China.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.409
A lot of Latin America does; Latin America
experienced the crisis, but not as not as

00:20:47.409 --> 00:20:50.870
badly as you would have thought under normal
circumstances.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:58.549
And so countries like Chile were sending copper
like crazy to China.

00:20:58.549 --> 00:21:03.620
The rest of Latin America was sending soybeans.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:11.809
So that's what I mean by China saving the
global economy in the way that it did 2007/2008.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:21.320
And what this meant was that China's expansion
was critical at that time and has been critical ever since.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.740
China's increase in GDP has actually been
the most significant element in the revival

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:36.779
of the global economy since 2007/2008, but
as I've indicated, a lot of it was debt financed.

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:40.580
And the debt limit was exceeded.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:48.340
The second thing that happened was that the
China was not only using debt financing, but

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:56.360
was having to build in a situation where they
needed consumers, so they had to start to

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:04.299
push very hard to build the consumer capacities
of the Chinese economy.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:09.890
Now, this is something that's very important
globally.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:16.039
Because the interest of foreign capital is
not only in using China as a place to produce

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:17.150
low-cost goods.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.240
There's also an interest in China as a market.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.020
I mentioned at the beginning that the Chinese
market was terribly important to Apple, even

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.320
though [it] no longer really is doing very
well in that market.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.940
There are some other companies that do a tremendous
business in China.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.980
For instance, Starbucks has more cafes in
China than it does in the United States.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:47.929
And actually, the China trade for Starbucks
is huge, and if Trump messes around too much

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:54.030
with the Chinese, I can just imagine them
putting some sort of restrictions on Starbucks

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.220
or something like that.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.890
And you'll soon see US firms having a hard
time in China.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.779
In fact, some of the automobile firms which
produce there already [are] having some kind

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:11.940
of complicated relations with the Chinese
authorities to the degree that this is one

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:19.700
of the other ways in which the Chinese authorities
can set up a counter movement to Trump's proposal

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.669
about about the tariffs.

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:30.060
So the internal market in China then needs
to grow, but it needs to grow also in a certain way.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:37.620
For example, if you build housing at the rate
that the Chinese build housing then, people

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.600
have to buy that housing or have to have money
to invest in that housing.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.000
To do that, they need to be able to borrow
mortgage finance.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.920
Now, before 2007/2008, there was very little
mortgage finance in China, but when this huge

00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:00.610
building process began, then they had to create
new instruments so that people could finance

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.600
the purchase of housing.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.320
Now, this is an interesting kind of thing
because then, what you see is that the financial

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:18.380
sector suddenly becomes an area in which money
is being expended on lending people to build

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.710
housing and apartments and all the rest of
it.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.740
At the same time, it's being lent to consumers
to purchase the housing and the apartment,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.580
which means that you need very strong financial
institutions to be able to back this whole

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.580
kind of process.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:42.570
Now, in the Cultural Revolution before 1978,
banks basically did not exist in China.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.230
Banks were abolished during the Cultural Revolution
in the ordinary retail sense of the word,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.270
so there was no banking.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:57.159
They grew came back into the picture very
fast [...] particularly after 1995 or so,

00:24:57.159 --> 00:25:04.960
the bank started to play a much more vigorous
role in in Chinese society.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:12.539
But, again, look at something which is significant:
what are the largest banks in the world today?

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:16.170
The four largest banks in the world today
are Chinese.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:25.201
Now, you go from a situation in 1978, when
the Chinese banks don't exist, to a situation

00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:27.810
where the four largest banks in the world
[are Chinese].

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:33.270
The fifth largest bank is Japanese, and the
six largest bank in the world is JPMorgan,

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.529
so we like to think we have the biggest and
most powerful banks in the world, but the

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:41.610
Chinese have four banks which are far bigger
than anything else.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:47.270
And these banks are lending money to developers,
and they're also lending money, of course,

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:56.590
to consumers so the Chinese boom is also financializing
at a very rapid rate, and, again, the Chinese

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.730
economy is being transformed radically.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:12.789
Now, there is, at the same time, an attempt
by the Chinese to recognize that you cannot

00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:20.039
actually build a really vigorous economy in
the long run if the only form of industrialization

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:30.400
you have is the low-wage, high-labor content
forms production.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:39.149
So there starts to become an interesting question
of “How do you change the Chinese economy?”

00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:42.190
So you start to produce high-value goods.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:48.160
And this is where the Chinese computer companies
and all the rest of it suddenly come into the picture.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.000
And, again, notice the speed with which this
happened.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.580
A lot of Chinese entrepreneurs, and Chinese
scientists, and engineers, and so on had training

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.620
in the United States.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:09.260
Many of them had worked for Apple and Google,
and in the computer companies, and the like

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.990
of Microsoft and so on.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:20.399
And there was an interesting sort of debate
within China about, “How can we create the

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:25.030
equivalent of a Chinese Silicon Valley?”

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.909
And if so, “How would we do it, and what
would we do?”

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:32.640
Now, here we're going to go into something
else which is crucial in the Chinese case:

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.700
one of the big misunderstandings about China
is that everybody thinks of it as a highly

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.080
centralized economy.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:48.429
It is not-- it's actually an incredible machine
in which centralization and decentralization

00:27:48.429 --> 00:27:50.460
work together.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:57.850
Essentially, the party in Beijing proposes
something.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:05.230
The rest of the country runs around and everything
is decentralized, and people try to satisfy

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.049
what it is that the central government is
asking.

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:18.270
So in a sense, the central government proposes,
but it's the localities that do the disposing,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:24.809
and; therefore, the decentralization becomes
very very significant.

00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:31.720
And the method the Chinese use is, if they've
got a problem, then it gets farmed out in

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.720
a certain way.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.590
So people say, “We've got a problem”,
and all of the localities, and all of the

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.600
cities, and the regional governments are invited
to solve this problem.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.500
And one of them then sets up and solves the
problem and then the central government says, “Oh!

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:53.920
Down in this place, they solved it this way;
therefore, everybody has to do what that solution is”.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:01.860
And to do that you need local entrepreneurs
who are going to be very active, and actually

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:08.140
what you find in China is that the localities
are very insulated from each other.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:14.310
They form competitive entities within the
totality of the Chinese economy, and they're

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.269
competing with each other.

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:23.860
Now, the mayors of a local city don't get
elected-- they get appointed by the Party.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:32.179
The average length of tenure of a mayor is
three and a half years; let's say four years.

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:38.520
So you're a mayor for four years, and at the
end of four years, you're going to be evaluated.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.410
You're in the Party, and the Party is going
to look at what you've done.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:48.570
At the end of four years, there's this spreadsheet
of achievements.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.760
How much did you grow the local GDP?

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.720
How did you do in terms of ensuring social
harmony?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.940
Actually, it turns out, as somebody told me,
there's now a spreadsheet of about 40 items.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.740
Early on, there was only about 7 or 8 items.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.110
One of them was: “How much did you grow
the local economy?”

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.320
So as a local mayor, you come in, and you're
appointed, and you've got four years to grow

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.190
the local economy.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.049
And if you do a good job, and you grow the
local economy real well, and you maintain

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:22.460
social harmony, people say, “Ah, ok. You're a good mayor of this place.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.500
There's a bigger city over here, maybe you'd
like to become mayor of this bigger city”.

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:31.279
And that way you can make go up the hierarchy,
and you may end up in the Central Committee

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:36.289
in Beijing, and join the party apparatus at
its great heights.

00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:42.530
But in those four years, you've got to go
like gangbusters to try to make things happen,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:50.620
and whenever there's something going not necessarily
on ideas coming from Beijing, you would seize

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:55.180
upon an idea which seemed to work locally,
and if it works locally, then the Beijing

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.710
would look at it, and say, “Oh, that's a
good idea.”

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:05.760
Well, an entrepreneur in particular, who had
experience of Silicon Valley and all the rest

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:13.769
of it said to the Beijing government, “Why
don't we create a kind of a space in the city

00:31:13.769 --> 00:31:22.179
which is going to be all about innovation
and incubators for all of these new electronics

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:24.940
companies and the like?”

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.809
Now one of the things a central government
can do is clear a space.

00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:32.100
You don't have a problem with that in China.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:38.470
So Beijing, just in six months, basically
evicted everybody from a particular area,

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.460
and they created this space called the “Avenue
of the Entrepreneurs”.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:50.450
And they put together this whole kind of organization
of startup incubator spaces.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:56.850
They put in facilities, they put in all of
the paraphernalia you might need, and then

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:02.559
it turned out that, of course, one of the
big things that you would have to do...

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:08.539
China was having problems of very high rents
on spaces of that kind, so the government

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:14.380
basically said, “Okay we'll turn it into
a space of zero rent, so that you don't have to pay any rent.”

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.020
So they set up this incubator space.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:26.860
It was highly successful in adapting and becoming
an entrepreneurial space, which was extremely

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:34.450
competitive, and, in fact, involved themselves
in what they call a “copycat culture”.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.230
That is, there's absolutely no respect for
intellectual property rights in that space.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.380
If somebody has a good idea, other people
would steal it immediately.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.480
So if you had a good idea, you had to act
upon it very fast because if you didn't act

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.990
on it very fast, somebody else would take
it, and somebody else would act on it.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:57.980
So this is an extremely dynamic situation,
and in this particular space in Beijing, this

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.139
sort of thing went on, and they very quickly
started to develop all kinds of new phones

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:12.090
systems, new structures for utilizing it.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:19.970
So you would go through the different phases
of innovation, diffusion, implementation in

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.340
a very short space of time.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:29.370
And this created the equivalent of a Silicon
Valley, and it was done in about three years,

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.159
but it had a very different philosophy to
it than Silicon Valley.

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:36.110
In Silicon Valley, stealing other people's
ideas is not good.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:41.340
I'll read you something from somebody who
is part of this as to what the culture was

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.060
like in China, and it's rather scary. Let me read it to you.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.000
This is from this book about AI superpowers,
which is about the way in which China has

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.940
positioned itself to be the only challenger
on artificial intelligence to the United States within the global economy.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:05.860
So, this is what he says: “Silicon Valley's
entrepreneurs have earned a reputation as

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:10.070
some of the hardest-working in America: passionate
young founders who pull all-nighters in a

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:15.680
mad dash to get a product out and then obsessively
iterate that product, while seeking out the next big thing.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:22.000
Entrepreneurs there do indeed work hard, but
I've spent decades deeply embedded in both

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Silicon Valley and China's tech scene, working
at Apple, Microsoft, &amp; Google before incubating

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.320
and investing in dozens of Chinese startups.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.640
I can tell you that Silicon Valley looks downright
sluggish compared to its competitor across the Pacific.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.660
China's successful internet entrepreneurs
have risen to where they are by conquering

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.120
the most cut-throat competitive environment on the planet.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:54.400
They live in a world where speed is essential,
copying is an accepted practice, and competitors

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.220
will stop at nothing to win a new market.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:04.140
Every day spent in China's startup scene is
a trial by fire, like a day spent as a gladiator in the Colosseum.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.440
The battles are life or death, and your opponents
have no scruples.”

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:18.960
Now, this is the world which creates these
new companies which did not exist before 2010/2011,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:31.810
but which then sudden sweep in and take 40%
of the China's market in mobile phones.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.790
This is the kind of world which is being constructed there.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:46.390
Now, this explains something to me; this copying
economy, which, of course, is one of the things

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:52.690
that is very upsetting to US entrepreneurs
because there's no defense of intellectual

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:57.370
property rights internally within China, and
not very much respect for intellectual property

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:02.000
rights outside of China.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:14.630
But this guy then goes on to talk about the
way in which this alternative digital universe,

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:24.540
which is being created then becomes the standard
by which everybody is evaluated.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.070
As I mentioned, I sometimes visit Nanjing.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:32.990
The second year I was in Nanjing, I went to
the local planning office, and there was a

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:40.070
huge exhibition there, which is about creating
a Silicon Valley culture in Nanjing and how

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.430
they were going to do it.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:47.760
And, in effect, the central government (when
they looked at what happened of the entrepreneurs

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.500
in Beijing) basically turned to all of the
cities in China and said, “Okay, do this.”

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.400
Now, what this does, of course, is to start
to say that China is going to start now to

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:08.550
move into high-tech artificial intelligence,
all those kinds of value-added activities.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:16.150
And this is, in effect, what has happened,
and we now have a situation... (which, I think,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:22.460
it was indicated by this Apple thing that
I started about) ...and now we have a situation

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.600
in which Chinese competition in these areas
has become so fierce and so good that actually

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.780
the United States is, I think, seriously threatened
in terms of its hegemony in many of these areas.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:46.700
For instance, the one big company is Huawei,
and you may have read that the executive of

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:56.110
Huawei was arrested in Canada at the behest
of the United States for trading with Iran,

00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:04.400
and there's obviously something going on here,
which is rather more than just simply a trading

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.250
with Iran kind of problem.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.630
But Huawei has done a great deal of innovation.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:21.050
Now, there's something called 5G: the fifth
generation of systems which handle mass data.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:31.930
Huawei has been way ahead in terms of actually
developing the 5G network and 5G technology.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:37.080
Now, other companies can't compete technically.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:45.070
Now, the United States has argued that we
should not invest in this technology because

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:52.720
it has within it the capacity for the Chinese
government to listen in on everybody's conversations,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.440
and that; therefore, it is not secure, and
there's a security problem, and; therefore,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:04.640
there can be no guarantee that this network
will actually work in the way which will be

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.050
insulated from utilization by the Chinese
government.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.610
So this is the argument the United States
is making, and on that basis, the US is banning

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:19.060
the utilization of their 5G technology.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.450
The same thing has been happening in other
countries.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.540
They persuaded, I think, Australia and New
Zealand.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.930
They're trying to convince the Europeans.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:42.830
In fact, the British are now kind of investigating
Huawei's technology over this security question,

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:47.450
but most of the rest of the world is taking
the Huawei technology.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:53.890
So, again, notice the speed of this.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:40:01.820
We were thinking of China as a country and
an economy, which is about low-wage labor.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:13.040
And it still is a very important low-wage
industrial economy, but since 2010, in effect,

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.890
China has suddenly moved into this area, and
within the space of about eight years, has

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:22.730
positioned itself to be a major competitor.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:33.530
So, if you take the ten top high tech companies
in the world, four of them are now Chinese,

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:37.500
and that was not the case in 2011.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.810
So this is the Chinese model in motion.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:54.720
It is very fast, it is very quick, it is backed
by government, and it is has mixed in with

00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:02.050
it strong government interventions, but it's
also highly decentralized in a way in which

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:08.400
that entrepreneurial spirit that I'm talking
about (entrepreneurial culture) has become

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:16.270
absolutely central to what you might call
almost a gladiator capitalism, which is emerging

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.470
in the Chinese context.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:27.460
Now, I think at this point, we have to ask
the question: “Is this the future not of

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.700
China, but is this the future of capitalism?”

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:39.100
Capitalism has historically grown, usually
through uneven geographical development.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.460
A place develops, and becomes hegemonic.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.290
If I was giving a talk of this sort back in
the 1980's we would be talking about Japan

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.020
and we would be talking about West Germany.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:56.040
As it was at the time that these were the
prime economies, and everybody had to do what

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:02.250
the Japanese are doing, so everybody started
talking about just-in-time production systems

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.720
and all the rest of it.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.540
By the time you get to the 1990's, Japan has
fallen into crisis, Germany is mixed up with

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:13.740
its kind of reunification, so who's top dog
in the 1990's?

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.080
Well, we have the Washington Consensus, which
is basically the United States emerging in

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.600
the Clinton years as a growth economy with
the dot-com economy, and all this kind of stuff.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:33.840
And so, the US starts to become top dog, and
basically the US says to everybody, with the

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.450
the end of history and all the rest of it,
“Everybody has to be like us because we've

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:41.750
got the answer to to how capitalism should
or should not be.”

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:49.780
Okay, there's a there's a economic crash of
2001, there's then a housing bubble and then

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:57.240
the crash of 2007/2008 and the question of
who's top dog right now and who everybody

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:04.340
should copy is becoming really an interesting
competitive global scene.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:09.040
And you can start to see the emergence of
these different regional hegemons.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:16.930
There's the China circuit, the North American
circuit, and the European circuit, with Japan

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.340
uneasily in the middle of a lot of this.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:28.450
So, here we have a situation where the Chinese
are beginning to move into the the top dog

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:33.580
position, and if they move into the top dog
position, you will then ask yourself, “What

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.380
kind of capitalism is this going to be about?”

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:42.050
And that's where the artificial intelligence
comes in because the Chinese have decided

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.650
that artificial intelligence is the future.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:47.620
Now, what is artificial intelligence about?

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:55.430
Well, it's about, actually, finding a way
to remove labor from the production process

00:43:55.430 --> 00:44:00.360
and this is I think then the big question
is: “What's going to happen to labor?”

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.570
And that, I think, I will deal with in the
next program.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:09.240
