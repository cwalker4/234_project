00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.170
“We decided, let’s put a message in a
bottle, why not?”

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.611
“This channel, that we had to cross to get
to the next island, this was the one that

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:10.650
was infested with sharks and stingrays.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.830
I mean, I say infested but there were several,
you know, and that’s a little worrisome

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.289
when you can’t touch the bottom and you’re
in their domain!”

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.440
“We wrote a note, we dated it, and we signed
our names to it, we rolled it up, and we put

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.660
some cake into the bottle.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.260
And we put the cork that came with the wine
bottle, just popped it right onto it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.510
We got up and we went out to the ocean.”

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.110
“I get like five or ten feet away from this
bottle and there’s just this like, lightning

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.710
flash, where I’m like, oh my God, there’s
paper in there, there’s clearly paper in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
there.”

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.193
“I tossed a bottle into the ocean and then
it traveled around for a few years, a few

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:46.730
thousand miles, it washed up on a beach, and
then you found it.”

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.250
These two met in one of the strangest ways
imaginable: through a message in a bottle.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.690
And it’s largely thanks to this guy, Clint
Buffington, who one might say has a certain

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.340
knack for finding these bottles on beaches
around the world.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.633
“You know I thought that I had maybe found
84, and I opened one recently and it turned

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:11.140
out to be a receipt, so I’m gonna say 83.”

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.250
“I’ll tell you some of the stuff that
I found on the beach.”

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.250
“Yeah.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.250
So, definitely bottles, obviously.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.750
Lightbulbs, shoes, yeah, of all kinds, sneakers,
flip flops, every other kind of clothing,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.280
shirts, socks, refrigerators.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.810
microwaves, televisions, computers.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.070
Found a bunch of blackberry phones, I’ve
found cameras washed up, film canisters, cleaning

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.070
detergent.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.070
Did I mention light bulbs?

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.670
Yeah that’s a big one.”

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.710
“Fluorescent tubes, yeah those things are
terrifying.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.979
Some places I go it’s just like a carpet
of light bulbs.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.750
You just have to tiptoe because it’s like
you never know when you’re gonna get a piece

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.090
of glass through the leg.”

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.020
Aside from the usual pollutants and trash,
Clint has found lots and lots of bottles with

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.080
messages inside.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.979
Here’s him holding that wine bottle Carol
and her husband Ed stuffed with cake and tossed

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.009
into the sea on their first wedding anniversary.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.640
He’s also got opinions on which types of
bottles are best for protecting messages,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.020
and which ones look the best.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.300
“Probably the best, believe it or not, is
the most classic beautiful thing that you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.331
think of with a message in a bottle, which
is just a wine bottle that has a cork in it,

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:14.340
an actual cork.”

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.800
It isn’t always clear where the messages
come from — and sometimes, Clint spends

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.790
months tracking down the sender.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.530
He found Carol and Ed after contacting a local
news reporter, who wrote a story about the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140
bottle that brought them together.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.540
But Clint also has an innate understanding
of the ocean.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.850
Ed and Carol Meyers dropped their bottle from
a resort in North Carolina’s Outer Banks.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.110
Clint found it about a thousand miles away
in the Turks &amp; Caicos islands.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.450
This bottle’s journey wasn’t entirely
random: there was some science involved.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.790
The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle
for 1843 has a lot of interesting stuff in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.270
it; stuff like keeping up morale by doling
out lots of rum.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.180
But you’ll also find tables and tables of
so-called “bottle papers.”

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.410
For centuries, researchers used bottles to
study the ocean’s currents.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.220
They’d toss a bottle into the sea, and track
not only where it ended up, but how it got

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.220
there.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.020
For example, in one study a bottle was dropped
a bottle at 24 degrees north, 19 degrees west

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.950
and eventually showed up in Cuba.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.560
Sailors could use this information to learn
about the ocean’s various current patterns.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.250
Surface currents travel in big gyres - think
of them as these whirling circles - and they

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.460
carry stuff like trash and messages in bottles
around the world.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.250
Looking at these current patterns, we know
that Carol’s bottle, departing from North

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.250
Carolina, most likely traversed the entire
North Atlantic ocean and made its way down

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.970
the coast of North Africa before being redirected
to the Caribbean where Cliint found it.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.480
Clint will often use these currents to determine
where to look for his treasures.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.570
“If you’re looking for messages in bottles
on the northwest coast, you’re probably

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.430
going to find some from Pacific Island Nations,
or maybe from Japan.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.940
Say you’re looking for messages in bottles
in England, you’ll probably find a lot from

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.190
the States because we’ve got the Gulf Stream
that goes right up the east coast of the States

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.440
and heads straight over to Europe, so a lot
of stuff washes up in Europe.”

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.900
You can even, to a certain degree, predict
it.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.190
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
has a current simulator, using data from electronically

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.250
updated tracking buoys.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.380
Drop a pin near Hawaii, and you’ll find
it ends up in Taiwan.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.530
And the message in a bottle stories seem to
match right up.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.750
Clint frequents Turks &amp; Caicos, which is perfectly
situated to receive bottles from all over

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.230
the east coast and Europe.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.780
He’s found bottles off the Missouri River
and in other odd places, but the Caribbean

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.440
islands are something of a treasure trove
for bottles that travel through the North

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.870
Atlantic Gyre.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.130
Clint’s real trick, though, isn’t finding
these bottles, but tracking down the people

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.460
who send them.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:05.990
“You know, if somebody sees this bottle
on the beach, which is empty, that’s obviously

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.990
trash.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.990
Right?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.630
But then this bottle is not.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.730
In my mind, that’s treasure, that’s trash.”

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.200
Messages in bottles may not be the best way
to exchange information.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.490
But they connect people in ways an email never
could.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.260
“We wrote, Ed and Carol Meyers celebrated
their first wedding anniversary at the Sanderling

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.360
Inn Resort on February 14th, 1999.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.790
They were wed on Valentine’s Day in Fredericksburg
Virginia.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.050
Included in this note is some of our wedding
cake.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.820
Peace and love to you, we wish you happiness.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.840
And then we each signed it.”

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.700
Currents are predictable; Clint can more or
less determine where a bottle will end up.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.830
But he can’t predict who sent it.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.980
And that’s really the beauty of the message
in a bottle: it leaves the connecting part

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.730
to the ebb and flow of the natural world.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.190
There’s no algorithm, no social network
— just the pulse of the sea, and the promise

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.310
of a mystery.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.110
“When we found each other, it was also a
point in my life when my mother had been diagnosed

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.770
with cancer and she was going to quickly die
shortly thereafter.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.151
And doctors found in me an unruptured brain
aneurysm.

00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:22.460
And in the middle of all that horror and pain
and grief was this magical, really mystical

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.880
experience of you finding this bottle that
we had forgotten about.”

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.890
“And it was a huge turning point in my life,
too.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.090
I mean, I never really thought about it this
way, but finishing college and going out to

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.470
the world, it’s a time when everybody’s
trying to figure out who they’re going to

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.470
be.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.240
Having this as a hobby, it really defines
who I am now.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.800
It’s interesting that it came at such a
pivotal moment for both of us.”

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.260
“It’s probably unfair to ask this, but
do you have a favorite message in a bottle?”

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.940
“Well, I do, and it’s yours, but don’t
tell anybody else.”

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.860
“Don’t tell anybody else, for future bottle
messages.”

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.310
“I think Sting is probably the first one
who really takes the message in a bottle and

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.900
blows it up in pop culture.”

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.340
Sting: “Message in a bottle, yeah.”
