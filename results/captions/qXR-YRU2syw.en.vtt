00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:05.372
Is there a supernatural
dimension?

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:10.344
A world beyond the one we know?

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:14.948
Is there life after death?

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:19.453
Do angels exist?

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:24.258
Can our dreams contain messages
from Heaven?

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:29.830
Can we tap into ancient secrets
of the supernatural?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.901
Are healing miracles real?

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.905
Sid Roth has spent over 35 years
researching the strange world of

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.642
the supernatural.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:48.181
Join Sid for this edition of
It's Supernatural!

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:52.286
[Applause]

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:52.819
Sid: Hello.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.488
Sid Roth here.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:59.793
Welcome to my world where it's
naturally supernatural.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:08.902
So many people have so many
sicknesses and so many of these

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:13.240
people have tried everything the
medical world has,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.943
everything that they've read
about,

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:20.614
books up to here about healing,
and they're stuck.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.283
They believe it's true, but
they're stuck.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:30.257
Well my guest has so many
incurable people healed that

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:37.698
16 hospitals and their
doctors send incurable,

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.100
the ones that medical science
has given up on,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.441
patients to her and she says
healing is simple.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.643
Would you like it to be simple?

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:50.677
Get unstuck.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:56.483
[Applause]

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:01.254
Tens of thousands have been
healed under your ministry,

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:05.158
many miracles, many bonafide
miracles.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.228
But you're special.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.565
You must have special gifts and
powers.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.267
Sandra Kennedy: I'm not special
at all.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.270
What I do, anyone can do.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.772
Anyone can do.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.307
Sid: You've proven it.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.342
You've trained anyone to do it.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.343
Sandra Kennedy: Yes, I've
trained anyone

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.845
and they can do it.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.814
Sid: Well you say something that
some people

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.182
get upset with, Sandra.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:33.653
You say healing is simple.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.822
Sandra Kennedy: Yes, I do.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.924
Sid: So how come when I ask
audiences,

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.260
how many of you need to be
healed,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.131
99 percent of the hands go up
and that extra one percent

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.799
they're just liars.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.637
Sandra Kennedy: The biggest
problem,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:55.942
Sid, is that most people are
trying to get from God something

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.177
God has already given.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.415
And so they are begging God,
pursuing God,

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:03.817
crying out to God, reading
books,

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:07.120
trying methods, trying this,
trying that to get God to do for

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.623
them what God has already done.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.525
So therefore, they put all of it
on them.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.393
It is a big [unintelligible]
mentality.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:18.398
Sid: You said one of the keys is
to fall in love with God.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.734
Elaborate on that for us.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.569
Sandra Kennedy: I actually tell
folks this,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.537
and, Sid, it's the truth.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.640
If I can get you to fall in love
with Jesus,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.543
that's my job to get you to fall
so in love with him that you

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:34.147
just take from him what he has
already given you.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:38.985
Most people know about God and
don't really know God.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.520
They don't know what God has
done.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.122
They don't know what God has
provided.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.657
They don't know the blessings of
God.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:45.525
They don't know what God has
already,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.928
as I said, given to them.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:50.964
So if I can get you to fall in
love with him just from his

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.033
Word, get you to fall in love
with him,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:57.604
you will automatically be able
to take what somebody you love

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.339
has given you.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:06.880
Sid: You know, a lot of people
approach this as almost formula.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.582
Sandra Kennedy: Yes.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.784
Sid: And that is, to me, that is
the missing ingredient.

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:11.351
It's not formula.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.953
Sandra Kennedy: It's not formula
at all.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:14.054
Sid: It's God of love.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:14.754
Sandra Kennedy: Right.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.223
Sid: And getting to know him.

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:20.494
You like to teach a lot about
Proverbs 4:20.

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:22.562
Sandra Kennedy: You've got to
get into the Word.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.397
You've got to understand what
the Bible has to say

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.699
about healing.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.101
And when the Bible says that
healing,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.938
that the Word of God is medicine
then you will take a scripture.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.340
He said in his Word, "Heal me."

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.843
Sid: My translation doesn't say,
Proverbs 4 doesn't say

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.747
"medicine", but I know that's
what the original Hebrew says.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:41.248
Sandra Kennedy: Yes.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:42.549
It says "medicine", absolutely,
it's medicine for you.

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:45.485
And if you keep that word, keep
applying,

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.220
like you do medicine, take it
morning,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.357
noon and night, you take the
Word of God and you talk to

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:53.460
yourself what the Bible says to
you until you get it,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.696
Sid, from your head down into
your spirit.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.833
Now people get stuck, and I know
we've talked about this a lot,

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.770
people get stuck because they're
stuck in their head.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.405
They know how to parrot it back.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.674
They know how to say it back to
someone what

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.209
the Word of God has said.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.444
They know how to parrot what a
book has said.

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.047
They watch somebody, but they
don't know,

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.448
it's not real to them.

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:17.517
So all I have to do is have I
have a pain,

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.719
all I have to do is have
something change and I

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.390
automatically go with the
problem instead of what Jesus

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.224
has said.

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:29.362
But if I believe him, if I
really believe him then I'm

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.231
going to start saying back to
myself,

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.433
well this is what the Word of
God says.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.268
What am I going to do and who am
I going to believe here.

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.405
You know, the Bible says this,
my symptoms say this.

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.707
You know, I tell people
sometimes to take their doctor's

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.309
report, for instance.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.145
You take your doctor's report
and then take your Bible and put

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:46.746
it on top of the doctor's
report.

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.981
Now you got to believe one or
the other.

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.817
You're going to believe one or
the other and the one you give

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:52.953
all your attention to is the one
you're going to believe.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:55.622
So you've got to give your
attention,

00:05:55.622 --> 00:06:00.527
everybody here, everybody you
know who needs healing are

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.396
begging God to do something that
he's already done,

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.731
every person you know.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.702
Sid: Tell me about that man in
the coma that your team,

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.071
not yourself, people you just
trained,

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:12.672
what happened?

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.074
Sandra Kennedy: The man was in a
coma,

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.342
had very little time to live at
all.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.010
Went in there.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.881
His wife was there, and I
mention that because she thought

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:21.881
they were crazy.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.883
They went in there, three or
four people went in there and

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:28.021
they began to speak, remember,
we don't speak to the flesh,

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.422
we speak to the spirit.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.324
We go in because you're a
spirit.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.460
You have a body that you live
in,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.396
that's what's sick, and you have
a soul and your mind,

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.498
your will and your emotions, and
it's your thinking that's

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:39.866
messing up your body.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.735
So you got to get your thinking
right.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.237
So they go in and they talk to
the man as if he

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.805
were not in a coma.

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.907
They begin to say what the Word
says over him.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.777
Sid: By the way, your spirit can
hear no matter what's going on

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.045
in the physical.

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:52.746
Sandra Kennedy: No matter what.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.080
So you're talking to the spirit.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.283
And so you go and talk to him,
hello John.

00:06:56.283 --> 00:06:57.684
His name happened to be John.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:07:01.454
"Hello, John, I'm so and so and
the Bible says this,

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.423
and by the stripes of Jesus you
are healed,

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.493
and God sent his Word in you,
took all your sickness and all

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:08.361
your diseases."

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:10.263
And you begin to speak to that
spirit,

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.432
"Spirit, come on, come out of
that coma.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.135
Come on, bring yourself and let
the healing power of God push

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.903
out the sickness."

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:19.172
Oh I love saying this.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:22.742
The healing power of God, Sid,
when you got born again,

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.145
the healing power of God, Holy
Ghost,

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:28.381
Holy Spirit, moved inside of
you,

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:33.053
so you have inside of you right
now all the healing power of God

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.556
already in you, every, it's in
you now.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:39.959
When you got born again all of
God came in you,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.162
which means all of his healing
power came in.

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:45.598
But I've got to get it from the
inside to my body.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.233
My body is sick, my spirit is
not.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.169
Sid: All right, I want to talk
about that when we come back.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.771
But what happened to the man in
the coma?

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:55.175
Sandra Kennedy: The man came out
of the coma days later,

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:55.942
weeks later.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.177
Woman: Thank you, Lord.

00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:59.479
Sandra Kennedy: Showed up at the
healing center,

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.749
walked down the street and the
person who happened to say,

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:06.119
"Hello, my name is such and so,"
she was walking down the street,

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.054
and he said, "Hello Velda."

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.055
Her name was Velda.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.157
"Hello, Velda, my name is John,"
which meant he heard her

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.659
in that coma.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.294
Sid: My goodness.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:23.870
When we come back I want Sandra
to step by step tell me what she

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.308
had to do, not when someone else
needed a creative miracle,

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:32.145
when she needed a creative
miracle.

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.680
Anyone can teach it.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.049
Anyone can speak a good game.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.018
What happens when you need a
creative miracle?

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.754
Be right back.

00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:44.190
[Applause]

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.693
We'll be right back to It's
Supernatural!

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:21.294
We now return to It's
Supernatural!

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:21.895
[Applause]

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:28.535
Sid: You know, as I was saying,
Dr. Kennedy does not just teach

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:31.905
by what she's learned.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:38.077
She actually has put this into
practice in her own life.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.246
That was an awful thing that
happened to you.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.550
Your nice little doggy bit off
your lip.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.320
That is not a cool thing to
happen.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.054
Sandra Kennedy: No, that is not.

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:53.626
Sid: And so did you have the lip
in your hand?

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.662
Sandra Kennedy: That's the first
question the nurse asked me in

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:57.363
the emergency room, where's your
lip?

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:58.865
I didn't know it was gone.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:03.236
The dog, as I bent down, the dog
jumped up by accident,

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:06.473
and the mouth of the dog, he was
a Sheltie with a pointed lip

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:09.976
like that, closed here and
closed down on my nose to this

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:12.879
side over here, took that lip
off.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.515
I didn't know what it was
because there was so much blood.

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:16.449
I had no idea.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.817
So I just grabbed a towel, put
it on it,

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:19.552
called some friends and said, "I
think I need to go to the

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.386
emergency room."

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:23.223
First thing they said to me is,
"Where is your lip?"

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.859
Well I had no idea if the dog
had eaten it or what.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.461
I didn't know where my lip was.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:33.700
Sid: Now you're talking up,
which I understand why because I

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.601
know what happened.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:38.004
However, at that time I don't
think you were so up.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:39.272
Sandra Kennedy: Oh I wasn't up
at all.

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:42.041
Here I am, I was horrified.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.409
Horrified.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:44.143
Sid: Can you imagine?

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.278
You're deformed now.

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:48.515
Sandra Kennedy: I was actually
horrified.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:49.349
I'm deformed.

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:50.216
And so they told me I needed
plastic surgery.

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.551
The plastic surgeon came in and
he instantly said,

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:52.519
"I can't do anything."

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:55.421
He said, "If it was the bottom
lip it would reproduce itself.

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.257
This is the top lip, it won't
reproduce itself."

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.325
And he said, "I can't do
anything."

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.360
He said, "It's ragged.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.129
I've got to cut it again and
then pull it together."

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.199
And he said, "We're going to
have to have to go to surgery

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:07.901
right now and then you're going
to have to have three to six

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:08.868
more surgeries."

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.971
And I instantly said, "I will
never have another surgery."

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.507
And he just looked at me like I
was crazy.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:19.012
And I said, "On top of that,
it's my lip and I'm going to

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.013
pray for you."

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:22.248
So I took his hands, never met
this guy in my life,

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.616
took his hand and prayed for
him.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:28.121
Went into the surgery, woke up
in the middle of him sewing up

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:31.257
my lip with black gut stuff.

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.460
As he's sewing up my lip I heard
him tell the nurse,

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.596
"I don't know why I didn't do
this.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.498
I normally sew the lip totally
up,

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:40.433
come back three weeks later,
slit it."

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.802
And I'm thinking, I'm a
preacher.

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:43.503
Don't do this.

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:44.070
I'm thinking.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.671
I can't say anything.

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:49.809
And I said, thank God that's why
you didn't sew it up.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:53.212
When I came out my nose was
sitting over here on this side

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.614
because he pulled it.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.248
They had to pull it.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:56.916
So I'm lopsided like this, Sid.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:57.684
I'm lopsided.

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:00.453
The only part of my lip that's
open is a little teeny hole

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:03.423
right over here and I could just
talk with a microphone like this

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.091
on this side.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.527
Sid: Yes, but you're not going
to talk on a microphone with

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:08.528
people looking.

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:10.129
Sandra Kennedy: I had a healing
explosion ten days later.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:14.200
Sid: I know, but don't you know
what you looked like?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.968
Sandra Kennedy: Yes I did.

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:15.602
I knew.

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:18.004
And when I went in, the first
thing I said was,

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:19.606
okay this is how I look.

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:20.473
This is the way it is.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:25.211
And what I ended up doing was I
went home and I got all the

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.580
pictures of me smiling because
he told me I would

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.382
never smile again.

00:12:29.382 --> 00:12:31.317
They would never be able to see
my teeth ever again.

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:35.321
And I got every picture of me
smiling,

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.191
plastered it all over all the
mirrors,

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:40.059
all over in the kitchen,
everywhere.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:43.596
And then every time I'd go by a
mirror or go by something I'd

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.966
speak to that lip and I would
command it in the name of Jesus

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:47.734
to move.

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:50.703
I'd command it maybe 30 times a
day.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.438
I command you.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.773
He said it wouldn't remove,
remember,

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:54.374
it couldn't move.

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:56.109
And I said, I command it to
move.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.878
When I go back to see him I kept
saying,

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.680
no I will never have another
surgery.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.348
I will never have a surgery.

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:03.616
And he kept trying.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.219
He brought out a book with cleft
lips and all kinds of

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.521
deformities, and he said to me,
"I want you to look at this."

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.223
I said, "I will never look at
this.

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:11.257
I don't want to get it in my
mind.

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.125
I will never look at it.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.961
I won't look at anything except
pictures of me smiling and what

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.896
I want this lip to do."

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:20.533
And the day that I had the
healing explosion that I looked

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.971
so bad, I turned my back to the
congregation and I said,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.606
"It's every man for himself."

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:29.575
I turned my back to the
congregation and I said,

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.911
"I command you to move."

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.247
And God as my witness I've never
had a surgery,

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.782
not one single thing.

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:38.084
And see, I think you can count
my teeth pretty well.

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:39.585
Sid: I see.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.953
[Applause]

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.356
Well you talk about two things.

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:45.325
I want you to briefly comment on
it,

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:50.329
persistence and actually acting
on the Word,

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:53.866
not just thinking about what the
Bible says.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.535
Sandra Kennedy: Remember, it
matters what you think.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.770
That's why I wouldn't get that
book in front of me.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.472
I wouldn't get the pictures in
my mind.

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:00.173
It matters.

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:02.942
And when I made the statement
earlier that I'm aware that all

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:05.178
of God's healing power is inside
of me,

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.481
and the only thing that's
blocking God's healing power

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.850
from getting to my body, that's
anybody who's listening,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.854
the only thing that's stopping
it is my mind what I'm thinking.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:19.992
So I've got to persistently stay
tuned to the Word of God until

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.229
it gets my passed my mind into
my heart that I believe it more

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.231
than what I see.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.300
Sid: Yes, but what if it wasn't
you.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.437
What if someone is listening to
us right now and they've done it

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.472
all wrong.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:36.476
They have a picture in their
mind of them dying

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:37.844
of a dread disease.

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:40.413
What can they do?

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.914
Sandra Kennedy: They can do
exactly what I did.

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:44.016
They've actually got to change
their thinking.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.918
The thinking is the process.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:46.986
You've got to change your
thinking.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:49.789
They need to start visualizing
themselves.

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.324
They need to see themselves
healed.

00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:54.193
They need to see if they're
skinny and emaciated,

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:57.397
they need to see their body
getting weight on it again.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:01.267
They need to believe that Word
of God that it's released in

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.236
their body and that there's
something happening

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.070
in their body.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.573
And what it is the power of God
that God has released in you.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.742
They've got to just speak to
that body,

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.043
keep speaking to it.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:13.613
Say I can't lift my shoulder.

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:15.715
I command it in the name of
Jesus,

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:17.083
shoulder, you will lift.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.718
You will in the name of Jesus.

00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:22.488
The number one healings that we
see are cancer,

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:26.392
percentage-wise are cancer and
we curse it.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:31.230
We curse it and we tell that
cancer it will die in Jesus'

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.966
name, and we keep seeing it go,
seeing it go.

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:39.539
And the secret, you release your
faith by praise and gratitude.

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.908
So I have to say, Lord, I'm so
thankful healing is inside

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.009
of me already.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:45.111
I thank you it's in me.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.312
Isn't that wonderful?

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.114
I thank you it's in me and,
Father,

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.115
I just release it now.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:52.652
Sid: So what you're telling me,
if I'm understanding you right,

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:56.756
it says it says in Proverbs that
the Word is medicine.

00:15:56.756 --> 00:16:00.459
You take as much medicine as you
can.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.160
Sandra Kennedy: Yes.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.231
Sid: If you knew that you had a
medicine that would heal you and

00:16:05.231 --> 00:16:07.600
you could have as much as you
want,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.769
what would you do?

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:14.307
When we come back I'm going to
find out what a woman did that

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:20.513
was diagnosed with cancer and
got a hold of this teaching.

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.014
Be right back.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:25.384
[Applause]

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.787
We'll be right back to It's
Supernatural!

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:04.143
We now return to It's
Supernatural!

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.378
[Applause]

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:08.581
Sid: Some of you are trying to
wrap your mind

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.282
around this concept.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.084
It's so simple, yet so profound.

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.621
The healer, not a little bit of
the healer,

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:19.458
THE healer is living within you.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.261
You don't have to run to some
place.

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.130
He's in you.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.266
You talk about, and this is so
important,

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.635
the power of agreement.

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:30.736
What do you mean by that?

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.171
Sandra Kennedy: Agreeing with
God.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.440
You're going to be agreeing with
somebody.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.709
You're either going to agree
with the doctor,

00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:39.478
thank God for good doctors, but
you're going to either agree

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:42.281
with the doctor or you're going
to agree with your symptom.

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.383
You're going to agree with
something.

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:48.654
So you need to start agreeing
with the Word of God.

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.189
Get somebody to agree with you.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.124
Sid: All right, but do you deny
your symptoms?

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:52.825
Sandra Kennedy: No.

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:55.795
You deny the right for them to
be there.

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:56.429
Sid: I see.

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.431
Sandra Kennedy: You don't deny
them,

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:00.833
but you deny, you don't have a
right in my body.

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.435
I'm not saying you aren't there.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:03.936
I'm saying you don't have a
right.

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.837
I do that.

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.273
Now remember, a symptom is not a
sickness.

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:09.208
Your mouth can make it a
sickness.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.278
Sid: You're just describing the
power of agreement in reverse.

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:13.312
Sandra Kennedy: Absolutely
totally.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.580
Sid: All right.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.284
We have readers that read, we
get manuscripts before they

00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:19.385
become books.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:23.923
We got a manuscript in, your
manuscript,

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:25.024
and this has never happened
before.

00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:28.627
Our readers read lots of books
on healing.

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:34.400
This woman was facing surgery
and after reading your book

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.170
something clicked and she didn't
need surgery.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.307
Let's have Lori tell you
herself.

00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:43.709
Lori: I was
experiencing excruciating pain

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:46.912
in my shoulder and was diagnosed
after an MRI

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.614
with a torn rotator cuff.

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:52.685
The doctor actually said it was
hanging by a thread and I would

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:53.719
need surgery.

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:54.353
Doctor: I'm sorry to tell you
this,

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:55.821
but you're going to need
surgery.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:21:01.527
Lori: While I was reading "The
Simplicity of Healing" it

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:05.865
connected with me on a personal
level that changed my mindset

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:07.867
concerning my own healing.

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:10.870
I already had knowledge of the
principles of healing,

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.173
but it helped me to see where I
had head knowledge,

00:21:14.173 --> 00:21:17.676
but wasn't letting it get deep
into my heart and spirit.

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:22.681
While reading this book, God
revealed to me the moment I came

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.818
into agreement with the symptoms
and how the symptoms actually

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:30.222
became a condition because I
came out of agreement with what

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:34.059
God had said and came into
agreement with the enemy.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.797
I repented when I realized what
I had done and immediately the

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.399
pain left my shoulder.

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:41.867
Look, God healed me.

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:42.968
Doctor: What?

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.237
Lori: Yes.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.272
Sid: You know,
Sandra,

00:21:46.272 --> 00:21:50.409
as she was talking about what
happened I could feel the

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:53.846
presence of God coming.

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:54.413
Sandra Kennedy: I could, too.

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:56.415
Sid: What's going to happen to
our people that are watching

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.116
right now?

00:21:57.116 --> 00:22:00.186
Sandra Kennedy: If they grab
hold of it and will grab hold

00:22:00.186 --> 00:22:04.957
and begin to agree with God and
thank him with gratitude,

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:09.295
the healing power of God that is
already in them will begin to be

00:22:09.295 --> 00:22:14.233
released inside of them, pushing
out that sickness and disease.

00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:16.936
They have to continue to praise
God,

00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:18.337
thank you, Lord, God.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.239
Most people know the principles
in their head.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.341
Same thing she was saying.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:27.780
But it dropped down inside of
her and it became real to her,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.550
and it became more real than the
problem on the outside.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.953
And you begin to say, if you
will do it,

00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:36.989
if people will do it, if they
would just begin to say,

00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:38.691
thank you, Lord, that I am
healed,

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.826
thank you that you're doing this
in my life,

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:44.730
thank you, Father God, that the
healing power is in me.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.931
I agree with you.

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:47.566
You said I'm healed, so bless
God,

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:48.334
I'm healed.

00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:51.136
You know, you've got to get in
agreement with somebody.

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:53.539
I'm going to agree with you,
God.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.173
Sid: Okay.

00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:55.307
I hear what you're saying.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:58.677
But again, one of your staff
people,

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:01.480
director of ministry, develops
cancer.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.681
How bad a cancer?

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:04.650
There's no such thing as a good
cancer.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.451
How bad?

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:06.752
Sandra Kennedy: Well she totally
recovered.

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:08.988
The mass was just all the way
across her stomach,

00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:09.889
just totally that way.

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.190
She just happened to be a nurse,
too.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.494
And she said that the Word is
more powerful than a two-edged

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:19.098
sword, and so she went in and
let the Word become a scaffold

00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:22.368
to her and she spoke to the
cancer,

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:25.337
and believed God to cut that
cancer out.

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:26.105
No pain.

00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:27.439
The pain did not leave.

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:30.609
I mean, she was hurting just as
bad.

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:32.244
Every time she'd go back to the
doctor.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.546
Sid: That took raw faith.

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:35.247
Sandra Kennedy: Absolutely.

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:35.981
Absolutely.

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:41.053
And the pain did not leave until
the day she got the full report

00:23:41.053 --> 00:23:43.589
that she was totally
cancer-free.

00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:45.457
And she didn't have surgery now.

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.226
She never had surgery.

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:51.163
[Applause]

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:53.766
Sid: Are many people with cancer
healed in your organization.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:54.500
Sandra Kennedy: Yes.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.901
The number one healings are
cancer.

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.703
I mean, we get calls from all
over the world.

00:23:57.703 --> 00:24:01.540
We teach people exactly what I'm
teaching here: How to believe

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.809
God, how to get in agreement
with God,

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:07.146
how to expect God to keep his
Word,

00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:11.850
how to expect God to do what he
says he has done.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.687
And most of us believe that
we've got to get God to do

00:24:14.687 --> 00:24:18.223
something and it's a whole
different concept when you're

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.758
praising him, but he's already
done it.

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:21.393
Sid: Do you know what I'm
hearing,

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:24.997
and I'm going to shout it to
you: Never give up!

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:25.964
Sandra Kennedy: Never give up.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:26.899
Sid: Never give up!

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:28.300
Never give up!

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.401
Sandra Kennedy: Never give up!

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:30.269
Amen!

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:32.071
Amen!

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:06.652
Sid: Next week on It's
Supernatural!
