00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.120
[Chatter]

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.400
The chatter never stops,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.360
the jihadi chat rooms, the Islamic State Twitter
pages never close.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.340
But sometimes you come across something that

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.640
shocks and that makes you think.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.039
[Keyboard typing]

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.449
Over the past four months,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.800
Sky News has been in contact with senior jihadists
in Syria.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.419
We created fictional characters, committed
to jihad,

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.910
and appointed a freelance investigative journalist
to run those characters.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.120
Very soon, our posts attracted the attention

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.980
of two major players in Islamic State's so-called
cyber caliphate.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.260
Junaid Hussain is a 21-year-old hacker turned
jihadist from Birmingham

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.240
who runs the IS information and recruitment
arm from Syria.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.980
Known as Abu Hussain, he has been identified
by the United States Secret Service

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.350
as a top five target for elimination by drone
strike.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.489
His wife, Sally Jones, a former punk from
Chatham,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.120
is now also in Syria, working alongside Junaid

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.740
but dealing with the female IS-supporting
jihadists.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.540
[Road noise]

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.460
From the start, it became clear that Islamic
State want their recruits to attack in the UK.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.590
We can reveal that this is an entirely new
tactic by Islamic State,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.910
who originally called for volunteers to join
them. No more.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.860
Sending us details - specially-compiled guidebooks -

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.190
they urged our characters to form gangs.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.060
To create a British Islamic State movement

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.350
over a long period of time.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.550
The books contain guidance on everything -

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.390
from getting money to building weapons.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.900
This new strategy is a major departure.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.770
They focus now on so-called lone wolf killers.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.880
"They're saying the best way to get the kufars,
which are the non-believers,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.220
"is hitting them in their own countries.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.800
"Hitting them hard."

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.660
Communicating via encrypted messaging sites,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.479
a second conversation started with our second
character - a girl.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.840
Very quickly, Sally Jones came straight to
the point.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.529
"She messaged me, saying 'greetings', and
then I replied.

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.329
"And then she asked straight away, 'What do
you want to do?'

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.019
"'Why are you here?' She was asking why I
was messaging her,

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.639
"and I told her I got her account from Abu
Hussain.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.239
"She said, 'Yes, that's my husband. So, do
you want to do something over there?'

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.529
"She was straight to point and I said yeah,

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.609
"'cos Hussein had released some tweets

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.769
"about how there needed to be an attack in
England

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.540
"because it had been long.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.249
"So I said those tweets resonated with me,

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.429
"and she said, 'Very good. So, do you want
to make a bomb

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.309
"or do you want to just cut some heads off, some kuffs' heads off?'

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.469
"I said a bomb would be easiest.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.920
"And from there, step-by-step, she said, 'First
what I'm going to do is send you a manual.'"

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.910
Assuring us she would help guide us through the making of a bomb.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.620
Sally Jones told us the materials we would need,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.020
asking us to get them and to show her a receipt
with a clear date.

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.379
She's checking to see if we were authentic.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.930
Sensing our character's worries, Sally Jones
took an unusual step to try and reassure us.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.459
She revealed she had another potential bomb-maker,

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.049
and two others who, she said, had so far failed
to attack.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.329
"They had made the bomb, all set and ready
to go,

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.090
"but on the day they were missing.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.469
"But then she mentioned a girl in Glasgow
and she said she was very good

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.569
"and she is going to do the attack.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.299
"What we don't know is where she's doing the
attack or when she's doing the attack."

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.579
Not losing momentum, Sally Jones sent us the
details of the intended target.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.909
August the 15th at the VJ commemorations,

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.109
the Queen and the Royal Family in Horse Guards
Parade.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.859
With one or even three potential real bombers
at large,

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.499
we contacted the Met's anti-terror branch
and informed them.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.540
This information was later passed to a Sunday
newspaper.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.499
The police deny involvement in that,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.100
rather encouraging us to continue our investigation.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.989
We wanted more information on potential attacks
in the UK,

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.840
so I took the tried and tested jihadi route
through Istanbul

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.550
to the Turkish-Arabic city of Urfa,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.940
near the Syrian border.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.780
Our Islamic State contacts confirmed the new
policy

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.710
for British and European jihadists to stay
in their countries,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.750
but I was told that there were specific developments

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.620
and needed to meet at a secret location -

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.320
information I would only be given on arrival.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.200
"Well, the secret services are all over Urfa

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.330
"and our contacts have been followed every
time we've tried to get to a meeting

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.910
"with a former Islamic State operative.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.620
"He's in a safe house

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.620
"and has said that what we need to do is to come
to this souk

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.699
"and try and disappear in the crowd,

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.830
"so I'm following these guys - they know where
the location is."

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.210
Having alluded the authorities, I was introduced
to this man.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.439
In Islamic State, he was part of the organisation's
internal security.

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.909
They've been known as the equivalent of the
Gestapo.

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.120
Hardcore, blood-thirsty and dangerous.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.889
They're feared and kill at will.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.220
His job was to oversee VIP foreign jihadists,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.169
as they underwent training for specific missions
outside Syria and Iraq.

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.580
He claimed four or five of them were English.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.930
More importantly, he says they completed training

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.170
and have returned to Britain to carry out
an attack.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.780
"In that training, what are they being trained
to do?

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.660
"What things - is it making bombs? Is it shooting?
Is it beheading?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.460
"I mean, what are they taught?"

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.110
Already stretched, British security services
cannot afford to ignore the possibility

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.620
that seven bombers could be operating in the
UK that we know of.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.909
Whether they're real or not is impossible
to know.

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:36.979
But Sally Jones believes there is an eighth
- our character.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.490
Until today, our communications have continued.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.280
Her final message clear and cold-blooded.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.090
Do it - that's all.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.410
