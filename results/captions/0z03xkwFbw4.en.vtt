00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.166
This is me ten years ago.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.179
I weighed 40 pounds more than today,

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:25.428
and like many people,
I wanted to lose weight.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:31.389
Like many people, I wanted to know
what is the best diet for humans.

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.710
Many of us actually have an opinion
about this question.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.399
Some believe that a low fat,
plant-based diet is the best.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.030
Others, that a low-carb diet,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.531
rich in protein
and animal fat, is the best.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.981
Others have opinions
on how much sugar we should eat,

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:53.094
or how much salt, cholesterol,
saturated fat, eggs or dairy products

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.789
we should have in our diet.

00:00:56.602 --> 00:00:59.450
But the question of what the best diet is,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.071
is a scientific one,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.731
so there should be no room
for opinions or beliefs.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.102
If Diet A is really better than Diet B,

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:11.072
then a study that compares
the two on enough people

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:12.928
should show that definitively.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.937
No opinions, no beliefs,
just hard data, right?

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.990
What is also clear is that
if the best diet does exist,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.832
then we haven't yet found it

00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:26.819
because the incidence
of diet-related disease

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.019
has increased dramatically
in the past several decades.

00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:34.549
Now, you might think it's because
people don't listen to what we tell them.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.222
But in fact, that's not true,

00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:39.612
people actually generally
do follow dietary guidelines.

00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:42.391
But according to
the Center for Disease Control,

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.741
if you live in the United States,

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:49.856
there's over a 70 percent chance
that you're either overweight, diabetic

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:52.631
or have non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.950
And there's overwhelming evidence
that diet and lifestyle

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.679
are major drivers of these conditions.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.481
So why is it that after so much research,

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:08.271
we still don't have an answer
to the seemingly simple question

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:10.650
of what is the best diet for humans?

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:16.402
What I'd like to propose to you today
is that the reason we don't have an answer

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.502
is because we've been
asking the wrong question.

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:23.273
And it's the wrong question
because it assumes

00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:25.794
that the best diet depends
only on the food

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:27.983
and not on the person eating it.

00:02:29.043 --> 00:02:34.764
But what if differences in our genetics,
lifestyle, our gut bacteria

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:37.283
cause us to respond differently to food?

00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:42.095
What if these differences explain why
some diets work for some people

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.673
but not for others?

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:49.793
What if our nutrition needs to be
personally tailored to our unique make-up?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.304
This is exactly the question
we set out to ask in our own research,

00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:57.293
which I did with my colleague Eran Elinav

00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:00.732
and several graduate students
from the Weizmann Institute of Science.

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:03.524
To take a scientific approach,

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:07.324
we first searched for a metric
of healthy nutrition that we should study.

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:12.383
Most studies examine weight loss
or risk of heart disease after some diet.

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:17.736
But the problem is that these are affected
by many factors unrelated to diet,

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.700
they take many weeks to change,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.502
and in the end, you get
a single measure of success.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.413
And if it didn't work, well then
it's very hard to understand why.

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:30.344
And so instead, we searched for a metric

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.692
that would still be relevant
for weight management

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.345
and diet-related disease,

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:39.324
but one that we could also easily
and accurately measure across many people.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.494
And this led us to focus
on blood glucose levels,

00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:49.014
and more precisely, changes
in blood glucose levels after a meal.

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:52.106
We call this a "meal glucose response."

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:54.566
Why is it important?

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:58.703
Well, because high
glucose levels after a meal

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:01.355
promote both hunger and weight gain.

00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:03.177
After we eat,

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:07.126
our body digests the carbohydrates
in the food into simple sugars

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:09.646
and releases them into the bloodstream.

00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:12.395
From there, with the help of insulin,

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.368
cells throughout our body
remove the glucose from the blood

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:18.196
so that they can use it
as a source of energy.

00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:23.226
But insulin also signals our body
to convert excess sugar into fat

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.335
and store it,

00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:27.197
and that's a primary way
by which we gain weight.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.506
In addition, fast flow
of glucose into the blood

00:04:31.506 --> 00:04:34.716
often causes our body
to release too much insulin,

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:38.205
which could lower our glucose levels
to below baseline,

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:41.226
making us feel hungry and eat more.

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:47.287
Meal glucose responses
are also very relevant for our health

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:51.224
because they've been shown
to be risk factors for obesity,

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:56.186
diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and other metabolic disorders.

00:04:57.016 --> 00:05:01.065
A recent study that followed
2,000 people for over 30 years

00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:04.705
found that higher meal
glucose levels after meals

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:06.815
predict overall higher mortality.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:13.836
Finally, and not least important,
with recent technological advances,

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:17.614
we can now follow a person's
glucose levels continuously

00:05:17.614 --> 00:05:19.116
for an entire week.

00:05:19.497 --> 00:05:23.675
And since the average person
eats around 50 meals a week,

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:29.066
it allows us to measure glucose responses
to 50 meals in just a single week.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:32.636
Meal glucose responses also provide us

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:36.945
with a way to directly measure
the effect of every single meal,

00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:38.796
as opposed to common approaches

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:42.278
that only evaluate
the effect of an overall diet.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:47.536
Now, of course, there are many factors
beyond glucose levels

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:49.955
that influence a healthy diet.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.186
But this is a very important one,

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:55.281
and solving it
can be a major step forward.

00:05:56.124 --> 00:06:01.295
Luckily for us, we managed to convince
1,000 healthy people of this idea,

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:06.016
and we connected them
to one of these small glucose sensors

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:10.125
and tracked their glucose levels
continuously for an entire week.

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:15.195
And during that week, participants
logged everything that they ate

00:06:15.195 --> 00:06:17.734
on a mobile app that we developed.

00:06:17.734 --> 00:06:21.035
And so that allowed us
to measure glucose responses

00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:24.112
to 50 different meals for each person

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:29.835
and around 50,000 different meals
across all 1,000 participants,

00:06:29.835 --> 00:06:31.906
making our study the largest one

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:35.296
that was ever done
on this problem until today.

00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:38.386
So what did we find?

00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:43.077
Well, when we looked
at averages, we saw trends.

00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:45.517
For example, more
carbohydrates in the meal

00:06:45.517 --> 00:06:47.686
generally increase the response.

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.467
This is not so surprising.

00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.647
Another, perhaps more surprising, trend

00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:56.467
is that more fat in the meal
generally decreased the response.

00:06:57.967 --> 00:07:02.087
But - and this is
the key finding of our study -

00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:04.628
for every trend we found,

00:07:04.628 --> 00:07:07.850
there were many people
who were very different from it.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:12.237
Basically, when the same person
ate the same meal on different days,

00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:14.466
the response was very similar.

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:17.127
But when different people
ate the same meal,

00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:19.168
the response was very different.

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:23.628
For example, white bread
induced almost no effect

00:07:23.628 --> 00:07:26.250
on the blood sugar levels of some people,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.180
but in others, it induced huge spikes.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.770
And the same was true
for every single food we tested,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.679
including rice, pizza,
sushi and even chocolate.

00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:41.719
For every food, there were some people
who had low responses,

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.738
others who had medium responses,

00:07:43.738 --> 00:07:46.378
and yet others
that had very high responses.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.381
It wasn't just about the food,

00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.528
it was also about the person eating it.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.770
So while averages
and trends are informative,

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.038
for any given individual,
they may not mean much.

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:09.461
Now, it wasn't just about
how good the body was at handling sugar,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.605
each person had different foods
that spiked his levels.

00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:16.941
Some people even had opposite responses.

00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:22.323
For example, some people
spiked for ice cream but not for rice.

00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:26.292
But then others spiked for rice
and not for ice cream.

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:30.202
In fact, more people spiked for rice
than for ice cream.

00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:34.282
Now, my wife is a clinical dietician,

00:08:34.282 --> 00:08:37.614
so when I showed her
this data, she was shocked,

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:42.964
because as a practitioner, she of course
relies on general dietary guidelines,

00:08:42.964 --> 00:08:44.402
and so one of the first things

00:08:44.402 --> 00:08:47.212
that she tells her many
newly diagnosed pre-diabetics

00:08:47.212 --> 00:08:49.643
is to stop eating foods such as ice cream

00:08:49.643 --> 00:08:53.390
and instead eat more
complex carbohydrates such as brown rice.

00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:57.252
So, as soon as she saw our data,

00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:01.142
she of course realized
that for most of her patients

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:04.472
not only does her dietary advice not help,

00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:08.613
but in fact, it pushes them faster
to develop the very same disease

00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:10.792
that her advice was meant to prevent.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:17.503
So these results of ours
on such a large data set

00:09:17.503 --> 00:09:21.263
convinced us that responses
to food are personal,

00:09:21.263 --> 00:09:24.788
and that diets that maintain
normal blood glucose levels

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:28.523
must therefore be personally
tailored to the individual.

00:09:29.283 --> 00:09:33.893
They also show, in our view,
why the current nutritional paradigm

00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:38.262
that searches for that one best diet
is inherently flawed.

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:41.763
The best diet for humans does not exist.

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:45.174
Our responses to food are personal,

00:09:45.174 --> 00:09:48.850
so our dietary advice
must also be personal.

00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:54.053
And personalized dietary advice
was our next challenge.

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:59.084
To tackle it, we measured
many parameters across participants

00:09:59.084 --> 00:10:01.774
that we thought may explain
people's variability

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:03.738
in glucose response to meals.

00:10:04.164 --> 00:10:08.894
And these included basic metrics
and lifestyle factors like age, weight,

00:10:08.894 --> 00:10:11.152
height and physical activity,

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:16.741
but also blood tests, medical background
and food frequency questionnaires,

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:20.653
and also DNA sequencing
of both the human genome

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:24.505
and the gut bacteria composition
of each person.

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.952
Now, of these, the gut bacteria

00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:31.783
was perhaps the most novel
component that we examined.

00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:36.864
For hundred of years, we know
that bacteria live within our body.

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:40.199
But only with recent advances
in DNA sequencing

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:43.103
could we begin to study them extensively.

00:10:43.764 --> 00:10:47.274
And when we did,
we found that this vast collection

00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:50.375
of hundreds of different species
that we each host,

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:53.205
collectively termed "our microbiome,"

00:10:53.845 --> 00:10:57.352
has a major impact
on our health and disease.

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:00.596
And what makes the microbiome
even more exciting

00:11:00.596 --> 00:11:03.806
is that unlike our genetics,
we can also change it

00:11:03.806 --> 00:11:07.357
even by simple means,
such as changing what we eat.

00:11:08.497 --> 00:11:12.037
Our bacteria help us digest
some of the food that we eat,

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:15.458
and in turn, produce molecules
that are taken by our own cells

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.636
and affect our physiology.

00:11:18.148 --> 00:11:23.300
For example, in our own research,
we studied artificial sweeteners,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.549
which the vast majority of us
consume on a daily basis

00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:29.758
in various diet soda drinks
and other products.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.957
And we found that consumption
of artificial sweeteners

00:11:35.357 --> 00:11:41.710
alters the composition of the gut bacteria
such that when transferred into mice

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.970
causes the mice
to develop symptoms of diabetes.

00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:51.427
And so this and several other studies

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:54.618
led us to ask whether the microbiome
would also be important

00:11:54.618 --> 00:11:59.049
for explaining people's
glucose variability in response to meals.

00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:04.029
And so we took this microbiome
and other clinical data that we collected,

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:06.939
and we used advanced
machine learning algorithms

00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:08.868
to automatically search for rules

00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:12.589
that predict personalized
glucose responses to meals.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:14.969
For example, one such rule could be

00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:18.459
that if you're over 50,
and you have a certain bacterial species,

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.177
then your response
to a banana will be high.

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:25.565
The overall algorithm
combined tens of thousands of such rules

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:28.351
that it automatically
deduced from the data.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.360
This approach is actually similar

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.790
to how websites like Amazon
make book recommendations,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.209
except that we applied it
to how people respond to food.

00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:43.089
And we could show that this algorithm
could then take any person,

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:46.511
even people who are not part
of our original study,

00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:51.370
and predict the response
to arbitrary meals with high accuracy.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.082
So as a final step, we asked
whether we can also use this algorithm

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:04.121
to design personalized diets
that normalize blood glucose levels.

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.274
So we recruited
and profiled new participants,

00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:12.272
and we asked the algorithm to predict
two diets for each person;

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:15.450
in one diet, which we called
the "bad diet,"

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.352
we asked the algorithm to predict foods

00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:19.985
for which that person
would have high responses.

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:21.831
And in the other - "good diet" -

00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:25.981
we asked it to predict foods for which
that person would have low responses.

00:13:26.256 --> 00:13:29.402
And each person then followed
each diet for one week.

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:34.026
Now, by design, the diets
had to be identical in calories.

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:36.402
In fact, all breakfasts,
lunches and dinners

00:13:36.402 --> 00:13:39.094
had the same calories on different days.

00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:41.954
And it's also important to note

00:13:42.384 --> 00:13:47.412
that each person received
a different personalized diet,

00:13:47.412 --> 00:13:48.873
and there were even some foods

00:13:48.873 --> 00:13:51.193
that were given to some people
on their good diet

00:13:51.193 --> 00:13:53.133
but to others on their bad diet.

00:13:54.394 --> 00:13:56.143
Now, to show you that these diets

00:13:56.143 --> 00:13:58.603
are not the obvious ones
you might think of,

00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:02.484
here they are for one of our participants.

00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:08.644
Now, take a moment and see
if you can guess for yourself

00:14:09.134 --> 00:14:12.493
which one the algorithm
predicted to be the good diet

00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:16.011
and which to be the bad diet
for this particular participant.

00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:21.885
And as you look at these,
notice that each diet contains foods

00:14:21.885 --> 00:14:24.764
that would not typically appear
in standard diets.

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:30.165
And now for fun,
let's play a quick guessing game,

00:14:30.364 --> 00:14:32.179
and you all have to participate.

00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:37.219
So, raise your hand if you think
the diet on the right is the good one.

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:43.755
Okay. Now raise your hand if you think
the diet on the left is the good one.

00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:48.846
Okay, definitely we see
nearly a 50/50 split here,

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:52.146
showing you that
it's definitely not trivial to guess.

00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:55.414
And I can tell you
that for this participant,

00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:57.735
the algorithm predicted
the diet on the right,

00:14:57.735 --> 00:15:01.089
the one with the ice cream,
to be the good one.

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:06.365
And so now the only question is
how good did these diets work.

00:15:07.994 --> 00:15:11.167
And what I'll show you next is in our view

00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:15.117
perhaps the most striking result
that came out of our study.

00:15:15.887 --> 00:15:19.087
So here are the continuous glucose levels

00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:22.226
of this participant
when following the bad diet.

00:15:22.226 --> 00:15:26.936
And you can clearly see abnormally high
glucose levels after meals

00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:30.597
indicating that this participant
has impaired glucose tolerance

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.788
and is likely pre-diabetic.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:37.086
But on the good diet,
the one with the ice cream

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:40.127
and the same amount of calories
as the bad diet,

00:15:40.127 --> 00:15:46.087
this same pre-diabetic participant
achieved fully normal blood glucose levels

00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:50.065
without even a single spike
across the entire week.

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:55.967
Obviously, we were very happy
to find out these results,

00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:59.757
and, in fact, we found similar results
for most participants

00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:03.854
for which we designed personalized diets
using our algorithm.

00:16:06.397 --> 00:16:11.858
Now, not only that, but the good diet
also induced several consistent changes

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:14.678
in the gut bacteria of most participants.

00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:18.649
And it seemed that
these changes were beneficial,

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:23.388
because bacteria that in other studies
were associated with good outcomes

00:16:23.388 --> 00:16:26.006
tended to increase after the good diet,

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:29.536
and bacteria associated with disease
tended to decrease.

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:33.047
And this result is of course
very intriguing

00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:37.375
because it suggests that in addition
to normalizing blood glucose levels

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:39.265
during the intervention week,

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:42.433
the good diet also induced
beneficial effects

00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:45.807
that may persist even beyond
the intervention week.

00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:51.845
So what's the take-home message
from all of this?

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:58.408
Well, based on the glucose
responses variability

00:16:58.408 --> 00:17:01.027
that we saw across 1,000 people,

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:05.957
our conclusion is that
there is no single best diet for humans

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:08.416
because we are all too different.

00:17:09.037 --> 00:17:12.405
It also means that if
a certain diet hasn't worked for you,

00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:14.798
then maybe it was the wrong diet for you.

00:17:15.497 --> 00:17:18.678
Your dietary failures
may not be your fault.

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:20.758
Your diet may have failed

00:17:20.758 --> 00:17:26.099
simply because it did not take information
about you as an individual into account.

00:17:28.077 --> 00:17:31.058
So what can you do
with this information now?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.230
Well, right now, you can actually measure

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.658
your personal glucose responses
to your favorite meals

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:41.914
using simple glucose devices
that you can buy at your local drug store.

00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:44.491
And I guarantee that you'll be surprised

00:17:44.491 --> 00:17:49.452
at which foods personally spike
your glucose levels and which do not.

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:52.440
As a more complete solution,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.989
we are working hard to make
our algorithms available to everyone

00:17:55.989 --> 00:17:58.381
so that you'll be able, from your home,

00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:01.711
to provide basic
clinical information about yourself,

00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:04.130
send a sample of your microbiome,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.900
and in return receive
personalized dietary advice.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.370
We are also starting longer-term
dietary intervention studies

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.131
in both pre-diabetics and diabetics
that will go on for a full year.

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:22.987
Because we believe that if the effect
of normalizing blood glucose levels

00:18:22.987 --> 00:18:28.174
that we were able to obtain in one week
could persist for a longer time period,

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:32.342
then we might be able to reverse,
and even cure, these conditions,

00:18:32.342 --> 00:18:36.132
which constitute one
of the worst epidemics of our times.

00:18:38.093 --> 00:18:39.662
More broadly,

00:18:39.662 --> 00:18:44.263
I believe that we are entering
a new era in the study of nutrition,

00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:50.132
one in which we will move away from asking
what is the best diet for humans,

00:18:50.132 --> 00:18:53.973
and instead, focus
on the more appropriate question

00:18:55.243 --> 00:18:57.513
of what is the best diet for me.

00:18:58.313 --> 00:18:59.804
Thank you very much.

00:18:59.804 --> 00:19:01.102
(Applause)
