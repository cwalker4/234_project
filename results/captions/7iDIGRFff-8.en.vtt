00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.330
-I'm going after the
President's tax returns.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.290
I think they're critical.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.940
-We really need to see
those tax returns.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.560
-People are gonna care.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.630
They want to know if
their President is a tax cheat.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.820
-We think that it will show us
some connection

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.520
of what do the Russians
have on Donald Trump.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.570
-For decades,
presidential candidates

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.390
have released
their tax returns.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.990
And for years, President Trump
told voters

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.230
he would do the same.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.980
-Maybe I'm gonna do
the tax returns

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.110
when Obama does
his birth certificate.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.310
If I decide to run for office,
I'll produce my tax returns.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.130
-What is your tax rate?
-It's none of your business.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.300
You'll see it when I release.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.990
At the appropriate time,
I will release them.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.920
I mean, I became president.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.330
No, I don't think
they care at all.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.710
-Now with Democrats in control
of the House,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.750
lawmakers are poised to seek
the President's tax returns.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.080
-We're keeping close to the vest
when we're gonna do this

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.870
and how we're gonna do this
for obvious reasons.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.820
But leadership agrees that this
should be one of our priorities.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.620
-New Jersey Democrat Bill
Pascrell sits on the House Ways

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.530
and Means committee,
one of three committees

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.960
with the ability to request

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.550
Trump's returns from
the Secretary of the Treasury.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.680
-Every citizen has a right
to know

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.010
if the President of the United
States is challenged ethically.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.960
-Since February 2017,
House Democrats have made

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.980
17 attempts to request
to release Trump's tax returns.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.390
All were shot down
by House Republicans.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.220
-Supporting this resolution
would be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.250
a clear invasion of privacy.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640
I would ask that all of our
committee members

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.330
to take a step back for a moment

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.670
and consider
the dangerous precedent of abuse

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.980
that would be set
by this resolution.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.240
This is a very important
piece of legislation.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.400
If this legislation we do not
follow up on,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.930
then we are surrendering to the
Executive branch of government.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
-Democrats plan to use a little
known 1924 provision

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.380
in the federal tax code

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.760
to request
the President's tax returns.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.940
The provision was added
during the Teapot Dome scandal

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.740
that led to the first
Cabinet official

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.390
sentenced to prison
for bribery and conspiracy

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.300
involving the leasing
of public oil fields.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.700
-The law does authorize
two specific rights

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.220
to the tax committees.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.010
They can obtain
anyone's tax-return information

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.870
by requesting it from
the Secretary of the Treasury,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.640
and they have the right
to submit

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.020
any of the information
obtained to the full House,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.830
the full Senate for possible
disclosure to the public.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.880
-Over 40 years ago,
Congress cited this provision

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.830
when it released
President Nixon's tax returns.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.090
The IRS ultimately ordered Nixon

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.390
to pay over $400,000
in back taxes.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.410
-I welcome this
kind of examination

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.030
because people have got to know

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.370
whether or not their president
is a crook.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.720
Well, I'm not a crook.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.040
I've earned everything I've got.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.480
-The demand to see the tax
returns

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.670
of presidential candidates
really does grow out

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.880
of Richard Nixon's
presidency.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.240
Jimmy Carter ended up having
to put a lot of his money

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.560
from the peanut farm business
in a blind trust.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.120
George W Bush,
who it was revealed

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.900
had really immense wealth,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.880
lived with that revelation
through the tax returns.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.980
And Romney's where we start
to see some kind of a push-back.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.620
-You know, I don't know
how many years I'll release.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.280
I'll take a look at what
our documents are.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.510
-The norm was established
because of Richard Nixon.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.650
And, so, every candidate feared
if you didn't do this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.400
that it would be
devastating politically.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.690
Voters wouldn't trust
the candidate,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.430
and the press would assume that
the candidate was hiding things.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.420
So, Romney tests
that assumption,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.870
he ends up releasing
some material,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.850
and then Trump
altogether abandons it.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.640
-Do you believe voters have
a right to see your tax returns

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460
before they make
a final decision?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.230
-I don't think they do.
But I do say this.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.830
I will really gladly give them.
You're not gonna learn anything.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.410
-It's pretty clear you can learn
a lot through tax returns.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.090
It's not everything.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.220
But it gives us some guide
as to the wealth of a candidate,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.530
how they make their money,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.320
and if there is
or is not a problem,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.610
at least with current
investments and revenue,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.930
with the job that they hold.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.740
-Democrats acknowledge acquiring
Trump's taxes

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.500
could be a drawn-out process.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.300
-I think it's a little
more challenging

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.080
than you might think.
-The chairman has, you know,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.600
the right to ask
for those returns.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.650
And the President may feel
that there's no law

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.730
which forces him to do that.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.990
And then we'll see.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.490
We'll go to the courts.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.950
-If they start
investigating you,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.370
that you can play
and investigate them?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.770
-Better than them.
-Can you compartmentalize that?

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.230
-And I think I know
more than they know.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.380
If they do that, then it's just
all it is a war-like posture.
