00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.249
from the howard hughes medical institute

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:30.249
the two thousand five holiday lectures
on science

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.290
this year's lectures evolution

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010
constant change and common threads

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.830
will be given by doctor shaundy carol

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.330
howard hughes medical institute
investigator at the university of

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.400
wisconsin madison

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.740
and doctor david m kingsley

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.960
howard hughes medical institute
investigators at stanford university

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.580
school of medicine

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.550
the third lecture is titled fossils
jeans and andrea

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090
and now to introduce our program

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.350
the president of the howard hughes
medical institute

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.000
doctor thomas check

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
good morning and welcome back to the
howard hughes medical institute

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.529
and to the two thousand and five holiday
lectures on science evolution

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:21.240
constant change and common threads

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.579
in his last lecture david kingsley
talked about domestication of wolves

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.480
into dogs and have to your sent a into
court

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.660
today he's going to delve deeper into
evolutionary time and show us about how

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.350
genetic changes in living populations
today related changes that we see in the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.490
fossil record

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.630
now david primarily studies fish but the
rules and mechanisms that he has

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.039
uncovered have broad implications for
the evolution of all kinds of species

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.050
including humans

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.279
one of the surprising things today that
has discovered

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:07.520
is that evolution appears to be a great
recycler using the same mechanisms over

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.439
and over again

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.239
the talk is entitled

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.409
fossils jeans and embryos

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.230
and now

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.480
here's a video

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.480
of david at work

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.520
for me why when in the science and one
of the most

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.000
warden things about it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.060
is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.859
the rare opportunity

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.609
ticket to spend your life

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.229
solving problems

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.259
or a study in question

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.289
that people have wondered about four

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.599
thousands here

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.900
markets inc

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.799
we live right now at a time

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.009
win

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.429
the techniques are available

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:54.079
to picket any problem the tree
interested

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.439
and

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.790
chisels get to be

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.729
the one who solves

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.769
uh... some age-old probable cars and

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.629
that's i think a fairly unusual
opportunity but for a long time the

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.439
problems were solved because the methods
were unavailable for work

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.679
what's different now is that the methods
are available to work on them so i think

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.419
hundred years from now

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.809
people will look back and say that must
have been incredible time to be doing

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:22.809
science

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.439
the methods for their

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.969
or you had to do

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.129
picked the problem you're interested in

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.689
and go apply the methods

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:32.809
uh...

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.309
what could be more exciting

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.669
to live in that sliver of time

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:44.259
win wonderful unsolved problems are
solvable i'll buy the applications so

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.339
methods that have work repeatedly in
others

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.249
there's no other job in the world where
it you can have that privilege of

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.529
getting to spend your time

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.479
trying to figure out how things work

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.539
so i think it's important for students
not to decide whether they like science

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.829
based just on the way scientists and
presented to me in in a few classes so

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.329
if you can find some way

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.689
into a land

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.529
or too

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.899
interact with

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.930
scientists doing science

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.030
that it's the best possible way to see
the difference between the problem

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.549
solving scientist really do

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.180
and the way it strongly are presented in
the classroom there's a big difference

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.840
between memorizing the word six point
which is an effort to inspite and i

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.830
think

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.249
that people have to leave

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.699
pass that nomenclature uh... asked that
and did into

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.529
eleven twelve

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.580
where

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.339
they can actually

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.039
could be confronted with the problem
with the answer is that no but don't

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.459
know my students

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:53.159
try to find

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.119
welcome back everybody

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.340
yesterday how we saw

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.280
selection by humans

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.679
uh... has transformed

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:04.930
plants and animals into of those

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.349
modern form so we see around us today

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.550
darwin and wallace are both realized
that the same principles of selection

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.349
that are so dramatically are change book
plants and animals a hundred

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.899
domestication

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.439
should also act in nature

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.780
so wild plants and animals of dairy in
all directions

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.999
the differences are inherited

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.749
many more individuals are produced in
compulsively survive and reproduce so

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.650
that creates a competitive situation

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.860
they will vary in swollen ever pletely
more offspring and these laws of nature

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.929
create a process of natural selection

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:44.620
that will extensively modified organisms
over time

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.550
so based on these laws burn proposed
that modern plants and animals are

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.389
really just the youngest sprouts and
twigs

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.179
of an immense an ancient uh...

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:54.469
tree of life

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.399
and that all organisms

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.799
that have ever lived may be related by
dissent with modification

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:06.799
extending back to the very earliest
stages of away from her

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.389
i think is obviously a profound
intellectual uh... leap it's always

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.909
struck me as large as the lead on that
was made by newton maybe no newton how

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.949
he signed apple falling in his backyard
and and realized

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.760
that the same forces of gravity that
control objects falling in his backyard

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.919
might also control the falling

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.909
of the moon around the earth

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.539
the orbiting of the birth ran the sign
in fact the principles that constructing

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.539
tire solar system

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.759
so newton scope for physics was
incredible

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.380
from apples to orbits from his backyard
to the entire solar system

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.729
i think darwin's our book had a similar
breathtaking scope

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.610
from up pigeons in his backyard

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.569
in the very first chapter of the origin
of species

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.839
this immense tree of life that connects
all living former spy modification by

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.979
dissent

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.519
uh... by the final chapter of the origin

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:06.270
okay so when in eighteen fifty nine when
burns great theory was proposed

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.220
it already explained all sorts of
confusing data from different uh...

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.909
areas

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:17.129
including todd tax from biogeography
though uh... the existence of closely

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.889
related organisms and island groups
unlike the cooper toast

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:25.759
facts from paleontology like the fact
that on modern mammals are only found in

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.530
the most recent fossil strata

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.110
fax from embryology

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.449
common structures are seen embryos of
animals that look very different from

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:34.800
each other

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.900
and unusual facts from morphology

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.759
so comparative anatomy is had known for
a long time

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.889
that some structures existed in animals
that were very hard to explain under the

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.490
prevailing idea that

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.930
each species

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.360
had been intelligently designed from
optimally match uh... it's its own

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.569
environment

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:54.779
for example

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.709
lots of animals that live in caves

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.069
never see light

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.240
they have no reason to have allies

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.379
and yet lots of caving animals

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.999
have this did you lines

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:08.659
so i think in the form they form in the
degenerating

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:12.019
where they form but they're completely
covered by skin

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:16.159
so these are non-functional organs in an
environment were eyes aren't needed

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:20.759
very hard to imagine why there they
repeat organism was designed live in a

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.839
case

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.160
but easy to explain

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.669
current blind animals evolved from
precursors that used to see

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.119
so dissent with modification

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:36.490
explains the structures as a vestige a
leftover from their common ancestry

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.600
although art

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.070
darwin's theory to explain lots of to
your facts that existed in eighteen

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.920
fifty nine

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.070
it also uh... set off a whole series of
raging debate about all sorts of uh...

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.880
other issues

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.400
many scientists believe that earth was
too young

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.510
uh... to be compatible with darwin's
theory of evolution when it was

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.170
published in eighteen fifty nine

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.790
there was an absence of transitional
forms

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.250
that darman predicted should be all over
the place hot in the fossil record

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.870
many people thought natural selection
couldn't work the way darwin proposed

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.290
because in the rare variants that
occurred

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.730
i would get swamped out by a form of
blending inheritance that will come back

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.440
from the second

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.090
and finally many people despondent and
we thought

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.620
that animals look too different from
each other to a possibly com

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.090
uh... from common ancestors

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.320
so all of these issues were extensively
i've debated underneath burns lifetime

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.670
he tried to address them in subsequent
issues of the origin of species but in

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.559
fact many of them were resolved

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.170
uh... for decades

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.880
let's come back and not talk about uh...
about uh... each of these uh... kiki

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.050
problems

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.280
how about the age of the earth

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.890
the age of the earth has been calculated
in lots of different ways

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.620
there's a famous calculation by
archbishop usher in the sixteen hundreds

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.610
the creation of occurred on october
twenty third four thousand four bc

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.110
that estimate was based on our genealogy
in the bible

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.280
so in the eighteen hundreds there was
already accumulated geological evidence

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.850
that the earth must be are much older
than them

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.940
one of darwin's contemporaries was a
famous physicist on named lord kelvin

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.110
i think i've ever heard of uh... calvin

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.360
right this is the calvin and the second
lobstermen dynamics

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.640
this is also the calvin of the absolute
temperature scale

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.530
so that uh... degrees are named after
her power

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.760
lord kelvin won the most famous
physicists of of the eighteen hundreds

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.950
so calvin calculated are that the first
couldn't be older then uh...

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.750
the return sun i had a maximum age of
forty million years

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.760
that was the based on the physics of the
cooling of the earth inside

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.480
that estimate barton bothered down a lot
because darman an estimated in the

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.420
origin that it might take hundreds of
millions of years

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.690
operatives process of dissent with
modification to generate by this immense

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.150
tree of life

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.340
darman wanted four hundred million years
tenfold more other

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.690
fourth kelvin thought was physically
possible

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.590
to this debate i was actually are
resolved by an amazing series of

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.260
discoveries in twentieth century physics
that darwin didn't live to see

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.440
ites nine realized in the early
twentieth century that energy in master

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.650
actually you know convertible his famous
equation equals m_c_ squared he for

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.240
energy and him for mass

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.760
detailed measurements of the actual
massive anand shows that for hydrogen

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.099
atoms actually slightly more

00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:29.240
then one helium atom

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.730
and the way the sun actually shines his
app process of uh... fusion energy

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.720
so four hydrogen atoms were fused
together to make one helium the small a

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.930
bit of excess mast is converted into
energy

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.530
so the sun is a nuclear furnace not the
kind of conventional furnace

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.179
of that calvin had model

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:48.880
uh... in the eighteen hundreds

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.260
you can actually major the amount of
hydrogen helium in the sun

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.889
and calculate how old the sun must be

00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:57.870
based on how that nuclear furnace

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.000
similarly around the turn of the century
radioactivity was discovered for the

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.390
first time

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.170
so that by actually provided a new
source of heat within rocks in it also

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.610
provided a brand new way to calculate
the absolute age approx

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.880
detailed art measurements uh... from
both the physics of stars

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.680
and a half life of radioactive decay

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.150
show that the earth in the solar system
or billions of years old

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.179
not millions of years old so hundred
times longer

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:27.649
then our lord kelvin had estimated

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:30.490
uh... during the debates with darwin

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.840
so when darwin said that an infinite
number of generations which the mein

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.520
kampf grasp must have succeeded each
other

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.560
in the long role of yours

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.850
he was even more right

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.250
than we thought at the time

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.830
they have out by the fossil record

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.680
well fossa record has always been
imperfect

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.920
don't worried about this in the origin

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.740
beginning as soon as the organ was
published lots of interesting fossil

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.290
started to be published in that's been
true ever since

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.420
uh... in eighteen sixty one

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.780
two years after uh... the origin
appeared a spectacular fossil or was

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.440
found this was the first of several
archaeopteryx fossil

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.610
remarkable preservation of

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.620
uh... feather structures

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.430
in an ancient reptiles so archaeopteryx
has traits of both birds reptiles

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.089
you can see feathers but it's one uh...
an ancient reptile but still has teeth

00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:25.090
structures that are in normally never
found in modern birds

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.520
this kind of fossil with a mixture of
trade two different organisms

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.810
exactly the kind of fossil of the
darwin's theory of the stock market

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:36.230
cation predicted must exist

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.990
well keep awful discoveries

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.630
have kept being made ever sense of the
origin

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.670
one of the biggest gaps in the fossil
record the darwin worried a lot about

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:50.660
was the complete absence of any known
possibles yun opry came rian strat

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.610
so the fossil record as darwin knew it

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.240
the first uh... appearance apostle life
in in the uh... in the record at that

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.580
time

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.400
by the time the possible pure they were
already complex and diverse

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.440
no record of uh... simple forms the
darman i'll propose must exist at the

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.770
base of uh... his immense tree of life

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.440
since the origin of fossil evidence of
life on earth uh... has been pushed back

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.740
and spectacular ways

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.500
possible so simple single celled
organisms have now been confirmed in

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.950
rocks are that are billion years
billions of years old times from there

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.710
in the figure at the top

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.880
just as darman predicted

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.650
early forms of life for much simpler

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.440
then neidhart complex like the team
later

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.670
wind fatherly fossil record looks like
maps of bacteria

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.060
cyanobacteria and single celled
micro-organisms

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.620
similar italy since eighteen fifty nine
the earliest forms of multi-site life

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.400
have also been found in the fossil
record

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.890
these also occur in rocks that pre-date
the explosion of more complex forms spot

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:59.100
in the cambridge

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.230
eunice i get a life

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.560
in billions of years old rocks the
release forms of multi sailor life in

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.420
pre-k marine rocks

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.630
ambition

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.949
many transitional fossils have been down

00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:12.660
hotmail been found for higher animal
groups

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.720
so it still much later in the fossil
record and talk about

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.510
uh... the reinvention of water

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.020
uh... by mail mls

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.140
we're used to think you numbered
addresses as land animals was skeletal

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.870
structures that are appropriate for are
walking around on two or four legs on

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.440
land

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.750
most mammals that's true but in fact
some mammals are found in the ocean as

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.750
aquatic organisms

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.580
they have streamlined bodies such as
seen here uh... in a manatee

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.780
so manatees have a streamlined body they
still have to four fans were or flippers

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.760
but they no longer have heinbuch

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.960
right so i mean they also have a series
of other aquatic adaptations

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.020
nostrils that are located high up on the
head for breeding uh... at uh... at the

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.550
water air interface

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.750
very unusual downturn dog jaw as their
only seen in manatees and of course

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.580
related or animal called duke gardens

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.850
unusual rios so most animals have ribs
that are hollow filled with a bone

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.670
marrow

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.880
in manatees and do burns the ribs are
actually solid they're filled with bone

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.040
that's not to serve as a form of ballast
offer these marine creatures

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.230
and finally in addition to those are
teachers manatee shows some

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.810
characteristics that suggest they may
have a vault on from uh... land animals

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.580
that includes both toenails on the
flippers

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.100
and obvious the jewel hind limbs

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.330
so this shows a blow-up of the manatee
flipper lucian at ends are

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.780
these toenail

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.860
was very unusual to toenails are usually
only found on our land animals this was

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.900
all recognize more time ago

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.330
that amenities toenails actually look
very much like elephant toenails

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.390
d_n_a_ studies show that of the d_n_a_
of manatees in the d_n_a_ of elephants

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.120
and more closely related and almost
other mammals

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.259
so it looks like

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:59.530
uh... these may have evolved from are
four-legged creature

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.640
in addition although manatees don't have
hind limbs if you look at their skeleton

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.370
they do have a tiny rudimentary public
bones were a hind limb

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.490
uh... would normally be found

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.220
it is art to catch them vertebral column
they can support weight there's no way

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.490
that comes off of the pelvis

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.120
surprisingly

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.190
those are rudimentary are pelvic bones
to do still have a tiny hip socket even

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.830
though the femur isn't there

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:29.680
they actually have a manatee bonaparte
appear hot at the front and invite you

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.170
to come up during the break

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.159
this is a small rudimentary paulus of
manatee

00:17:34.159 --> 00:17:36.029
you see a little circle here

00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:38.790
this is a a two-stage orthop socket

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.200
for a ghost femur

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.080
that's no longer that's no longer there

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.420
again

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.250
that's a just like the the schedule
eisen cave organisms

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.410
the example of a kind of structure
that's very hard to explain that

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.309
manatees have been designed up from
scratch

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:56.450
to uh... to live in the ocean

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.510
and the other hand

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.500
those kind of structures are easy to
explain if manatees actually walt

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.309
from four lated are up for later
precursors

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:10.400
well if manatees of all time for liggett
land animals where are the suppose

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.419
apostles

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:14.950
of are intermediate forms

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.030
the fossils are actually in jamaica

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.679
uh... variation paper that was published

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:23.730
uh... in two thousand one by dr darling
from the howard university here in

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.930
washington d_c_ area

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.220
he described the spectacular fossil it
was found in fifteen million year old

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.610
deposits on in jamaica

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.720
this are nearly complete skeleton shows
all sorts of art characteristic

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.650
diagnostic manatee features including
the nostrils uh... up on the top of the

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.600
head

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.510
characteristics solid ballast

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.320
like ribs

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.170
the unusual downturn jaws that are only
found in manatees in dupont

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.920
despite having all these features it has
another a very interesting feature

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.900
it still has time

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.120
so the hind limbs are president and they
look just as robust as the poor lips

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.870
exactly the kind organism

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:08.320
for evolving manatees from of previous
how poorly good uh... ancestor

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.090
other intermediate stages in public
reduction i have been found for this

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.799
group

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:16.799
manatees and do bones belong to a group
called the saving and other kota saving

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:21.050
apostles have been shown that show
intermediate stages of hinman reduction

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.900
here's a possibly conceive

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.799
the hind limbs or president but they're
now much smaller than the four limbs

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:30.080
still have the pelvis the femur and
lower leg bones

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.220
so we have now i'll fossil record that
goes all the way from a complete

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.140
four-legged looking manatee at the kinds
that have intermediate public production

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.930
and then the simple thus the jewel
pelvis that still found are in the month

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.380
forms

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.360
the other are a group of marine mammals
that's known

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.980
participation of the whales in the
dolphins we actually have alive

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.559
dolphin skeleton here at the front of
the auditorium

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.060
the dolphins also have

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.500
characteristic a streamline marine body
form they help for flippers but they

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.370
don't have hind limbs

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.250
you can see here in the skeleton

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.610
the obvious off flickr

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.170
reform remnants of the dolphin uh...
appear at the front of the body

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.640
there are no hind limbs in the skeleton

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.700
hanging beneath the vertical column

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.330
at the spot where a hinman would
normally be

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.490
you can against c these two rudimentary
bones unattached

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.960
know what's coming out

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.600
but these represent what's left of
upheld the best

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.370
uh... in this former marine mammal

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.870
that kind of rudimentary pelvis suggests

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.500
that dolphins and whales also evolved
from for liggett in land animals

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.780
if that's true

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.580
where are the transitional fossils

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.810
uh... that uh... the show those
precursors

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.830
well for man team will evolution

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.030
the uh... spectacular fossils

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.760
have also been found in the last twenty
years

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.730
this case the key fossils are located in
pakistan and egypt

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.510
forty seven million year old skeletons
have our heads that look like whales

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.950
but still have four legs with the hind
limbs as robust as the four limbs

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.410
the egyptian fossils from thirty six
million years again shows schools that

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.539
and clearly whale like

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:15.549
you now see that the hinman has been
extensively reduced

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:19.139
very small still has a policy if you
were in the lower leg bones but it's

00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:22.180
detach from the vertebral column could
no longer support

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.050
uh... body weight

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.000
again a beautiful set of transitional
fossils from before late didn't quite

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.640
animal with the school of a whale

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.500
the partial hinman reduction

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.970
for the kind of tiny rudimentary pelvis
is that you see today

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.420
uh... you know modern bob dole from her
way up

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.750
finally large incomplete mammalian part
of the rare but an amazingly uh...

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.520
detailed fossil record exists for the
process of public reductions tickle

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.490
backs uh... we introduced the
corrections today

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.940
we'll show you a short video that
summarizes extensive uh... pairings

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.600
logical studies of the fossil record of
public reduction that have been are

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.020
carried out by mike bell

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.550
these are all based on studies of
apostle of lake site in nevada

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.890
at this site

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.690
diet com dying each year float out to
the bottom of the way

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:15.409
and establish these thin rocky layers
that are like growth rings in in a tree

00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:19.890
you can actually walk through trying by
walking your way up and down the slopes

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.330
of of this quarry

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.440
or we're going to show you is i a
detailed studies

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.360
of the forms of steckel backs that are
present in one section of this quarry

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.460
represents

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.110
about twenty five thousand years of
evolution of mike's looked at in detail

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.899
at each stage you can pull out rocks

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:38.890
split on

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.120
uh... from macquarie it lots of
different area could calculate watch

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.830
fish were present at a given time they
come in different forms including the

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.320
complete steckel back

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.590
the palace in the spine

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.870
reduced to go back to the tiny rudiments
like you would find in a minute here

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.340
where

00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:00.070
or an intermediate for mothers to bounce
left instead of just one

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.770
at each stage in the fossil record

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.360
you can count the fish that are seen in
the summer layer across rocks in the

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.330
quarry

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.929
and calculate what's the percentage of
the fish that are reduced

00:23:10.929 --> 00:23:13.529
or intermediate or complete

00:23:13.529 --> 00:23:17.520
and you can do that for successive
stages as you walk through time

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.809
so this is a summary of actual data from
our mikes lab calculating and counting

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:25.289
lots of different fission rocks they all
start out reduced

00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:29.110
and then in the series at about ten
thousand years a newspaper back invades

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.649
environment replaces the the previous
form

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:35.820
this type of act has a complete pelvis

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.100
and a very interesting thing happens
over the next ten or fifteen thousand

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.540
years that complete form

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.250
revolves public reduction

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.109
with intermediate possibles

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:49.950
scene along the way

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.590
there was sorry that time series again

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.480
starts out with with

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.289
uh... population that's a hundred
percent pelvic reduced

00:24:01.289 --> 00:24:05.289
rapid replacement around ten thousand
years new form all with the complete

00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:07.559
post and then the real pollution

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.470
of a public

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.990
reduced phenotype

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.870
intermediate forms asking along the way

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.940
can also see that in line graph form

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.419
a blue line for the reduced form that
predominates in the early stage

00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:25.640
a red line for the complete form the
rapidly replaces the ten thousand years

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.950
and then the real pollution and public
production within intermediate forms

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.700
summarized by the green line

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.549
a strong during the time sir

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:35.730
so it's remarkable

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.009
to be able to watch evolutionary change

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:40.320
uh... with this level of detail

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.050
you can actually watched the
morphological changes happen in

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.840
centuries rolled barley

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.570
and catch that you know intermediate
forms as a completes the go back

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.800
evolves onto a public reduce state

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.040
face a lots of people ask all the time

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.970
where are the fossils other predicted by
evolution

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.350
darman asked that question himself in
eighteen fifty nine

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:08.539
maybe because there was so honest about
clean out the problems with his theory

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:11.840
there's still a stranger urban legend or
meth

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.700
that transitional fossils had never been
found

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.600
and that this is somehow a of major
problem with evolutionary theory

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.350
so after a hundred and fifty years of
discoveries in paleontology that simply

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.930
isn't true

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.929
where are the key fossils

00:25:26.929 --> 00:25:30.690
well for early forms of uniserial earned
multi sailor life the fossils are an

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.660
ancient greek ambien rocks of australia

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.840
for feathers there in germany

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.850
for manatees there in jamaica

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.820
for whales

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.280
they were in pakistan puget

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.299
first echo baxter in nevada

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:46.200
direction down many of your own
backpacks for those those students who

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.169
are participated in the fossil activity

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:51.070
yesterday afternoon

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.150
so the posse record actually provides
incredibly strong support for darwin's

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.870
ke idea of the sentence modification

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.740
i hope anyone who seriously interested
in this issue

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.020
we'll look at the data as it exists in
two thousand five

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.600
not as that existed in eighteen fifty
nine

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.380
including all kinds of beautiful fossil
just a small segment which we've been

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.650
able to describe

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.480
uh... in the holiday lectures

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.480
so i'll stop there it was good time for
a break and we'll take a few questions

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.620
hot track

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.289
so the plan for the complete form

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:29.330
complete form arise that as well

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.720
echo back so i can migrate uh... there
could've been environmental changes not

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.230
really clear well aware that stupa
backyard came from

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.980
bibd it's very clear

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.650
that the complete form arrives in the
late m all at once

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.430
uh... the

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.950
the

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:50.800
these structures now have the form of a
newspaper back without intermediates

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.480
along the way so that does look like a
migration or a replacement vent instead

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.490
of uh... an evolutionary event

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.390
in contrast in public of the class

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:03.540
reduction real balls at the site by you
clearly see the intermediate along the

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:09.130
way

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.620
gcc common ancestors subscribe please
send

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.380
but how many contests to think they are
or click

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.160
types for the quote word firsthand
censuses

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.120
all the different types of grimaces
today

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.480
final paragraph about darwin's book says
arm

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.830
life originally briefed by the creator
into a few simple forms or one

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.799
they so he thought that things uh...
must of gotten much simpler

00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:41.230
was arm

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.700
he allowed the possible and not just one
of may be possible pure simple forms

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.030
what the fossil record actually shows

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.190
is very simple forms at the beginning of
the fossil record of life on earth

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.610
uh... bacteria unit sailor animal

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.659
eunice enotes a organisms

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:00.870
the single celled simple prokaryotic
organisms

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.440
on begin to be found also if you carry
out a organisms

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.620
then multi sailor organisms the more
complex forms

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.980
i think the key idea of a tree of life

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.620
is that things are related by dissent
with modifications

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.809
not clear if the tree has to be very
bronner very narrow

00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:22.480
it should be simpler at the beginning
and more complex are later

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.480
that's exactly what that's exactly what
the fossil record shop

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.810
disease stossel's pieces

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.880
and signs this housing figure out how
the point of the athletes

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.669
anticipated films

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:47.260
so i think it's also important remember
that uh... balance there is a period

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.970
white teens

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.800
right so there aren't a whole chapters
of on darwin's book

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.389
that explain

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:55.500
the creation

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.889
theory where where did the universe come
from

00:28:57.889 --> 00:28:59.810
that's not what darwin's book is about

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.420
darwin's book is about

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.580
how life

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.350
changed and how organisms are related by
descent obvious modification

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.100
i think that's a frequent confusion that
you see a lot in

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.210
debates about religion an evolution that
somehow i evolution

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.029
uh... proves that uh...

00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:23.380
the universe was created of by some
random process

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.410
evolution describes how life changes
once life is here it's not a theory

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.210
about how life originally arose or why
the whole universe on why the whole

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.280
university says

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.440
off strained

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.420
he said

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.660
so

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.679
you know we're going to come back to
that point five during during the august

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:55.420
second spark here because i was actually
concede jitters thing and i'm triggers

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.090
in the fossil record of evolutionary
change

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.150
it does happen

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.270
five different rates a different time
sometimes fast sometimes slow

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.509
uh... again

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:08.260
there's nothing in the uh...

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.769
the theory of evolution

00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:13.789
that says it has to be particularly fast
were particularly slow in fact we know

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:18.509
genetic mechanisms where major genes can
figure facts or other genes have small

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:23.710
facts becca create rapid evolution or
slower evolution whether there is no

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.909
uh... there's no particular rate

00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:30.890
that evolution requires and in fact the
range of rates are seen in the fossil

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.480
record and experimental system

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.160
delivered a comeback uh...

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.870
for that to the second section happy to
take on more questions but you're in a

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.500
minute

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.850
okay so let's come back to some of these
uh... scientific debate about the way

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.649
um... selection

00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:47.940
could or couldn't work

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.200
the um... major debates was uh...
whether natural selection would be able

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.720
to let an interesting new variant affect

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.010
uh... traits within the population

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.700
so as i said people believed in blending
inheritance of the time that works and i

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.120
was first published

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.560
the uh... problem that was pointed out
was was suppose that you know a a little

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.800
tiny

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.590
drop of black ink

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.049
appeared in wisdom dropped into a giant
bat

00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:17.780
of all white liquid like milk

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.529
they pray drop a black ink in a giant
about of white milk has no effect

00:31:22.529 --> 00:31:24.780
are on the overall color of the back

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.390
it's still just blended out and uh...
population would stay out predominantly

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:32.180
on don milky white

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.770
so it's even confusing to try to explain
because we now know so much more about

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.530
the genetic mechanisms that actually
exists that bob blendon inheritance

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.670
clearly uh... doesn't happen

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.820
your jury was written before any
detailed knowledge of genetics of those

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.840
kinds of ideas were out there

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.799
but when men those laws were
rediscovered in nineteen hundred

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:51.360
it was clear

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.059
that variants

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:54.820
just lost by blending

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.979
in fact uh...

00:31:55.979 --> 00:32:00.930
uh... variants exist as stable are
stable genetic changes

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.250
that by insist on chromosomes

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.880
those stable variance i or sometimes
hard to see in populations bearings can

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.350
be recessive

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.539
but once a mutation arises

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:15.210
it can increase in frequency simply by
being transmitted out to more and more

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.610
offspring

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.600
we made extensive use of uh...
mendelssohn laws on yesterday in talking

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.460
about the genetic architecture of corn
in our case and paid evolution

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.460
stick a backup aleutian uh... and uh...
uh... uh...

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.809
evolution of color forms and rock pocket
mice

00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:34.220
chon actually showed you

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.450
a simulation

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.299
based on mendoza lawns and population
genetics

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:41.440
of how a rare variant

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.430
when that appears doesn't just get
blended in

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.659
in fact a small selective advantage even

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:51.649
a five percent uh... increasing the
number of offspring that are surviving

00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:53.620
reproduced from a blackberry and

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.799
will lead to a rapid increase

00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:58.410
in the frequency of that very into
overtime

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.550
so the population level the very end
doesn't blend it appears in

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.919
fitted on generates more offspring it
will actually increasing frequency as

00:33:06.919 --> 00:33:10.070
uh... both the white form decreases

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.040
now the state it was based on a
simulation

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.750
but i'd like to compared the results of
that stimulation

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.250
with the results of the actual frequency
of pelvic forms that are seen in the

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.870
fossil record that we just described for
public reduction in stick a black

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.039
so here

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.779
they do line graph represents

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:32.280
uh... the reduced form of how was
originally as a where variant

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.400
sweeps are two fixation

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.900
in other uh... the successive layers
that can be dug up out of this on my

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.320
seem like that

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.940
i hope you can see

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.640
that although this is simulated data

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.669
and this is actual data

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:49.380
that the form of the currents

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.490
are strikingly similar

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.770
variance don't blame and when they
appear in fact

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.419
uh... they can spread to populations
using

00:33:57.419 --> 00:34:01.249
uh... laws of both of mendel and
population genetics that are that are

00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:02.720
now well understood

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.799
and that are also confirm by
observations in real systems

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:11.710
okay finally have a this last problem
ado animals simply look to different

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.539
i've become

00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:14.749
from coming in substance

00:34:14.749 --> 00:34:16.849
this is again an area

00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:19.409
the darwin tried to address uh... in the
origin

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.109
uh... he's got this passage

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:23.689
all living things have much in common

00:34:23.689 --> 00:34:25.270
somewhat germinal vesicles

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.970
uh... we see this also in that the same
poison can similarly affect of both

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:31.659
plants and animals

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.669
or that the poison secreted on by the
golf life

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:39.109
uh... will produce gross both on wild
roses are or on oak trees

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:40.789
darwin was trying here

00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:43.089
uh... but you can tell

00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:47.449
this stage the knowledge of biochemistry
and molecular genetics are was so

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.869
rudimentary

00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:52.699
that the arguments for the in a
relationship of all living forms

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.939
was still of very circumstantial

00:34:55.939 --> 00:34:57.209
since

00:34:57.209 --> 00:34:58.949
the origin of species

00:34:58.949 --> 00:35:03.289
pathways for the synthesis of d_n_a_ in
our name proteins and lipids in

00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:06.579
carbohydrates have now been worked out
in detail

00:35:06.579 --> 00:35:09.809
turns out most bacteria plants and
animals share fundamental metabolic

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:13.589
pathways they all use a_t_p_ for energy
they have lots of other our bylaws kal

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:15.229
characteristics in common

00:35:15.229 --> 00:35:18.729
began to take enzymes our of one
organism like a mammal mixing together

00:35:18.729 --> 00:35:22.750
are with bacterial extracts and the
enzymes and bits and pieces

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.320
uh... from different organisms are
compatible and can capitalize on these

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.829
reactions

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:32.499
most importantly in one of the triumph
so thought twentieth-century biology

00:35:32.499 --> 00:35:36.499
the molecular basis of heredity has been
worked out in detail

00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:40.359
the structure of d_n_a_ was discovered
in nineteen fifty three

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:44.269
that led to the den of cation of a
universal code for converting d_n_a_

00:35:44.269 --> 00:35:48.279
sequence into amino acids sequence and
most animals

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:51.769
same sorts of d_n_a_ same sort of
genetic code whether you're a virus for

00:35:51.769 --> 00:35:54.960
a victory or a planter an insect uh...
or

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.869
amounts for human

00:35:56.869 --> 00:36:01.169
genes from one organism can actually
replicate and function in another

00:36:01.169 --> 00:36:05.199
a striking confirmation of the common
biochemical and genetic heritage of all

00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:07.289
living things

00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:11.890
finally very different looking animals
are actually built on using similar

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.869
genes in pathways

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:18.040
when the most striking examples of this
i was originally found in research

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.779
injure saw for the fruit fly

00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:24.589
drosophila has a whole set of keys
developmental control genes called hox

00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:25.739
genes

00:36:25.739 --> 00:36:29.129
these jeans a current clusters along
chromosome

00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:32.059
and the expression pattern of the genes
in the embryos is related to their

00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:34.419
position on long the cluster

00:36:34.419 --> 00:36:37.909
so the blue jeans here at the one end of
the cluster

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:38.959
are expressed

00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:43.039
at the head and of the embryo that's
shown there in the bottom right

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.819
the color genes in the middle

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:46.969
or expressed in the middle of the embryo

00:36:46.969 --> 00:36:50.640
and the green jeans at the end of the
cluster or expressed in the tail region

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.569
of the embryo

00:36:52.569 --> 00:36:56.429
to those genes are just expressed the
different interior post here head to

00:36:56.429 --> 00:36:58.159
tail compositions

00:36:58.159 --> 00:37:02.769
there also required for the formation of
the particular tissues that you find

00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:06.109
from the head to the table of the
adulteress awful

00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:08.430
so if you make mutations and those jeans

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.790
you change the development of the
characteristic issues that should formal

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.049
on interposed your body except

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:19.630
was surprisingly although animals so it
looks very different mice looked very

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.619
different from proof lies

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:25.719
their interior post your body axis is
built from the very same uh... sets of

00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:26.939
genes

00:37:26.939 --> 00:37:30.359
so mice and humans other vertebrates
have

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:34.869
uh... sequences that are closely related
to these hox gene supplies

00:37:34.869 --> 00:37:38.369
the hox genes in mammals also occurring
clusters

00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:41.789
the clusters are also expressed in
patterns that are related to interpret

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:43.009
your development

00:37:43.009 --> 00:37:45.950
blue jeans at one end of the cost of
that actually duplicated so there's more

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.609
copies in in mammals

00:37:48.609 --> 00:37:51.999
blue jeans at the end of the clusters
are expressed in the head regions of the

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.089
embryos from

00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:54.589
at the lower left

00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:57.249
the middle genes are expressed in the
middle part of the embryo the green

00:37:57.249 --> 00:38:00.199
jeans at the end of the cluster
expressed in the tail region of the

00:38:00.199 --> 00:38:01.159
embryo

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:03.199
and just doesn't replies

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:07.139
if you make mutations in these psyche
hox genes

00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:10.859
those mutations alter the formation of
the characteristics issues that would

00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:14.749
normally formate each position along the
interior post here body axis of the

00:38:14.749 --> 00:38:15.960
mouse

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.779
so it looks like

00:38:17.779 --> 00:38:22.099
the head to tail access of animals even
the look completely different

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:26.759
are infected built by ancient toolkit of
these key developmental regulators

00:38:26.759 --> 00:38:28.719
called hox genes

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:32.259
similar uh... toolkit jeans have been
discovered

00:38:32.259 --> 00:38:36.410
they control a range of other structures
are in diverse organisms so the hockey

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.259
genes for the interior posterior axis

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:42.640
other sets of genes for the dorsal
ventral access other toolkit genes for

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.219
the left-right access

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:45.900
and other toolkit jeans

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.709
offer the formation of particular body
tissues

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:53.429
give an example of one particular tissue
arye development

00:38:53.429 --> 00:38:57.139
so i is variation structures found in
lots of different animals

00:38:57.139 --> 00:38:58.329
they look quite different

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:00.249
uh... in different animals

00:39:00.249 --> 00:39:03.859
that's a human eye an adress offline

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:07.859
humanize high has single white gathering
our organ and lands

00:39:07.859 --> 00:39:11.770
in contrast insects have these compound
eyes thousands of little

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.659
uh... like gathering organs all-women on
a little crystalline array

00:39:15.659 --> 00:39:19.869
the histology of the eyes spot is quite
different single like gathering lens for

00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:22.659
the marianne i in this array of on it

00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:27.219
independent little white gathering units
in the compound diet and sex

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:29.479
although those eyes look very different

00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:32.009
turns out that the same toolkit gene

00:39:32.009 --> 00:39:36.259
is required for i develop ment in many
different organisms

00:39:36.259 --> 00:39:39.229
so uh... this team is called pack six

00:39:39.229 --> 00:39:40.770
can make a mutation in

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:45.069
one chromosome that one of the two
copies of pax six on during human

00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:46.189
development

00:39:46.189 --> 00:39:49.399
you begin to lose optical parts of the
eye

00:39:49.399 --> 00:39:53.759
in particular the colored a high-risk
muscle that normally surrounds the pupil

00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:56.490
you can see there the eye of a a patient
with

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.280
uh... defect in one copy of his packed
sixteen and that produces

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.319
uh... the absence of an iris disease
called anna radiance of the people now

00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:06.609
nearly fills the are

00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:08.069
similarly in the malice

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:11.379
mutation in one of the two copies of the
pack sixteen

00:40:11.379 --> 00:40:14.019
parsley reduces our the size of the
i_r_a_

00:40:14.019 --> 00:40:18.219
mutations in both copies completely
eliminate the i uh... announced on

00:40:18.219 --> 00:40:20.639
embryo had shown at the upper right

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:24.059
although to sop lies with very different
than a million times

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:27.689
there's a similar packs sixteen in fruit
flies and if you make a mutation that

00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:28.460
gene

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.899
you eliminate the compound by at the the
for plot

00:40:31.899 --> 00:40:33.839
even more remarkably

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:35.719
if you all over express

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:39.649
this ki yaad developmental regulator of
ice formation

00:40:39.649 --> 00:40:44.009
you can generate new rights issue in
completely different body parts

00:40:44.009 --> 00:40:47.559
so this is an experiment that was done
dial by war ca walter gehring slam

00:40:47.559 --> 00:40:51.439
taking this pack sixteen in engineering
that to be expressed

00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:53.330
uh... during late development

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.909
united on developing fruit fly

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:59.209
you can see when you overexpressed of
the irate and later gene

00:40:59.209 --> 00:41:01.659
you induce on the lake of the fruit fly

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:05.589
the tiny little patch of red compound i
kiss you

00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:07.539
you do the scanning electron micrograph

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:08.680
that structure

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.100
had exactly the kind of independent
repeated i'll unit that you would find

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.109
in the normal fly on

00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:17.519
and remarkably you can get that result
whether you do the experiment with the

00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:19.579
flight pack sixteen

00:41:19.579 --> 00:41:20.419
or

00:41:20.419 --> 00:41:24.059
with the pack sixteen

00:41:24.059 --> 00:41:27.329
so did we think the jeans like packed
six

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:29.480
are part of an ancient toolkit

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.909
that's been inherited from a common
ancestor and can be put to work to build

00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.260
related structures

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.759
even in very different working animals

00:41:38.759 --> 00:41:42.669
so how do these sorts of our master
regulators work

00:41:42.669 --> 00:41:46.499
many of the ancient toolkit genes that
control the development of thirty people

00:41:46.499 --> 00:41:50.109
adi access or the formation of a
particular tissue

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:52.719
turn out to encode gene products

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:55.309
that act by switching other genes

00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:56.939
on and off

00:41:56.939 --> 00:41:59.539
okay so for example to build an army

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:04.229
you have to express uh... lens proteins
and photoreceptors

00:42:04.229 --> 00:42:06.060
the pack sixteen does

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.309
the tax

00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.970
as

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.559
a regulatory molecule that flips which
is on target genes and causes things

00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:15.060
like lens proteins and total receptors

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.480
ought to be expressed

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.869
at the site where the pack sixteen has
expressed

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:23.649
trevor short video about the show that
kind of a regulatory structure

00:42:23.649 --> 00:42:27.629
so this is a gene with the yellow part
are of the d_n_a_

00:42:27.629 --> 00:42:30.489
uh... that codeine part colored yellow

00:42:30.489 --> 00:42:33.449
that might include something like a lens
protein

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:36.509
it would normally only be expressed of
an army plan race plans on the jeans

00:42:36.509 --> 00:42:40.759
promoter and makes a messenger r_n_a_
from the gene

00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:44.359
the coding region of the genus
surrounded by a series of regulatory

00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:45.739
switches

00:42:45.739 --> 00:42:49.290
so these are part of d_n_a_ that don't
co pretty protein instead

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:53.619
they acted switches that determine where
and when the gene turns on

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:56.519
those switches or the landing sites

00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:58.629
for regulatory molecules

00:42:58.629 --> 00:43:00.799
that bind to the switches

00:43:00.799 --> 00:43:03.149
attorney plan raised for the jeans
promoter

00:43:03.149 --> 00:43:06.759
and cause an increase in the total
number message or any transcript coming

00:43:06.759 --> 00:43:08.379
from the g

00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:10.950
typically deal be surrounded by multiple

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.449
uh... switches

00:43:12.449 --> 00:43:16.649
that allows the gene to be turned on at
different times and places op under the

00:43:16.649 --> 00:43:20.279
control of different signals and
regulatory molecules

00:43:20.279 --> 00:43:24.289
a lens protein in the mouse is also
expressed in the liver for example

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:25.559
it might have a switch

00:43:25.559 --> 00:43:28.979
where regulatory molecule turns it on in
the highlands

00:43:28.979 --> 00:43:32.249
the pack sixteen is an example of a
regulatory molecule that we're going to

00:43:32.249 --> 00:43:35.980
one of those switches there'd be a
difference which opportunity known

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.609
uh... in the liver

00:43:38.609 --> 00:43:42.489
okay with that background on master
regulators huh let's come back up to the

00:43:42.489 --> 00:43:46.640
problem of foreign women hinman on
development in different animals

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.209
for lender hind limbs are good examples
of structured that very indifferent

00:43:50.209 --> 00:43:53.299
always along interposed your body axis

00:43:53.299 --> 00:43:56.230
so four limbs in hind limbs can become
wings or legs

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.559
short legs so and hopping legs

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:02.209
uh... spines and finn sighed and fish

00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:03.859
overdue brits

00:44:03.859 --> 00:44:05.259
share

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:09.359
another set of toolkit amassed a
regulatory teens that are involved in

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:13.459
controlling the formation of hind limbs
or for land

00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:16.969
so these are slight show a series of
chicken embryos

00:44:16.969 --> 00:44:18.420
that had been stains

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.779
uh... with a blue died this is a method
allows you to look at where an

00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:25.349
individual gene has been expressed race
he cites a blue with the sites where the

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:27.669
gene is the returning on

00:44:27.669 --> 00:44:29.969
there's a gene called t_v_ expired

00:44:29.969 --> 00:44:31.219
that's expressed

00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:34.169
in the wing by the v_ chip but not the
leg

00:44:34.169 --> 00:44:37.849
there's another gene called t_b_ exports
expressed in the hind uh... late but not

00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:38.809
the wing

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:41.559
another gene called pex one that turns
on in the way

00:44:41.559 --> 00:44:43.239
but not the way

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:47.369
so all vertebrates i have these master
regulatory genes are expressed in one

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:51.739
way or the other and help determine are
held the limbs normally form

00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:55.910
doesn't matter whether your official
reform birth chip are or a mouse

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:57.849
are these genes are turned on

00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:01.889
in out one limb structure or the other

00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:05.459
so what's happened in organisms where
the development of one lam has been

00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:07.249
drastically alter

00:45:07.249 --> 00:45:11.709
so we went through yesterday the example
of completely losing the heinlein uh...

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:14.469
in natural populations of steckel backs

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:18.939
and i summarized the series of of
genetic experiments that show

00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:22.809
that a major gene located this land of
linkage group seven controls the

00:45:22.809 --> 00:45:27.439
presence of the absence of the pelvis in
these natural population

00:45:27.439 --> 00:45:31.899
so it's possible to actually are also
determined the location of these toolkit

00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:35.099
master regulators that are known to be
involved in hinman reform and

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.489
development

00:45:36.489 --> 00:45:37.759
when you do that

00:45:37.759 --> 00:45:41.999
turns out that one of the hinman master
regulatory laters maps exactly to the

00:45:41.999 --> 00:45:45.629
locus that controls the presence or
absence of the hind fed

00:45:45.629 --> 00:45:47.519
uh... in the staple backs

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:49.980
that gene is called the cadets one gene

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.469
one concert you're in the earlier
expressions flights as well

00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:56.359
this gene actually plays several
different roles dog during normal

00:45:56.359 --> 00:46:00.129
development you may wonder why it's
called pex one well in addition

00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:04.339
uh... take normally turning on and hind
limbs but not for landsat also turns on

00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:06.159
and some other body tissues

00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:09.679
it turns on in the pituitary in plays an
important role in controlling pituitary

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:11.369
gene expression

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:15.659
it also turns on in on jaws the mouth
parts

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:19.429
if you completely eliminate the pics one
gene in a mouse

00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:21.379
you shrink the hind limbs

00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:25.879
but the mouse dies at birth with
pituitary abnormalities and uh... enjoy

00:46:25.879 --> 00:46:28.769
normality screen your facial defects

00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:31.989
in some ways it doesn't look very
promising for trying to use this gene to

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:35.549
evolve a new structure in our
populations that are subject to a full

00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:38.589
range of fitness constraints in the wild

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:42.169
on the other hand if you look at what's
happened to the pics one gene uh... in

00:46:42.169 --> 00:46:43.829
steckel backs

00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:46.229
the protein coding region of the gene

00:46:46.229 --> 00:46:47.949
has not changed at all

00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:51.409
in marine in public reduce tickle backs

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:55.489
in contrast if you look at where this
toolkit gina strongly expressed in

00:46:55.489 --> 00:46:56.459
embryos

00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:59.329
there is an obvious difference in pex
one expression

00:46:59.329 --> 00:47:02.779
now we're seeing blue at those sites
where the pics one gene is expressed in

00:47:02.779 --> 00:47:05.729
either marina republic because
population

00:47:05.729 --> 00:47:10.029
it in the marine population expression
in the blue mountains are region

00:47:10.029 --> 00:47:12.309
but also turns on and a spot

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:13.500
uh... at the

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.459
site of the body where the high infant
would normally grow out

00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:20.949
also see that from the belly of the fish
are here in the lower left how two spots

00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:23.819
where the kremlin's would normally form

00:47:23.819 --> 00:47:25.999
in the public reduced population

00:47:25.999 --> 00:47:29.880
you still have normal expression in the
developing had region the mouth of the

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.159
drop parts

00:47:31.159 --> 00:47:34.329
but at the site in the body where the
hind limb but normally form

00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:39.219
the pics one gene i'm normally no longer
terms on in that location

00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:42.139
so what do we think it's happening all
that summarized

00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:45.739
uh... in the final brief animation

00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:50.179
the marine and the pelvic reduced
population have apec's one locus

00:47:50.179 --> 00:47:54.469
the coding region of the gene is still
intact in both population

00:47:54.469 --> 00:47:58.150
this gene we think it's surrounded by a
series of these regulatory switches the

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.019
cause of turned on in specific body
parts like the chart the pituitary or

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:04.339
behind them

00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:05.970
in both populations

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.149
some of those switches are still present
in function normally

00:48:09.149 --> 00:48:12.379
so genes expressed normally in the mouth
parts

00:48:12.379 --> 00:48:16.359
you still build normal nelson johnson
both populations

00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:21.569
still expressed in the pituitary still
for normal to terry in both organisms

00:48:21.569 --> 00:48:25.749
in the marine population it turns on and
the highland menu bill the pelvis

00:48:25.749 --> 00:48:28.539
in the reduced population

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:30.609
the hind limb control switch

00:48:30.609 --> 00:48:32.239
has been inactivated

00:48:32.239 --> 00:48:36.389
you no longer express the pics one gene
at that point patient and as a result

00:48:36.389 --> 00:48:38.260
the hind limb fails to form

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.459
uh... in the fish

00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:44.849
okay you'll hear from shawn did similar
tweaking with these switches that

00:48:44.849 --> 00:48:46.150
surround jeans

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.390
rides a very flexible method for
evolution to use

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.840
the create major changes morphological
changes in particular body regions but

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.880
still preserve on the overall viability
of the coding region in the expression

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.800
of the teens

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.599
uh... in other tissues

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:05.509
okay i've gone through on them reduction
in some detail they think it's a great

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:11.559
sort of trade it's evolved out
repeatedly in lots of different animals

00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:16.069
sigs ample of 'em on sort of macro
evolutionary change that scene in wales

00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:17.579
manatees

00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:20.769
and so it kind of trade now or
evolutionary studies have made it

00:49:20.769 --> 00:49:22.149
possible

00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:25.989
to document major morphological change
that occurs and nationally anchoring

00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:27.129
species

00:49:27.129 --> 00:49:30.659
to trace those changes out through the
fossil record

00:49:30.659 --> 00:49:34.479
to track down the number in the location
of the chromosome regions that control

00:49:34.479 --> 00:49:37.049
the morphological differences

00:49:37.049 --> 00:49:41.189
to identify specific genes that normally
build a corresponding morphological

00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:42.309
structure

00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:46.839
and the study how those genes have
changed uh... in natural population

00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:48.640
so we now know a lot more

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.310
about the detail molecular mechanisms to
control the sports traits and we did at

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.069
the time the darwin road

00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:58.339
but the details in the additional data
become for many fields all support the

00:49:58.339 --> 00:50:01.939
key original idea of dissent with
modifications

00:50:01.939 --> 00:50:04.160
that's exactly are what supposed to
happen

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.249
but the good scientific theory

00:50:07.249 --> 00:50:10.410
science should fundamentally both
explain existing data and make

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.069
predictions

00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:14.069
as we've seen darwin predicted

00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:16.089
that the earth must be old

00:50:16.089 --> 00:50:19.649
the transitional fossils must have
existed in the past

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:23.739
that variance must be able to arise in
spread to populations

00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:28.409
and that very different organisms uh...
must be related to one another

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:31.999
every one of those predictions has been
resoundingly confirmed by all kinds of

00:50:31.999 --> 00:50:33.739
independent data

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:34.740
from physics

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:39.239
from geology from paleontology from
genetics from biochemistry

00:50:39.239 --> 00:50:42.139
from molecular biology in from
embryology

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:46.499
that's why evolution is regarded as a
well-established backed by scientists

00:50:46.499 --> 00:50:50.209
and that's why uh... we considered a key
organizing principle for understanding

00:50:50.209 --> 00:50:51.549
paula biology

00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:54.499
and into relationships uh... between
living forms

00:50:54.499 --> 00:51:01.499
so i'll stop there and i'd be happy to
answer questions

00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:07.889
strike

00:51:07.889 --> 00:51:09.930
fetuses

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:16.930
seat

00:51:17.759 --> 00:51:19.199
there is

00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:22.599
lots of different mechanisms that can
alter d_n_a_ sequence shawn mentioned

00:51:22.599 --> 00:51:27.119
single base pair changes that can occur
are by heirs of replication during

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:30.259
ourselves so cell replication

00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:34.149
that occurs randomly and will just alter
individual base pairs

00:51:34.149 --> 00:51:37.319
there's also transpose of oil moments
that will hop around

00:51:37.319 --> 00:51:40.969
there's also a gene duplication of ends
to take place in fact we now have genome

00:51:40.969 --> 00:51:43.610
sequences of lots of different animals
and you can see

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.470
household gene sections

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.129
i have been duplicated creating a new
regions we think that

00:51:49.129 --> 00:51:50.969
those kinds of mechanisms

00:51:50.969 --> 00:51:55.460
provide uh... a flexible bases of
generating the kinds of genetic

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.499
variation

00:51:56.499 --> 00:51:57.869
that underlies

00:51:57.869 --> 00:52:01.440
uh... the things that evolution can do
to produce a new alterations in

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.569
morphology

00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:07.089
just over one side of the room gap

00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:08.270
no

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.999
swoon

00:52:09.999 --> 00:52:13.869
slams shut

00:52:13.869 --> 00:52:19.559
house remarkably arm the extract spot is
actually interpreted

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:21.319
and if you shine light

00:52:21.319 --> 00:52:22.870
on the lake of the fly

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:26.890
and report from the neurons that project
that a topic i passed

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.669
they respond to the light

00:52:28.669 --> 00:52:32.119
so uh... it's a remarkably

00:52:32.119 --> 00:52:33.940
so my functional alive

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.359
uh... that not only has the right lens
proteins and photoreceptors but actually

00:52:38.359 --> 00:52:44.289
is innovative will respond lightened
stimulate electrical activity

00:52:44.289 --> 00:52:48.179
invented last the teacher here

00:52:48.179 --> 00:52:53.809
that starts you senseless last address
domestic three shahrukh

00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:56.029
and i was just wondering why

00:52:56.029 --> 00:52:58.449
so many religious

00:52:58.449 --> 00:53:03.109
six years that religious andrew groups
of people are going to see the sketch

00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:08.339
reacts negatively darwin's theories ego
he clearly or at least protected to

00:53:08.339 --> 00:53:10.479
clearly still believes

00:53:10.479 --> 00:53:13.089
actress act

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:16.699
who will talk more about that the second
noon i think the point i'd like to make

00:53:16.699 --> 00:53:17.569
is

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:19.179
and in fact on

00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:23.059
most major religious groups in the world
don't see a conflict uh... between i

00:53:23.059 --> 00:53:25.199
evolution and religion

00:53:25.199 --> 00:53:27.119
uh... including the pope himself

00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:27.970
uh... who

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:31.660
looks at the same day that i summarized
here and says this is an independent our

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.049
data that overwhelmingly supports

00:53:34.049 --> 00:53:35.969
uh... the theory of evolution

00:53:35.969 --> 00:53:38.629
is not a conflict between the idea

00:53:38.629 --> 00:53:39.919
that life

00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:41.049
has been

00:53:41.049 --> 00:53:42.329
modified

00:53:42.329 --> 00:53:46.729
generated uh... by a process uh...
evolution and the central modification

00:53:46.729 --> 00:53:50.530
that's a separate issue from where the
universal originally came from

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:54.619
and what set everything off at the
beginning vital also doesn't say

00:53:54.619 --> 00:53:56.439
how god created to act

00:53:56.439 --> 00:53:57.479
union says

00:53:57.479 --> 00:53:59.029
all came from dot

00:53:59.029 --> 00:54:00.419
so it's not so different

00:54:00.419 --> 00:54:04.989
then uh... you know on evolutionary
model where from very simple beginnings

00:54:04.989 --> 00:54:11.420
of life forms are generated by descent
modification

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.909
ho

00:54:13.909 --> 00:54:16.990
side aspect in this town

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:20.109
the decisions

00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:22.269
the

00:54:22.269 --> 00:54:23.349
lisa

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:24.899
see you soon

00:54:24.899 --> 00:54:28.739
dozens of small sources so you've got
some

00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:30.149
uses

00:54:30.149 --> 00:54:33.469
that's actually why that gap apostle
record existed for a long time cuz i

00:54:33.469 --> 00:54:37.429
wasn't sure how to recognize that early
forms of of life on earth

00:54:37.429 --> 00:54:40.569
one of the uh... the real breakthroughs
came from a realization that sometimes

00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:43.279
the single cell micro-organisms

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:47.390
two million large maps so you can
actually see this today off the western

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:52.130
coast of australia there's these
structures called str mandalite hons

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:57.209
strata light like structure was his big
map like forms of spy in a bacteria

00:54:57.209 --> 00:55:01.729
that all form and their big enough that
they actually make uh... giant kind of

00:55:01.729 --> 00:55:05.150
mushrooms just full of off hold back
three

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:09.109
so those forms can be seen today and
those of the structures that were first

00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:13.969
recognized in in the fossil record very
similar sorts of accumulation incredibly

00:55:13.969 --> 00:55:17.469
high density all lay down in little
chains and maps just like you would see

00:55:17.469 --> 00:55:22.109
today in in a modern structure awful
australia these bacteria still exist in

00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:23.180
the world today

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.099
and they can be recognized in the fossil
record originally

00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:27.680
because of that unusual

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.959
island group b_ two of them and then
once i was clear that those things

00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:36.349
existed you could begin looking for more
and more rocks said had the

00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:39.469
characteristics that they would have
been laid down in the kind of nearshore

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:42.229
environments where those structures
reform

00:55:42.229 --> 00:55:47.209
this is my last teacher but i hope that
doesn't mean the end of the question

00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:49.190
pge

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:52.239
past possibly axis

00:55:52.239 --> 00:55:55.509
exchanges struts jsp kids

00:55:55.509 --> 00:55:58.969
so there's lots of work for new ideas
eases breakout there's lots of questions

00:55:58.969 --> 00:56:02.059
about where the disease organisms liking
problem

00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:05.479
so that's looked at by sequence in the
virus in trying to see how it's related

00:56:05.479 --> 00:56:08.589
to the other known viruses uh... as

00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:10.849
patients are treated with drugs

00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:14.539
viral resistance for drug-resistant
forms of the virus will emerge within

00:56:14.539 --> 00:56:18.799
the body dramatic example of evolution
occurring in medicine

00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:23.469
again if you sequence the genome of the
virus is that have emerged in a patient

00:56:23.469 --> 00:56:27.359
that's being treated with drugs you can
see individual based care changes that

00:56:27.359 --> 00:56:30.779
have occurred within the virus they're
part of the evolution of are drug

00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:31.949
resistant

00:56:31.949 --> 00:56:38.089
some fact the strategies the doctors use
to try to suppress of viral infections

00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:41.419
are heavily based on the idea of trying
to minimize the chance that by were

00:56:41.419 --> 00:56:42.780
resistant forms

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.600
uh... will pop out and spread the best
way to do that is to treat patients with

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.540
multiple drugs simultaneously so that
even if a single bass pro change occurs

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.870
there some other drug that is inhibiting
multiple parts the virus independently

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.249
and keeps the infections on spa stamp

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:02.309
okay thanks very much as were great
questions and i'll turn things back over

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:09.309
at the top

00:57:11.909 --> 00:57:15.549
thank you david kingsley for an
outstanding talk

00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:20.249
we're going to break now for
half-an-hour when we return sean carroll

00:57:20.249 --> 00:57:26.759
well conclude our journey of evolution
by talking about human fossils and also

00:57:26.759 --> 00:57:28.089
human genetics
