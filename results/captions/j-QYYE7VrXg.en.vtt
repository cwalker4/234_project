SHE SAID IN THE INTERVIEW:
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.991 align:start position:0%
"I'M NOT FOR IMPEACHMENT...  I
DON'T THINK WE

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.126 align:start position:0%
SHOULD GO DOWN THAT PATH,
BECAUSE IT DIVIDES THE COUNTRY.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.993 size:88% position:44%
AND HE'S JUST NOT WORTH IT."

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start position:0%
OKAY, THAT'S CLEARLY REVERSE

THAT'S A LITTLE-- THAT'S A
LITTLE... WHOOP-WHOOP.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:51.584
SHE'S USING A LITTLE RHETORICAL
TECHNIQUE WE CALL "DUCK SEASON,

PELOSI'S DAUGHTER, ALEXANDRA,
HAS SAID THAT THE SPEAKER IS THE

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.724 align:start position:0%
ONLY ONE IN WASHINGTON WHO KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING, SO WE CAN

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.394 align:start position:0%
ALL SLEEP AT NIGHT.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:05.264
WELL, THAT LEAD A REPORTER TO
ASK, "HOW WELL DO YOU SLEEP AT

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.732 align:start position:0%
NIGHT?"
PELOSI ANSWERED,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.067 align:start position:0%
"IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH
CHOCOLATE I HAVE EATEN DURING

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.201 align:start position:0%
THE DAY."

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start position:0%
"TODAY, I GAVE UP CHOCOLATE FOR
LUNCH-- I MEAN FOR LENT.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:14.040
IT REALLY WAS MORE FOR LUNCH,
BECAUSE I'M OFF IT ALREADY.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.308
I HAD A DOUGHNUT FOR BREAKFAST.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.043
THEN, ONCE I HAD THE DOUGHNUT, I
THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THE

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.411
CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM FOR LUNCH.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:22.215 align:start position:0%
THEN MY COLLEAGUE CAME FROM GUAM
AND BROUGHT CHOCOLATE CHIP

SURE, SURE.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.158 align:start position:0%
GO AHEAD.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.526 align:start position:0%
SURE, CLAP AWAY.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.495
JUST A REMINDER: THE QUESTION
WAS, "HOW WELL DO YOU SLEEP AT

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.332 align:start position:0%
NIGHT?"
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'M GUESSING NOT THAT WELL,
SINCE SHE CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:46.672 align:start position:0%
A WORKDAY WITHOUT SNORTING A
LINE OF COCOA.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.007 align:start position:0%
THE BROWN DRAGON.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.645 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
WAS IT JUST YESTERDAY?

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:56.315
YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP UNVEILED
HIS NEW BUDGET, WHICH WOULD CUT

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.852 align:start position:0%
$818 BILLION FROM MEDICARE OVER
TEN YEARS.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.656 align:start position:0%
SO SENIORS--
&gt;&gt; Audience: BOO!

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.459 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I KNOW.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.262 align:start position:0%
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET TEN YEARS'
WORTH OF COLONOSCOPIES NOW.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:13.900 align:start position:0%
OR JUST GET ONE AND TELL THEM TO
LEAVE THE CAMERA HANGING UP

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.737
THERE WITH THE CORD HANGING OUT
AND PLUG IT INTO THE XBOX, AND

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.810 align:start position:0%
SHOOT THOSE POLYPS.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:30.082 align:start position:0%
DESPITE-- HE'S TO GO THIS
DESPITE AT HIS RALLIES HE SAYS,

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.018 size:81% position:41%
"WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.352 size:78% position:39%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, WE WILL
PROTECT MEDICARE FROM THOSE

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:45.898 align:start position:0%
GREEDY OLD PEOPLE.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.333 size:78% position:39%
STAY BEHIND ME, MEDICARE.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.467 align:start position:0%
I'LL FIGHT THEM OFF.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.635 align:start position:0%
IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:57.977 align:start position:0%
THEY'VE GOT BONES LIKE BRED
STICKS.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.346 size:81% position:41%
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
THAT'S HOW HE WOULD PUNCH,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.018 align:start position:0%
RIGHT?

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:08.554
OF COURSE, THIS SETS UP AN EPIC
BATTLE OVER HEALTHCARE IN THE

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:09.755 align:start position:0%
2020 ELECTIONS.

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.490
YESTERDAY, TRUMP SAT DOWN WITH
"BREITBART," AND EXPLAINED WHY

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start position:0%
THE DEMOCRATS' HEALTHCARE PLAN
IS POPULAR WITH VOTERS:

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:15.962
&gt;&gt; THEY THINK, FREE HEALTHCARE.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.531 align:start position:0%
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:19.932
BUT THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOU'RE UP
ON THE DEBATE STAGE, AND THEY

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.467 align:start position:0%
SAY, "WE'RE GIVING YOU FREE
EDUCATION.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.203 align:start position:0%
WE'RE GIVING YOU FREE
HEALTHCARE.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
WE'RE GIVING YOU EVERYTHING YOU
WANT, AND A ROLLS-ROYCE IN

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:30.810 align:start position:0%
EVERYONE'S POCKET," IT'S NOT AN
EASY SITUATION.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:35.314
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, EDUCATION,
HEALTHCARE, ROLLS ROYCE-- ALL

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:38.484 align:start position:0%
LUXURIES.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:43.422 align:start position:0%
WHAT DO YOU WANT NEXT,
BIG GOVERNMENT PAYING FOR

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.590 size:88% position:44%
DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED CATHETERS?

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:47.226 size:84% position:42%
THAT'S WHAT YOU POORS WANT.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.728 align:start position:0%
TRUMP CONTINUED:
&gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.065 align:start position:0%
IT SOUNDS VERY SEDUCTIVE--
SINGLE PAYER.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.667 align:start position:0%
SAY WHAT YOU WANT, BUT IT'S A
VERY SEDUCTIVE THING.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.671 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.740 align:start position:0%
HE'S RIGHT, JON.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:01.974 align:start position:0%
IT'S VERY SEDUCTIVE.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
"HEY, BAEK, YOU WANT TO PLAY
DOCTOR?

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:07.346 align:start position:0%
I HOPE SO.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.181 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE I'M VERY SICK."

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:13.419 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
BUT, TRUMP EXPLAINED, IT'S

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:16.055 align:start position:0%
TOO EXPENSIVE TO KEEP POOR
PEOPLE ALIVE.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:17.890
&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY IS THE COUNTRY NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.160
BUT IT'S MORE THAN THE ENTIRE
REVENUE STREAM TAKEN IN FOR THE

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:25.898 align:start position:0%
ENTIRE-- IT'S, LIKE, NOT EVEN
CLOSE, RIGHT?"

<i> (  LAUGHTER  ).</i>

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:31.971 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW-- QUOTE,
UNQUOTE.

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:37.777
THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THE INSANE
RAMBLINGS OF A SYPHILITIC BRAIN,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
BUT LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR
YOU.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.449
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:49.355
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU,
PUT IT IN LAY MAN'S TERMS.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.490 align:start position:0%
HERE'S HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO
HAVE MEDICARE FOR ALL.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:52.858
AND HERE'S THE REVENUE STREAM
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENTIRE.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:59.198
AS YOU CAN SEE, MEDICARE IS
MORE BY A DIFFERENCE OF "LIKE

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:04.303 align:start position:0%
NOT EVEN CLOSE, RIGHT?"
SO TRUMP UNDERSTANDS WHY PEOPLE

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:09.208
WANT MEDICAL CARE, BUT WARNS,
"WHAT HAPPENS IS TEN YEARS

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.609 size:84% position:42%
LATER, THE COUNTRY IS GONE.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:14.013 align:start position:0%

OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY."

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:19.018 align:start position:0%

YES, YOU HAVE SOCIALIZED

MEDICINE, AND TEN YEARS LATER--
IT'S GONE.

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:28.661 align:start position:0%
YOU WILL BE MISSED, EVERY OTHER
