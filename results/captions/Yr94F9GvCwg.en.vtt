00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
IYANLA: The transport team
was delayed in picking

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.899
Miss Jillian up from her hotel.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.690
IYANLA (VOICEOVER):
And my team has told me

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.820
that she is extremely agitated.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.450
I want to have a clearing
conversation with her,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360
so that we will not
have any upset present

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.782
during the healing process.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:17.865
IYANLA: Morning, sunshine.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.870
 Good morning.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.070
 How are you?

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.890
 Oh, I'm well.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.120
IYANLA: Is that true?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.860
 Is that true for you?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.240
 But I asked the question.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.140
Is that true?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.348
 I asked a question as well.

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:30.830
 No, but I asked you first.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.890
 Hm.
I'm fine.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 Is that true?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.690
Yeah?

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.100
 Mm.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 I wanted to, before
we start our work today,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.730
just have a quick
conversation about--

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 How unprofessional
you guys are?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.350
For making me sit
there for two hours?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.450
 Now, why is that
unprofessional for you?

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.550
 I didn't get an
update, anything.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.190
Don't tell me to check out
of my hotel room at 9:00

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.649
and then sit there till
11:30 with nobody telling me,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:58.940
updating me, somebody's coming.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.190
I could've stayed in the room.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.470
 But see the thing that I
wanted to talk to you about

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.692
was that right there.

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:04.900
 What are you talking about?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.630
I haven't raised my voice.
- That attitude.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.620
But you don't have to.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.700
 I'm taking to you
in a calm nature.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.840
 No, you're not.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.130
JILLIAN: Yes, I am.
I'm talking--

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.280
 That's what--

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.600
 --to you like
you're talking to me.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.360
 I'm telling you how
I'm experiencing it.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.260
 OK.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.190
 And if you do it to
me, who you don't know--

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.620
if you do it to me, who
you came for for help--

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.030
- How you do it to me--
- --then I'm sure--

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.988
 --for you don't know.

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:24.580
You don't sit your
guests, who you're

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.954
trying to supposedly help,
in a lobby for two hours

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:28.870
without updating them.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.160
That's rude.
IYANLA: Here's the way--

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.860
 You're trying to stir up drama
by making me sit at this hotel.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.760
You think I'm a fool?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.660
IYANLA: What do you--

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.560
 I know how TV work.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.101
You're going to have
me sit here so I

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:39.250
can get riled up because
this is for your ratings--

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.090
 No, it isn't.
JILLIAN: --on this show.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.440
 No, it isn't.
JILLIAN: OK, ma'am.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.070
 Let me tell you
what happened today--

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 Because I don't feel healed.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.220
How about that?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.080
 Well, how about we
haven't done the work?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.100
 We can't get to the
work because you--

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 How about we can't get
to the work until you--

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.428
 --are being unprofessional.

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:53.020
 --until you get ready
to release that energy.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
I could have come out here
and continued to move on,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.180
but my concern for you, to
be able to do this work,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.320
is that I wanted to
clear that energy.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.470
So you've made up
what this was about.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.270
I've been working with Ramone.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.770
But here's the thing.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.699
Here's the thing.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.890
This is what you're
taking into the marriage.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.990
And this is what he
has to deal with.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.950
 I'm not taking this
into the marriage.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.630
 Are you aware that this--

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.600
 I don't talk to
him like this--

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.370
- --is the level of stress--
- --because he respects me.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.640
 It doesn't matter whether
or not you talk to him.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.600
It's in your energy.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.850
You're bringing it
in the room with you.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.440
You don't have to
ever open your mouth.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.210
You sleep in the bed with that,
and if you would do it to me,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.280
and I'm here committed to your--

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.180
 Are you committed?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.340
 --intention-- absolutely.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.642
Absolutely committed.
- OK.

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:39.100
IYANLA: But what
I'm not gonna be--

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.015
 We'll see.
IYANLA: --is abused--

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:41.500
 I'm not abusing you.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.200
- --and disrespected.
- I haven't touched you.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 You are, and you're
probably not aware.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.760
 I haven't said
anything mean to you.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.560
- You're probably not aware--
- I'm talking to you--

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.370
 --of how nasty--

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.270
 --calmly.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.022
 --your energy is.
You are not.

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:52.330
- You're yelling at me.
- You're not.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.260
 I'm calm.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.400
 What I'm saying to you
is you are not aware--

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.300
JILLIAN: No.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.509
 --of the level of
toxicity in your energy.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:01.710
 Oh, my toxic energy.
OK, now.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.200
IYANLA: And that's what I wanted
to deal with you with before we

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.440
go into do the work--
JILLIAN: OK.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.210
 --so that you don't
bring that to Ramone.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.370
JILLIAN: OK.
- And--

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.578
 I won't bring it to Ramone.

00:03:09.578 --> 00:03:11.580
 --I haven't given
you permission

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.950
to speak to me in that way.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.370
 I haven't given you permission
to disrespect me like this.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.370
IYANLA: I am your elder.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.130
I have not disrespected you.
- With your unprofessionalism.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.420
IYANLA: I want to know--

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.860
I'll tell you what we gonna do.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.500
We gonna cut this right now.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.880
Let's do it.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.324
Get me Mr. Ramone.

00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:27.240
IYANLA (VOICEOVER): Anger
is a common response

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.790
to feelings of powerlessness.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.210
Miss Jillian's anger is
not only about her having

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.150
to wait in a hotel
lobby, it is also

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.910
about her inability
to relinquish

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.700
control and surrender
to this healing process.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300
 So what happened was
there was some breakdown

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.720
this morning between Miss
Jillian and production.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.460
And production called her.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.330
They did give her the
instruction to come down,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.020
and they weren't
there at that time.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.030
- Why?
- Then when they--

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.990
why?
RAMONE: Yeah.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.820
 Because of just
technical things going on.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.580
We have to set up what
we're doing today.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.510
We have to be ready--

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.330
 That has nothing to
do with your driver.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.070
 Isn't her safety supposed
to her priority though?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.550
 Excuse me?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.841
 Her safety is y'all priority.

00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:09.850
 It wasn't her safety.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.994
She was in the hotel.

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.570
She was in the lobby--
- She was in the lobby.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.890
 --of the hotel.
Right.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.720
So what--

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.780
 Anything could
happen in the lobby.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.040
IYANLA: You know--

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.100
 I mean, she wasn't
in a room to herself.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.360
 --I can only tell
you what happened.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.040
I can only tell
you what happened.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.010
I wasn't even aware
that it happened

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.062
because my schedule
says that I'm

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:26.270
gonna to meet with you first.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.822
 But my thing is that I
trusted with you guys--

00:04:28.822 --> 00:04:30.280
by putting her in
a different hotel

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.110
last night in the first place.
I didn't want that to happen.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.090
I didn't want us to be
separated in the first place.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.964
One of the things that
you emphasized with me

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:37.120
was protecting her.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.760
And I was being with her
and make sure that she's--

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.340
 What makes you think
that she was unsafe?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.970
She had-- doesn't
have-- let me tell you--

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.120
 First of all, when y'all
dropped her off last night,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.570
y'all dropped her off 34 or
35 minutes away from here,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.100
something like that.
40 minutes away from here.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.560
She's in a hotel by herself.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.095
 What does that have to do
with what we're talking--

00:04:49.095 --> 00:04:50.225
- She had to go--
- --about right now?

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:50.940
 It has exactly
to do with that.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.780
 She's a grown woman.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.500
RAMONE: Yes, she is
a grown woman, but--

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.570
 But we're not talking
about her safety.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.240
Her complaint was
not about safety.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.164
That's not what her
comment was to me.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:00.580
 Well, she's--
her comment to you

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.890
right now is that
you guys staged her

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.910
to get a reaction out of her.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.951
That's what she's saying.

00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:04.920
 But that is not true.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.820
That's not true.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.450
And because you think that.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.350
I'm done.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.250
 OK.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.450
 I told you yesterday,
this is my ministry.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.579
This is not what I do.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.120
I just happen to do
it on television.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.286
 Well, if we done, we done.

00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:19.020
 I just-- we're done
because without trust,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.210
we have absolutely nothing.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.360
 And I don't trust you.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.770
 There we go.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.160
I'm done.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.600
We don't have to this anymore.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.020
 Somebody take me home, please.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.180
Go get your stuff.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.846
RAMONE: My stuff is
already ready, babe.

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.270
No problem.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.110
 Bye, y'all.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.690
IYANLA: For Miss
Jillian and Mr. Ray,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.320
their inability to trust
in the healing process

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.810
reveals a much larger issue.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.110
Despite the fact that
they reached out for help,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.320
there was a level of
awareness about themselves

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.060
and their relationship that
they are unwilling to step into.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.210
And so our time together
has ended prematurely.
