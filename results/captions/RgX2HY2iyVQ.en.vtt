00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.700
- Why don't you move here, and
then you'd have a bigger place?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.700
Do you like it here?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.133
- But--[sighs]
I mean,

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:09.166
I don't fit in here--
just straight up body type.

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.100
Like, in L.A.,
my arms register as legs.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.200
They're just like--
[laughter]

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.800
[laughter]

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.033
They're like,
"Why is that octopus on Sunset?"

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.733
"Is that--"
[laughter]

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.733
It's not--
it's not for me out here.

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.733
- No?
- It's not, no.

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.733
But I--you know.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.166
- What do you do when
you're here?

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.000
- I cry.
I just sit in my room...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[laughter]
Bawling.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.366
No, I--

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.800
Well, last time I was here,
right from the show,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.166
I got courtside tickets
to a Laker game.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.233
- That's fun.
- Yeah, 'cause my--

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.066
my business agent thought
I was mad at him

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.700
for sexually harassing me.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400
- Well--
- But no, I'm 33,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
so I'm just starting to really
appreciate that,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.533
you know what I mean?
- I see, I see.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.133
- Well, it's true.
I can't speak for everyone.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.433
I'm not like
"Sexually harass--"

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.766
but, in your 20s,
I feel like you walk around--

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.433
like you'll walk past
a construction site,

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.800
and be kind of like,
"Oh, don't look--"

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.366
But then, in your 30s, you know,
I'm just like,

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.000
"What about this?"
[laughter]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600
"Like, how about--"
[laughter]

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.200
It's like my skirt's over
my head.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.933
I'm like, "Aah."
[laughter]

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.200
They're like, "We're eating."

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.266
But, uh--
[laughter]

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.466
[laughter]

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.366
It changes, it really does.

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.700
It changes, so--
So I got courtside seats,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.800
which--you've sat courtside
at a game, right?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800
- I have, yeah.
- I thought--I went--

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.566
I thought it would be
free booze.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.833
Um...
[laughter]

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.833
It's not, it's not.
[laughter]

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.066
I guess you have to be on
the team to get free booze.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.433
So...
- [laughs]

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.500
- I go, I get randomly seated
next to Dianna Agron.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.433
You know, the actress.
She was on "Glee."

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.400
She played the cheerleader,
Quinn?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.766
I mean, that lets you know
how hot she is.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.733
Yeah--oh, there we go.
There's the picture.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.566
Thanks for--yes.
Isn't that great?

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.866
[laughter]
She's like--

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.366
the most gorgeous girl ever.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.633
Her name was "Quinn"
on that show.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.133
To pull off that name?
- Yeah.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.033
- Like if my name were "Quinn"
on a show,

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:53.733
they'd be like, "Oh, the jolly
Irish groundskeeper, that--"

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.100
[laughter]

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.700
"Does a jig time and again,"
you know.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.733
But so she's there.
Is she not like an angel?

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.000
So--and the whole night,
she's like,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.466
She's like this...

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:06.733
'cause she knows people are
taking pictures of her.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.300
I obviously don't.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.633
[laughter]

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.333
I learned a lot.
I learned that my resting face,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.300
is just a scowl, is just--
[laughter]

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.700
[laughter]

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.000
And I learned--and you can see--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.933
that I have what I'm now calling
an "at-risk chin."

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.866
[laughter]

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.600
This is not a good section!

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.566
[laughter]
If I--if I don't,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.700
like keep it at sea level,
it just doubles itself, just--

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.766
[laughter]

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.000
I become the dinosaur in
the jeep in "Jurassic Park,"

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.433
just "Fff!"

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.766
[laughter]

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.800
So I'm like--no idea people are
taking pictures.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.866
I'm pounding red wine,
and I--

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.700
I thought it was free--
and I--

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.833
[laughter]

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.400
I get red wine teeth right out
the gate, you know?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.666
Like,
just first sniff of merlot,

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:56.233
just "True Blood" mouth.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:59.266
I look like I've been feeding,
and I'm eating popcorn,

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.766
the way I think we all
eat popcorn, which is--

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.466
you know, at first, don't you
always kind of start out

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:04.733
kind of like lying to yourself?

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:08.366
Like, "I don't know,
I'll have a little."

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.200
Ehm.
[laughter]

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.066
Like one piece at a time,
you know?

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.566
And then--and then, like,
you get a little more real.

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.800
Right?
[laughter]

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.100
and then eventually,
you just--you get "real" real.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.466
And just "gah!"

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.900
[laughter]

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.466
Like, I've split my lip trying
to get one more kernel--

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:25.466
[laughter]

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:28.000
It's true.
In my dumb mouth.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.800
It is true.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.566
- [laughing hard]

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.500
- And so that's what happened.
If you Google me, it'll be--

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.700
And I--I look like her,
actually.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.466
I look like her if she were
stung by a million bees.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.666
[laughter]

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:41.533
It's true!

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.600
I look like her if she were,
like, becoming the Hulk.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
That's--
[laughter]

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.233
And she--you know,
she wanted to be friends,

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:49.033
and I'm like, "I can't.
I can't.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.366
We don't have--
we're not the same thing."

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:54.433
Like she was telling me
hot people problems, you know.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:55.900
She's like,
"He won't stop calling."

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900
And I'm like,
"[whine], I hate that."

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.600
[laughter]

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.066
Do you eat popcorn like that,
though?

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.666
Are you a popcorn lover?
- Yeah, I do.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:06.433
And I eat it exactly like that.
- Right?

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.433
- Yes.
- I mean, that's why--

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:08.466
I'm so annoyed--
I'm single again,

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.433
so I'm going to have to start
dating some guy,

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.500
and we'll go to the movies
and he'll be like,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.466
"Do you want to get popcorn?"
and I have to be like,

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:16.133
"Oh, I hadn't even thought
about it."

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.933
[laughter]

00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:19.533
He's like, "What size?"
and I'm like,

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:21.366
"[giggles] A small.
Look at me."

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.400
[laughter]

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.933
Right, like a small popcorn?
That's like taking one Advil.

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:27.266
Like, "get outta here."

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.633
[laughter]

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.733
"Get--I want a trough.

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:33.600
And I want to dunk my head
in it."

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
And--and then, you know.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.300
I'll be pretending not
to think about the popcorn.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.000
- Hilarious.
So when you say

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.366
you're gonna start dating again,
that means that you're--

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:43.133
are you dating at all?

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.933
- No, I, um--

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:47.233
Well, I know everyone here
is like, "How do we date you?"

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.400
Thank you.
[laughter]

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.933
[laughter]

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:52.733
You can't, and not just 'cause
I'm not totally out of the woods

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:55.066
with this UTI I have right now,
but also--

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.233
[laughter]

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.800
but also--
Thank you.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.100
[laughter and applause]
Oh, my God.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.166
[laughter and applause]

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:09.066
No, but I'm not on any
dating websites.

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:12.733
I don't--I'm on--I have one,
like, app on my phone

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:14.800
that's kind of--
it's called "Foodspotting."

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.000
[laughter]

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.033
And it's like Tinder, but
for food, so, it lets me know--

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:20.766
- Is this real?
- This is totally real.

00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:23.666
It lets--they let you know about
food in your area.

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:27.500
So, like, this week in L.A.,
I was eyeing this one particular

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.933
scone.

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:30.200
And uh--
[laughter]

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.633
Under a mile away.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:33.000
Coincidence?
Probably not.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.800
[laughter]

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.166
So, I'm like, "Should I go?"
And my friends are like, "Go!

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.366
Like, check it out!"

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:43.066
So I went to the scone, and
I kind of just sidled up to it,

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:45.966
and I was like, "Oh, my God, you
look just like your picture."

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:48.700
[laughter]

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.033
So I'm kind of dating.
Kind of dating.

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:53.366
- It's different than that.
You should--

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:55.033
[laughs]

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:56.033
Oh, my God.
- It's pretty much

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:57.033
the same exact thing.
- Hilarious.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.033
It's almost exactly the same.
- Yeah.
