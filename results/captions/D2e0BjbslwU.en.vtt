00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:14.119
&gt;&gt; Narrator: For decades,
the Soviet space program was

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:18.656
shrouded in secrecy.
It was a history of public

00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.683
successes and hidden
disasters ... which claimed more

00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:28.350
than 160 lives.
It wasn't until the end

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:31.776
of the cold war, and
the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:38.096
in 1991, that the secret history
of Soviet space disasters was

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:39.433
finally revealed.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.427
The Soviet mission to dominate
space would ultimately become

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:56.105
nothing more than a dusty dream.
But during the 1960s, two space

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.499
programs are in full gear
with the moon as their goal.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:02.858
Each superpower desperately
wants to be the first to put

00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:04.246
a man on the moon.

00:01:04.446 --> 00:01:07.488
To put their cosmonauts
on the moon, Russia needs

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:09.835
a rocket big enough to get them
there.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.616
&gt;&gt; N1 was a super rocket,
counter part to American Saturn.

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:21.572
to launch Soviet counterpart
to Apollo to the moon.

00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:26.284
&gt;&gt; Narrator: By the late 1960s,
the Saturn-5 has proven itself

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.769
as NASA's workhorse.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.111
By early 1969, the Soviets are
preparing to launch the N-1.

00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.987
Unlike the Saturn, it is
Top-Secret.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:37.959
While the Saturn-5 uses 11 huge

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:41.821
engines in three stages,
the Soviet N1 relies

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:45.806
on a complicated array
of 42 smaller engines.

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.367
There are 30 engines
in the first stage alone.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:54.893
Eight more in stage two.
While the third stage has

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:56.299
the four final engines.

00:01:56.334 --> 00:02:00.474
But, with more engines,
the risks multiply.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:04.164

...

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.854
&gt;&gt; There's three huge stages
and 30 engines in the first

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.569
stage, all built by
a manufacturer that was not

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:13.250
particularly experienced
in building rockets.

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:15.376
It was an aircraft engine
builder.

00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:17.527
It was horribly complicated.

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:24.824
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The gigantic takeoff pad is readied as
the launch date for the mammoth rocket draws near.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:33.119
On February 21st, 1969,
the Soviets launched

00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:34.788
the unmanned N1.

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:39.281
Liftoff goes smoothly, then
70 seconds into flight,

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:41.298
the engines malfunction.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.663
The rocket is completely
destroyed and so, it seems, are

00:02:47.698 --> 00:02:50.251
Soviet hopes of beating America
to the moon.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:56.298
But the Soviets still believe
the N1 can succeed.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:01.516
On July 3rd, 1969, two weeks
before the "Apollo 11" launch,

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:04.198
the Russians send up a second
N1.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.331
&gt;&gt; By time it cleared the tower,
this launch vehicle had shut

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:11.673
down all of its engines except
one, which ultimately caused

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.737
the vehicle to tip over and come
down crashing, like that,

00:03:15.772 --> 00:03:19.044
onto the launch facility totally
destroying the launch facility

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.105
and knocking the turning
tower gantry off its turning base

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.621
and also leveling
on of the lightning towers

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:26.410
completely.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:27.595
It was like a tactical nuke
blast.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.845
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The damage is
devastating.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.545
It is two years before
the Soviets will be able to use

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.377
the rocket facility again.

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:41.762
But America is right
on schedule.

00:03:41.797 --> 00:03:46.802
On July 16th, 1969, "Apollo 11"
takes off for its historic

00:03:46.837 --> 00:03:48.020
journey to the moon.

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:51.003
For four days the world waits
to know its fate.

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:56.677
What no one but American
intelligence and NASA know is

00:03:56.712 --> 00:03:58.800
that the Soviets haven't given up.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:02.965
Three days earlier they've
launched Luna 15, a secret

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.340
unmanned moon probe,
in a standard rocket.

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.393
&gt;&gt; They were going to go
to the moon, pick up a bit

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:13.029
of dirt, take it back, and say,
"Look ... look at how clever

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:14.533
we Soviets are.

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:17.986
We've gone there, we've brought
back some soil without risking

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.198
human life, at a fraction
of the cost, and look at how

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:24.871
much money the Americans wasted
in this silly political

00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.091
competition with us. "

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:29.615
&gt;&gt; Narrator: If the two rockets
perform according to plan,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.547
they will be in the moon's orbit
at the same time.

00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:34.890
NASA keeps the news
from the public.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.147
But Apollo astronauts Michael 
Collins, Neil Armstrong,

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.743
and Buzz Adrin are informed.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:43.449
&gt;&gt; My father never expressed any
concern on my part,

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:47.911
And I think ...
he is a good enough engineer

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.632
to understand the probabilities
of there actually being some

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:52.639
sort of a collision.

00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:56.310
Space is a very big place
and the prospect of two

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:59.731
spacecraft colliding is pretty
unlikely.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:03.834
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The next day,
Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.349
become the first people
in history to set foot

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:07.670
to set foot on the moon.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.841
Armstrong is the first off
the spacecraft.

00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:18.610
&gt;&gt; That's one small step
for man, one giant leap

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:19.795
for mankind.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.044
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The "Apollo 11"
mission is a shining achievement

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.198
for the American space program.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:31.914
The Luna 15 meets a darker
and little known fate as it

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.142
crashes into the lunar surface.

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:39.574
The high drama of the moon race

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:42.699
has its origins in
the V2 missile programs of Nazi

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:43.776
Germany.

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.759
By the end of World War II,
America and Russia are moving

00:05:46.794 --> 00:05:48.949
into position for the cold war.

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:51.931
Both countries want Germany's
rocket research.

00:05:51.966 --> 00:05:55.882
&gt;&gt; The fact that Nazi Germany
spent all that money, and used

00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:00.085
all those people, including
the slave laborers to build

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.098
rockets to bombard london, saved
the American and Russian missile

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.718
and space programs a decade
or more.

00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:11.696
&gt;&gt; Narrator: America acts
quickly.

00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:16.116
Within months of the war's end,
100 of the top German rocket men

00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:17.814
are in the United States.

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.086
The press is told they are truck
drivers, but the Germans know

00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.276
what they will be working on ...
rockets.

00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:27.490
Among them is Wernher Von Braun,
the director of the Nazi

00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:31.373
V2 program and the man who will
help lead America to the moon.

00:06:31.408 --> 00:06:36.404
As important as the Germans
were, it was the rockets

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.970
themselves, the V2s, which would
be the foundation for both

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:42.378
the American and Soviet missile
programs.

00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:49.609
The Soviet missile program is
led by an unlikely figure,

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:53.633
Sergei Korolev, a rocket
scientist who had spent years

00:06:53.668 --> 00:06:57.120
in a gulag prison, a victim
of Stalin's purges.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:02.662
&gt;&gt; In those days it was
necessary for just

00:07:02.697 --> 00:07:04.855
one of your colleagues to say
you were disloyal.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.891
And a colleague, we think, made
the claim that he wasn't working

00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:15.648
seriously on the rockets that
were for the military defense

00:07:15.683 --> 00:07:18.352
program, but had these fantasies
about space.

00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:23.384
In any case, Korolev gets
arrested, sent to the gulag,

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.437
almost dies, works in the gold
mines.

00:07:26.472 --> 00:07:31.876
Was there for ... it's not clear
how long, maybe as long

00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.773
as a year.

00:07:32.808 --> 00:07:37.204
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Korolev is rescued
because of his mathematical

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:39.720
education, aeronautical
knowledge, and personal

00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:43.242
connections, but mostly
because the Soviet military

00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:45.219
needs him to design planes.

00:07:45.254 --> 00:07:51.301
Out of prison, one of Korolev's
jobs in the 1950s is to counter

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.924
the threat of America's
Strategic Air Command.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:58.066
America's huge bomber fleet is
armed with nuclear warheads

00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:00.188
and on-call 24 hours a day.

00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:03.853
To the Soviets it's like
a dagger pointed at

00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:04.939
their throat.

00:08:04.974 --> 00:08:10.694
By 1957, Korolev is ready
to test his own creation, the R-7

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:14.144
intercontinental ballistic
missile, or ICBM.

00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:19.795
Korolev's R-7 has four strap-on
boosters that can power it

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.246
into interplanetary altitudes
and then explode it

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:24.656
into American soil.

00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:26.667
The R-7 is revolutionary:

00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:29.723
the first missile that can
deliver a nuclear warhead

00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:31.629
from one continent to another.

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:35.233
But Korolev's new engine design
is not yet dependable.

00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:41.414
Meanwhile, a world away
in New Mexico, America is having

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:44.261
its own struggles with its
modified V2.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:56.384
Finally, on August 21st, 1957,
Korolev's R-7 became the world's

00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:00.087
first ICBM to fly successfully,
disintegrating harmlessly,

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:03.615
as planned, thousands of miles
from its launching point.

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:07.173
Suddenly, President Eisenhower
is in political trouble.

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:11.162
He's put America's resources
into its huge arsenal of B-52s,

00:09:11.197 --> 00:09:12.600
instead of missiles.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.951
Congress quickly declares that
America is in danger ...

00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:18.216
on the wrong side of a missile
gap.

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:24.731
October 4th, 1957, another shock
for America.

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:28.724
The Soviets send Sputnik 1 into
space on top of another Korolev

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:30.161
R-7 rocket.

00:09:30.196 --> 00:09:33.507
It is the first successful orbit
of a man made satellite,

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:36.957
and the United States is left
reeling by the unexpected

00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:39.294
display of Russian rocket know
how.

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.837
President Eisenhower tries
to quell American panic.

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:49.655
&gt;&gt; Our satellite program has
never been conducted as a race

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.985
with other nations.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.270
I consider our country's
satellite program to be well

00:09:55.305 --> 00:09:59.691
designed and properly scheduled
to achieve the scientific

00:09:59.726 --> 00:10:01.676
purposes for which it was
initiated.

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:07.140
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Just four weeks
after Sputnik1's success,

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:11.459
the Soviets launch "Sputnik 2."
This time with a passenger:

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:15.808
a dog named Laika,
meaning barker.

00:10:15.843 --> 00:10:19.761
Laika survives for several days
in space.

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:22.923
"Sputnik 2" is another
impressive success

00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.436
for the Soviet Union.

00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:28.821
&gt;&gt; This is a country that had
been Marched on, stomped on ...

00:10:28.856 --> 00:10:33.708
and had a long, you know,
years of, decades of, feudalism.

00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:37.049
And suddenly, in the '50s
and '60s, they're being told,

00:10:37.084 --> 00:10:41.433
"You are the best
and exhibit "A" is our space

00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:43.129
program, which is the best
in the world. "

00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:46.974
This was the first time that
the Russian people had ever

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:48.890
believed that they were

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:49.651
a superpower.

00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:55.051
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Under pressure
from the Russians,

00:10:55.086 --> 00:10:58.045
The Unites States rushes
to get an American satellite.

00:10:53.161 --> 00:11:03.544
On December 6, 1957,
a Navy-designed Vanguard rocket

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:07.998
Is ready, or so the U.S. thinks.
The grapefruit-sized satellite

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:10.441
it carries is America's answer
to Sputnik.

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:17.345
&gt;&gt; And a huge, huge ball of fire
rising up perhaps 100 feet.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.311
&gt;&gt; Narrator: It's a humiliating
failure for the United States.

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:25.695
At the U.N., Soviet delegates ask
if the United States might wish

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.471
to receive foreign aid
under Moscow's program

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.876
of technical assistance
to backward nations.

00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:35.038
But there is much Khrushchev is
keeping secret.

00:11:35.073 --> 00:11:40.072
&gt;&gt; We never saw video footage
or TV footage of the Soviet

00:11:40.107 --> 00:11:43.651
rockets blowing up, because it
was done in secrecy.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:47.272
And even the R-7 only flew
successfully on its fourth

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:50.859
attempt, whereas the U.S.
Program was in the full

00:11:50.894 --> 00:11:52.114
limelight of the media.

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:58.161
&gt;&gt; Narrator: On
January 31st, 1958, America

00:11:58.196 --> 00:12:01.110
finally gets its first satellite
into orbit.

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:06.398
It's the Army's Explorer 1,
and it uses a rocket built

00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:08.671
under the direction of Wernher
von Braun.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:14.319
Eisenhower makes a decision that
will change America's space

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:17.850
program forever ... He unifies
all research into one

00:12:17.885 --> 00:12:18.681
department.

00:12:18.716 --> 00:12:22.955
In October of 1958, a new
National Aeronautics and Space

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.087
Administration ... NASA ... takes
over the job.

00:12:26.122 --> 00:12:31.222
NASA's first step is to choose
seven pilots who will be

00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:32.876
America's first men in space.

00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:36.123
To the country they are more
than astronauts, they are

00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:39.336
a nation's hope to restore
its technological self-esteem.

00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.116
&gt;&gt; We went for military test
pilots who were all

00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:47.111
in their 30s ... in fact,
John glenn was 40 ... who had

00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:51.214
degrees or a lot of experience
in engineering, whereas

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:54.848
the Russians got a bunch
of younger men who were not

00:12:54.883 --> 00:12:58.412
remotely well educated
by the Mercury standards.

00:12:58.447 --> 00:13:00.964
They didn't need to be very
experienced, they just sort

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.659
of needed to be healthy
and trainable.

00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:08.221
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Sergei Korolev,
seen here next to his wife,

00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:11.179
would lead this group
into the frontier of space.

00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:15.415
Six would become Russia's first
cosmonauts.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.323
One would become Russia's first
casualty.

00:13:18.358 --> 00:13:23.316
These cosmonauts would be
the Soviet's answer to NASA's

00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:24.719
Mercury seven.
¶

00:13:46.644 --> 00:13:50.199
But no amount of training can
eliminate human error.

00:13:50.234 --> 00:13:53.755
In March 1961, Valentin
Bondarenko becomes the first

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.055
casualty of the Soviet program.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.310
&gt;&gt; Valentin Bondarenko was
the youngest member of the first

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:04.530
group of 20 Soviet cosmonauts
and he made a very forgivable

00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:05.472
human error.

00:14:05.507 --> 00:14:10.075
He literally removed
an electrode and used an alcohol

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.780
soaked cotton swab to clean
the place where the electrode

00:14:13.815 --> 00:14:17.451
or probe had been on his skin
and just flicked it toward

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:18.104
a table.

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.158
Unfortunately it landed on a hot
plate that he had to cook food

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.741
during this test and it just
sparked.

00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:28.987
And the pure oxygen environment
fed anything that was in it,

00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:30.754
caught on fire, and they could
not get him out in time.

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:39.789
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Inside the Soviet
missile program competition

00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:41.798
between rival divisions
is fierce.

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:46.156
One key player is
Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, a man

00:14:46.191 --> 00:14:48.550
of great bravery and even
greater arrogance.

00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:52.576
He is so determined to develop
a rocket that can replace

00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:56.567
Korolev's r- 7 as Russia's icbm
that he fuels his new rocket

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:59.615
with a volatile mixture
so dangerous it's known

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.762
As Devil's Venom.

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:06.158
&gt;&gt; Marshal Nedelin wanted to be
present at a very close

00:15:06.193 --> 00:15:06.836
distance.

00:15:06.871 --> 00:15:12.885
He instructed his team to bring
a chair, to place his just next

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.786
to the rocket.

00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:17.850
So, everyone understood it was
a violation of the rules,

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:20.921
But he was a big boss so he was
sitting there.

00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:26.456
And every rocket scientist,
every engineer, thought "should

00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:33.543
I stay behind the walls,
or should I go to sit next

00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:34.661
to the Marshal?

00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:37.472
Otherwise I would be considered
as a coward. "

00:15:37.507 --> 00:15:42.930
And dozens of people moved close
to Marshal Nedelin.

00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:50.412
And then, unfortunately, there
was a big accident.

00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:56.289
there was a huge explosion
and everyone, including

00:15:56.324 --> 00:15:58.086
Marshal Nedelin, was killed.

00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:02.471
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The fire burns
for hours, fed by millions

00:16:02.506 --> 00:16:05.105
of pounds of kerosene
and liquid oxygen.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.268
Those not burned outright
by the flames are splashed

00:16:08.303 --> 00:16:10.678
with the corrosive acids
of the rocket fuel.

00:16:10.713 --> 00:16:13.336
few escape.

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:17.966
In all, more than 150 people die
in the gruesome accident.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:25.490
The Soviet ICBM program is set
back by the disaster,

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:29.400
but Korolev continues to forge
ahead with his plans to send

00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:31.103
a cosmonaut into orbit.

00:16:31.138 --> 00:16:35.891
His answer to NASA's Mercury is
the Vostok, a huge craft that

00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:37.686
weighs nearly five tons.

00:16:37.721 --> 00:16:41.681
NASA is just as determined.
They plan to jump ahead

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:45.642
of the Soviets by putting
an American into space

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:48.515
In May 1961.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.829
Astronaut Alan Shepard is chosen
to pilot the first manned

00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:53.981
"Mercury" rocket.

00:16:54.016 --> 00:16:57.725
Nobody is sure if Shepard's
rocket, or Shepard, can survive

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.555
the flight.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.587
But the Soviets surprise NASA.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:06.537
At the last minute they announce
that they will launch a man

00:17:06.572 --> 00:17:10.452
into orbit on April 12th, 1961,
one full month before NASA's

00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:11.352
launch.

00:17:11.387 --> 00:17:15.560
The cosmonaut chosen is
Yuri Gagarin, hand picked

00:17:15.595 --> 00:17:17.216
by Sergei Korolev.

00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:21.787
&gt;&gt; He liked the idea that
Gagarin was a simple son

00:17:21.822 --> 00:17:25.278
of a peasant family, big smile
on his face.

00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:29.629
And I think the reaction was
really very, very chemical,

00:17:29.664 --> 00:17:30.709
you know, personal.

00:17:30.744 --> 00:17:35.707
&gt;&gt; Narrator: On April 12th,
the 27-year-old Yuri Gagarin

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:37.620
sets out to make history.

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:42.397
A Vostok capsule, powered
by Korolev's R- 7 rocket, is

00:17:42.432 --> 00:17:45.703
The vehicle that will take
the first man into orbit around

00:17:45.738 --> 00:17:46.860
the earth.

00:18:07.842 --> 00:18:12.843
Gagarin makes one earth orbit
in "Vostok 1."

00:18:12.878 --> 00:18:18.953
The flight goes flawlessly,
but there is an important secret

00:18:18.988 --> 00:18:20.684
the Soviets are keeping.

00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:24.011
&gt;&gt; We didn't hear it officially
from the Soviets at the time,

00:18:24.011 --> 00:18:31.759
because they were presenting
the fiction that he had landed

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:35.143
in his spacecraft.
Because the international

00:18:35.178 --> 00:18:40.320
Aeronautical rules required that
a pilot had to take off

00:18:40.355 --> 00:18:43.273
in his aircraft and land to set
a new record.

00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:45.908
And they were treating this
as a new world record ...

00:18:45.943 --> 00:18:47.531
the first space flight.

00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:49.301
So they just flat-out lied
about it.

00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:52.073
The genius of the original
design was, "Well, let's just

00:18:52.108 --> 00:18:54.783
punch him out of there and let
him parachute down. "

00:18:54.818 --> 00:18:56.880
It's like, "it's too hard
for him to land in

00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:58.281
the spacecraft, let's get him
out of the spacecraft

00:18:58.316 --> 00:19:00.831
at 20,000 feet. "

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:04.854
And that's what they did.
They just fired him out of it.

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:08.842
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Gagarin is hailed
as a conquering hero around

00:19:08.877 --> 00:19:09.713
the world.

00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:11.870
The Soviet Union has upstaged

00:19:11.905 --> 00:19:13.627
America once again.

00:19:16.627 --> 00:19:22.689
Between 1961 and 1963 the
Russian star shines brighter

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:26.713
than ever as each Vostok flight
confirms the Soviet's mastery

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:27.839
of space.

00:19:27.874 --> 00:19:32.026
Valentina Tereshkova is out
to achieve another first

00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:34.870
for the Soviets as the first
woman in space.

00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:39.237
She is to pilot "Vostok 6"
into history.

00:19:39.272 --> 00:19:43.534
Tereshkova takes off
on June 16th, 1963.

00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:47.381
In another blow to American
pride, she logs in more flight

00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:51.193
time ... 48 orbits ... Than all
the male Mercury astronauts

00:19:51.228 --> 00:19:52.781
combined.

00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:57.159
With Tereshkova's safe return
the Vostok series comes

00:19:57.194 --> 00:19:59.918
to a triumphant end
and emphasizes the

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:02.441
the Soviet's lead in the space race.

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:08.911
&gt;&gt; Narrator: America's
Mercury flights end in 1963,

00:20:08.946 --> 00:20:13.025
having failed to overtake the
Soviets in the space race.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.128
The next U.S. Space program,
Gemini, is gearing up

00:20:17.163 --> 00:20:20.009
for its first launch
in March 1965.

00:20:20.044 --> 00:20:24.190
It will put, not one, but two
men, in space and provide

00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:27.996
practice in docking maneuvers
crucial to the success of a moon

00:20:28.031 --> 00:20:29.366
landing.

00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:33.321
The Russians feel pressured
by Gemini.

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:37.413
Khrushchev orders Korolev
to beat the Americans into space

00:20:37.448 --> 00:20:40.686
with, not two men, but three,
inside a capsule with

00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:42.518
a pressurized interior.

00:20:42.553 --> 00:20:46.588
Three can be crammed
into the new Voskhad spacecraft,

00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:47.880
but not safely.

00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:52.047
&gt;&gt; There were three cosmonauts
sent up in a Voskhad capsule,

00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:55.065
which is basically just
a modified Vostok.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.851
And now, the Vostok's had only
carried one person.

00:20:57.886 --> 00:21:00.539
To squeeze three people in it
meant you had to take away

00:21:00.574 --> 00:21:03.523
their pressure suits and there
was no escape system.

00:21:03.558 --> 00:21:06.472
So, if the rocket blew up,
or something went wrong

00:21:06.507 --> 00:21:08.526
during the launch, the three men
just fried.

00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:13.852
&gt;&gt; Narrator: October 12th, 1964,
it is the first Voskhad launch,

00:21:13.887 --> 00:21:16.624
And for the first time
thSoviets will not be using

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:18.303
An ejection seat.

00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:22.042
The cosmonauts will return
to earth inside their capsule.

00:21:22.077 --> 00:21:24.596
Retro-Rockets and parachutes
slow their descent

00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:27.997
And the three-Man crew lands
safely, deep in Russia.

00:21:28.032 --> 00:21:31.328
The Americans have been beaten
into space again.

00:21:31.363 --> 00:21:37.077
In the spring of 1965 the
Soviets are readying a second

00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:41.241
Voskhad mission for another
space age first.

00:21:41.276 --> 00:21:45.370
Pavel belyayev and alexei leonov
are the crew.

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:48.204
Their mission ... The first walk
in space.

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:52.331
There is no third cosmonaut
on this trip, the extra space is

00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:54.094
Needed for their spacesuits.

00:21:54.129 --> 00:21:58.410
Leonov trains hard on earth,
but in space there are dangers

00:21:58.445 --> 00:22:00.250
No one anticipates.

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:07.182
On March 18th, 1965, leonov
begins his historic space walk.

00:22:07.217 --> 00:22:11.172
&gt;&gt; Leonov was really a guinea
pig.

00:22:11.207 --> 00:22:14.619
He was trying out something that
had never been done before.

00:22:14.654 --> 00:22:18.031
His spacesuit was pressurized,
obviously, because space is

00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:18.933
A vacuum.

00:22:18.968 --> 00:22:21.269
So, if you didn't wear
a spacesuit your blood would

00:22:21.304 --> 00:22:22.775
Boil and you'd die very quickly.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.158
Unfortunately, while he was out
in space, the air inside

00:22:26.193 --> 00:22:28.210
His suit pushed it out.

00:22:28.245 --> 00:22:29.800
It was rather like a balloon.

00:22:29.835 --> 00:22:32.175
So, he was much bigger than
he would normally have been.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.589
Now, when he tried to squeeze
back into the air-Lock entrance

00:22:35.624 --> 00:22:36.532
He couldn't fit.

00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:39.834
So, he therefore kept gradually
dropping the pressure, hoping

00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.094
That it would become small
enough so that he could fit in.

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:46.491
And eventually he had to drop it
below the permitted safety

00:22:46.526 --> 00:22:49.853
Limit, in fact, before he could
just about squeeze in feet

00:22:49.888 --> 00:22:50.688
First.

00:22:50.723 --> 00:22:52.555
But it was a real struggle.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.434
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Leonov's problems
aren't over.

00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:59.247
He and belyayev land off-Course
and spend a cold night alone

00:22:59.282 --> 00:23:02.248
In the Russian wilderness before
being rescued.

00:23:02.283 --> 00:23:05.179
The world is told nothing
of the flight's flaws.

00:23:05.214 --> 00:23:09.665
For Korolev, the mission is
another success, and the last

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.210
Of the voskhad series.

00:23:11.245 --> 00:23:14.262
He can concentrate now
on the spaceship that will take

00:23:14.297 --> 00:23:16.963
His cosmonauts to the moon ...
The Soyuz.

00:23:16.998 --> 00:23:21.061
The Soyuz has been
in development since sputnik ...

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:22.394
Nearly seven years.

00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:27.397
The huge spacecraft weighs
almost 7 1/2 tons ... 1 1/2 times

00:23:27.432 --> 00:23:30.062
The mass of its predecessor
the voskhad.

00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:34.366
However, the first Soyuz manned
flight is still two years off.

00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:37.417
&gt;&gt; "Gemini 12," "gemini 12."

00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:39.355
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The Americans,
meanwhile, continue flying

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.975
Gemini missions.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:46.477
Between 1965 and 1966, gemini
amasses almost 1,000 hours

00:23:46.512 --> 00:23:50.340
In space ... The Russians voskhad
only 26.

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:54.134
America has caught up
in the space race.

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:58.835
The testing of Korolev's Soyuz
spacecraft moves forward

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.346
Under pressure from the Soviet
leadership.

00:24:01.381 --> 00:24:05.223
It is at this crucial point that
Korolev, the master

00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:09.065
Of the Soviet space program, is
hospitalized for routine

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.184
Surgery.

00:24:10.219 --> 00:24:12.958
&gt;&gt; He goes into the hospital,
for what was supposed to have

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:15.255
Been a simple operation,
and he thought he was going

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.518
To be in over the weekend
and back to work on monday

00:24:17.553 --> 00:24:18.160
Morning.

00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:22.618
The surgeon discovers he's got
a huge, malignant tumor the size

00:24:22.653 --> 00:24:23.697
Of a fist.

00:24:23.732 --> 00:24:27.321
He issues an emergency call
to get help, they can't find

00:24:27.356 --> 00:24:27.937
Help.

00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:31.401
It was over the weekend.
They tried to fit an oxygen mask

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.643
On him and because he had had
his jaw broken in the gulag

00:24:34.678 --> 00:24:36.367
They couldn't fit it properly.

00:24:36.402 --> 00:24:40.106
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The operation fails
and Korolev is given a state

00:24:40.141 --> 00:24:40.801
Funeral.

00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:43.936
Ironically, he is honored
in death as his could not be in life.

00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:49.875
For fear of what would happen if they
have allowed the world to know

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.781
Korolev's name.

00:24:51.816 --> 00:24:56.445
The new chief designer is
vasili mishin, Korolev's former

00:24:56.552 --> 00:24:57.703
Second in charge.

00:24:57.814 --> 00:25:00.183
Although a talented engineer,
he lacks Korolev's

00:25:00.295 --> 00:25:04.037
Organizational skills, political
connections, and sheer bullying

00:25:04.183 --> 00:25:05.331
Power.

00:25:05.477 --> 00:25:09.681
The loss of Korolev will haunt
the Soviet space program

00:25:09.871 --> 00:25:11.928
For years to come.

00:25:13.285 --> 00:25:15.772
NASA is under pressure, too,
to get a .....

00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:38.811
on January 27th, 1967,
during a routine training

00:25:38.846 --> 00:25:42.448
Mission in the "Apollo 1"
command module, a fire breaks

00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:43.633
Out.

00:25:43.817 --> 00:25:47.480
It quickly flares out of control
in the oxygen-Rich atmosphere

00:25:47.659 --> 00:25:49.168
Inside the capsule.

00:25:49.354 --> 00:25:52.942
Within 16 seconds the three
astronauts are dead.

00:25:55.144 --> 00:25:59.493
The disaster is horrifyingly
predictable and preventable.

00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:05.000
The cause ... Bad wires, faulty
installation and poor quality

00:26:05.144 --> 00:26:08.342
Control in a spacecraft packed
with flammable materials.

00:26:08.594 --> 00:26:12.262
The Apollo disaster might have
been avoided had the Soviets

00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:15.179
Told the truth about
valentin bondarenko's death

00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.869
In 1961.

00:26:17.084 --> 00:26:21.442
That, too, involved a fire
in an oxygen rich atmosphere.

00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:26.917
Devastates the American effort.
It will be two years before

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.963
NASA's next manned flight.

00:26:29.176 --> 00:26:33.995
The American disaster provides
the Soviets with an irresistible

00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:37.131
Opportunity to retake the lead
in the space race.

00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:40.188
They rush the Soyuz
in to readiness for a launch

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:42.380
In the spring of 1967.

00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:48.715
Cosmonaut vladimir komarov is
scheduled to pilot the new Soyuz

00:26:48.895 --> 00:26:50.511
Spacecraft.

00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:54.869
&gt;&gt; It was clear that
the administration wanted

00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:59.223
Because it, of course, was to be
launched along with another

00:26:59.258 --> 00:27:03.362
Soyuz, in which there would be
a rendezvous, if not a docking

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:04.547
Maneuver.

00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:08.331
And this was all going to happen
at the 40th anniversary

00:27:08.478 --> 00:27:11.067
Of the glorious October
socialist revolution.

00:27:11.462 --> 00:27:14.238
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Soyuz engineers
asked brezhnev for more time

00:27:14.346 --> 00:27:17.580
To perfect "Soyuz 1,"
but brezhnev refuses.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.379
They must launch on time.

00:27:19.593 --> 00:27:23.737
&gt;&gt; It seems likely that
the "Soyuz 1" was

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.823
A fundamentally flawed
spacecraft.

00:27:26.004 --> 00:27:29.811
And that the cosmonauts,
the designers, those people that

00:27:29.955 --> 00:27:33.270
Really understood the program
believed that they were likely

00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:34.958
To have a very big problem
with it.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.735
&gt;&gt; Narrator: On
April 23rd, 1967, "Soyuz 1,"

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:41.942
With cosmonaut vladimir komarov
is launched.

00:27:42.085 --> 00:27:45.716
The mission gets off
to an ominous start.

00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:51.294
&gt;&gt; "Soyuz 1," unfortunately,
lost a solar panel,

00:27:51.476 --> 00:27:55.321
And therefore didn't have enough
power to stay up long enough

00:27:55.464 --> 00:27:58.163
For "Soyuz 2" to come
and rendezvous with it.

00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:01.616
So they decided to take komarov
back down again.

00:28:06.072 --> 00:28:09.163
&gt;&gt; Komarov was having just
a difficult time orienting

00:28:09.306 --> 00:28:12.010
The spacecraft, getting it to do
what he wanted.

00:28:14.886 --> 00:28:20.638
The real problem was that
the parachute system just

00:28:20.853 --> 00:28:23.448
Suffered a series of failures.

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.723
The first chute did not deploy
properly and then did not

00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:28.908
Separate properly.

00:28:29.089 --> 00:28:32.504
The emergency chute fouled
withhat and the spacecraft

00:28:32.683 --> 00:28:33.806
Never slowed down.

00:28:33.915 --> 00:28:37.581
It just hit the earth at, how
ever many ... 250 miles an hour.

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:45.496
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Komarov has
no chance.

00:28:45.607 --> 00:28:48.838
The crash is so thunderous
recovery teams cannot even

00:28:48.949 --> 00:28:51.357
Distinguish human remains
from the wreckage.

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:55.713
Details of the disaster are
a closely guarded secret.

00:28:55.892 --> 00:29:00.205
Komarov will be remembered,
however.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.168
He is the first person to die
during a mission to space.

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:13.955
&gt;&gt; Narrator: By 1968, America's
Apollo program is back on track

00:29:14.108 --> 00:29:16.146
after the Apollo 1 disaster.

00:29:16.325 --> 00:29:19.172
That same year the Russians
struggle to iron out

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.935
The problems of Soyuz.

00:29:21.082 --> 00:29:23.345
And the Soviets do just that.

00:29:23.526 --> 00:29:28.240
On October 30th, 1968, "Soyuz 2"
and "Soyuz 3" return

00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:30.578
Successfully from a joint
mission in space.

00:29:31.943 --> 00:29:35.865
For the first time a Soyuz
spacecraft has returned to earth

00:29:35.977 --> 00:29:37.879
With its cosmonaut alive.

00:29:39.891 --> 00:29:42.875
Two months later,
on December 21st, 1968,

00:29:43.023 --> 00:29:47.013
"Apollo 8" takes frank borman,
Jim lovell, and William anders

00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:49.570
Around the moon.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.052
The Soviets must respond
if they are to stay in the race.

00:29:52.161 --> 00:29:54.396
The Russians answer
the challenge on

00:29:54.684 --> 00:29:57.236
January 14th, 1969, when

00:29:57.345 --> 00:30:00.362
"Soyuz 4" and "Soyuz 5" make
the world's first link-Up

00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:02.735
Between manned spacecraft.

00:30:02.847 --> 00:30:06.479
The Soviet dream of reaching
the moon is tantalizingly close.

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:11.836
But to get there they need
the massive N1 rocket.

00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:15.296
It is the only Soviet rocket
powerful enough to reach

00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:16.262
The moon.

00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:21.262
First envisaged by Korolev
in 1961, the N1 is finally ready

00:30:21.373 --> 00:30:23.714
For its first test launch eight
years later.

00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:28.928
On February 21st, 1969,
the N1 finally takes off.

00:30:29.037 --> 00:30:30.221
The N1 finally takes off.

00:30:30.332 --> 00:30:34.974
If performs beautifully
for approximately 70 seconds.

00:30:37.312 --> 00:30:41.287
With the N1 disaster,
the Soviets lose all hope

00:30:41.322 --> 00:30:44.784
Of winning the moon race,
but they still have hopes

00:30:44.819 --> 00:30:48.246
The N1 will get there before
the end of the decade.

00:30:48.394 --> 00:30:52.748
Five months later they launch
another N1.

00:30:55.674 --> 00:31:00.377
And the Soviet dream of reaching
the moon goes up in flames.

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:09.439
On July 20th, 1969, the race
to the moon ends in triump

00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:10.771
For America.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:14.870
The mysterious surface that has
fascinated humanity for so long

00:31:15.014 --> 00:31:16.524
Finally is conquered.

00:31:16.671 --> 00:31:27.562
&gt;&gt; That's one small step
for man, one giant leap

00:31:27.747 --> 00:31:28.965
For mankind.

00:31:34.794 --> 00:31:37.060
&gt;&gt; Narrator: However,
the Soviets do not give up

00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:39.081
Their dreams of glory in space.

00:31:39.228 --> 00:31:42.641
Instead they simply exchange
moon landings for space

00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:43.683
Stations.

00:31:43.863 --> 00:31:47.240
The construction of the salyut
space stations during the 1970s

00:31:47.352 --> 00:31:50.556
Becomes the burning focus
of the Soviet space program.

00:31:53.323 --> 00:31:56.881
The first of Russia's space
stations is the salyut 1.

00:31:58.184 --> 00:32:02.749
This Soviet animation shows that
salyut 1 has four cylinders

00:32:02.932 --> 00:32:04.979
Of differing diameters
and lengths.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.220
Three of them are pressurized.
The fourth, which houses

00:32:08.368 --> 00:32:10.592
The propulsion unit, is open
to space.

00:32:10.774 --> 00:32:14.080
The Soviets plan to launch
the salyut space station

00:32:14.226 --> 00:32:15.229
Unmanned.

00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:19.768
Later, a three-Man crew, flying
separately aboard a spacecraft

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.248
Will dock with the station.

00:32:25.921 --> 00:32:29.803
In April 1971 the world's first
space station is successfully

00:32:29.982 --> 00:32:31.419
Put into orbit.

00:32:40.843 --> 00:32:45.050
Having reached orbit
successfully, the station is

00:32:45.198 --> 00:32:46.883
Ready for its first occupants.

00:32:48.684 --> 00:32:53.320
Vladislav volkov, georgi
dobrovolski and viktor patsayev

00:32:53.468 --> 00:32:55.446
Will be the "salyut 1"'s first
visitors.

00:32:56.954 --> 00:33:00.373
In order for all three to fit
into the "Soyuz 11" they must

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:02.458
Leave behind their pressurized
suits.

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:05.405
The Soviets had been sending
cosmonauts into space this w

00:33:05.586 --> 00:33:07.564
Since "voskhad 1."

00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:10.949
It's a big risk, but they're out
to make history.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:17.170
On June 6th, 1971, the three
cosmonauts are launched

00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:20.165
In "Soyuz 11" from the baikonur
cosmodrome.

00:33:32.533 --> 00:33:37.275
"Soyuz 11" docks successfully
with the salyut station.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:40.764
&gt;&gt; This mission was the first
time the Russians had had

00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:43.280
A space station up there.
The whole country, from kiev

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.887
To vladivostok, had been
thrilled to watch these guys

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:51.416
On television for weeks.

00:33:51.565 --> 00:33:53.609
They came to know them,
they knew each of them.

00:33:53.756 --> 00:33:57.888
&gt;&gt; Narrator: After
an unprecedented 23 days

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.915
In space, it is time
for the 3 cosmonauts to come

00:34:01.062 --> 00:34:04.799
&gt;&gt; They had contact up until,
basically, the moment

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:08.177
Of retrofire, the valve that was
supposed to open in the lower

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:13.140
Atmosphere to let fresh air
in opened earlier, and let

00:34:13.252 --> 00:34:15.485
The life-Sustaining air out.

00:34:15.665 --> 00:34:19.079
The air whistled out of that
space craft in the space

00:34:19.192 --> 00:34:19.975
Of about 30, 40 seconds.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:24.076
&gt;&gt; And as a result, the capsule
was depressurized, patsayev

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.843
Actually got out of his seat
and recognized what the problem

00:34:26.954 --> 00:34:29.036
Was but was unable to close it
fast enough.

00:34:29.184 --> 00:34:31.706
&gt;&gt; And when the rescue crews
came to open up the capsule,

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:34.112
They wondered why everything was
so quiet, there were no radio

00:34:34.224 --> 00:34:36.807
Communications going on.
And they found these three men

00:34:36.956 --> 00:34:40.015
Just strapped in their seats,
just lying there.

00:34:41.853 --> 00:34:44.944
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The cosmonauts
cannot be revived.

00:34:45.123 --> 00:34:49.266
Without pressure suits,
their blood has literally

00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:51.172
Boiled.

00:34:51.314 --> 00:34:53.866
The Soviets have lost
the dangerous gamble to fly

00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:55.135
Without pressure suits.

00:34:55.244 --> 00:34:58.871
By the three cosmonauts
and their families.

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:10.132
The Soviets would startle
the world by agreeing to a joint

00:35:10.273 --> 00:35:13.698
The united states.

00:35:13.808 --> 00:35:17.402
For the U.S., it would be
the last of the historic

00:35:17.509 --> 00:35:18.875
"Apollo" missions.

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:22.729
The world's first docking
between spacecraft from two

00:35:22.874 --> 00:35:26.900
Different nations is complet
on July 17th, 1975.

00:35:27.046 --> 00:35:29.497
&gt;&gt; It was a soft docking.
&gt;&gt; Ha ha!

00:35:29.674 --> 00:35:32.085
They're secured.

00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:37.829
&gt;&gt; Glad to see you here.

00:35:38.438 --> 00:35:44.170
&gt;&gt; Narrator: The hostility
between the superpowers that has

00:35:44.282 --> 00:35:48.952
Cost so many lives and so much
money is dissolved in the good

00:35:49.095 --> 00:35:50.137
Will of the moment.

00:35:54.925 --> 00:35:57.802
&gt;&gt; Narrator: By the 1980s,
the Soviet visits

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.299
To their salyut space stations
had become almost routine.

00:36:01.435 --> 00:36:02.761
Had become almost routine.

00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:08.162
On September 26th, 1983,
"Soyuz t10" is rolled out

00:36:08.281 --> 00:36:11.900
To the launch pad as cosmonauts
vladimir titov and

00:36:11.979 --> 00:36:15.611
Gennadi strekalov anxiously
await an evening liftoff.

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:18.558
&gt;&gt; During the last minute
of the countdown, a fire broke

00:36:18.629 --> 00:36:21.432
Out at the base of their "Soyuz"
launch vehicle.

00:36:21.576 --> 00:36:24.065
Both titov and strekalov have
said that they were sitting

00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:27.334
There knowing, they could see
flames rising, they knew

00:36:27.445 --> 00:36:29.887
Something was wrong, but nothing
was really happening.

00:36:30.066 --> 00:36:32.403
They had to wait for a launch
control team to initiate

00:36:32.582 --> 00:36:33.445
The abort.

00:36:33.556 --> 00:36:36.939
So it was a nerve-wracking
20 seconds waiting.

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.880
"When are they going to get us
t of here?"

00:36:39.058 --> 00:36:44.701
And the automatic escape system,
which had never been tested

00:36:44.849 --> 00:36:47.400
With people on board, got
its test.

00:36:47.544 --> 00:36:50.563
The solid rocket motor
on the front of the "Soyuz"

00:36:50.713 --> 00:36:53.690
Fired, pulling the vehicle,
I think, about four

00:36:53.801 --> 00:36:55.090
Or five miles high.

00:36:55.238 --> 00:36:59.761
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Cosmonauts titov
and strekalov have come within

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.386
Moments of a fiery death.

00:37:01.496 --> 00:37:05.735
While both will fly again
on later, successful missions,

00:37:05.845 --> 00:37:09.186
This aborted launch is ner
officially recognized.

00:37:12.167 --> 00:37:16.269
As the 1980s continue, so does
NASA's new space shuttle, as it

00:37:16.382 --> 00:37:18.787
Replaces the old "Saturn 5"
workhorse.

00:37:18.933 --> 00:37:23.024
For the first time in six years,
Americans are going into space.

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:34.675
&gt;&gt; Four, three, two, one, zero.
&gt;&gt; And we have liftoff.

00:37:34.787 --> 00:37:37.944
Liftoff of America's first space
shuttle.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:41.366
&gt;&gt; Narrator: While the shuttle
is perceived as a great success,

00:37:41.502 --> 00:37:44.160
The reality is that it's much
more expensive than

00:37:44.271 --> 00:37:45.821
The "Saturn 5" to operate.

00:37:46.004 --> 00:37:47.725
The "Saturn 5" to operate.
And many in NASA think it's

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.059
A costly mistake.

00:37:49.197 --> 00:37:52.863
However, this doesn't keep
the Soviets from craving shuttle

00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:54.123
Technology.

00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:58.971
&gt;&gt; The key member of ... Who was
responsible for military

00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:05.123
Industrial complex, he said,
"there is one critical argument.

00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:07.137
Americans are doing it.

00:38:07.315 --> 00:38:09.002
Americans are doing it.
Do you think they e stupid?

00:38:09.149 --> 00:38:10.188
Do you think they e stupid?

00:38:10.301 --> 00:38:14.328
They are very pragmatic,
and if they are doing it, it

00:38:14.468 --> 00:38:18.054
Means that they know something
else.

00:38:18.132 --> 00:38:20.176
Let's follow their example. "

00:38:20.358 --> 00:38:24.101
&gt;&gt; NarratoR: Rumors began that
the reason for the remarkable

00:38:24.245 --> 00:38:28.805
Similarity between the U.S.
Space shuttle and Soviet "buran"

00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:31.319
Is not engineering,
but espionage.

00:38:31.571 --> 00:38:36.421
&gt;&gt; I've seen their "buran,"
which is the title they use

00:38:36.608 --> 00:38:40.766
For their shuttle, and it does
look very much like our shuttle.

00:38:41.056 --> 00:38:45.337
I suspect that they probably had
drawings.

00:38:45.554 --> 00:38:48.283
And they were never classified,
I don't think they would have

00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:49.540
Been very hard to get.

00:38:49.732 --> 00:38:52.737
I would be hard-Pressed to say
they stole them ...

00:38:52.848 --> 00:38:55.109
In fact, if they wrote in,
we might have sent them to them.

00:38:55.362 --> 00:38:58.593
I think they have very capable
engineers if they could develop

00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:01.360
A system like that, but I don't
think they did.

00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.658
&gt;&gt; I believe it was designed
independently.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:12.130
And even if its shape looks
familiar, you know, the shape is

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:14.501
Dictated by aerodynamics.

00:39:14.716 --> 00:39:20.789
&gt;&gt; The Soviet shuttle flew once.
Now it's in a city park

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:21.837
In Moscow.

00:39:21.913 --> 00:39:22.986
It's in gorky park.

00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:24.172
Basically, they ran out
of money.

00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:27.476
I mean, at a time where
in 1990 their budget started

00:39:27.588 --> 00:39:30.207
Going steeply down, the "buran"
was just eating up a lot

00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:31.142
Of money.

00:39:31.263 --> 00:39:34.016
And so, as a result, it's
sitting in a park right now.

00:39:34.164 --> 00:39:37.284
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Soviet resources go
instead to their

00:39:37.394 --> 00:39:41.127
Third-Generation space station.
It's called "mir," meaning

00:39:41.237 --> 00:39:42.349
Peace.

00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:49.358
On February 20th, 1986, "mir" is
successfully launched.

00:39:52.128 --> 00:39:56.045
"Mir" has six docking ports,
which allow unmanned scientific

00:39:56.153 --> 00:39:58.161
Modules to dock with
the station.

00:39:58.238 --> 00:39:59.601
It's remarkably flexible.

00:39:59.712 --> 00:40:03.191
Modules can return to earth when
their missions are complete

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.224
To be replaced by new modules
carrying different experiments.

00:40:08.408 --> 00:40:11.569
While the Russians were able
to fund the initial construction

00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:15.450
Of "mir," the cosmonauts have
had to result to some unusual

00:40:15.666 --> 00:40:17.604
Capitalist antics to keep it
afloat.

00:40:18.234 --> 00:40:22.167
&gt;&gt; The Russian cosmonauts these
days have a really difficult

00:40:22.311 --> 00:40:23.389
And ironic job.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.479
They're asked to do
an increasing number of kind

00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:31.005
Of really cheap things, like
milk commercls and things.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:32.845
And they hate it.

00:40:32.956 --> 00:40:35.072
And you can understand that.
They're cosmonauts.

00:40:35.145 --> 00:40:36.903
They shouldn't have to do milk
commercials.

00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:41.788
&gt;&gt; Discovering a magnificent
picture of "mir" crossing

00:40:41.863 --> 00:40:42.721
The horizon.

00:40:42.832 --> 00:40:45.596
&gt;&gt; Narrator: "Mir" was meant
to last only five years.

00:40:45.672 --> 00:40:48.759
It is now approaching
its 13th birthday and is

00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:52.465
Fighting the American perception
that it's outdated equipment

00:40:52.574 --> 00:40:54.441
Ready for the cosmic junk yard.

00:40:54.592 --> 00:40:56.991
&gt;&gt; Certainly a lot of things
broke.

00:40:57.102 --> 00:41:02.128
The Soviets, or the Russians
now, have demonstrated that

00:41:02.312 --> 00:41:06.260
They can improvise when problems
come up.

00:41:06.408 --> 00:41:10.283
Now, often, they do it in ways
that makes us very nervous.

00:41:10.463 --> 00:41:14.638
And the risk they take is quite
often more than we would like

00:41:14.821 --> 00:41:15.716
To take.

00:41:16.005 --> 00:41:18.410
&gt;&gt; When something goes wrong up
there, ever since 1971,

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.811
They have to fix it up there.

00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:22.506
And that's given them
an expertise and sort of seat

00:41:22.651 --> 00:41:25.234
of the pants repairs that
Americans have only read

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:26.096
About in books.

00:41:26.173 --> 00:41:29.399
And it's the one thing that
people in NASA are kind

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.092
Of sniping and making snide
comments about how the Russian

00:41:33.278 --> 00:41:35.146
program is falling apart.
It's the one thing that

00:41:35.253 --> 00:41:36.870
It's the one thing that
we really realize that

00:41:36.945 --> 00:41:38.307
The Russians have over us is
that type of experience.

00:41:40.389 --> 00:41:44.665
&gt;&gt; Narrator: In the 1990s,
the strengths of both

00:41:44.813 --> 00:41:48.768
The Russian and American space
programs would finally come

00:41:48.879 --> 00:41:50.241
Programs would finally come
together.

00:41:50.387 --> 00:41:54.551
By may 2001, the 2 nations,
along with 14 other countries,

00:41:54.707 --> 00:41:58.979
Woulcomplete the world's first
international space station.

00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:05.006
The Soviet space program led
the race to the moon

00:42:05.152 --> 00:42:11.082
From 1957 to 1967, but due
to the program setbacks,

00:42:11.232 --> 00:42:15.180
The technological advancements
of the united states ultimately

00:42:15.327 --> 00:42:17.009
Prevailed.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.681
But despite the bitter cold war,
the universal quest

00:42:21.828 --> 00:42:23.739
For knowledge endured.

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:27.930
Today, global cooperation
in space is a reality.
