00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.711
Shekhar Kapur: I’m very fascinated by what you

00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:50.468
because there’s a lot of construction going on here.

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:51.882
It’s almost like, you know, there’s a

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:54.240
Sadhguru: A whole humanity is in construction. (Laughs)

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.366
Shekhar Kapur: Okay. Alright. I’ll buy that. I’ll buy that.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.710
So, Sadhguru, this is a temple that,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.583
I know you told me that, it will last thousands of years, and there

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:06.077
it’s a feminine temple.

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:12.960
It’s a temple devoted to the female aspect, not only of us, but the whole existence,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.195
the feminine aspect of existence.

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:18.421
So, tell me about this. This is not man, woman. What is it?

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:21.020
Sadhguru: What is feminine? What is masculine?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.790
See, you need to understand this.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.223
Human understanding comes from a certain perception,

00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:27.762
a limited perception.

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:30.211
When I say a limited perception, right now,

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.947
your whole perception comes through your sense perception.

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:38.074
Sense organs can perceive something only if there is something to compare with.

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:40.938
for example right now… you know silence only because there is sound.

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:43.335
And you know sound only because there’s silence, isn't it?

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.854
See right now, if I show you this part of my hand, (Gestures) you can only see this.

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:48.912
You cannot see this. (Gestures)

00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:51.029
If I show you this, (Gestures) you can only see this.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:53.596
So, this is the nature of sense perception.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:58.309
Whether it’s your eyes or your ears or your smell or your taste or your touch,

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:00.552
everything is only by comparison.

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:03.530
So, the moment you perceive through sense organs,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.963
you already divided the existence.

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:10.513
So, because of the division, your mind also thinks in divisions.

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:13.259
Because without divisions you cannot perceive,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.199
without two there is no logic, so you need two.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.287
So, these two fundamental principles,

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:21.597
because we are human, we are a species with man - woman,

00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:23.048
masculine - feminine,

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:25.774
we are calling them masculine and feminine,

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:28.520
So, in this culture, they… it may be referred to as Shiva, Shakti,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.040
or in other cultures, Yin and Yang, whatever.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.722
Shekhar Kapur: So, Shiva being masculine and Shakti being feminine.

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:34.714
Sadhguru: Yes. Yes.

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:36.355
Shekhar Kapur: Why Shakti? Shakti means power.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.011
Why is that feminine? You would expect

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.532
Sadhguru: Not power, Shakti means energy.

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:41.288
Shekhar Kapur: Energy, okay.

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:44.593
Sadhguru: It’s energy. Unfortunately, because of various, you know,

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:49.547
civilizational and exploitative situations in the human societies,

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:53.954
we are thinking of energy as power and power and dominance.

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:55.446
No, energy is just energy.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.130
Without energy nothing happens.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.962
Shekhar Kapur: So, I could say this temple is… is a temple for energy.

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:02.050
Sadhguru: Feminine energy.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.550
Shekhar Kapur: Feminine energy.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.073
So, let’s go in and tell me what feminine energy is,

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:07.909
as against masculine energy.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.829
Is this what you call as leap of fate

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.346
alright from intellectualism to consciousness there is one big leap

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.409
Sadhguru: It doesn't take any fate it just needs a leg

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.796
Shekar kapur: or a broken leg okay

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.995
Sadhguru: When we say a temple, this must be understood.

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:31.968
The temple is like a body, to energize the system.

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.036
Temple is not a place of worship.

00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:38.840
Temple is not a place where you go and make appeals to some unknown God up there.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.313
This is not that kind.

00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:42.451
This is not a place where you lead a prayer.

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.177
That is the uniqueness of this culture.

00:03:44.177 --> 00:03:47.431
Here, temple is like a body, energized in a certain way.

00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:51.274
Now, if you see the masculine temple that we have is circular,

00:03:51.274 --> 00:03:54.261
circular in nature because that is the quality that it is.

00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:57.071
The feminine temple is in the form of a triangle.

00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.132
There’s a whole lot of things in its geometry,

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:01.355
how it is made.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:07.373
See, all the wings are 33 feet, properly done. in the multiples of 11.

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:11.288
It is made in a certain way to create a feminine energy there.

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:12.998
Why 33?

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:16.155
If you go into these details, there’s enormous amount of science behind that.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:19.286
Like your spinal column is 33 aspects, and

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:24.276
Shekhar Kapur: Which I just risked right now, (Sadhguru Laughs) because… okay.

00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:28.290
Sadhguru: So, there are so many aspects to this, which I don’t wish to go right now,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.280
but essentially, it is feminine energy.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.090
Where was the need for this, in a way?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.600
See, one thing is today,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.145
the feminine is at huge risk on the planet.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.140
So, immediately, people may think,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.343
‘Oh, that’s because of the man.’

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:45.330
Maybe man instigated it,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.830
but when I say masculine and feminine,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.770
I’m not talking about male, female.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.799
I’m talking about those two aspects,

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:54.011
those two dimensions of life, without which,

00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.884
our life will not be beautiful;

00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:59.680
our life cannot work actually, even in the most fundamental way.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.156
So, because people start thinking in terms of dominance,

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:04.516
this is a problem.

00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:08.163
If you’re not looking at life as dominance,

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:11.170
if you’re looking at life as integration,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.147
if you’re looking at life as cooperation,

00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:15.051
if you’re looking at life as oneness,

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:18.501
then without these two dimensions, there is no existence.

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.957
But unfortunately, societies have taken on to this,

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:24.073
as to who is dominating right now,

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.058
whether masculine or feminine

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.754
If any one of them dominates, it’ll turn ugly.

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:32.659
It is not that if masculine dominates it will turn ugly or

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.290
feminine dominates it will turn ugly.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.613
If any one of them dominates it will turn ugly.

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:39.175
Above all, if you start thinking in terms of dominance,

00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:40.772
your life will turn ugly.

00:05:40.772 --> 00:05:42.943
By domination, you will not know life.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.123
Only by inclusion, you will know life.

00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:48.800
So, this is essentially to create an energy force

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.772
where people can experience a powerful sense of feminine,

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:55.680
a fiery nature of the feminine thing.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.365
See, feminine is a very fiery form of energy.

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:06.031
But today, because we have made economics the most important aspect of human societies,

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.131
naturally

00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.880
see, we need to understand this,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.447
economics is being glorified as if it’s some kind of a divine thing;

00:06:12.447 --> 00:06:14.974
economics (Laughs) essentially means survival,

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.352
survival process.

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:19.560
Economics has a place in our life for sure,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.085
but it is not the be all of life.

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:25.153
So, feminine doesn’t belong to that dimension.

00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:28.945
If, in these societies

00:06:28.945 --> 00:06:34.842
love, art, music, above all, aesthetics of life, was dominant in a society,

00:06:34.842 --> 00:06:38.745
if aesthetics was as important as economics,

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:41.313
nobody had to bring up the feminine,

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:46.360
feminine would be naturally exuberantly alive and manifest in the society.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.316
Today, either we have

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.937
we are slowly making all the women like men,

00:06:50.937 --> 00:06:53.272
because they have to survive, they have to earn money,

00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:54.521
they have to provide;

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:56.994
or a small percentage of them, in reaction,

00:06:56.994 --> 00:07:00.832
not being able to cope with that, they’re becoming like Barbie dolls.

00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:06.933
Here we are creating a woman who is fiery and powerful in a completely different way.

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:08.919
Shekhar Kapur: But what you're saying is,

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:11.318
you just said love, art, aesthetics,

00:07:11.318 --> 00:07:15.166
you used those three words as part of the feminine energy.

00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:16.018
Now, I’m a filmmaker.

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:20.164
I’d like to assume that I have all three in myself, so that’s my feminine energy.

00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:21.495
Sadhguru: Yes, it is.

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:22.796
Shekhar Kapur: Yes. So, what else…..

00:07:22.796 --> 00:07:24.929
Sadhguru: If you do not have the feminine,

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:28.965
you won’t look in… think in terms of what’s beautiful, what’s not beautiful.

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:31.664
You’ll only think in terms of what’s useful and what’s not useful.

00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:33.194
You will become utilitarian.

00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:34.519
The masculine is like that.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.545
Shekhar Kapur: So that’s, so I’m

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:38.217
Sadhguru: So, you being a man or a woman has nothing to do with it.

00:07:38.217 --> 00:07:41.107
Shekhar Kapur: So, am I in conflict constantly between my masculine and feminine self.

00:07:41.107 --> 00:07:42.867
Sadhguru: Why… see, that’s the whole thing.

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:46.048
These two energies are the basis of creation,

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:47.788
why would they be in conflict?

00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:50.813
They’re in absolute collaboration.

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:53.966
It is only in human mind that it’s in conflict.

00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:55.955
In life, it’s not in conflict.

00:07:55.955 --> 00:07:57.709
In energy, it’s not in conflict.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.121
Only in… in mind it’s in conflict because mind divides.

00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.354
Shekhar Kapur: Because to people who were listening to you say

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:09.050
the sheer, absolute power of the feminine energy, they don’t relate to that the

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.160
they … see feminine energy is something gentle, nurturing, soft.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.067
Sadhguru: No, no, no.

00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:14.680
Shekhar Kapur: Tell me about the power of feminine energy

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.271
Sadhguru: See

00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:18.266
Shekhar Kapur: …because a lot of our culture talks about various goddesses

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:21.863
that have a sense of huge power and almost violent power.

00:08:21.863 --> 00:08:26.560
Sadhguru: (Laughs) See, the original Goddesses that we created in this culture were all Kali,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.330
Bhairavi,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.235
now she’s Bhairavi; all fierce, powerful creatures, okay?

00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:37.263
Somewhere down the line when the outside influences came upon the culture

00:08:37.263 --> 00:08:39.400
and people made fun of them,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.639
people ridiculed ‘Your women are like this?’ (Laughs)

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:45.057
Then they tried to domesticate the feminine.

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:52.680
And then they created Saraswati, Lakshmi, very soft, gentle, housewife kind of feminine.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.050
Bhairavi, you can’t contain her to the limitations of your

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.000
not that she’s… she cannot stay in your house;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.755
you cannot contain her to the boundaries of your house.

00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:04.907
She’s… she is all-encompassing.

00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:06.045
That’s the nature of her.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.793
That’s the nature of the feminine, that it’s all-embracing,

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:11.224
not all-conquering, you must understand.

00:09:11.224 --> 00:09:13.567
Man wants to be in conquest.

00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:15.490
A woman wants to embrace.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.840
By conquest, you will never have it.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.995
By embrace, you will have it, isn't it?

00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:24.952
Sadhguru: Yes. See now, now it’s come to a point where the work has become almost feminine. Okay?

00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:27.694
You have… you need gentle hands to do what they’re doing.

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:31.233
But before that, this rock was in the quarry, okay?

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:35.042
There you needed some hard tools to cut it, make it a big piece,

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:37.552
transport it on the truck, bring it in, hold it there,

00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:38.888
cut it down to size.

00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:40.611
All that was very masculine.

00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:42.594
If that masculine work had not happened,

00:09:42.594 --> 00:09:45.399
this feminine part would be not possible.

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:47.732
This is so in the society also, I want you to see.

00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:52.614
If the man goes about, breaks down nature, builds his home and all this,

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:55.728
then the woman comes in and makes it beautiful.

00:09:55.728 --> 00:10:01.660
If she didn’t come in, he would just have a rock house which is of (Laughs) no consequence.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.263
Nobody enjoys being there.

00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:05.306
They’ll have a house, and they’ll live outdoor.

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:08.974
It’s happening in cultures where feminine has been suppressed.

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:12.935
They have great homes, but they always want to be outdoors. (Both Laugh)

00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:17.329
Shekhar Kapur: it’s a good place to talk about what consecration means.

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.664
What does consecration mean? (Sadhguru Laughs) What do you consecrate?

00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:24.148
I mean, what is that… what is that process and what does it achieve?

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:28.388
Sadhguru: See, this is happening everywhere around you all the time.

00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:31.731
One form of existence, or one form of energy,

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.943
is transforming itself into another.

00:10:34.943 --> 00:10:41.672
What is mud is becoming flower, fruit and food, isn't it?

00:10:41.672 --> 00:10:45.128
What is filth is actually becoming a flower.

00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:48.075
What is stink is becoming fragrance.

00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:49.431
It’s happening.

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:52.612
If you eat the food, this food becomes,

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:58.634
from what was just a grain of rice, becomes such a sophisticated machinery like human body.

00:10:58.634 --> 00:11:04.182
So, if you make mud into food, you call it agriculture.

00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:09.172
If you make food into this, (Ref to body) you call it digestion.

00:11:09.172 --> 00:11:15.895
If we make this into mud, usually we call it cremation, (Both Laugh) or burial and whatever.

00:11:15.895 --> 00:11:19.633
So, if you can make a stone or some other gross substance,

00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:23.295
a material substance, into a divine reverberance,

00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:26.549
into highest, subtlest possible reverberance,

00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:28.276
that’s called consecration.

00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:32.182
So, the whole existence is doing it all the time in different levels.

00:11:32.182 --> 00:11:35.087
So, this is a certain science and a technology through which

00:11:35.087 --> 00:11:39.077
you transform the grosser elements into finer elements.

00:11:39.077 --> 00:11:43.364
Unfortunately, this was always mistaken as producing gold.

00:11:43.364 --> 00:11:46.671
The alchemy of the West is always talking about producing gold.

00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:51.289
Gold has no worth except in the market, okay?

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.545
It’s only greed which makes a man go towards gold.

00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:56.786
The Indian alchemy never talked about making gold.

00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:02.082
Indian alchemy always talked about making grosser elements into finer substances,

00:12:02.082 --> 00:12:05.477
making a stone into the divine.

00:12:05.477 --> 00:12:08.894
So, the whole Indian alchemy is like a consecration process.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:12.006
Sadhguru: See, right now, there is an agricultural science, right?

00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:12.886
Shekhar Kapur: Yeah.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.958
Sadhguru: They will teach you how to study the soil,

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.535
the qualities of the soil, the seed, the manure, everything.

00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:22.348
So, they only set those conditions,

00:12:22.348 --> 00:12:24.196
They will set the soil conditions;

00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:25.479
they’ll set the seed condition;

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.334
everything else that’s necessary to grow.

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:31.150
But the growth itself, the transforming earth into food,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.277
that, no scientist does.

00:12:34.277 --> 00:12:36.429
That is happening by nature.

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:39.647
Here also, the same thing. We have a whole science.

00:12:39.647 --> 00:12:42.790
If we set all these conditions, the gross becomes subtle.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.776
So, when I was building something,

00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:51.567
and this was my first project. I’m building a farm in… near Mysore,

00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:55.875
and I’m doing it with a real short shoe string.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:59.809
So when I wanna, in… in the end, I wanna paint it.

00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:04.433
And I don’t have the thing to get painters to paint this large wall surface.

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:08.310
So, I want to paint it, and it takes too much time to go like this; (Gestures)

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.313
so what I do, I dip, hold it here (Gestures) and just walk.

00:13:11.313 --> 00:13:15.552
One smear of paint (Laughs) from this end to that end, that end to this end.

00:13:15.552 --> 00:13:18.740
The first smear that I did, I dipped and walked like this. (Gestures)

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:24.821
Here, the smear was thick. As it went, it became lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter and became really subtle.

00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:28.109
I just looked at this and I burst into tears.

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.556
That was one great moment of realization for me.

00:13:31.556 --> 00:13:33.047
This is the whole creation.

00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:35.995
From a rock to divine, this is all the thing is.

00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:38.466
It’s either dense or it’s subtle.

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:41.633
That’s all it is. It’s the same existence everywhere.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:46.481
Whether you look at the Earth or you look at your body or you look at what you call as Divine,

00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:48.736
it is all the same substance.

00:13:48.736 --> 00:13:51.392
It is just getting subtler.

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:54.831
And whatever we are creating as divine is just that -

00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:58.067
making a rock into a subtler form of energy.

00:13:58.067 --> 00:14:02.184
Every substance on the planet is exuding a certain kind of energy,

00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:05.096
reverberation, which is a scientific fact.

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:07.161
You can change the way it exudes,

00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:09.779
what type of energy it exudes, you can change that.

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:14.918
Altering that to a very subtle and useful form of energy is consecration process.

00:14:14.918 --> 00:14:17.069
So, temples were energy forms,

00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:20.289
temples were energy places where every day in the morning,

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:23.453
before you start your day, you go sit there for some time,

00:14:23.453 --> 00:14:26.571
imbibe this energy and go into the world.

00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:28.711
Why this became necessary is,

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:33.256
see, once you step into the world, for a ordinary person, a common man,

00:14:33.256 --> 00:14:37.168
every transaction in the world, whatever it may be,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.844
what is your profit is somebody’s loss;

00:14:39.844 --> 00:14:41.991
what is somebody’s profit is your loss.

00:14:41.991 --> 00:14:44.831
whether it’s family transaction, between husband and wife,

00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:45.858
father and son,

00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:48.483
business partners or every transaction

00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:51.221
there’s something to give, something to take everywhere.

00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:53.985
That’s why it’s a transaction.

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:57.556
So, if you’re not sufficiently lubricated in your

00:14:57.556 --> 00:14:58.980
the way you are,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.361
every transaction is a point of friction, a possible friction.

00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.224
There are some people who are making every (Laughs) transaction into a friction.

00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:09.246
Some people are conducting their transactions gracefully.

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:12.278
So, everyday going sitting in the temple was just this -

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.589
you already well lubricated;

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:17.986
when you step out you can pass through the world with least amount of friction.

00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:23.238
So, this is a very very significant instruction which is still alive in the southern part of this country.

00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:25.352
Here, nobody tells you if you go to the temple,

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:26.022
you should pray.

00:15:26.022 --> 00:15:28.942
They always tell you if you go there, you must sit there;

00:15:28.942 --> 00:15:31.286
you must sit there for some time and come.

00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:33.214
But today, the instruction has become like this,

00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:35.598
the way they are following it is, they touch their bottom to the floor,

00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:36.973
and they go.

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:38.698
Nobody told you, you have to pray.

00:15:38.698 --> 00:15:40.376
Nobody told you, you have to make a offering.

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:42.363
You just have to sit there.

00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:46.622
But they also told that people on the spiritual path need not go to the temple.

00:15:46.622 --> 00:15:49.311
Because they have self-charging mechanisms.

00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:51.901
So, temple is essentially for a householder

00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:55.116
who has no his own way of transforming his own energies -

00:15:55.116 --> 00:15:58.030
Use a public place; a battery charging place it is.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.914
So, this is feminine energy;

00:15:59.914 --> 00:16:01.144
it’s triangular.

00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:04.148
That’s… whole temple is triangular,

00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:06.466
it's an equilateral triangle okay?

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:10.982
There are many aspects of the geometry which I don't want to go in

00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:12.491
but the significant aspect is

00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:16.559
another triangle fitting into this in a smaller capacity..

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:20.247
so a downward triangle is

00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:21.582
this downward triangle

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.180
always symbolizes the feminine.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.497
The upward moving triangle symbolizes the masculine.

00:16:27.497 --> 00:16:34.018
but here normally it would be depicted like this.

00:16:34.018 --> 00:16:36.724
Okay, this is also the Star of David and whatever else,

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:40.416
the star is used, and this is the basic yanta for Shri Chakra and everything.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.487
This is the masculine and feminine meeting.

00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:47.206
But here, the masculine is held inside the feminine triangle,

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:50.625
because here, the masculine is unborn.

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.782
It’s in the womb of the feminine.

00:16:53.782 --> 00:16:56.523
So, it’s a smaller triangle held inside.

00:16:56.523 --> 00:16:59.240
It is not a larger triangle like a male meeting the female.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.108
This is like in the womb.

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:04.011
The masculine is a child in the feminine’s womb

00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:06.508
because here the feminine is in a dominant form.

00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:10.280
So, those… there’s a whole geometry of things into, in this,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.749
where we are trying to build a body of the feminine

00:17:13.749 --> 00:17:16.138
to energize it in a certain way.

00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:18.486
So, Devi will sit here.

00:17:18.486 --> 00:17:20.139
This is also a triangle,

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:21.728
and this is into the Earth.

00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.692
Here, there are steps going in.

00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:27.404
Being in the Earth is very important for the feminine.

00:17:27.404 --> 00:17:31.013
So, the deity herself is going into the Earth,

00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:33.395
and people have to go in to meet her.

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.858
That’s how it is.

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:40.400
And there are lots of symbolisms attached and geometry involved in this whole process.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.576
In the end, today you have walked in,

00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:43.939
it’s like a construction site.

00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:46.141
After two months, you walk into this space,

00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:47.790
forget about the ambience,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.236
walk with your eyes closed,

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:51.542
you will see it’ll just hit you in your face,

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:53.966
the whole energy of it. That’s how it will be.
