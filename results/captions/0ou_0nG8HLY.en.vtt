00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.410
With the execution of Order 66 and the Sith’s
successful takeover of the galaxy, the Jedi

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.070
were forced into hiding.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.309
The Empire’s official public policy on the
Jedi was to kill them all, but privately Palpatine

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.699
wished to convert some of the remaining Jedi
to become his dark side servants, as he did

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.480
with Anakin Skywalker.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.789
So here are 5 other prominent Jedi that were
converted to the dark side and joined the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240
Galactic Empire.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.310
First we have Antinnis Tremayne.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.100
He was originally a Jedi padawan and the apprentice
of Jedi Master Dav Kylanu.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.570
During his time as a Jedi he was fascinated
by the dark side and the potential power it

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.570
could offer him.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.579
A fascination that was amplified when he fought
during the Clone Wars, a war that deeply affected

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.940
him as he saw thousands die around him, with
his own Master eventually being killed in

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.940
battle.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.350
He was later captured and held prisoner until
the war was over.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.019
After the war, Antinnis was taken to the deep
core world Byss along with many other captured

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.360
Jedi padawans and Agricultural Corps members,
which were Jedi that never got picked by a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.310
master and instead used their powers to grow
food rather than fight.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.350
Once there he and the others were put to a
test by Darth Vader himself.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.170
Vader was ordered by Palpatine to find worthy
students to be trained as the Empire’s newly

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.110
created Inquisitors, who would be tasked in
hunting down remaining Jedi.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.810
The test involved the Jedi being given wooden
staffs and then being forced to fight Vader.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.360
Vader was able to beat down pretty much all
the padawans and Agricultural Core members

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.479
with relative ease, mocking them and bragging
about how he destroyed their Order.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.140
During the test, Antinnis took a risk and
pushed one of the buttons on Vader’s suit,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.729
which caused the Sith Lord’s breathing system
to shut down.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.860
Although such an act only caused Vader to
gasp for a few seconds before he turned the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.119
function back on, it did impress him, causing
him to pick Antinnis and a few others to become

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.119
Inquisitors.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.100
Now chosen to become an Inquisitor, Antinnis
was trained in the dark side of the force

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.710
by Darth Vader.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.250
Once fully trained Antinnis became a spokesman
for the New Order’s youth group and carried

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.410
out his duties as one of the Emperor’s enforcers.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.970
Though whenever he came across a Jedi Antinnis
always tried to persuade them to join him

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.669
and the Empire, arguing that what he was doing
was the exact same thing what the Jedi did

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.140
of the past but in a new uniform.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.989
Most Jedi refused, but some did join, including
Jedi Master Jerec who later became a prominent

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.970
Inquisitor himself.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.940
Overtime Antinnis was promoted to High Inquisitor
for his work and was even thought to be one

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.880
day an Emperor’s Hand, a personal servant
of Palpatine.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.889
But not everything went well for him as during
his fight against Jedi knight Corwin Shelvay,

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.690
Antinnis lost his arm and right eye.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.570
As a result he had to undergo surgery, to
which Vader purposely made sure that he received

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.040
some of the more unattractive prosthetics
as a means to lessen the Inquisitors large

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.810
ego and to make him look more menacing, as
before he was somewhat of a soft spoken and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.200
kind man.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.900
But the surgery changed that for the worse.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.820
By the time of the Rebellion, Antinnis was
considered to be one of the Empire’s most

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.440
powerful and dangerous Inquisitors.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.030
He was assigned the Imperial Star Destroyer
named the Interrogator and was known to treat

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.200
his crewman poorly, executing all those that
didn’t fulfil their duty perfectly.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.630
Despite this he was often successful in chasing
down and destroying local Rebel cells within

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.329
star systems, and he was renowned for being
one of the best interrogators within the ranks

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.760
of the Empire.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.920
Later he helped Vader stop a coup against
Palpatine lead by Grand Admiral Demetrius

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.000
Zaarin.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.120
After that he was tasked in hunting down a
former Inquisitor named Adalric Brandl who

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.100
had defected from the Empire.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.280
When the Empire started to fall apart following
Palpatine and Vader’s deaths on the second

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.870
death star, Antinnis joined the Imperial Remnant
known as the Empire Reborn which was created

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.530
by fellow dark Jedi.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.540
He didn’t really do much after that other
than discover and reveal the Valley of the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.540
Jedi to the leader of the Empire Reborn, which
was a place that was immensely strong in the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.770
force.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.419
Second we have Jerec, a male Miraluka, a species
that were born blind, but were able to see

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.759
through the force.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.320
As a Jedi padawan, he was the apprentice of
Jedi Master Jocasta Nu.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.060
Over the years, Jerec became more and more
obsessed with obtaining knowledge and exposing

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.950
himself to ancient lore.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.090
By the time he was a Jedi Master, he believed
he had already learned all that the Jedi had

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.510
to offer, and that him staying in the light
limited his potential in gaining more knowledge

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.880
of the force.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.820
He was later sent to a mission in the Unknown
Regions to collect ancient lost artifacts

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.460
before the clone wars.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.100
He would remain there for the entire war and
later during the execution of order 66.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.880
When he returned to the main galaxy, he was
captured by the Inquisitor Antinnis Tremayne,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.260
who gave Jerec the choice: join the empire
or die.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.460
Seeing an opportunity to finally learn from
the dark side, Jerec eagerly joined and became

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.770
an Inquisitor himself.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.140
As an Inquisitor, Jerec was successful in
locating surviving Jedi and turning them to

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.340
the dark side.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.640
As a reward for his successes, he was allowed
to pursue sith lore, along with all the Jedi

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.840
lore within the Jedi archives to his heart’s
content.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.310
As a result he became one of the Empire’s
most knowledgeable Sith scholars.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
As he grew stronger, he believed that he deserved
to be Emperor Palpatine’s apprentice, and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.580
that Darth Vader was unworthy as a Sith Lord.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.340
Some time after coming to that conclusion,
he believed that he should be the Emperor.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.750
So he began to consolidate as much power as
he could within the Empire in an effort to

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.990
one day overthrow Palpatine.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.640
He did this by converting the Empire’s Dark
side adepts to be more loyal to him rather

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.000
than to Palpatine, in return for more power
once he became Emperor.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.311
He also used his position as a High Inquisitor
to influence financial backers and convince

00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.420
them to fund him, which in turn made Jerec
into a billionaire.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.990
But despite his ambition and plot to take
over the Empire, Emperor Palpatine was more

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.460
than aware of what he was trying to do.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.889
As a consequence he removed Jerec’s access
to Sith Lore and would put loyal Imperials

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.400
to oversee the High Inquisitor’s actions,
including Grand Admiral Thrawn who was at

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.710
times assigned to Jerec’s star destroyer
the Vengeance.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.300
Another great ambition of his was discovering
the Valley of the Jedi, which would have given

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.390
him immense amount of power due to the location’s
strong connection to the force.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.930
Though him discovering the valley led to his
eventual downfall as he was defeated by a

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.360
Jedi named Kyle Katarn, who went on to free
the trapped souls of the Valley which gave

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.060
the place its power.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.370
When he died Jerec’s body dissolved in a
flash of the dark side energy and he was sent

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.730
to Chaos, which was the force underworld,
also known as Hell.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.610
Third is Beyghor Sahdett.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.530
He was a Jedi Master who survived Order 66
by overpowering and cutting down the clones

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.110
that were trying to kill him.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.690
But despite his skill with the lightsaber
and force, he was eventually captured by the

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.690
Empire.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.590
As a prisoner he was taken to Palpatine along
with a few other Jedi and was ordered by the

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.190
new Emperor to fight for his survival.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.810
When he and the other Jedi refused and attempted
to attack Palpatine, he witnessed the power

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.330
of the dark side as the Sith Lord cut down
3 of them with ease.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.070
With only he and another Jedi left alive,
Beyghor attacked and killed her knowing it

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.340
was the only way he would survive.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.840
As a reward for his obedience, he was allowed
to live and became a dark side adept for the

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
empire.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.280
He served the Empire by going undercover.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.370
Pretending to be a Jedi survivor he was able
to infiltrate resistance groups that smuggled

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.700
and protected remaining Jedi.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.240
During one of his undercover missions his
true allegiance to the Sith was discovered

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.480
by a pair of Jedi who then attacked and subdued
him.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.639
The bound and gagged Dark Jedi was then discovered
by Darth Vader when he came after the same

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.190
Jedi Beyghor was infiltrating.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:07.260
When ungagged Beyghor began telling him who
he was and what his purpose was.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.660
Probably believing it was a trick or seeing
him as a potential threat, Vader cut him down.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
Fourth is Sardoth.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.330
He was a Jedi Knight and the apprentice to
Lycan, who actually fell to the darkside and

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.910
ended up introducing its power to Sardoth.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.540
Although his master was eventually arrested
for his crimes against the Jedi, Sardoth remained

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.000
in the order but the darkside he was introduced
to still lingered within him.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.930
Shortly before the clone wars, Sardoth was
contacted by Palpatine’s secret agents and

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.419
was convinced to join the Sith Lord by secretly
aiding him.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.589
As a result he was spared from Order 66 and
the Jedi Purge that ensued afterwards.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:49.210
He remained as an enforcer for the Empire
until the Sith decided to betray him for unknown

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.250
reasons.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.460
This forced him to go into hiding and change
his identity, to which he eventually ended

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.870
up operating a casino on the planet Ahakista.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:03.339
He also went on to collect illegal lightsabers
and ran an underground black market.

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:09.080
Overtime the Empire came to Ahakista to construct
a commanding post to coordinate its navy.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.860
During this time a guy named Darca came into
contact with Sardoth and he noticed that this

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.930
man held his former master’s lightsaber.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:22.040
Wishing to get it back and add it to his collection,
Sardoth attacked the rebel mercenary.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.600
This was the first time in a long time that
Sardoth had used the force in such a manner,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.050
which ended up being his undoing as Vader
was on Ahakista at the time and sensed it.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.760
He came to the tunnel that the two were dueling
in and confronted the fallen Jedi.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.730
During the duel Sardoth asked why he was betrayed
despite his loyalty, to which Vader responded

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.080
that if he was worthy then he would have remained
an ally.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.380
He then cut down Sardoth as he had done to
countless Jedi before him.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.850
Fifth is is Maw.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.720
He was a Boltrunian Jedi Knight and due to
his species nature he was an overly selfish

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.220
individual, to the point where he didn’t
even want to take a padawan because he wanted

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.350
to solely focus on himself.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.950
He was apart of the Jedi Shadow organization,
which sought out to destroy everything that

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.100
was connected to the dark side and their followers.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.950
Probably because he was on some remote planet
searching for dark side forces, he survived

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.000
Order 66 and the initial phase of the Jedi
purge.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.330
Though it wasn’t long until the Empire caught
up with him.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.401
The High Inquisitor Jerec soon tracked him
down and was able to convert him to the dark

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:29.170
side and convice him to join the Empire.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.550
He became one of Jerec’s seven dark Jedi
that were loyal to him and were tasked in

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.100
helping him find the Valley of the Jedi.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.690
At one point Jerec and the Seven Dark Jedi
were able to capture Jedi Master Qu Rahn.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.670
During their interrogation of the Jedi, Qu
Rhan was able to make a quick attack and was

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.890
successfully able to cut Maw in half before
being struck down himself.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.270
Although losing his legs, Maw was able to
survive the injury but was forced to have

00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:00.770
a repulsorlift be surgically implanted onto
his lower torso to allow movement.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.810
He was able to use the force to aide his ability
to levitate, and was eventually able to master

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.630
it to such a degree that he could use it to
his advantage during duels.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.680
Though despite this new development and mastery
of using the force to levitate in such great

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.270
speeds, Maw was defeated and killed by Jedi
Kyle Katarn.
