00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.290
We ran into each
other at a restaurant.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.420
We literally ran into--

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.100
I was sitting in my chair.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.130
Our chairs were up
against each other.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.630
Yeah.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.730
And that's when we met.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.340
And we talked for
a while that day.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.870
And I said, please
come on the show.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.810
I would love for you
to have this platform

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.570
to talk to people about
what you're doing.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.320
And I asked you about
the negativity then.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.694
I said, how are you dealing with
what's going on in the world,

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:23.610
because they were so--

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.235
I was sitting with
some other women who

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.180
were just really
angry and saying,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.410
what do we do about all this?

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.520
And you said--

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.330
We have to be joyful warriors.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.400
I decided at the
end of last year--

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.270
I was just-- there was so much
that was just creating anxiety

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.770
and depression and anger.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.620
And I just-- I was like,
I'm done with that.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.440
I'm done with that.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.750
I don't like that feeling.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.590
I don't think any of us do.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.210
And let's just go into 2018
and be joyful warriors.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.366
I like that term,
joyful warriors.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.338
Yeah.

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:58.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.240
Because as you said, we can't
just be against something.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.800
We have to be for something.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.840
That's exactly right.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.160
And then all what we're seeing--

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.090
these kids that
are just marching--

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.520
the Stoneman Douglas kids,
at the Women's March--

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.590
there's so many things
that are happening

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.122
right now where people
are taking to the streets.

00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.080
And we have to remember
it's not about fighting

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.829
against something.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.770
It's about fighting
for something.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.410
And it is fighting with a
spirit of love of country.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.160
And that's really
important to remember.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.660
Yeah.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.400
We love our country.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.300
And part of being a
patriot, love of country,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.400
is about fighting for the
ideals of our country,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.510
fighting for the
best of who we are.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510
We are a great people.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.620
We are a great country.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.290
And it is part of loving our
country to say, you know what?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.180
I believe those words we spoke
in 1776 that we are all equal

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.500
and should be treated that way.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.680
Yep.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.605
I believe those--

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:55.105
Yep.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:56.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.522 --> 00:01:57.480
I believe those things.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.250
And I will march and I will
fight to make those words true.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.611
And I will do that joyfully.

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:03.110
Yes.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.340
You will do it joyfully.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.740
And because both of your
parents are immigrants--

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.750
your father is from Jamaica
and your mother was from--

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.250
India.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.110
--India.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.050
And so with everything
that's going on--

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.530
you were elected at the same
time as Trump was elected.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.030
Yeah.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.360
OK.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.770
So you get elected as senator.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.330
Trump is elected as president.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.950
And in all that
time of everything

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.491
that's going,
especially with parents

00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.930
who were immigrants, what is
the most surprising thing that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.820
has happened to you?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.130
Well, there's a lot.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.060
And there are those moments,
like when this administration

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.750
arbitrarily made a decision
to rescind protection

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.810
to those DREAMers that
are protected by DACA--

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.630
that was one of
the lowest lights

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.110
in terms of what had happened.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.120
Yeah.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.210
These kids who are
serving in our military,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.980
they're in colleges
and universities,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.400
they are working in
Fortune 100 companies,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.260
and they are playing
by the rules--

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.770
they were vetted to see if
they've committed any crimes,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.630
if they're living
a productive life.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.090
And if they were living life
the way that we want them to,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.590
we said, we'll give
them protection.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.480
And then arbitrarily, we
took that protection away.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.170
Yeah.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.681
That is appalling to me.

00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:14.180
It is.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.120
It really-- it makes me so sad.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.390
And we need to fight for
them to be protected.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.880
And so on the topic
of those DREAMers--

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.130
I'll tell you then a
highlight of the experience

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.310
that I've had as a
United States senator.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.720
Walking the halls of the United
States Congress and seeing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.510
thousands of DREAMers
who have been traveling

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.770
to our nation's capitol
by bus, by train, by car--

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.110
god only knows how they're
affording to get there--

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.760
I am certain that
they are sleeping

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.820
10 deep on someone's living
room floor while they're there.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.940
And they are there every
day walking the halls,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.930
truly believing that if the
members of the United States

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.590
Congress see them and hear
their stories, that we'll

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.910
do the right thing.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.460
These kids believe
in our democracy.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.760
That's a beautiful thing.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.970
Yeah.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.469
Yeah.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.799
That's a beautiful thing.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.204
Yeah.

00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:08.495
So we have to do right by them.

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:08.995
Yeah.

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:09.551
That's right.

00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.051
Yeah.

00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:10.740
That's right.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.620
But I see them, like I see
so many of these other kids,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.470
as being our future.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.500
And so I say our future
is bright because they

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.060
do believe in our democracy.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.700
They do believe if they
are heard and seen,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.860
that it will matter and
that people will listen.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.540
Yeah.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.970
And I think that
these kids that are--

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.010
the march that just
happened in Washington--

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.910
Yeah.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.220
--they will make a difference.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.604
First of all, they're going
to be eligible to vote soon.

00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:36.270
And they can make
changes if they're not

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.710
happy with what's going on.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.289
It's been happening for a
while, where people have put it

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.330
out there that you might
be running for president

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.121
or that they want you
to run for president.

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:44.965
Yeah.

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:46.590
You're probably not
going to answer me.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.964
But I'm going to
ask you, anyway.

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:50.040
You're right on both counts.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.760
You won't answer?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.600
I'm not going to answer.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.810
No.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.506
What-- then--

00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:52.950
But here's why--

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.270
Let me see what your
answer is, though.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.700
Let me tell you why.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.590
Will you run for president?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.090
OK.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.120
Let me tell you that--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.469
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:59.260
What's your answer?

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.020
So here's my answer.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.620
Right now, we are in the
early months of 2018.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.350
And at this very
moment in time, there

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.930
are people across America
who have priorities

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.470
around their health care,
have priorities around

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.050
can they get through the end
of the month and pay the bills,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.410
pay off their student loans,
can they afford to pay for gas,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.460
housing--

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.960
critical issues.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.240
These DACA kids, when
we talk about where they

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.370
are in terms of immigration--

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.760
there are so many pressing
issues right-- guns.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.190
We've got to pass an
assault weapons ban.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.770
We need to have universal
background checks.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.360
These are immediate needs.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.860
And these are the things
I'm focused on right now.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.940
I've seen so many people, Ellen,
focus on that thing out there

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.440
and then trip over
this thing here.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.395
Right.

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:48.270
I don't want to trip.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.570
OK.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.361
There's so much that's
important right now.

00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:51.757
Who would be your
vice president?

00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:55.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.506
Got any plans?

00:05:57.506 --> 00:05:59.434
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.434 --> 00:06:00.398
I'm busy.

00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:01.844
[CHEERING]

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:03.290
All right.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.384
All right.

00:06:05.384 --> 00:06:07.300
We're going to vet you
right now just in case.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.227
We need to know lots
about you because people

00:06:09.227 --> 00:06:11.310
are going to want to know
more about Kamala Harris

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.660
because we know
what you stand for.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.430
And I love all the
things you stand for.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.550
Thank you.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.670
Thank you.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.660
But who was your
first celebrity crush?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.471
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:17.970
OK.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:18.886
I'm going to tell you.

00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:21.210
I'm going to date
myself, honestly.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.072
Tito Jackson.

00:06:23.072 --> 00:06:24.190
Tito?

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.690
OK.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.100
The Jackson 5-- OK.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.380
So I have a sister.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.550
And I have lots of cousins.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.460
And everyone picked a Jackson 5.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.376
And all that was left was Tito.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:34.308
Wow.

00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:35.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:36.610
All right.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.110
All right.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.740
And it's still like--

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.610
they got Michael.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.310
They got Marlon.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.810
Wow.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.770
I got Tito.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.980
Well, all right.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.880
Poor Tito.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.380
No.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.190
But I love Tito.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.690
Yeah.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.120
He truly ended up being
my first celebrity crush.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.330
All right.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.830
All right.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.700
I've been a senator--

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.180
complete this.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.900
I've been a senator
for over a year now.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.910
And I still don't
understand blank.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.910
I still don't understand
how in Washington, DC,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.580
there's one inch of snow and
the whole town shuts down.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.920
I don't understand that.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.060
Yes.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.980
That's a good thing
to not understand.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.550
What's the most rebellious
thing you did as a teenager?

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.880
Oh.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.630
You are going to vet me.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.252
Yeah.

00:07:15.252 --> 00:07:16.210
It's going to come out.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.299
So you might as
well tell it here.

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:20.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.373
I broke curfew.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.320
I was a loiterer.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.150
I actually had a
loitering problem

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.930
when I was in high school.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.966
I really did.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:34.840
Where did you loiter?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.580
I would loiter the halls.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.310
And the principal would say,
Kamala, you're out here again.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.915
And I'd say, Yes,
Mr. [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:41.800
I'm out again.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.450
And he'd say, come on,
let's sit down and talk.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.075
How's it going?

00:07:44.075 --> 00:07:45.170
And I'd say, I'm bored.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.878
He'd say, why don't
you go back to class?

00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:48.280
And then I'd go back to class.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.060
You were bad.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.296
I was awful.

00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:50.796
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:51.835
You were really bad.

00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:56.620
If you had to be stuck in an
elevator with either President

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.564
Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff
Sessions, who would it be?

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:01.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.092
Does one of us have
to come out alive?

00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:06.978
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.978 --> 00:08:10.345
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:14.860
You can't sleep in
the middle of night.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.780
What do you do?

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.060
Oh, I get up.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.060
I will read cookbooks.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.100
I actually-- this
happened recently.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.880
Yeah.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.870
I love cooking.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.220
You just read cookbooks?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.360
I read recipes.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.756
I'd like recipes
if I'm not cooking.

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:33.130
Especially if
you're not cooking.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.760
Yeah.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.850
What's a nickname that
your husband calls you?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.679
Honey, babe.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.260
The regular?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.929
Yeah.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.350
What's a nickname your
Republican colleagues call you?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.892
I have no idea.

00:08:46.892 --> 00:08:48.218
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.218 --> 00:08:50.170
All right.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.830
Let's see.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.970
Do you have any tattoos?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.690
No.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.490
If you were going to get a
tattoo, what would it be?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.406
And where would it go?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.504
If I were to get
a tattoo, maybe--

00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:03.670
I don't know-- if I were
going to be self-indulgent,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.378
it would be a lotus
flower because that's

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:09.820
what my name means,
and maybe on my wrist.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.850
OK.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.142
And are you running for
president, yes or no?

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.990
Next question.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.270
All right.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.910
Tito, come on out.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.210
All right.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.610
Kamala Harris, Senator
Kamala Harris, everybody--

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.160
--possibly your next President
of the United States.
