00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.529
In 1975, the communist revolutionary group
the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, had taken

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.920
over Phnom Phen, the capital city of Cambodia,
and soon they had control of the entire country

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
and declared its new name as “Democratic
Kampuchea”.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.910
They wanted to create an idealized, communist
agrarian society, and started making radical

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.910
changes.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.789
While their reign was short -- the group was
ousted by the Vietnamese government in 1979

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.470
-- they proved just how much damage can be
done in a short four years.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.850
While we will never know the exact number,
most estimates put the amount of civilians

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.580
killed by Pol Pot and his regime during their
time in power as around 2 million, or close

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.250
to 25% of the population at the time.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.210
While the Cambodian genocide is hardly talked
about in the West, those who survived have

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.920
definitely not forgotten.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.660
10.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.930
Under Pol Pot You Had No Right To Private
Property, The Government Owned It All

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.320
One of the first things Pol Pot did is decide
that his government would be truly, ideally

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.350
socialist, which means absolutely no personal
property at all.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.579
Under Pol Pot, all personal property was seized,
and anything like clothes or other things

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.930
you needed to live, were still chosen by and
considered property of the government.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.469
The truth is that this was extreme even for
a communist society, and many other communist

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.030
nations were watching with concern.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.280
Pol Pot wanted to take total control of people’s
lives, and absolutely own all the population

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.340
in pretty much every way, but part of the
point of communism had been to at least give

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.299
the illusion of everyone being equal and being
taken care of according to their needs, as

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.639
long as they worked.

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.619
Even most communist societies tended to allow
people a certain amount of personal property

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.409
to feel they can aspire to something, so Pol
Pot was being extremely radical in this regard.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.409
9.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.929
Most Fun Things Were Outlawed: You Could Not
Gamble, Own Jewelry, Or Be Religious

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.700
Religion was of course quite dangerous for
a regime like Pol Pot's to survive, so it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.490
was one of the very first things to go.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.490
The Khmer Rouge immediately banned the practice
of religion, and slaughtered a massive number

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.619
of buddhist monks.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.909
Some people believe the amount killed may
have been in the tens of thousands, but like

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:15.340
many of the numbers regarding the Cambodian
genocide, we will likely never know for certain.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.040
On top of religion, most fun was also outlawed.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.620
Since you couldn’t own property, you certainly
couldn’t wear gaudy things like jewelry,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.370
and gambling was outlawed.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.430
Many traditional folk entertainment practices
were also banned because Pol Pot wanted to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.600
separate people from their old culture.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.180
People were now spending the vast majority
of their time working for the government,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.500
and barely getting enough food to live.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
8.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.970
Doctors, Civil Servants And Other "Dangerous"
People, Were Detained Or Murdered

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.439
Pol Pot was himself a teacher before he became
a revolutionary leader and brutal dictator,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.750
and so he felt that the most dangerous types
of people were those intellectuals who could

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.340
be subversive and turn people against him.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.810
For this reason, he decided that anyone decently
educated or smart was too dangerous to live,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.519
and the majority of the countries best and
brightest were rounded up and murdered.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.079
Doctors, civil servants, teachers, policeman
and other important people were gunned down

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.819
for the danger they posed to his new regime.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.989
This particular communist movement was unique
in that it was truly anti-intellectual.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.439
While communist regimes certainly repress
intellectuals who argue with them, many others

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.180
throughout history tend to bring as many intellectuals
into their own fold, and use them for their

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.230
own propaganda.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
Instead, Pol Pot seemed completely uninterested
in propaganda, and instead just wanted to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.470
do it all by brutal force, and do it all at
once.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.470
7.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.760
Pol Pot Had His Own Infamous Detention Center
(S-21), But He Had Way More Than That

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.700
When Pol Pot and his team finally took over,
they declared it year zero in Cambodian history,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.040
a callback to the French Revolution, and immediately
went on a rampage of mass detention, torture,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.150
interrogation and execution.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.920
Some estimates put the number of total detention
centers at 150 and some put it at closer to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.680
200, but it is hard to know the exact amount,
as most of the country became temporary detention

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680
centers.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.319
High schools, and other public buildings were
turned into prisons instead of places of learning

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.140
-- after all, you don’t need a high school
when the teachers have been murdered.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.470
The most infamous of these is a building that
had once been a high school called Tuol Svay

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.449
Pray, but was renamed to S-21 by the Khmer
Rouge.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.650
An estimated 14,000 people were detained at
this facility, and only seven are believed

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.650
to have survived it.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.550
We know these things because the Khmer Rouge
authorities made the torturers keep incredibly

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.250
detailed photographic records, to prove they
were carrying out the cruelties they had been

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.710
ordered to perpetrate.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.449
One photo shows someone who is only a boy,
wearing no shirt, with a prisoner tag literally

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.480
safety pinned directly to his chest, his skin
covered in bruises.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
6.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.449
People Were Forced Out Of Their Homes To Work
In Rural Areas; Schools Were Closed

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.610
Pol Pot grew up in relative privilege, to
a wealthy farm owner, and got to go study

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.210
in France, which a lot of young men in Cambodia
could not afford.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.620
For this reason, as we mentioned earlier,
he spent his time as a teacher before he became

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.449
the cruel murderer we all know of today, and
was for the most part a mild mannered and

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.680
kind person to all appearances before the
genocides.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.770
Perhaps it was his love for farms that caused
him to come up with such a strange idea, but

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.080
Pol Pot decided to do something even most
communist countries would consider extreme,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.020
and shut down the urban areas entirely.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.670
Everyone was forced out of the cities and
sent down to work in rural areas on farms

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.320
or other farming cooperatives.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.190
This was all rigidly enforced by the Khmer
Rouge soldiers, who made sure that the entire

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.090
country turned into an agrarian society practically
overnight.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.979
The purity and importance of farming and rural
life were emphasized above all else, and learning

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.120
and intellectualism were a thing of the past.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.809
With all the teachers murdered and the schools
turned into detention centers school was done

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:54.480
-- the only thing the Khmer Rouge wanted to
teach was farming and obedience.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480
5.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.550
Pol Pot Created A New Social Hierarchy Overnight
And Strictly Enforced It

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.669
In order to create an entirely new, and an
entirely new agrarian society overnight, Pol

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.970
Pot decided that he needed to completely change
the social order.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.349
He made four new categories of people, in
order to class his new population of worker

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.349
slaves.

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.170
Those who were aligned with Western values,
or had happened to live in the city, were

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.349
the new people, and had a lot less rights
than most.

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.460
However, if you were loyal to the Khmer Rouge,
maybe you could move up to deportee status.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.849
Those who really, really behaved may eventually
be considered candidates for full citizenship,

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.000
and if you really were a good little government
stooge, you may eventually end up a full rights

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
citizen.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.440
However, most people stayed at the status
that the Khmer Rouge put them into when they

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.220
first classified them -- it was extremely
rare for them to move up.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.930
This is partly because the entire new hierarchy
was meant to glorify and elevate an existing

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.750
category of people over others, and systems
designed to discriminate don’t usually tend

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.819
to be fair.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:56.819
4.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.199
Families Were Forcibly And Entirely Separated
To Better Brainwash The Populace

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.819
One of the biggest hallmarks of Pol Pot’s
regime was a family separation policy that

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.300
even many of the worst dictators in history
would have thought cruel.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.650
When the people were forced out of the cities
to go be worker drudges in the country, the

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.920
Khmer Rouge separated families en masse.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.770
Unlike many dictators past and future who
have done such things in order to punish others

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.080
for subversion, Pol Pot did it as a calculated
move to make his regime into the perfectly

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.080
well oiled machine.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.130
There were a couple big reasons for Pol Pot’s
cruel policy: For starters, it makes it a

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.080
lot easier to brainwash the populace when
you remove the family unit -- the government

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.699
now essentially becomes the family authority
that raises the children.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.810
However, Pol Pot also wanted to organize people
based on their skills and uses as efficiently

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.400
as possible, which meant grouping children
with other like children, women with women

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400
and so on.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.020
And this also meant sending people away to
areas where he felt they would make the most

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.590
sense as workers, so it was a natural byproduct
of his policies even regardless of brainwashing

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.780
reasons, to separate families as much as possible.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.324
This sort of thing is what led many other
communist regimes to wonder if something should

00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:04.110
be done -- even some of the worst were not
this cruel unless actual counter revolutionary

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.889
crimes had been committed against the regime.

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:07.889
3.

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:12.449
Pol Pot Literally Pitted The “Purer” Country
Folk, Against The City “Intellectuals”

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:16.490
Pol Pot was an intellectual himself, so perhaps
this is why he felt so threatened, or perhaps

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.870
he was really just that romantic for farm
life.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:25.020
Regardless, the true hallmark of the strangeness
of Pol Pot’s cruel regime was his insistence

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.080
on an entirely agrarian society, starting
over entirely from the beginning.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.479
Even when countries are taken over by revolutionaries,
they tend not to throw out the entire thing

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:39.479
in terms of infrastructure, knowledge and
urban buildup, but the Khmer Rouge led by

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.490
Pol Pot, did just that.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.410
He essentially made the entire thing a battle,
in his own mind, of the dangerous and subversive

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.019
city intellectuals, versus the more pure folk
who worked on farms.

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:54.610
The irony here is that while Pol Pot felt
that farm life and an agrarian society would

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.310
make things more pure and wholesome, or at
least so he claimed on the surface, in his

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:05.269
supposed quest for moral purity, he was responsible
for the deaths of roughly 2 million innocent

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:06.269
people.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:10.360
Unfortunately, this is a dangerous sentiment
playing out in too many places in the world

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.170
today, as hatred for intellectualism is on
the rise.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.170
2.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.120
Some Were More “Equal” Than Others, Despite
Claims Of Perfect Communism

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.079
While Pol Pot and his regime claimed they
were creating an ideal and perfectly equal

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:27.630
communist society, most of us know that that
sort of thing rarely works out so well in

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.630
actual practice.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.630
As we mentioned earlier, there were four classes
of people, and even a lot of hard work and

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.110
sucking up generally didn’t get you any
further.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.800
Worse yet, if you happened to live in the
city when he took over, you were a “new

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.980
person” while anyone who had lived on a
farm was already a full rights citizen.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.019
To make matters worse, even if you had already
lived on a farm, that didn’t necessarily

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:50.839
mean you always had enough to eat during the
reign of the Khmer Rouge, and didn’t mean

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:52.800
things were equal even among that class.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.670
There are reports that the soldiers who worked
for the Khmer Rouge, and anyone who administered

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.860
for them, certainly seemed to have more luxury
than most people living under the new regime

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.269
of “Democratic” Kampuchea.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.820
As for Pol Pot himself, many people like to
point out that despite his claims about the

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.269
importance of hard farm work and everyone
being equal, he always looked fresh faced

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:16.880
and soft handed, like he hadn’t worked hard
physically in a very long time, if ever.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880
1.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.610
Pol Pot’s Cambodia Was An Attempt At Rapid
Social Engineering

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.839
There are successful communist countries running
today, and successful capitalist countries

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:26.750
and other types as well.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.260
There isn’t really one perfect form of government,
and any type of government can at least do

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.210
decent by its people if it tries hard enough.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.320
This is why many other communist countries
were alarmed from the beginning.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.750
Communism in many cases came about more naturally,
because people were looking for something

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.839
different that took a little better care of
the common man and the communist countries

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.770
never took such drastic steps.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.400
Many communist intellectuals feared from the
beginning that Pol Pot’s regime could never

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.700
work long term, and was an embarrassment to
everyone, because of how radical it was.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.160
He wanted to turn his society to a level of
communist many would consider extreme, and

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.980
go entirely agrarian, basically overnight.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.360
And, unlike most countries, he murdered his
intellectuals instead of trying to subvert

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.810
them to write things in favor of the government.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.899
His rapid style was so insane, that many communist
countries urged Vietnam, their closest neighbor,

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:17.889
to put an end to his reign of terror.

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:23.820
So, in 1978, at the urging of the international
community, Vietnam invaded Cambodia.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.991
In 1979, they took over Phnom Phen and the
remaining forces of the Khmer Rouge, as well

00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.690
as Pol Pot himself, retreated into the jungles.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.579
Pol Pot would never face justice -- he committed
suicide the night he found out he would be

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:40.279
turned over to an international tribunal,
but at least the invasion of the Vietnamese

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:45.350
provided some immediate welcome relief from
the horrific cruelties the Cambodian people

00:11:45.350 --> 00:12:05.949
were suffering.
