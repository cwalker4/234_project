00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.680
There is no denying the fact that science
has solved many mysteries of nature, from

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.060
demonstrating that the Sun and not the Earth
is at the center of the solar system, to discrediting

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.020
the long-held stork theory of where babies
came from.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.380
This success gives scientists tremendous pride
in their accomplishments and is the reason

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.870
that a recent poll by the National Academy
of Sciences showed that scientists are generally

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.030
highly respected by the American public.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.200
However, there is also no doubt that there
are unsolved mysteries and one of the biggest

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.710
mysteries in modern physics originates from
the fact that we scientists can’t conclusively

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
identify 85% of the matter of the universe.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.210
So here’s the deal.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.200
The most modern research says that the kind
of matter that makes up you and me constitutes

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.539
only about 5% of the mass and energy of the
universe.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.360
It seems that about 25% is made of a substance
called dark matter and 70% is made of an even

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.350
more elusive substance called dark energy.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.789
Earlier videos of mine describe both of these
possible dark substances.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.149
However, today I want to talk about dark matter,
which seems to be about five times more prevalent

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.759
than ordinary matter.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.229
The simplest picture that scientists have
of dark matter is a subatomic particle with

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.090
a mass between one and ten thousand times
the mass of a proton.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.009
This particle has no electrical charge and
interacts with ordinary matter via gravity

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.000
and possibly involving forces weaker than
we’ve discovered so far.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.730
For this reason, scientists call this particle
a WIMP, for weakly-interacting massive particle.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.660
Using the WIMP idea, scientists can explain
many mysteries, from why galaxies rotate faster

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.410
than can be explained from the known laws
of physics and visible matter in the universe,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.960
to the motion of vast clusters of galaxies.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.660
Because of the success of the theory, the
WIMP idea is very well regarded in the scientific

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.490
community.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.011
However, while the WIMP theory solves many
mysteries in astronomy, it doesn’t solve

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.480
all of them.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.840
For instance, when scientists use WIMP theory
to simulate the formation of large galaxies

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.790
like the Milky Way, the simulations predict
many, perhaps as many as 500, small satellite

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.620
galaxies buzzing around the periphery of the
Milky Way.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.170
When astronomers look, they find only about
twenty.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.390
Also, the simulations predict that the small
galaxies should be arrayed uniformly around

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.359
the Milky Way, while the observed satellite
galaxies are preferentially located in a plane

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.660
perpendicular to the Milky Way’s orbital
plane.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.590
These discrepancies and a few others have
pointed to possible weaknesses of the WIMP

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.200
theory.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.799
These weaknesses are not enough to entirely
throw away the idea of the WIMP dark matter

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.590
and, truth be known, scientists debate just
how important these discrepancies really are.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.269
It‘s entirely possible that with improved
simulations the disagreement between the model

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.499
and observations will be smaller.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.439
Further, astronomers may still find more satellite
galaxies.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.010
This recently happened when the researchers
using data taken by the Dark Energy Survey

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.980
collaboration found several additional satellite
galaxies at the Milky Way.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.489
This discovery demonstrates just how fluid
our understanding of the situation really

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.939
is.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.700
Still, it may be that some tweaks to the WIMP
theory might be needed.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.780
While there are a number of proposed solutions,
one idea is particularly cool.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.900
One of the key properties of dark matter is
that it does not absorb, nor emit, electromagnetic

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.900
radiation.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.469
Basically, visible light, radio waves, infrared,
ultraviolet, none of them interact with dark

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.920
matter.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640
This is because dark matter carries no electric
charge.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.069
But what if dark matter had a different kind
of charge- a dark charge so to speak.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.650
If it did, we could imagine that, in analogy
to familiar electromagnetism, that particles

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.049
carrying dark charge could emit dark photons
and feel the force of dark electric fields.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.329
Because ordinary matter doesn’t carry this
hypothetical dark charge, these dark photons

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.100
zip by ordinary matter without interacting
at all.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.120
We just wouldn’t see them.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.050
Now this sounds like it might be a kind of
silly proposal, but is it?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.061
I mean, after all, ordinary matter is quite
complex, with its quarks and leptons and at

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:34.220
least five forces that govern its behavior.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.030
Why couldn’t dark matter be equally complicated?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.630
While we admit that we have no real reason
to believe this dark charge idea, we can ask

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.580
ourselves “Given existing data, is there
any chance this new theory could be true?”

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.360
It turns out that measurements of ordinary
matter can tell us both what is possible and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.550
impossible for this new idea.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.139
For instance, observations of the rotation
of galaxies tell us that dark matter is not

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.530
concentrated in a disk like the matter of
the Milky Way.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.150
Instead, most of it is located in a big sphere
surrounding most galaxies.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.220
This sets limits on both the strength of dark
matter charge and how dense the dark matter

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.420
is.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.900
The reason is relatively simple.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.710
If the dark charge were the same as ordinary
electric charge, it could radiate away energy

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.949
like familiar matter and the dark matter distribution
would be disk-like and not sphere-like.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.919
Using ideas like this, scientists are able
to rule out some possible properties of dark

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.919
matter that interacts strongly with itself.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.849
However, there is one proposed idea of self-interacting
dark matter that is very interesting.

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.070
This model suggests that dark matter is even
more complicated.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.860
In this model, in addition to the regular
WIMP particle, there are two forms of charged

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.259
dark matter, with one of the dark matter particles
being heavy and the other being light.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.560
This is kind of like imagining a dark matter
proton and a dark matter electron that could

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.690
conceivably bind together to make dark matter
atoms.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.470
I should caution you against making too much
of that analogy, but it helps give you a mental

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.370
image of the idea.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.070
The reason I caution you against this analogy
is that if one postulated dark atoms, it’s

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.970
easy to let your imagination get away from
you and start thinking about dark molecules

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.110
and then dark planets, dark stars and an entire
dark matter Milky Way living alongside of

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.669
ours, forever invisible except through gravitational
interactions between the dark and the ordinary

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:32.759
worlds.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.229
However we know this can’t be true.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.810
In the past, before the scientific community
settled on the dark matter hypothesis, astronomers

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.350
looked for other explanations for why galaxies
rotate so fast.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.850
The simplest hypothesis was that rogue planets,
brown dwarfs, black holes and similar dense

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.199
bodies of ordinary matter were to be found
in the Milky Way.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.169
The idea was that scientists had simply underestimated
the amount of matter in the galaxy.

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:07.750
However, these experiments set pretty strict
limits on the existence of these compact objects.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.150
Because of the way that these measurements
were done, we can rule out the existence of

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.180
stars made solely of dark matter.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.800
The reason is simple.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.909
If dark matter stars existed, they’d have
been detected in these searches for dark objects

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:21.280
made of ordinary matter.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.770
However, it’s still possible that smaller
compact dark objects could exist- say dark

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.570
asteroids, for instance.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.509
So what do existing measurements still allow?

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:35.139
The result is actually surprising.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:40.360
Under the idea that dark matter consists of
a WIMP and two particles carrying dark charge,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.120
dark matter could consist of a big cloud of
WIMPs with a smaller disk of dark matter held

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.280
together with dark electromagnetism.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.030
In fact, given existing measurements, the
disk of strongly interacting dark matter could

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.590
contain as much mass as we see in ordinary
matter.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.020
This is a surprising conclusion and gives
us a very different picture of the structure

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.020
of galaxies.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:09.430
Now while I have told you about this interesting
hypothesis, I must add a word of caution.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:15.439
No matter how interesting this idea is, it’s
just that- an idea- and most ideas in science

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:17.300
turn out to be wrong.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.789
However, for the moment, it’s a cool possibility
that lives in the gap between ideas that are

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:26.180
still possible and those that have been ruled
out completely.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.699
Only time, and experiments, will tell us in
what category this idea will finally end up.
