CAPITALISTS IN CALIFORNIA.

GAVIN NEWSOM, THE DEMOCRAT?

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.985

LOU: THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:57.523
AND IT HAS TO, WELL, FILL YOUR

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.592
HEART WITH CONFIDENCE AS YOU

YOU'RE OVERCOME MUCH.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:05.731
WHAT'S A LITTLE MORE.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:07.666
&gt;&gt; WELL, AND WHAT FILLS MY

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.335
CONFIDENCE IS THAT GOVERN NEWSOM

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.438
HAS TOLD US HE'S GOING TO DOUBLE

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:13.472
THE STATE INCOME TAX, GOING TO

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.274
INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES AND MAKE

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:18.077
SURE THAT WE DON'T REPEAL THE

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:21.247
GAS TAX WHICH HAS DRIVEN OUR

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.548
GASOLINE OVER $4 A GALLON AND

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.017
PLUNGED THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.151
OF THIS STATE INTO POVERTY.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.319
THAT JUST CAN'T CONTINUE.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:31.190
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:33.959
GOING TO REJECT THE SOCIALIST

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:35.127

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:45.571

I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.611
CAPITALISTS, INCLUDING YOURSELF.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.046
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:57.416
TO COME TO THAT POINT TO BE

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.651
SECOND IN THAT RACE, AND GAVIN

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.552
NEWSOM SAID SOMETHING THAT I

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.220
THOUGHT, ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.054
THAT YOU THINK, BE CAREFUL WHAT

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:04.156

WANTS IN THE STATE OF

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:11.530
CALIFORNIA.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.132
I HAD TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.432
THINKING THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.700
IDEA.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.801
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DO.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.102

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.803
TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.139
PRESIDENT HERE.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:22.241
YOU KNOW, GAVIN NEWSOM WANTS TO

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:25.611
TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:28.180
MY ANSWER IS, THAT'S WHAT A

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:31.584
CRAVING POLITICIAN DOES.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.951
I'M A BUSINESSMAN LIKE THE

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.953
PRESIDENT.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.387
THAT POLITICIAN GAVIN NEWSOM

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.488
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.656
TAX BURDEN IN THIS STATE, HE

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:40.726
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:43.195
COST OF HOUSING WHICH HAS LED

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.430
46% BAY AREA RESIDENTS WANT TO

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.065
LEAVE THE STATE, HE DOESN'T WANT

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:48.701
TO TALK ABOUT THE LOUSY SCHOOLS

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:49.935
WE'RE SPENDING BILLIONS ARE THAT

DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.206
LACK OF WATER.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:56.075
JERRY BROWN SAID WE'RE ALL GOING

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.545
TO BE LIMITED TO 55-GALLONS A

00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:00.579
DAY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TEARING

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.280
DOWN RESERVOIRS INSTEAD OF

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.948
BUILDING THEM.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:05.351
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:06.785
LOUSY CROWDED ROADS FULL OF

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.987
POTHOLES OR THE HOMELESS LIVING

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.056
IN OUR STREETS, LOU.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:11.490
THIS IS RIDICULOUS

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.525
MISMANAGEMENT.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:15.694
WE NEED A BUSINESS PERSON TO

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.230
TURN THIS STATE AROUND AND GET

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:20.366
GOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HERE.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.967
LOU: AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.601
HEALTHY DOSE OF COMMON SENSE

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.871

LOU: -- BE IN ADVANCER.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.576
IT SEEMS TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.145
WAY RIGHT NOW, THEY WANT TO

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.547
RAISE TAXES, THEY WANT TO

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:37.750
REGULATE DESPITE WHAT PRESIDENT

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:38.617
TRUMP IS DOING NATIONWIDE.

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:43.255
THEY'RE SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:46.325
TO THE ECONOMY AS HE INSPIRES A

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.192
PROSUCCESS, PROBUSINESS,

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.627
PROCAPITALLIST AGENDA.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:51.363
AND YET THEY WANT TO TAKE US

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:52.231
BACK TO THE GOOD OLD YEARS OF

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:56.602
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:58.103
&gt;&gt; FOR EIGHT YEARS THE OBAMA

00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:00.806
ADMINISTRATION ANTIBUSINESS

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:01.373
INCREDIBLE REGULATIONS, TAX

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.908
INCREASES.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.242
AND BUSINESS DIDN'T WANT TO

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:06.745
INVEST.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:07.546
I GOT TO TELL YOU, HERE IN

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.882
CALIFORNIA, 9,000 BUSINESSES,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.582
LOU, HAVE LEFT THIS STATE IN THE

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.251
LAST SEVEN YEARS.

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.786
I HAVE TALKED TO SMALL BUSINESS

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:14.186
PEOPLE -- I'M A SMALL

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.288
BUSINESSMAN.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.655
I HAVE 100 EMPLOYEES IN MY

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.823
BUSINESS.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.957
AND SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE ALL

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:21.026
ACROSS THE STATE HAVE TOLD ME

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:22.227
THAT THEY WOULD MOVE THEIR

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.128
BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA IF

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.698
THEY ONLY COULD.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:27.099
BUT YOU KNOW, CAR DEALERS,

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:29.735
RESTAURANTS, FARMERS, THEY CAN'T

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.570
MOVE THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:32.938
SILICON VALLEY, YOU KNOW, IS

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:37.443
EXPANDING, BUT THEY'RE EXPANDING

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:37.776
IN ARIZONA, NEVADA, TEXAS, OTHER

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:38.777
PLACES.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.050
THAT CAN'T CONTINUE OR WE'RE

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:45.818
GOING TO HAVE A HOLLOWED-OUT

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.287
ECONOMY HERE.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:49.254

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.326
MY GUESS IS THE PRESIDENT WILL

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.561
BE EXCITED ABOUT COMING TO

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.328
CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT YOU.

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:59.164
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:04:56.528 --> 00:05:04.403
LOU: AND THE DECISION TO SUPPORT

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:03.402
THE TRUMP AGENDA,

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:07.339
THE TRUMP AGENDA I THINK IS A

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:08.373
BIG LESSON FOR ANYONE RUNS FOR

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.308
OFFICE WERE STATE OFFICE OR

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.776
CONGRESS OR THE SENATE.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:11.276
IT'S A LESSON THAT THEY WOULD

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.078
LEARN FROM YOU.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.046
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PRIVATE

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:19.051
ECONOMY, LOU.

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:20.819
I WAS A JACK KEMP DISCIPLE.

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:22.287
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE BEST PATH

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.922
TO PROSPERITY.

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.790
I STARTED AT THE BOTTOM.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:27.292
I HAD NOTHING.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:28.627
I HAD A SINGLE MOM WHO IS A

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:31.830
SCHOOLTEACHER IN CHICAGO AND I

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:32.631
GOT MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS AND

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.233
MADE SOMETHING MYSELF.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:36.268
I WANT EVERY PERSON IN

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:38.537
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE SAME KIND

00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.671
OF OPPORTUNITIES I DID.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.341
THE CALIFORNIA DREAM RIGHT NOW

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:44.276
IS DREAMING OF MOVING TO TEXAS.
