00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.179
judges you know these hearings are a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.910
place to hopefully get answers and as

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.920
I'm sure your you've noticed your lack

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.330
of a clear answer to a question I asked

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.140
you last night has generated a lot of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.650
interest

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
I received reliable information that you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310
had a conversation about the special

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
counsel or his investigation with the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
law firm that has represented President

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
Trump as you'll recall last night I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.180
asked you whether you'd had such a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.239
conversation and under oath you gave no

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.770
clear answer then today my Republican

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.690
colleagues raised the issue with you and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.350
again you said you don't recall and that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.550
you had no quote inappropriate

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.860
conversations with anyone at that law

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
firm which has led a lot of people to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.050
believe that that was equivocal in terms

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.660
of a response so whether a conversation

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.899
was appropriate in your opinion is not a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.060
clear answer to my question my colleague

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.720
senator Blumenthal again asked you and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.220
you said you were quote pretty confident

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.710
the answer was no so frankly if if last

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.049
night you had just said no or an

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
absolute no even today I think this

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.290
could be put to rest but I will ask you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.150
again and for the last time yes or no

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.329
have you ever been part of a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.020
conversation with lawyers at the firm of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.340
Kassovitz benson torres about special

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.490
counsel muller

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.829
or his investigation and i asked where

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.619
you ever part of a conversation I'm not

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.040
asking you what did you say right I'm

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.689
asking you were you a party to a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.850
conversation that occurred regarding

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.530
special counsel Muller's investigation

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
and as simple yesterday no would suffice

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.439
about his investigation and are you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.930
referring to a specific person I'm

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.079
referring to a specific subject and the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.180
specific person I'm referring to is you

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.970
who was the conversation with you said

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
you had information that is not the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.900
subject of the question sir

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.010
the sir the question is you and whether

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.459
you were part

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.900
of a conversation regarding special

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.659
counsel Muller's investigation the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.530
answer's no thank you and it would have

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.970
been great if you could have said that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.340
last why thank you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.110
in my nevermind okay yesterday senator

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
senator Blumenthal asked if you could

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.099
recuse yourself in cases involving the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.379
personal civil or criminal liability of

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.329
the president you declined to say that

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.890
you would so my question is could a

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.989
reasonable person question your

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.590
independence in cases involving the

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.750
president's civil or criminal liability

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.000
sorry can you repeat it would it be

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.220
reasonable for someone to question your

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.440
independence in cases involving the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.739
president's civil or criminal liability

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.450
should that occur my independence I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.370
believe has been demonstrated through my

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.780
12-year record and what you've heard

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.510
from the people who've worked with me

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.609
and I believe deeply in the Independence

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.940
of the judiciary I'd rule based on the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:18.000
law and you can look at cases that I've

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.739
ruled against the when I became a judge

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.269
against the Bush administration and I've

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.370
talked about the history of our country

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.220
in the history of the Supreme Court and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.419
on that point sir in particularly a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.709
history of the Supreme Court in

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.870
confirmation hearings

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.329
Justice Kagan during her confirmation

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.239
hearing committed to recusing in cases

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.579
she handled as Solicitor General Justice

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.709
Breyer committed to recusing in cases

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.930
implicating his financial interest in

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.970
Lloyds of London

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.340
Justice Ginsburg refused to commit to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.349
recusing in cases that were on her DC

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.900
Circuit recusal list

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.940
Justice Scalia committed at the hearing

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.859
to recuse in a case implicating an issue

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.769
that was the same as an issue he had

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.159
decided as a DC Circuit Judge so my

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.980
question to you is will you commit to

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.629
recusing in any case involving the civil

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.099
or criminal liability of the president

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.049
who appointed you the the Independence

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.729
of the judiciary requires that I not

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.880
commit to how I would decide a

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:20.340
particular case and to issue a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.680
commitment on a discretionary recusal

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.840
issue in either direction so if I answer

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.880
that question in either direction that

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.510
would be a vile I would be violating my

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.880
judicial

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.340
independence in my view by committing as

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.310
a in this context I've explained but

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.730
with all due respect sir if if I shared

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.570
with you that other nominees sitting at

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.400
that desk or some desk like that have

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.170
committed to recusing there have been

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.150
circumstances where they have committed

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.590
so is it your opinion then that they

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.880
violated some ethical code or rule I

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.620
don't know all the circumstances but I

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.780
believe those were situations that were

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.420
required recusal x' where they had

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.840
previously had to recuse and were simply

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.550
indicating they're required recusal x'

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.920
but i don't know all the circumstances a

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.190
discretionary recusal is a commitment to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.350
get a job or discretionary non recusal

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.550
as a commitment to get a job either

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.370
direction would be violating my

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.730
independence as a judge as a sitting

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.530
judge and as a nominee to the court okay

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.600
it is clear and willing at this point to

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.330
commit to a recusal so we can move on

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.340
one of your mentors justice kennedy

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.130
wrote landmark opinions in the area of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.260
LGBTQ rights that have had a major

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.720
impact on the lives of many Americans

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.480
let's discuss one of those cases and

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.070
that's the obergefell case you know

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.930
berger feld as you know the court held

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.900
that same-sex couples have a right to

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.810
marry my question is whether the

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.360
obergefell case was correctly decided in

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.210
your opinion senator

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.100
Justice Kennedy wrote the majority

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.230
opinion in a series of five cases Romer

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.940
versus Evans if we can just talk about a

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.920
burger Phil that'd be great I want to

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.870
explain it I actually know that the

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.010
history leading up to a burger failed so

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.620
can you just please address your

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.570
comments to obergefell so I would like

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.820
to explain it if I can he wrote the

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.300
majority opinion in Romer versus Evans

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.250
Lawrence versus versus Texas United

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.500
States versus Windsor obergefell and

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.900
masterpiece cake shop concluding in

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.700
masterpiece cake shop importantly with a

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.900
statement if I could just read this no

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.370
please don't because I actually have

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.480
read it and I'm sure most have my

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.400
question is very specific can you

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.500
comment on your personal opinion on

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.249
whether obergefell was correctly decided

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.759
it's

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.879
yes or no please in masterpiece cake

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.789
shop and this is I think relevant to

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:52.949
your question Justice Kennedy wrote in

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.109
the majority opinion joined by Chief

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:58.349
Justice Roberts and Justice Alito and

00:06:55.109 --> 00:07:01.189
Justice Gorsuch and Justice Breyer and

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:04.139
Justice Kagan the days of discriminating

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:06.359
against gay and lesbian Americans or

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:11.629
treating gay and lesbian Americans as

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:14.039
inferior and dignity and Worth are over

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.409
that is the press in the Supreme Court

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.979
agreed with by a sir I'm asking your

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.169
opinion

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.529
you're the nominee right now and so it

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:24.449
is probative of your ability to serve on

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.489
the highest court in our land so I'm

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.079
asking a very specific question either

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:29.279
you're willing to answer or not and if

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.319
you're not willing to answer it we can

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.759
move on but do you believe obergefell

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:38.999
twas correctly decided so each of the

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:41.129
justices have declined as a matter of

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:43.019
judicial independence each of them to

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:45.360
answer questions in that line of cases

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:47.909
you will not answer that following the

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.979
precedent set by those eight just as

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:51.539
they've all declined thank you when

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:53.579
asked to answer that question have

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:55.919
limited times of what it's important we

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:57.809
really like to move on all right

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.279
you've said that Brown the Board of

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:01.889
Education was one of the greatest

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:04.589
moments in the courts history do you

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:08.179
believe that obergefell was also one of

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:10.349
those moments I've said senator

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:15.629
consistent with what the nominees have

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:18.719
done that the the vast swath of modern

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:20.759
case law as Justice Kagan put it you

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:22.499
can't as a nominee in this seat give a

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.779
thumbs up or thumbs down that was that's

00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:27.209
what Oh berger feld was one of the great

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:29.069
moments in the history of the Supreme

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:31.409
Court of the United States and for that

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:34.229
reason those nominees have declined to

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:35.969
comment on recent cases all great moment

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.189
is what I'm asking you not to comment on

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.449
the the legal analysis do you believe

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:42.120
that was a great moment in the history

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:44.069
of the court so the the Justice Kennedy

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.990
wrote the majority opinion saying the

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:49.079
days of treating gay and lesbian

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:51.660
Americans or gay and lesbian couples as

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:54.029
second-class citizens are inferior and

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.990
dignity and worth are over in the

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:56.970
Supreme Court that's

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.920
very important statement senator I agree

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.170
that's why I think you repeated it thank

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.850
you let's move on over the last several

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.220
months we have all witnessed the

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.110
inhumane and heartbreaking separation of

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.380
immigrant children from their families

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.660
by this administration despite a court

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.470
order requiring the administration to

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.600
reunite them over a month ago nearly 500

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.600
immigrant immigrant children are still

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.880
separated from their parents do you

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.790
believe that constitutional rights of

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.339
parents specifically fundamental due

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:33.300
process rights are implicated in such

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:36.209
family separations senator senator that

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.060
is a matter of pending litigation I

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:41.040
believe and as a sitting judge on the DC

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.110
Circuit or as a nominee

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.279
I of course can't comment have you

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.140
watched the coverage of any of these

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.270
cases on television or have you read

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.279
about the experiences those parents and

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.870
those children have had I have seen some

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:57.899
television in the 1889 Chinese Exclusion

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.790
case the Supreme Court permitted a ban

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:02.820
on Chinese people entering the United

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:05.730
States the court said Chinese people are

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:08.540
quote impossible to assimilate with our

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.640
people on end quote and said they were

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:15.360
immigrating in numbers quote approaching

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:19.170
an invasion this case has never been

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.570
explicitly overruled you've said you'd

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.160
be willing to talk about older cases so

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.589
can you tell me was the United States

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.209
Supreme Court correct in holding that

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:32.430
Chinese people could be banned from

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:35.940
entering our country senator the cases

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:38.660
in the 1890s as you know 1889 to be

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.970
specific okay in that era

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.890
reflects discriminatory attitudes by the

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.230
Supreme Court of course that's the air

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.670
also of Plessy versus Ferguson so would

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.430
you be willing to say that that was

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.709
incorrectly decided yeah Sarah I don't

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.630
want to opine on a case a particular

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:58.290
case without looking at it and and

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.579
studying about the discrimination are

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.750
you aware that that case has not been

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:06.540
overturned sir I know that with a number

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.680
of the cases like Korematsu let's look

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.270
let me use that as an example

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.710
discussed earlier but in this case in

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.149
particular were you aware that it had

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.240
not been over times whose center I

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:18.220
realized that there still cases in the

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.020
immigration context have you ever

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.220
written about any of those cases and

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:24.910
your thoughts about whether they should

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.100
be re-examined or potentially overturned

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.770
and sometimes obviously they should be

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.570
overturned well there is a swath of

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:35.200
cases have you talked about this case

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:37.149
ever I don't know I do not believe I'm

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.529
happy to be refreshed if you have

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:43.209
something that suggests I have no it's

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:44.950
actually a question okay and under the

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:47.170
Constitution judge do you believe that

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.790
Congress or the president can ban entry

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.370
into the United States on the basis of

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.980
race senator that it was the of course

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.260
one of the issues that was just in

00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:01.080
litigation and there's still litigation

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:04.000
about the immigration laws and how

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.190
that's pending litigation so I think I

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.740
as a matter of Independence and

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.149
precedent well that's fine let's move on

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.250
in 2013

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:14.020
Texas passed a law that imposed new

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.480
restrictions on health care facilities

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.850
that provide abortions the effect was

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.850
that after the law was passed half those

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.589
facilities closed which severely limited

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.380
access to health care for the women of

00:12:23.589 --> 00:12:28.330
Texas in 2016

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.220
whole women's health was decided where

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.690
in the Supreme Court invalidated the

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:36.850
Texas restrictions was whole woman's

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:40.589
health correctly decided yes or no and

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:43.330
we can keep it short and move on senator

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:45.040
consistent with the approach of nominee

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.860
wasn't the answer calling that nominee

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.260
precedent okay I'd like to ask you

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.680
another question which I believe you can

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.140
answer on you've said repeatedly that

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.870
Roe versus Wade is an important

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.940
precedent I'd like to understand what

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.589
that really means for the lives of women

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.990
we've had a lot of conversations about

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:07.209
how the discussion we're having in this

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:11.470
room will impact real people out there

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:15.040
and so my question is what in your

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.350
opinion is still unresolved for example

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.420
can a state prevent a woman from using

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.279
the most common or widely accepted

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.589
medical procedure to terminate her

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:25.569
pregnancy do you believe that that is

00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:27.660
still an unresolved issue

00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:31.079
I'm not asking how you would decide it

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:34.120
so I don't want to comment on

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:35.470
hypothetical cases roe v wade is an

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.749
important precedents been reaffirmed

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.790
many times so are you willing to say

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:42.069
that it would be unconstitutional for a

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:48.129
state to place such a restriction on

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:51.339
women row v Wade you can the precedent

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:53.230
of the Supreme Court was in Roe was

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:54.850
reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood versus

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.279
Casey of course and that's precedent on

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.779
press and then there are a lot of cases

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:56.279
Kavanaugh Issues An EPIC Response When Kamala Harris Disrespects His Pocket Constitution

00:13:56.279 --> 00:14:00.610
applying the undue burden standard then

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.639
and those themselves are important

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.079
precedents and I had to apply them and

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:07.540
we've discussed that many times I've

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:08.559
actually had the benefit of sitting

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.999
through most of the hours of your

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:11.470
testimony over the last two days so I

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:13.569
know you've talked a lot about that can

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.959
Congress ban abortions nationwide after

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:19.240
20 weeks of pregnancy so that's would

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:23.259
require me to comment on potential

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:25.420
legislation that I understand and

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:27.250
therefore I shouldn't as a matter of

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.649
judicial independence following the

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:33.279
precedent of other nominees I'm gonna

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:35.230
ask you about unenumerated rights so you

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:37.029
gave a speech praising former justice

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.800
rehnquist dissent in Rhodes been much

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:41.350
discussion about that and you wrote

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.420
quote celebrating his success that

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.980
success in stemming the general tide of

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.199
freewheeling judicial creation of

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.329
unenumerated rights that is what you

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:51.850
said in celebration of justice rehnquist

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:53.649
so unenumerated rights is a phrase that

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.689
lawyers use but I want to make clear

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:57.579
what we're talking about it means rights

00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:59.050
that are protected by the Constitution

00:14:57.579 --> 00:15:01.180
even if they're not specifically

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.149
mentioned in the Constitution so they're

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.980
not in that book that you carry so what

00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:08.829
we're talking about is the right to vote

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.050
that's an unenumerated right the right

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:13.179
to have children the right to control

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.579
the upbringing of your children the

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:17.980
right to refuse medical care the right

00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:20.319
to love the partner of your choice the

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:23.829
right to marry and the right to have an

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:26.259
abortion now putting those unenumerated

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:29.019
rights in the context of the statement

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:31.689
you made which was to praise the

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:34.389
stemming of the general tide of

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:35.290
freewheeling creation of unenumerated

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:37.329
rights which

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:42.430
you were the interpretation there is you

00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:45.130
were praising the the quest to end those

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.810
unenumerated rights my question to you

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:50.290
is which of the rights that I just

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:56.730
mentioned do you want to put an end to

00:15:50.290 --> 00:16:02.110
or rollback three points I believe

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:04.779
senator first the Constitution it is in

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:08.620
the book that I carry the Constitution

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:10.240
protects unenumerated rights that's what

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.370
the Supreme Court has said but that does

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.319
not explicitly protect the rights that I

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.930
just listed and we both know that that's

00:16:14.319 --> 00:16:18.730
right so that's point one point two is

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.639
Glucksberg the case you're referring to

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.800
a specifically cited Planned Parenthood

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:27.880
versus Casey as Authority in that case

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.889
so Casey reaffirmed Roe case he is cited

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.350
as Authority in glücksburg that's point

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:34.630
two and point three Justice Kagan when

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.889
she sat in this chair pointed repeatedly

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:40.269
to Glucksberg as the test for

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:43.209
recognizing unenumerated rights going

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:45.490
forward I in describing the precedent I

00:16:43.209 --> 00:16:48.670
agree with her description of that at in

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.110
her hearing so thank you for that so

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.120
then let's put the rights that I

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.610
mentioned which are unenumerated in the

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:58.240
context of your praise of Justice

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:01.000
Rehnquist as having stemmed the general

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.179
tide of freewheeling judicial creation

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.890
of unenumerated rights arguably every

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:09.280
right that I mentioned on that list was

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:11.470
a judicially created unenumerated right

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.579
and my question then is when you praise

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:18.400
a jurist who attempted to end those

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:21.220
rights which rights in particular do you

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.150
believe are praiseworthy of ending right

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:28.390
so that was the test that was set forth

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.280
by the Supreme Court going forward for

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:33.780
recognition of additional unenumerated

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:36.280
rights that was relied cited as

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.200
Authority in that case Planned

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:41.080
Parenthood versus Casey which reaffirmed

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.909
roe we talk about the right to vote do

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.240
you believe that that falls in the

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:48.400
category of having been caught up in the

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.120
general tide of freewheeling judicial

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.100
creation

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:57.670
rated rights when what I was describing

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.640
with chief justice rehnquist and it was

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:03.670
a description of his career was in a

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.920
variety of areas and his role clear

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.780
reference was to unenumerated right and

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.430
in a number of areas I described five

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.840
different areas of his jurisprudence

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.340
where he'd helped the supreme court

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.140
achieve what I think has been a

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.110
common-sense middle-ground that has

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.660
stood the test of time in terms of

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.940
precedent in a variety of areas at least

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.880
that's how others have described it the

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.190
Glucksberg case as Justice Kagan

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.370
explained when she was in this chair is

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:33.240
the case that the Supreme Court has

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:35.650
relied on for forward-looking future

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.300
recognition of unenumerated rights if

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:39.130
you're not familiar with that I think

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.200
you're not going to address the specific

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.330
enumerated rights or are you because if

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.740
not we can move on I think I've

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.130
addressed it thank you senator

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.570
okay in 2011 you were a judge on one of

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.740
the challenges to the affordable care

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:55.809
act the court you sat upon held there

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.990
that you dissented on procedural grounds

00:18:55.809 --> 00:19:01.300
on the the court which upheld the Act

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.880
one of your former law clerks described

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.100
your opinion in that case and that's the

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.160
seven sky case as quote a thorough

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.080
takedown of the individual mandate he

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.450
would go on to clerk for Supreme Court

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.809
Justice Kennedy that year or the next

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:18.550
year and the Supreme Court then held or

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:20.170
heard the challenge to the Affordable

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.990
Care Act and according to him your

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.090
opinion was quote a roadmap for the

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.120
dissenting justices the ones who would

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.800
have struck down the Affordable Care Act

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.530
giving you wrote the quote roadmap

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.900
according to your law clerk could one

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.700
reasonably conclude that you would have

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.760
voted to strike down the Affordable Care

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:42.220
Act had you been on the Supreme Court

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:45.100
couple points senator first I concluded

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.809
in one case I upheld the Affordable Care

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.400
Act against an origination clause

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:50.950
challenged in the case you're referring

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.190
to I did not reach the merits but I

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:57.460
discussed the merits Pro that were being

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.290
argued in both directions my opinions

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.920
been described as the road map for both

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:06.370
sides because I described both positions

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.130
and actually it wasn't a roadmap at all

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:12.280
because I we started as a takedown well

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:18.280
I speak for myself and my own opinions

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:20.470
speak for themselves and the Chairman

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.910
wants to close this questioning so we

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.930
can leave it with that all right judge

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:26.910
thank you

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.910
god bless you and God bless america
