does she mean

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.315
Because she was not fighting

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.217

"My people."

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.988
Slow down, Omarosa Parks,
slow down.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.590
You can't roll hard with
President Trump for a year

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.159

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.261
"That was really weird,
right?"

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.863
Anyone else notice that?
It was just me? Anyone?

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.265
Oh, and if you're wondering

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.264
How can you say that
about the president

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:48.935
three years after we all
said that about the president?

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.237
How?

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.105
Seriously, though?
Omarosa had to spend a year

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.041
in the White House to learn
that Donald Trump

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.275
doesn't know what he's doing?

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.044
Like, I can't wait for
her next book,

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:02.114
"Donald Trump: Something's
Wrong With His Hair."

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.950
But the revelations
in Omarosa's book

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.152
aren't even the juicy
part of the story,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.554
because it turns out that,
unlike James Comey,

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.523
she wasn't just making notes.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.491
She was making tapes.

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:15.595 line:0%

<i> in the high security

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.825
- What's weird about this
is that Omarosa

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.493
is presenting these tapes
as evidence

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:50.596
that she was treated unfairly,
but from what she released,

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.498
John Kelly
doesn't sound that bad.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.166
If anything,
he just sounded like a guy

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.202
who had a lot more important
things to do, you know,

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.371
He's just like, "Look, I can't
have this conversation

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.506
"right now--the president
accidentally swallowed

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.075
"the nuclear launch codes,
and, uh,

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:05.144
we need to come up with
some new ones, ASAP."

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:07.179
Like, if anything,
these tapes may have

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.081
landed Omarosa in hot water,

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.284
because she took
a recording device

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.986
into the White House
Situation Room.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.521
That's the room
where presidents hold

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.056
the most
classified meetings,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.392
like highly classified,
things that are too secret

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.926
for the Oval Office.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.361
Like, the Bin Laden raid

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.230
was run from
the Situation Room.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.333
I mean, I know now we don't now
what they use that room for

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.201
under Trump, I mean,
I bet if we checked

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.537
the security cam footage now,
we'd just see like Ben Carson

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.639
sneaking in to take naps
and...

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:36.342
and Don junior going in there
to practice his karate.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.011
You know, just like [as Don]
"The true master is one

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.447
who can strike without
waking me up."

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.716
And as if taping
the Chief of Staff

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.718
in the Situation Room
wasn't scandalous enough,

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:49.288
today, Omarosa dropped
her latest mixed tape,

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.058
and this one features
the president himself.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.427
Oh, and please listen
to how Trump reacts

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.464
when he "finds out"
Omarosa has been fired.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.188
- "I don't love you
leaving at all.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:25.257
"I just found out! They run
a big operation, Omarosa.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.560
God damn it!"

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.295
You know, for a man who
lies as much as Trump,

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.963
you'd think he'd be
better at it.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:35.668
He's like, "No.
I'm so upset about<i> this!"</i>

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.370
I wonder if he did this
to people

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.771
who got fired from
"The Apprentice,"

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:40.806
if he also called them,
he's like, "Hey, Gary,

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.609
"I just saw last night's
episode--what happened?

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:46.612

That's so messed up.
Especially since Trump

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.910

have a wife who wants to run.

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:40.112

in this whole thing--

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:48.320
he's so FBI that he gets
insulted

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:50.189
and he's just like,
"Okay. Okay, sir."

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.624
That's all he does?

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:52.925
'Cause the Commander-in-Chief
insults him,

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.360
he treats it like
it's an order:

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.329
"Why don't you ask your wife

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.637
it's well known
that President Trump

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.838
wasn't a fan of
Andrew McCabe,

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.506

00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.244

that back in December,

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:15.080
Trump tweeted, "McCabe

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:43.275
He said he didn't want
McCabe to get his pension,

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:22.821
to play Spider-Man,
you've got to remember

00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:25.557
that he's actually
been in Congress since 1999.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.593
Yeah. That was so long ago,
Britney Spears

00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:31.797
hadn't even done it
again yet.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.199
Yeah. She'd only done it
one time,

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:37.502
and remember, we all thought
that would be the only time.

00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:39.738
We were so naive back then.

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:42.074
Now, other than pretending
that he was upset

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:43.575
about stuff
President Trump said,

00:15:43.608 --> 00:15:45.844
the thing that Paul Ryan
was most famous for

00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:48.347
was his deep, sincere concern

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.248
about America's national debt.

00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:51.917 line:0%
- We are fiscal conservatives.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.685 align:start position:0% line:0%
What that means is
we believe

00:15:53.718 --> 00:15:55.354 align:start position:0% line:0%
government should not
live beyond its means.

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.222 line:0%
The debt is projected to grow

00:15:57.255 --> 00:15:59.391 line:0%
to truly catastrophic levels
in the near future,

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:02.661 line:0%
leading to an economic collapse
and a diminished future.

00:16:02.694 --> 00:16:04.830 line:0%
Bringing our deficit
up to a trillion dollars

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:07.566 line:0%
will only serve to actually
weaken the dollar.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.468 line:0%
I don't know what it would
take for a person

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.970 line:0%
to completely sell out the will
of the American people,

00:16:12.003 --> 00:16:13.605 line:0%
sell out the federal budget,

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:15.974 line:0%
sell out our children
and grandchildren.

00:16:16.007 --> 00:16:18.477 line:0%
What on earth could you
be given in legislation

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.178 line:0%
to make you vote for that?

00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:22.114
- Uh...tax cuts?

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:25.250
(bell dinging)
Oh! I got it right!

00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:27.486
I got it right.
Thank you!

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:30.088
[cheers and applause]
Thank you!

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:32.557
Yeah because, you see,
after eight years

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.927
of blaming President Obama for
the ballooning national debts,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.897
last year when the Republicans
took over the entire government

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.665
under the leadership
of Paul Ryan,

00:16:40.698 --> 00:16:42.234
here's what they did.

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.802 line:0%
- The two biggest
achievements for me

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:47.272 line:0%
are, first, the major reform
of our tax code

00:16:47.305 --> 00:16:49.141 line:0%
for the first time
in 36 years,

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.009 line:0%
which has already been a huge
success for this country,

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.177 line:0%
and that's something
I been working on

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.545 line:0%
my entire adult life.

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.947 line:0%
- New forecasts say
the U.S. budget deficit

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.949 line:0%
will balloon
in the next few years,

00:16:57.982 --> 00:17:00.786 line:0%
largely thanks to the
Republican tax cuts.

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:04.923 line:0%
- The CPO says it'll hit
a trillion dollars by 2020.

00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:06.925
- Yeah. But I mean, look,
come on, come on.

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.860
Let's not be haters.
What's a few trillion dollars

00:17:08.893 --> 00:17:10.729
between friends, right?

00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:13.432
Just because Paul Ryan turned
out to be a complete fraud

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.200
doesn't mean
we can't give him

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:17.069
the sendoff that he deserves.

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.337
Paul Ryan is leaving us,
folks.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.808
So let's pour out a 40.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.077
40 grams of protein,
of course.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.647 line:0%
Yeah. Just for him,
the way he would like it.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.715 line:0%
[laughter, applause]

00:17:30.748 --> 00:17:32.684 line:0%
Just for you, Paul.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.219
Not John Kelly.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:10.322
He was just about to get Trump
to act presidential.

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:13.592
He just needed one more week!
So close.

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:17.062
I think it's fair to say that
being Trump's Chief of Staff

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.830
did not work out well
for John Kelly.

00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:21.266
Because remember,
he came into the job

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:23.435
known as a respected
four-star general,

00:18:23.468 --> 00:18:25.137
and now he's leaving the job

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.372
known as the guy
who fired Omarosa.

00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:29.407
Like...that's a downgrade.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.610
That's actually the saddest
thing about John Kelly.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:34.012
It seems like his whole job
was just telling other staffers

00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:35.347
that Trump was firing them.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.215
'Cause he had to fire Omarosa,

00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:39.117
he fired Scaramucci,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.153
he fired Steve Bannon,
he fired Rex Tillerson,

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.687
he fired Jeff Sessions.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.457
I wouldn't be shocked if Trump
made him fire himself.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.492
He was just there like,
"The president has requested

00:18:47.525 --> 00:18:50.128
your resignation."
"What? After all I've done?"

00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.396
"Please, try to leave
with some dignity."

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:52.597
"Go to hell,
you son of a bitch!"

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.399

where the beautiful
but mysterious woman

00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:14.986
with the foreign accent
is actually a secret assassin?

00:19:15.019 --> 00:19:17.822

Melania does not mess around.

We barely hear from her,

00:19:56.294 --> 00:19:59.598
and then when she does speak,
it's to fire somebody?

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.099
And like,
whatever this lady did

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:03.401
must have made Melania so mad,
'cause you realize

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:06.504
Trump cheats on her, and she's
pretty chill about it.

00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:08.106
But then Melania
goes on a flight,

00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.541
and all of a sudden,
she's all like,

00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:11.409
[accent] "Bitch took
aisle seat."

00:20:11.442 --> 00:20:13.211
[laughter]

00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:16.648
And like, honestly, I don't
even know who this is.

00:20:16.681 --> 00:20:20.185
Mira Ricardel? Who is this
person that they're firing?

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:23.588
Like, they're running out of
people we know to fire.

00:20:23.621 --> 00:20:26.057
This is like "Walking Dead",

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.961
