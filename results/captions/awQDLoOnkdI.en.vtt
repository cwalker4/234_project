00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.620
SHANE SMITH: I've
been to the most

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.970
fucked up place on Earth--

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.800
twice.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.206
The Hermit Kingdom
of North Korea.

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:26.456
(WHISPERING) It's
totally insane.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.440
The thing is, when you
go to North Korea,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.550
you're not a tourist.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.915
You're on a
government-sanctioned tour.

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:41.850
And you can't go anywhere
outside your hotel without

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.280
your guide, your translator,
and your secret police.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.610
You're also not allowed
cellphones, radios, or

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
computers of any kind, and are
taken on a tightly scheduled,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.730
highly orchestrated tour--

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.580
only of the sites and
monuments that

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.830
they want you to see.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.070
So you end up travelling for
hours and hours on empty roads

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.871
only to see the Palace of the
People, or the Library of the

00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:06.760
People, or the Soccer
Team of the People.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.390
The only thing you never get to
actually meet is the people

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.140
of the people.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.180
In fact, you're not allowed to
talk to anyone unless they're

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.709
officially sanctioned
as part of the tour.

[VOCAL MUSIC]

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.810
So when I heard that North Korea
was actually exporting

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.480
its own people as a way to
generate much-needed hard

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.130
currency, I wanted to go and see
if I could actually talk

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.940
to them and maybe find out what
it's actually like to

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.230
live inside the Hermit
Kingdom.

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.530
We found out from one of our
correspondents in Russia that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.030
there were actually secret
North Korean labor camps

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.030
hidden in the depths
of Siberia.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.900
So we flew to the far eastern
region of Russia and hopped on

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.070
the Trans-Siberian railway,
which is essentially the only

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.540
lifeline for Siberia and
the Far East region.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.140
Her bum was hanging
out of her shorts.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.930
We're here in Khabarovsk in
Siberia, we're about to get on

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.990
this train for about
28 hours to go to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.850
the middle of nowhere.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.270
And we're going to go check out
the secret North Korean

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.430
labor camps in Siberia.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.816
It's hot as shit.

SIMON OSTROVSKY: Hi.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.190
SHANE SMITH: My name is Shane.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.570
I'm from America.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.780
We're here with our
friend Simon.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.710
We've been on the train
for a long time.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.420
We're going a bit goofy.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.580
Where are we going?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.560
SIMON OSTROVSKY: We're going to
Tynda, in the Amur region

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.690
of Russia, in the Far East to
look for the North Koreans.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.640
SHANE SMITH: The thing about
this is, it's mind boggling

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.690
that North Korea, the most
hermetic state in the world,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.740
the Hermit Kingdom it's
actually called, is

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.960
outsourcing its labor.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.500
But they outsource their labor
into miniature North Korean

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.730
villages so that you don't ever
lose the North Korean

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.740
experience.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.640
So it's like North Korean-type
buildings, North Korean

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.630
propaganda, North Korean
pictures, North Korean songs.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.830
They wake up and sing the
North Korean anthem.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.500
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They bring
North Koreans in for

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.130
three-year contracts.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.150
After they're done working here,
they get sent back to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.750
North Korea.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.520
They spend a month in a
reintegration camp to get all

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.720
of the propaganda that
they've missed.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.820
Most of the workers are over 40
years old, so they all have

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.260
families back home.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.570
So they know that if they try to
run away, then their family

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.980
back home gets in trouble.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.230
SHANE SMITH: The North Koreans
are making money to support

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.180
the regime.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.740
And these poor dudes are out
there in the middle of nowhere

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.880
singing "God save Kim Jong-Il"
and working in near-slave

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.290
conditions.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.610
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This is kind
of the only place where you

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.400
can actually have an entre into
how they actually live

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.090
day-to-day.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.670
SHANE SMITH: Question--

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.750
are we going to get assassinated
for going to talk

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.850
to the North Koreans?

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.459
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
Quite possibly.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.420
People aren't going to
be happy to see us.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.670
That's for sure.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.610
SHANE SMITH: Why is it that the
best stories always take

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.440
so long to get to?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.180
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Because all
of the easy-to-get-to ones

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.944
have been done by programs
better than yours.

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:35.240
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.230
He's a prickly pear, this guy.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.420
He's a prickly pear.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.516
You should be British because
you're a cunt.

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:44.760
[LAUGH]

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.810
Now, you have to remember that
everything in Siberia, almost

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.450
without exception, is very,
very fucking far away from

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.390
everything else.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.040
And even though it was the
height of summer and 100

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.210
degrees outside, because it's
Russia, the heat gauge on the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.220
train had been turned on full
and then broken off--

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.630
probably circa 1971.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.420
So the experience is essentially
like being trapped

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:17.950
on a boiling-hot, reeking,
drunken sauna 24 hours a day.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.450
Oh shit, hello.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.010
