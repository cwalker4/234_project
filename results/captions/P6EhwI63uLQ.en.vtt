Hello and Welcome
 I’m Gina Shakespeare.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.720
 Today on Declassified the Clinton Foundation
 ‘Pay to Play’ Model is Under Investigation.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.480
That’s right we have seven 
documented examples 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.280
of when payments to the Clintons and their foundation 
coincided with political favors

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920
This story written
 by Seamus Bruner,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 Seamus is the associate director of research 
at the Government Accountability Institute

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.240
 and author of the new book

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.560
“Compromised: How Money and Politics
 Drive FBI Corruption.”

 details are in the description below.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.360
Lets begin with some maths,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 the Clinton Foundation has raised more than $2 billion
 since its inception in 1997,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.960
 and Bill and Hillary Clinton have been paid more 
than $150 million for delivering speeches.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.880
 Notably, these payments increased dramatically
 after Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state in 2009.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.720
The tens of millions of dollars that flowed directly
 to the Clintons or their foundation,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.080
 from foreign governments or 
other entities (or “benefactors”) 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.600
who could benefit from Secretary 
Clinton’s actions,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.640
 seem to pose inherent
 conflicts of interest.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.040
The foundation is currently being probed 
by U.S. Attorney John Huber

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.680
who was assigned by then-Attorney General
 Jeff Sessions—for alleged wrongdoing.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.720
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told 
The Hill on Nov. 20. That

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.400
 “Mr. Huber with the Department of Justice 
and FBI has been having an investigation,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.680
 at least part of his task was to look
 at the Clinton Foundation

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880
 and what may or may 
not have happened

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.760
 as it relates to improper activity 
with that charitable foundation,” 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.400
A scheduled testimony by Huber 
before Congress was postponed

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.600
 in response to the funeral of late 
President George H.W. Bush.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.200
The Clintons’ apparent conflicts 
were concealed

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 and their potential culpability has been 
mitigated by several factors: 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.440
the memorandum of understanding (MOU)
 reached with Obama’s presidential transition team; 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440
special government employee (SGE) waivers; 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.160
and the State Department’s 
ethics review apparatus.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.800
The MOU was an agreement between
 the Clinton Foundation

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 and the Obama transition team that 
outlined certain requirements 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.720
for Hillary Clinton’s confirmation as 
secretary of state in 2009.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 The MOU identified a set of protocols that supposedly
 addressed concerns about possible foreign influence.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.280
The foundation promised to observe 
these protocols—including,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.160
 primarily, the increased and timely
 disclosure of payments.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.560
 These essential requirements included the annual 
publication of Clinton Foundation donors

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.800
 and restrictions on donations 
from foreign governments.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.440
The MOU satisfied lawmakers 
and the media,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.160
 and Clinton was near-unanimously
 confirmed in January 2009.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.040
 However, the MOU was violated 
almost immediately,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.880
 and would be so repeatedly (in spirit and in letter) 
throughout Clinton’s tenure.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 For example, from the beginning of 
Clinton’s tenure in 2009,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.480
 the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) never 
reported any of its foreign donors,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.320
 as acknowledged by CHAI spokeswoman 
Maura Daley in 2015.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.400
 Other significant violations include the failure to 
report donors annually,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 the failure to disclose foreign-
government donations,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.160
 and the failure to submit donations and speech 
payments for ethics reviews.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.720
Absent the blanket immunity document,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.840
 every payment to the Clintons
 from foreign entities

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.400
with interests that Secretary Clinton 
could influence was, at best, 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.800
a potential conflict of interest and, 
at worst, a bribe.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.680
Next up Clinton State Department’s
 ‘Special’ Employees

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.600
In addition to the tens of millions in foreign funds
 that flowed to the Clinton Foundation,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.200
 the Clintons received tens of millions 
of dollars in the form of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.920
 Bill Clinton’s speaking fees and 
consulting arrangements.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.440
 Instead of these payments being reviewed by neutral 
or third-party ethics officials,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.840
 they were reviewed by the State 
Department under Hillary Clinton

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 and the process specifically involved longtime 
Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.880
It is worth noting that Hillary Clinton’s
 State Department 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.600
operated without an inspector general for 
the entirety of her tenure

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.120
an unprecedented duration without 
a watchdog in place.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.240
 Furthermore, Clinton granted SGE 
waivers to her closest staffers

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.320
such as Mills, Huma Abedin,
 Declan Kelly,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.360
 and approximately 100 others

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.520
that allowed these staffers to work for both the State
 Department and other for-profit entities.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 SGE status is essentially a conflict
 of interest waiver.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.760
Abedin was Hillary Clinton’s closest aide 
at the State Department.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.400
 The controversial SGE waiver allowed her to
 simultaneously work for Clinton,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.080
 the State Department,
 the Clinton Foundation,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.080
 and consulting firm 
Teneo Strategies.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.800
 For example, Teneo—a for-profit firm
 co-founded by Doug Band

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.560
paid Abedin $355,000, while State paid
 her $135,000 as an SGE.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.320
 Abedin frequently corresponded with 
Clinton Foundation and Teneo executive Band 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.920
and helped grant favors to Clinton Foundation 
donors and Teneo clients.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.720
Next up Teneo &amp; ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.760
Clinton Foundation official Doug Band is 
a longtime personal assistant

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.320
to Bill Clinton who helped capitalize and expand
 the Clinton Foundation in 2001.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.680
 Emails first revealed by Judicial Watch show 
that from the beginning of Hillary Clinton’s tenure,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.000
 Band frequently emailed Clinton State Department
 aides requesting favors for Foundation donors.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.520
 Abedin would usually respond immediately to 
indicate the favor request 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.280
had been received and
 was under consideration.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.280
 Favors (described below) were granted 
to foundation donors,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.920
 leading to widespread criticisms 
of “pay to play.”

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.480
Band’s firm, Teneo,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.520
 was founded by Band and longtime Clinton friend
 and fundraiser Kelly in November 2009.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 Kelly raised funds for Hillary Clinton’s 
campaigns since 2000

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.360
 and raised more than $2 million for her
 2008 presidential bid.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.920
 In September 2009, Hillary Clinton appointed Kelly to the State 
Department as “special economic envoy.” 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.000
While at the State Department,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.400
 Kelly received an SGE waiver and continued to
 advise his for-profit clients.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.360
 Teneo hired Bill Clinton in 
2011 as an adviser 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.440
but “changed the relationship” after criticism that 
it had the appearance of conflicts.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.000
 Teneo subsequently considered 
Clinton “a client.”

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.840
A leaked 2011 internal memo drafted 
by Band revealed Teneo had approximately 20 clients

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.760
many of whom are also 
Clinton donors.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.480
 In his memo, Band described Teneo as
 an agent for “Bill Clinton, Inc.” 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.120
that was dedicated to 
“helping the President secure 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.960
and engage in for-profit activities—including speeches,
 books,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.560
 and advisory service engagements.”

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.600
 Furthermore, Band and Kelly 
negotiated “in-kind services 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.440
for the President and his family—
for personal travel,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.680
 hospitality, vacation, and the like.”

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.360
Band admits in the memo 
that Teneo clients

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.760
 were encouraged to make donations 
to the Clinton Foundation.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.000
 After Teneo clients became 
foundation donors,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.960
 they were encouraged to make payments
 to “Bill Clinton, Inc.” 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.360
The 2011 Band memo refutes 
claims by the Clintons

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.280
 that the Clinton Foundation provided
 them no direct benefits.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.440
Next up Laureate Hired Bill as Honorary Chancellor,
 US AID Funds Increased

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.360
When Hillary Clinton 
became secretary of state,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.440
 she “wrested control of USAID and influence
 over billions in foreign assistance,”

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.880
 according to a 2011 article
 by the Daily Beast.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.120
She appointed Rajiv Shah as 
USAID administrator; 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.760
USAID then funded numerous multimillion-dollar 
“partnerships” with Clinton benefactors.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.960
 The grants were made in close proximity 
to payments to the Clinton Foundation.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.360
 One example is the timing of USAID grants to a
 charity run by Bill Clinton’s friend Doug Becker.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.800
 Laureate also is listed as a $1 million to $5 million 
donor to the Clinton Foundation.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.600
 In 2009, Bill Clinton began giving speeches at 
Laureate campuses in Spain,Brazil, and Peru.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.640
In August 2009, then-Secretary Clinton
 told Mills to invite Becker

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.000
 (“who Bill likes a lot”) to a State
 Department dinner.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.640
 Hillary Clinton made Laureate part of her 
State Department Global Partnership,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.720
 and her undersecretary praised Laureate 
for “doing such important work.”

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.960
In April 2010, Laureate appointed Bill Clinton
 as their “honorary chancellor” 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.120
and paid him over $16 million 
over the next five years.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.720
 Also, in 2010, Laureate and the
 IYF announced a joint 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.200
$10 million commitment to the 
Clinton Foundation.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.080
While Becker’s Laureate paid Bill Clinton more
 than $16 million between 2010 and 2015,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.560
 USAID grants to Becker’s IYF increased from
 $9 million in 2009 to over $25 million in 2012.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.560
 USAID granted $55 million from 2010
 to 2012 to the IYF.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.280
 Bill Clinton abruptly resigned from
 Laureate in April 2015

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.040
the same month his relationship with 
Laureate was exposed in the book “Clinton Cash.”

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.480
 USAID operates under “substantial guidance 
from the Secretary of State,” 

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.160
according to 64 lawmakers in a July 2016 letter

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.160
 “which creates an appearance that millions of 
dollars in taxpayer money 

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.120
was channeled to IYF by Secretary Clinton’s 
State Department 

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.760
as a kickback for her husband’s generous contract
 as an honorary Laureate chancellor.”

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.320
Next up Shangri-La Received Favors From State
 Department After Hiring Bill

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.520
Billionaire Hollywood producer Steve Bing is a 
longtime Clinton friend and donor.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.320
 Bing is listed as having donated $10 million to $25 
million to the Clinton Foundation.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.520
 Between 2009 and 2010, Bing’s
 construction company,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.320
 Shangri-La Industries LLC,

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.880
 also personally paid Bill Clinton $2.5 
million to be an adviser.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.960
Not long after Bill Clinton’s for-profit consulting 
arrangement was approved,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.720
 Bing requested his first favor.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.440
 On July 16, 2009, a
 Shangri-La executive,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.680
 Zachary Schwartz, asked Band for help 
with reversing the State 

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.400
Department’s denial of a
 travel visa to Cuba.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.160
 Band forwarded the request 
to Abedin, writing,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.760
 “Please call zach asap on this… Important.”
 Abedin responded,

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.480
 “I’ll call zach when we land in India.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.640
” Two weeks later, Bing’s 
team was in Cuba,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.960
 despite the travel restrictions 
for Americans.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.200
Next up UBS Payments to Clinton Foundation
 Increase Following Intervention

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.040
In 2007, Bradley Birkenfeld, a UBS Group
executive-turned-whistleblower,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.120
 revealed that UBS was encouraging
 its North American division

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.200
 to facilitate offshore transfers 
to Switzerland.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.680
 UBS was soon investigated
 by the FBI and IRS 

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.080
for potentially facilitating massive
 criminal tax evasion.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.080
By 2009, the IRS wanted UBS 
to turn over the

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.240
 secret accounts of approximately 
52,000 Americans.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.640
 In 2009, longtime Clinton fundraiser and
 Teneo co-founder Kelly

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.640
 introduced Bill Clinton to UBS
 executive Bob McCann,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.280
 an Irishman and longtime 
client of Kelly’s.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.200
 “Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Mr. McCann
 to support the foundation … 

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.480
[and] also encouraged Mr. McCann to invite 
President Clinton to give several paid speeches,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.000
 which he has done,” 

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.480
according to a leaked memo drafted by Clinton 
Foundation official Band.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.640
Shortly after Barack Obama’s
 2009 inauguration,

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.520
 Secretary Clinton flew to Geneva and met 
with her Swiss counterpart,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.560
 Micheline Calmy-Rey,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.960
 to discuss the UBS crisis.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.840
 By July 2009, Clinton had fully intervened on UBS’s 
behalf and negotiated a settlement with the IRS.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.240
 UBS only had to turn over the details of over
 fourty-four hundred American account holders,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.120
 instead of the
 requested 52,000.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.600
After Clinton’s mysterious intervention,

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.480
 UBS’s donations and sponsorships to the Clinton 
Foundation increased substantially.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.320
 According to The Wall Street Journal,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.640
 “Total donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation 
grew from less than $60,000

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.600
 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 
by the end of 2014,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.080
 according to the foundation and 
the bank.” Furthermore,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240
 UBS sponsored a series of speeches, 
moderated by McCann,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.720
 which directly netted Bill Clinton 
more than $1.5 million.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.720
Next Clinton Benefactors Sought 
Keystone XL Approval.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.760
Canadian pipeline company TransCanada first 
proposed the Keystone XL oil pipeline in 2008.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.160
 Keystone XL would be transporting petroleum 
tar sands from Canada 

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.880
to Texas for processing and thus required State 
Department approval to move forward.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.200
 TransCanada’s then-largest
 shareholder,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.280
 TD Bank, began sponsoring 
speeches by Bill Clinton

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.200
 just days after Obama appointed Hillary Clinton 
as secretary of state,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.400
 paying over $500,000
 for three speeches.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.800
In July 2009, Gordon Giffin,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.480
 a lobbyist for Keystone XL, 
sent an email to Band,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.320
 asking for an invite to an event at which
 Hillary Clinton was speaking.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.400
 Giffin was Bill Clinton’s ambassador to 
Canada from 1997 to 2001 

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.520
and a major donor to Hillary 
Clinton’s campaigns.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.920
 Band forwarded Giffin’s
 request to Abedin,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.600
 and asked, “Can u get him in?” 
Abedin replied,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.800
 “Yes will get him in.”

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.320
In 2010, Secretary Clinton said she was “inclined”
 to approve the project,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.640
 despite the Obama administration’s
 public opposition.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.080
 In August 2011, Bill Clinton said,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.480
 “We should embrace [Keystone XL].”
 In August 2011,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.520
 Clinton’s State Department greenlighted the 
Keystone XL environmental review

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.800
 and stated the project will have “no significant
 impacts” to most U.S. resources.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.720
 TransCanada lobbyist Giffin has donated 
between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:26.280
 And TD Bank paid Bill Clinton more than $1.7 million
 to deliver 10 speeches,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.840
 while the State Department considered
 the Keystone XL approval.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.320
Next up Clinton Donors Cashed In 
on Haiti Earthquake

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.600
On Jan. 12, 2010, Haiti was rocked by a devastating
 7-magnitude earthquake.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.800
 Internal emails sent just hours 
after the quake,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.200
 and released under the Freedom 
of Information Act,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.920
 reveal the State Department was 
communicating with the Clinton Foundation 

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.800
and prioritizing projects for 
Clinton benefactors.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.920
 A top State Department aide to Hillary Clinton 
fielded incoming offers for relief assistance,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.040
 asked the foundation for help 
identifying the offerors,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.080
 and gave special priority to “FOBs”
 (friends of Bill) and “WJC VIPs.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.200
” Less than a month after the quake, 
U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten 

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.800
sent a cable to State Department 
headquarters saying,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.600
 “The Gold Rush is on.”

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.240
In April 2010, the Clinton State Department established
 the Interim Haiti Relief Commission (IHRC)

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.840
—a quasi-governmental entity that 
coordinated relief efforts.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.040
 Bill Clinton and Haitian President Jean-Max 
Bellerive were installed as co-commissioners.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.120
 The IHRC approved projects that would be 
funded by either the State Department,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.080
 USAID, or the Haiti
 Recovery Fund.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.000
The IHRC was Haiti’s second
 unmitigated disaster;

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.600
 one year after the earthquake,

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.280
 global NGO Oxfam reported that “almost no major 
reconstruction projects [had] started.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.240
” In an article, titled “The King and Queen of Haiti,” 
Politico reported,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.640
 “Many of the most notable investments the 
Clintons helped launch,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.000
 such as the new Marriott 
in the capital,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.760
 have primarily benefited 
wealthy foreigners."

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:03.320
 The four-star luxury Marriott is owned by 
Clinton mega-donor Denis O’Brien’s Digicel

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.360
 and was one of the first recovery projects the 
Clinton Foundation facilitated.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.400
 Hillary Clinton’s brother, 
Tony Rodham,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.720
 was a board member 
of VCS Mining,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.480
 which received a lucrative 
gold mining lease

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.440
the first issued in 
Haiti in 50 years.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.880
One of the biggest winners in the aftermath of 
the Haitian earthquake was Digicel,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.520
 one of the largest telecom companies
 in the Caribbean.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.040
 Digicel is owned by Irish
 billionaire O’Brien,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.640
 who is a close friend of Bill Clinton and 
a major foundation donor.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240
 After the Haiti earthquake,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.920
 O’Brien and the Clinton Foundation partnered
 on rebuilding infrastructure 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.480
with substantial 
taxpayer/relief funding.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.840
 USAID, in partnership with the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.280
 provided more than $5 million in
 taxpayer-funded grants to Digicel.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.040
 With the post-earthquake
 USAID funds,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.200
 Digicel gave Haitians free cell phones and accounts 
and massively expanded its user base.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.480
 Digicel then collected fees from the impoverished 
Haitians for every transaction,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.680
 making millions of dollars
 in fees alone.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.360
O’Brien has donated between $5 million and $10 million
 to the Clinton Foundation.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.440
 Between 2010 and 2012,  O’Brien arranged 
several lucrative speeches 

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.800
by Bill Clinton in Ireland,

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.720
as well as a $225,000 Digicel-sponsored 
speech in Jamaica.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.600
 The timing of these speeches coincided with major 
grant awards to Digicel from USAID.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.120
 As a 94-percent stakeholder
 in Digicel,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.160
 O’Brien cashed in $650 million worth of
 dividends in 2014 alone.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.760
According to an analysis by the Center for
 Economic Policy Research,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.560
 less than 1 percent of USAID funds ($1.3 billion) went 
to local Haitian groups 

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.080
and more than 60 percent went to organizations 
operating inside the Washington Beltway.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.560
 Four years later, USAID funds were 
still unaccounted for.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.960
Not only did the Clinton State Department
 and Clinton Foundation

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.000
 bungle relief efforts as 
Haitians suffered,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.520
 but Clinton friends and donors were 
given sweetheart deals.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.200
Next up New Details on 
Uranium One Scandal

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.400
Uranium One was a Canadian 
mining company 

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.200
whose assets included mines 
in Utah and Wyoming,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.160
 amounting to a projected 20 percent of domestic
 uranium production capacity at the time.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.600
 The company was acquired in 2010
 by Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ),

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.480
 a fully controlled subsidiary of Russian state-owned
 nuclear conglomerate Rosatom.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.640
 The purchase of Uranium One required a
 review by Obama’s Committee

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.760
 on Foreign Investment 
in the U.S. (CFIUS),

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.800
 since there were significant national
 security implications.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.840
 As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was obligated to
 review the sale.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.360
As detailed in the book 
“Clinton Cash,” 

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.280
nine investors linked to Uranium One donated 
approximately $145 million 

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.520
to the Clinton Foundation in close 
proximity to the CFIUS review.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.440
 These investors included one of the
 Clintons’ largest benefactors,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.440
 billionaire Canadian mining mogul
 Frank Giustra,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.200
 as well as the then-chairman of 
Uranium One, Ian Telfer. 

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.160
Additionally, in June 2010, Bill Clinton was 
paid $500,000 by Renaissance Capital

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.280
a Kremlin-backed bank that had been promoting
 Uranium One investment.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.760
Bill Clinton’s office also requested
 permission for him 

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.400
to meet with one of Rosatom’s board members,
 Arkady Dvorkovich.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.680
 The speech was reviewed by the 
Clinton State Department

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.160
 and approved within two
 days of the request.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.360
 Dvorkovich attended Clinton’s 
Moscow speech,

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.720
 and after the speech, Clinton
 visited Vladimir Putin,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.560
 who thanked him for speaking.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.720
Ted Kassinger is an attorney 
and resident CFIUS expert 

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.480
at the international law firm 
O’Melveny &amp; Myers.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.520
 While Kassinger advised Clinton’s State
 Department from 2010 to 2013,

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.400
 records indicate he was also advising the 
Russians on the takeover of Uranium One.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.760
 Kassinger was specifically identified as
 the lead “U.S. Counsel” 

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.960
advising ARMZ in an announcement 
about the successful takeover.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.680
Kassinger also repeatedly met with Hillary
 Clinton’s undersecretary Jose Fernandez in 2010.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.200
 Kassinger and Fernandez even met directly
 with Clinton in April 2010,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.840
 just two months before ARMZ announced its intention 
to take a controlling stake in Uranium One.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.200
In 2015, internal emails 
sent by John Podesta

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.160
who would later become the chairman 
of Clinton’s presidential campaign

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.040
just days before the release of the
 book “Clinton Cash,” 

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.280
suggest Fernandez was made the
 fall guy for the CFIUS approval.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.120
On March 29, 2015, Fernandez 
emailed Podesta: “Hi John,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.760
 I trust you are getting a brief rest
 after a job well done.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.440
 Thanks no doubt to your recommendation 

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.960
I have joined the CAP [Center for American Progress] 
board of trustees,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.520
 which I’m finding extremely
 rewarding[emphasis added].”

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.000
Less than three weeks later,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.440
 on April 17, Fernandez 
emailed Podesta again 

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.200
and expressed willingness “to do all I can to
 support Secretary Clinton” 

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.960
as The New York Times prepared to release
 their front-page expose

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.040
 and reached out to Clinton campaign
 spokesman Brian Fallon.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.880
In Fallon’s rebuttal to The New York 
Times’ questions 

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.800
surrounding Clinton’s involvement in the
 sale of Uranium One,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.640
 he quoted Fernandez. “As you are 
aware,” Fallon stated,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.440
 “Mr. Fernandez has personally 
attested that

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.760
 ‘Secretary Clinton never intervened with [him] 
on any CFIUS matter.’”

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.480
The implication was clear: Fernandez was taking
 the blame for the Uranium One CFIUS decision.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.320
 The timing is damning and
 suggests a quid pro quo:

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.640
 Fernandez took the fall for
 Uranium One

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.240
 and he received a “very rewarding” board
 position thanks to Podesta’s recommendation.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.040
Besides the State Department,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.360
 two other notable figures gave
 their approval to CFIUS 

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.320
for the Uranium One deal: FBI 
Director Robert Mueller,

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.160
 and Attorney General Eric Holder.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.080
 While Mueller and Holder didn’t apparently
 receive millions of dollars

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.320
 from Uranium One investors,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.120
 they didn’t act to block the 
Russian nuclear takeover,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.400
 despite concerning
 evidence in their hands.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.080
At the time of the Uranium 
One sale in 2010,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.480
 the FBI was intimately aware of a 
Russian espionage scheme 

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.640
and a separate Russian racketeering and bribery 
scheme targeting the U.S. nuclear industry.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.600
The Hill reported in 
October 2017 that 

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.920
“The FBI had gathered 
substantial evidence

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.280
 that Russian nuclear industry officials
 were engaged in bribery,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.640
 kickbacks, extortion and
 money laundering 

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.560
designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy 
business inside the United States,”

Next up Increase in Weapons Sales
 to Foundation Donors

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.600
The State Department is responsible for approving 
commercial arms sales to foreign countries,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.080
 and the secretary of state determines 
which countries get approved.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.000
 Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved 
commercial weapons sales 

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.040
totaling $165 billion to 20 countries that donated
 to the Clinton Foundation,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.120
 according to an analysis by 
International Business Times.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.880
 Under Hillary Clinton’s direction,

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.720
 the State Department increased 
weapons sales 143 percent

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.640
 to 16 Clinton Foundation foreign donors—
$151 billion in total sales,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.000
 compared with just over $105 billion for the 
same time period under the Bush administration.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.720
 Five countries with notorious 
human-rights abuses

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.080
 donated large sums to the 
Clinton Foundation 

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.800
and saw more than 97 percent increases in their State 
Department-approved weapons deals.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.480
Next up we go to Qatar

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.400
In a 2009 cable, Clinton 
acknowledged,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.320
 “Qatar’s overall level of [counter 
terrorism] cooperation 

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.720
with the U.S. is considered the 
worst in the region.”

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.840
 In 2010, the Clinton State Department criticized Qatar
for its human-rights abuses.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.160
According to leaked emails from 2014,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.160
 Hillary Clinton acknowledged
 that Qatar and Saudi Arabia 

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.600
were “providing clandestine
 financial and logistic support”

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.840
 to the ISIS terrorist group and
 other radical groups.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.360
 Nonetheless, during Secretary
 Clinton’s tenure,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.360
 the State Department approved $4.3 billion in 
arms purchase agreements for Qatar

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.280
a 14-fold increase from her predecessor.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.400
Qatar has donated between $1 million
 and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.520
 including a controversial $1 million
 “birthday gift” for Bill Clinton

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.160
 in 2012 while Hillary Clinton was
secretary of state.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.120
 Despite that the foundation was required 
to disclose large donations from foreign governments,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.400
 the Clinton Foundation confirmed in 2015
 that the $1 million payment wasn’t reviewed by ethics officials.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.000
Next up the United Arab Emirates

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.120
According to a 2009
 diplomatic cable,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.200
 Secretary Clinton knew that entities within the 
United Arab Emirates supported terrorism.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.520
 “UAE-based donors have provided financial 
support to a variety of terrorist groups,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.600
 including al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and Hamas,” 
Clinton stated.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:37.840
 In 2010,  Human Rights Watch reported that the 
UAE committed atrocious human-rights abuses,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.800
 including “torture,restrictions 
on freedoms of expression 

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.360
and association, and violations
 of women’s rights.” 

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.760
According to Human
 Rights Watch,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.680
 the situation worsened each 
year from 2009 to 2012.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.800
Nonetheless, the UAE received a 10-fold
 increase—one of the largest

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.520
in Clinton-approved weapons sales.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.600
 Sales to the UAE totaled nearly $25 billion 
during Clinton’s tenure,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.640
 compared with $2.2 billion during the comparable
 period under Clinton’s predecessor.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.200
The UAE is a major Clinton 
Foundation donor.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.000
Next up, Saudi Arabia

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.560
The Saudis have a long history
 with the Clintons 

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.040
and have donated between $10 million and $25 million
 to the Clinton Foundation, cumulatively.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.760
 Additionally, a group called 
Friends of Saudi Arabia 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880
has donated between $1
 million and $5 million.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.200
 In 2009, Secretary Clinton
 lamented the 

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.600
“ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to
 treat terrorist financing 

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.120
emanating from Saudi Arabia as
 a strategic priority,”

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.160
 according to a leaked
 diplomatic cable.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.200
 Nonetheless, the Saudis received State 
Department approval in 2011 

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:50.400
for a $29 billion deal to acquire Boeing fighter jets 
that was a “top priority” for Secretary Clinton personally,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.120
 according to her aide
 Andrew Shapiro.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.640
 According to leaked internal 
department emails,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.800
 she and her staff reportedly
 worked behind the scenes

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.200
 to get the Saudi “Christmas present” 
from Boeing approved.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.720
Next up, Algeria

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.600
 In 2015, the Clinton Foundation revealed
 $26 million in undisclosed donations.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.400
 Among those payments
 was one of $500,000 from the government 
of Algeria.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.040
 This was an egregious violation 
of the MOU,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.400
 especially considering Hillary 
Clinton’s State Department 

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.440
approved massive increases in 
weapons sales to that country.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.440
 The Clinton Foundation admitted
 the Algeria payment 

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.000
violated ethics rules and downplayed
 it as “an oversight.”

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.840
Next up, Bahrain

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.040
The Crown Prince of Bahrain committed $32 
million to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005,

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.160
 and the country is listed as a $50,000
 to $100,000 donor.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.680
 Clinton Foundation official 
Doug Band emailed 

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.360
State Department official Huma
 Abedin in June 2009,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.400
 seeking to set up a meeting for “our good friend”
 the Crown Prince of Bahrain.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.560
 Abedin responded that Crown Prince Salman
 bin Hamad al Khalifa 

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.560
had sought a meeting with Secretary Clinton
 the previous week “thru normal channels,”

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.040
 and that Clinton “doesn’t want to commit to 
anything for Thurs or Fri until she knows how she will feel.”

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.960
It is unclear why the Crown Prince chose
 to reach out to the State 

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.480
Department through the Clinton
 Foundation backchannel.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.400
 However, the email is a clear
 indication that the foundation

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.640
 served as a backchannel for donor access to
 the Clinton State Department.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.320
Next up Boeing, Lockheed, and 
Clinton Speeches

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.720
Bill Clinton was reportedly paid 
over $600,000 for speeches 

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.160
sponsored by entities that benefitted 
from arms-purchase approvals

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 by Secretary Clinton’s
 State Department.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:42.120
 The speeches included a $175,000 keynote address paid 
for by the Kuwait-America Foundation,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.640
 hosted at the Kuwaiti ambassador’s house
 and sponsored in part by Boeing.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.960
 Kuwait has donated between $5 million 
and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation 

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.960
and received increased weapons sales
 during Secretary Clinton’s tenure.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.280
In April 2009, Lockheed Martin
 donated $1 million

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.680
 to the U.S. Institute of Peace to sponsor
 their Dean Acheson lecture.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.400
 Months later, Secretary Clinton was
 selected as the first speaker,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.400
 sponsored by Lockheed’s contribution.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.080
 The Chamber of Commerce in Egypt paid Bill Clinton
 $250,000 to deliver a speech in Cairo in 2010,

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.080
 which has reportedly been 
linked to Lockheed.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.760
 The company received two 
major weapons approvals

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.200
 from the State Department 
just days before the Cairo speech.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.200
 Lockheed became a Clinton
 Foundation donor in 2010,

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.520
 and during that year, the State Department
 approved 17 arms deals for Lockheed.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.640
 In 2011, the firm was a primary 
contractor on a $650 million

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.440
 State Department-approved
 award to Qatar.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.800
Like Boeing, Lockheed hasn’t donated 
to the Clinton Foundation

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.000
 since Clinton lost the 2016 
presidential election.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.640
In May 2010, the Russians got a $3.7 billion
 arms deal with Boeing,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.040
 approved by the State Department.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.120
 “This is a shameless pitch for Rosavia … 
to buy Boeing aircraft,” Hillary Clinton said,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.600
 while touring a Boeing
 factory in Moscow.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.400
 In August 2010, Boeing donated 
$900,000 to Haiti relief efforts

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.120
 through the Clinton Foundation.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.120
 Two months later, the 
Clinton State Department

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.120
 approved a $29 billion sale of fighter
 jets to Saudi Arabia.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.920
 Boeing has donated between $1 million 
and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation,

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.120
 and has sponsored at least two speeches that
 enriched the Clintons directly.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.200
And finally today a 
Drop in Donations

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.000
The pattern of payments to the Clintons reveals 
how intertwined money and power are.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.200
 When the Clintons had the 
power to grant political favors,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.880
 their income and 
donations skyrocketed.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.840
 Bill Clinton’s speaking fees tripled during 
Hillary Clinton’s tenure at the State Department.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.720
Almost immediately after Hillary
 Clinton lost the 2016 election,

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.360
 donations by foreign governments
 sharply dropped.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.400
 According to the Clinton Foundation’s 
2014 IRS filing,

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.240
 total contributions amounted 
to $217 million.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.440
 The foundation’s 2017 filing revealed contributions
 amounting to just $22 million.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:12.120
 This means support for the Clintons’ global 
charitable enterprise fell by nearly 90 percent.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.800
I do trust you’ve enjoyed this episode

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.760
 and learning about the critical details related 
to the Clinton Foundations ‘Pay to Play’ Model,

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.400
 that is now under investigation.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.840
