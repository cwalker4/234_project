00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.599
Berlin April 1945

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.309
in Hitler's bunker in the center of the German capital

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.050
It was obvious to everyone that the fuhrer had lost the war

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.690
Hitler would rather die than Surrender and he expected the german people to do the same

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.129
But on the 28th of April only two days before his suicide

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.809
It'll land of a BBC broadcast that contained devastating news

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.629
It has been reported by reuters that unconditional surrender was offered by Himmler to Britain and the United States only

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.779
Hitler was beside himself Himmler had betrayed the very foundation of the Nazi State. Loyalty to the Führer

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.060
But Himmler's peace offer was only the final act in a story of double-dealing within the third Reich never before told on television

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.160
Time Watch reveals how in the later stages of the war both Himmler and Hitler compromised on their ideological beliefs

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.880
And how ultimately Himmler was to betray his beloved Führer

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.100
At the height of his career Himmler was after Hitler the most powerful man of the third, right?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.749
aged 44 he was head of the SS, and the police

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.130
minister of the interior Reichs Commissar for German Nationhood and commander of both the reserve and the home army

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.009
Himmler was hardworking and an efficient organizer

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.709
But the key to his success was one quality he possessed which Hitler valued above any other

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.860
loyalty

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.059
When himmler took over the ss. He confided to a party comrade

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.389
The SSvwill be an order sworn to the fuhrer for him. I could do anything

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.899
Believe me if hitler were to say I should shoot my mother. I would do it and be proud of his confidence

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.609
When in World War II the Nazis moved east. Himmler proved just how murderous his loyalty to hitler could be

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.240
SS and police units under Himmler's command,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.389
arrested and killed so called enemies among the civilian population, especially the Jews

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.240
by 1942

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.949
Jews from all over Europe were systematically deported to camps to be either gassed or worked to death

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.929
but when Himmler sent Hitler a statistical report about the so called final solution of the Jewish question

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.399
He was scrupulously careful in using euphemistic language

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.080
The original report described the killing of Jews as special treatment

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.959
but in a version for Hitler Himmler ordered it to be replaced by an even blander term

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.750
Transport to the East

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.759
Himmler knew the fuhrer did not wish to read any explicit reference to the murders

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.109
Hitler needed to keep his own image. Detached from

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.040
the the killing of women and children in the east and from the

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.940
most terrible aspects of this genocide

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.200
Hitler was aware that the foot of the German people

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.940
Wouldn't be ready for this, so he was still able to free himself up from this

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.590
Direct Connection with the murder of the Jews and to leave the dirty work to Himmler who himself said this is a glorious secret

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.050
Which we must carry with us to the grave

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:23.249
But as the war drew to a close this policy of secrecy was to change

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.539
now hitler and Himmler began to make compromises

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.930
with Hitler's knowledge and approval

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.920
Himmler gave speeches to party officials and military leaders in which he was surprisingly frank about the genocide

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:56.490
One of these speeches was recorded on the 24th of may in 1944 here at the Adolf Hitler school in Sonthofen

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.419
Himmler had composed his speech at Sonthofen carefully

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.829
Just before speaking so explicitly about the killing of women and children

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.380
he had stated in more general terms that the Jewish question had been solved

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:19.199
A statement that had received the spontaneous approval of his audience a gathering of army generals

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.039
the applause hints at why Hitler and Himmler had decided to reveal the supposed secret of the Holocaust

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.999
I think the reason behind this was to ensure that certain key groups

00:09:55.759 --> 00:10:00.969
Recognized their complicity in the Holocaust Hitler referred on a number of occasions to having

00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:06.279
We burnt our boats, and that's a good position to be in you know was we're all in this together

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.149
We can't get out of it. It's a sworn community

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.259
Himmler's speeches were a reminder that there was no alternative to loyalty

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:24.068
For since the Germans were losing the war loyalty to the Führer was being put to the test everywhere

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.229
No more so than in the battle of Kharkov in early 1943

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:38.979
The Germans had just suffered a devastating defeat at Stalingrad

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:44.649
Now the Soviets were about to recapture the Ukrainian city of Kharkov

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:54.519
Hitler ordered the SS Panzer Corps with two Waffen-SS Divisions to defend the city to the last man

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.609
The Waffen-SS. Was the military branch of the SS and its soldiers were known for their fighting spirit

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:19.470
More than once Waffen-SS troops had proved their loyalty and it stood fast when the regular German army had wavered

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:35.809
But this time it was different

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.139
The SS Panzer Corps faced encirclement by the Red Army

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.360
It's commander SS general Paul Hausser asked repeatedly for permission to withdraw

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.920
Hausser's SS-Panzer Corps was under the command of field marshal von Manstein of the regular army

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.900
Manstein too realized that Hitler's stand fast order would only result in senseless sacrifice

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:49.598
But he wasn't willing to act against a direct order from the Führer

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:59.109
So it was SS general Hausser who had to resolve the conflict between loyalty to the Führer and responsibility for his men

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:25.699
Hitler was furious

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:32.570
But Hausser got away with it his SS Divisions escaped encirclement and were able to counter-attack

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:42.239
Now it was the Soviets turn to be encircled

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.000
in fierce house-to-house fighting the SS recaptured Kharkov.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.560
The battle of Kharkov was not only the last great German victory of the war

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:10.139
It was also a turning point. For the first time an SS general had Openly disobeyed Hitler's express orders

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:52.100
The head of the SS began to take liberties too. He started to make ideological compromises

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.300
Himmler had built up the SS as a racial elite of an imaginary Aryan master race

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:07.109
In the early years he'd even personally examined the photos of SS applicants for their Germanic appearance

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:15.719
But from 1943 this policy changed radically

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.060
With Hitler's reluctant consent

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:30.920
Himmler permitted the enlistment of SS Soldiers who by Nazi Standards were racially inferior.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.140
Here in this to the Nazi theorist unsuitable part of the world.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.760
The first and most curious non-Germanic SS formation was recruited

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.380
The name of the division was SS Division Handschar

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.680
Almost all of It's soldiers were Bosnian Muslims who even had their own Imams.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:56.419
The Germans were desperate for soldiers who would die for them and Himmler thought Islam was there for the perfect religion

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.399
It educates the men in this division for me and

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:08.389
promises them heaven if they fight and are killed-in-action a very practical and attractive religion for soldiers

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.489
Even the policy towards the jews the Nazis most hated enemy was not consistent

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.709
These pictures of Bergen-Belsen taken just after its liberation have come to epitomize the horrors of the Holocaust

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:42.400
But when in 1943 Shmuel Huppert was taken with his mother to Bergen-Belsen the conditions there were very different

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.699
At that time, it wasn't exactly a concentration camp.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.989
It wasn't a camp where they killed people

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.079
The life was in a way

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.370
reasonable

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:05.140
reasonable in the sense that we got three blankets, so we weren't cold and

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.820
we got

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.070
something to eat

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.249
It wasn't plenty but we could survive

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.229
I can say even that we were once in a week or once in two weeks?

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:23.040
We had the opportunity to wash ourselves, and we didn't work

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.300
I learned to play chess in Bergen-Belsen and I play chess still today

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.500
but what was most important was the fact that we were together

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.920
that I was never separated for my mother

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.980
the children were with their mothers which was of course something very unusual

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.820
In the situation where Jewish children were first of all

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.060
taken from their families and exterminated

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.600
In 1943 the inmates of Bergen-Belsen were treated relatively better than other Jews

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.250
Because Himmler aimed to exchange them for German nationals in neutral or enemy countries

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:24.929
But this wasn't the only example of pragmatic exemptions from the so-called final solution

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.260
According to Himmler's agenda notes for a meeting with Hitler on the 10th of December 1942

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.660
one of the topics he discussed with the Führer was the ransom of Jews for foreign currency

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:53.540
Himmler was a compulsive organizer, and typically he'd write Memoranda to himself for future reference

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.059
after the meeting with Hitler he dictated

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.890
I have asked the Führer about ransoming Jews for hard currency

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.440
He has authorized me to approve such cases if they really brought in substantial amounts of foreign money

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.820
At a time when the Holocaust had reached its most lethal phase

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.530
Hitler and Himmler were prepared to release certain Jews for ransom

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.790
But this wasn't just about money

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:40.379
Himmler's agenda notes show that he also planned to use important Jews as hostages

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.229
You are fine brothers. I want you each to start a banking business

00:21:54.590 --> 00:22:02.900
One to go and open the house in Paris one in Vienna one in London choose the most important centers so

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:08.109
The Nazi's fantasy was the Jews were all interconnected

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.350
And so secretly ruled the world

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:38.240
In the latter stages of the war as things got worse and worse the notion that the Jews were so powerful

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:46.820
Meant that in this Nazi demonological view of things that the jews that were in the nazi remit could be useful as hostages

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.879
to be used as bargaining counters with the West &amp; Himmler's

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.110
Thinking obviously run along these lines not just at this moment

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.270
but later on to that the Jews could be useful it could be a bargaining counter a ploy and

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.670
This was the way to use them

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.100
When in 1944, the Jews of Hungary were deported to Auschwitz.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.140
They were subject to Hitler's most cynical attempt at political blackmail

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:42.140
With Hitler's previous permission to Ransom Jews Himmler made the pretense of proposing to the Western allies a deal

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.219
10,000 trucks for the lives of the Hungarian Jews

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:58.790
On the18th of May 1944 two Jewish emissaries left Budapest to contact zionist officials and the Western Allies

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:10.000
On their way to Palestine the two emissaries were detained by the British and sent to Cairo for interrogation by SIME

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.360
The Joint Mi5 Mi6 organization in the Middle East

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.640
One of the emissaries was Joel Brand from the Jewish rescue committee in Budapest

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.240
He said he was to deliver the Jews for trucks proposal

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.980
The other emissary was Andor Gross

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.420
He was a former smuggler and now agent for both Allied and Axis secret services including the SS

00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:48.299
To the surprise of his interrogators Gross claimed that he had a separate secret mission

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.689
To propose a meeting between senior SS

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:59.759
intelligence officers and an American or British counterparts in order to negotiate a separate peace between the West and the Nazis.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:17.219
While the Jews for trucks offer was authorized by Himmler. It's not clear whether Himmler was also behind the Gross mission

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.580
But both missions had the same objective

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:27.239
To entice the West into negotiations with the Nazis by using the Hungarian Jews as hostages

00:25:35.649 --> 00:25:42.689
Yet Himmler had miscalculated for the Western governments this war was not primarily about the Jews

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.380
On the 31st of May 1944

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:53.180
The British War Cabinet committee on the reception and accommodation of refugees chaired by Anthony Eden

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.700
met to discuss the Jews for trucks proposal

00:25:58.629 --> 00:26:01.529
the minutes of this meeting expressed the concern that

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:08.840
negotiations with the German government might lead to an offer to unload an even greater number

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.520
of Jews onto British Hands

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:33.359
Just a few days later Allied forces launched the invasion of Normandy this was not the time for negotiations

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.050
Himmler's Jews for trucks proposal was rejected out of hand

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.730
But amongst the intercepted German signals sent from the head of Mi6 to Churchill

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.800
Time Watch has discovered a document suggesting that in summer 1944

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.820
Himmler might have made yet another approach to the Western Allies

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:09.680
one of the signals forwarded to Churchill on the 31st of august 1944 was a telegram from Himmler

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.939
A handwritten note by the prime Minister shows that he personally destroyed the telegram

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.310
Himmler Telegram kept and destroyed by me

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.070
it's not known to whom the intercepted telegram was addressed but out of more than

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.450
14,000 decrypts seen by Churchill personally during the war

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.129
This is the only one from Himmler and the only one Churchill destroyed

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:53.809
I think it is interesting that the this telegram arrives at a time, when peace

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.999
Soundings are in the air. What's in the telegram?

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:07.249
we don't know but that it comes at this time may just be an indicator that himmler is trying to drive a wedge between

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.820
the Western Allies and the soviet Union something which the

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Nazi Leadership was was very much hoping for and in a sense

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.749
Churchill's reaction to Destroy it might well have been therefore to prevent any semblance of this getting out and being

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.629
Discussed in any circles whatsoever had been taken seriously?

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:37.009
only a few days after the intercept of the mysterious telegram Himmler discussed with Hitler Peace feelers either to Russia by the

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.140
Japanese or to England

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:46.610
But nothing came of it Hitler was against any peace talks as long as Germany was not in the position to dictate the conditions

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:25.459
From this point in the war Himmler's loyalty to hitler began to waver

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:33.559
Unlike Hitler, Himmler was searching for a political solution to the war and this search was to be kept secret

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:41.059
One of the few people who knew about Himmler's double game was the head of SS intelligence Walter Schellenberg

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:31.879
But Himmler faced one major problem. It was unlikely that the West would be willing to negotiate with him

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:27.809
Encouraged by Schellenberg. Himler hoped that by concealing his crimes and with some humanitarian

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:32.189
Gestures he could persuade the Western governments to negotiate with him

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.329
The Jews of Theresienstadt were to play a crucial part in this strategy

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.159
This Nazi Propaganda film about the Theresienstadt  Ghetto is produced in 1944

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:05.039
Its purpose was to deceive the world that the Jews were being treated well by the Nazis

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:20.589
the truth was that most Theresienstadt inmates were sent to Auschwitz or died of starvation and disease.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:26.320
Theresienstadt was not a death factory like Auschwitz or Dachau

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:32.619
So Himmler thought it safe to use the Jews of Theresienstadt to create an alibi for himself

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:49.300
Through intermediaries in Switzerland Himmler agreed with the American Union of Orthodox Rabbis to release every two weeks

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.219
1,200 Theresienstadt inmates in exchange the following crimes

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:05.099
On the 5th of February 1945 the first train load departed to switzerland

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:56.220
Himmler had made it a condition that the Western press report about the release favorably and this is how Hitler learned of it

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.710
from Swiss newspapers

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.360
Hitler raged at Himmler.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:10.169
With German defeat all but inevitable Hitler had changed his mind on ransoming Jews

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:17.699
He strictly forbade any more releases of camp inmates and ordered that any German who helped a Jew escape

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.130
be executed

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.270
wherever Jews were

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:27.390
They would still remain for Hitler the world enemy number one so as far as he could get hold of the Jews

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:30.059
They were they were doomed in Himmler's point of view

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.590
It differed

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.590
to the extent that Jews

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.140
Were this useful pawn perhaps that could be deployed to gain some advantage

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:45.959
and he was doing this in a sense in a sort of pragmatic fashion to try to

00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:52.229
improve his own position in this end phase with the Third Reich because he unlike like Hitler did believe in a

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.229
continuation of power one for this particular conflict was ended and was searching for a way to

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.340
bring it to an end which would save his own position and save his own

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.070
save his own neck as well

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.540
With a heavy cold Himmler took refuge in the ss. Hospital at Hohenlychen north of Berlin?

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.420
His world was falling apart

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:04.720
Himmler's relationship with Hitler was put under even more strain by the SS chief's military incompetence.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:12.130
in late January 1945 Hitler had made him the commander of an entire army group and

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.499
ordered him to stem the soviet Advance

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.110
It was a disaster

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.159
Himmler spent far more time in his SS hospital than at his headquarters

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.009
Himmler's SS was in trouble with Hitler too after the Soviets had captured Budapest

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.679
Hitler ordered an SS counter-offensive on the Hungarian capital

00:36:53.560 --> 00:37:01.410
But in face of overwhelming soviet superiority SS veteran Sepp Dietrich and his sixth SS Panzer army retreated

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.950
Hitler sent Himmler to strip Dietrich's SS divisions of their arm bands

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.889
Including the division which bore the fuhrer's own name the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:24.180
Himmler now made arrangements to take over from Hitler in the event of the Führer's death

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.819
whilst he covered himself with Hitler and

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:36.990
ordered that in camps such as Dachau no prisoners must be allowed to fall into Allied hands alive he simultaneously

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.069
tried to ingratiate himself with the future victors of the war

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.839
He allowed Bergen-Belsen to be surrendered to the British

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:53.099
If himmler hoped that handing over Bergen-Belsen would help his case with the Allies. He couldn't have been more wrong

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.380
Himmler had deluded himself about the real conditions in the camp

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:04.680
When the British entered Bergen Belsen it had long lost its special status as a hostage camp

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.200
it was overcrowded had

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.630
Typhoid and mass starvation were rife

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.990
The things in this come are beyond describing

00:38:15.869 --> 00:38:22.069
When you actually see them for yourself, you know what you're fighting for here. Pictures in the paper cannot describe it at all

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.070
The things they've committed well

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.950
nobody would think they were human at all

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.629
This morning we burried over five thousand bodies. We don't know who they are

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.979
Behind me you can see a pit which will contain another five thousand. There are two others like it in preparation.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.310
All these deaths have been caused by

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.139
systemic starvation and typhus and disease which have been spread

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:55.369
Because of the treatment meted out to these poor people by their SS guards and their SS chief.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.770
Despite this misjudgment over Bergen-Belsen

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.260
Himmler continued to try and Gain favor with the Nazi 's enemies

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.720
Here in the villa of his masseur on the night of the 20th of April 1945

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.840
He even met with an emissary of the world Jewish Congress the Swede Norbert Masur

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.879
Himmler was desperate that this meeting be kept secret. He knew that in Hitler's eyes, he was committing treason

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:37.010
Himmler agreed with Masur to release 1,000 Jewish women from the Ravensbrück concentration camp

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.570
But only on the condition that they be designated as poles not Jews

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.390
Hitler was not to know about it

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.159
after Masur had left Himmler said to his masseur Felix Caston

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.319
If I could have a fresh start. I would do many things differently now, but as a loyal soldier

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:06.119
I had to obey for no state can survive without obedience and discipline

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:13.258
But by now Himmler was no longer a loyal soldier

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:20.278
Only three days after his meeting with Masur, here in this room at the swedish consulate in Lubec

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:22.349
He met Count Folke Bernadotte

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.660
from the Red Cross

00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:30.149
Himmler Saw in the count a channel to the West and

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:36.359
as he met Bernadotte he was all too well aware of the mental state of his Führer

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:51.329
On the 21st of April 2 days before hen met Bernadotte Hitler had been woken by the noise of shelling

00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:54.899
the Soviets had reached the suburbs of Berlin

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.390
The Army Group of SS General Felix Steiner

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:05.819
in the North of Berlin was one of Hitler's last hopes he ordered Steiner to launch a suicidal counter-attack

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.190
The news of Hitler's Collapse had reached Himmler by the time he met count Bernadotte

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.369
Himmler declared that Hitler was quite possibly already dead

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.169
He now considered himself free to act and drafted a letter

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.640
authorizing Bernadotte to convey an offer of surrender to the Western Allies

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:33.980
It has been reported by Reuters that unconditional surrender was offered by Himmler to Britain and United States only

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:40.300
further that Britain and the United States have replied

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.300
Saying that they will not accept unconditional surrender, except on behalf of all of the Allies including Russia.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.180
Himmler had miscalculated once more

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:55.180
Not least because Hitler was still alive and the news of Himmler's secret dealings became public.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.600
Himmler was soon to follow his Fuehrer's example.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.660
On the 23rd of May 1945 he took cyanide in British captivity

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.180
This is the house in Lüneburg where Himmler committed suicide.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.160
There he is powerless at last.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:07.560
Powerless to blackmail to torture or to murder. An ignominious end for the most evil life recorded in history

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:21.529
Himmler's remains lie buried in an unknown grave somewhere in the Lüneburg heath in Northern Germany

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:32.680
Himmler had once said. I can't betray the Führer. Everything I am I owe to him.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.089
But in the end. He did betray his Führer

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.879
And died knowing who was loathed and despised by the man he most admired

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.880
you
