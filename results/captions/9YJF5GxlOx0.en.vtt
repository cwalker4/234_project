&gt;&gt; Chris: THIS WEEK, HOUSE

00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:07.548
DEMOCRATS STRUGGLED OVER HOW TO

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.283
DEAL WITH COMMENTS ABOUT SUPPORT

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.521
FOR ISRAEL MADE BY CONGRESSWOMAN

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:14.288
ILHAN OMAR.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.190
THE CONTROVERSY TESTED DEMOCRATS

00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.525
UNITY AND EXPOSED DIVISIONS

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:19.694
BETWEEN THE PARTY'S OLDER AND

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:20.695
YOUNGER LAWMAKERS.

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:21.362
JOINING US NOW, CALIFORNIA

00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:23.798

FRESHMAN LIAISON TO HOUSE

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:26.567
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.835

&gt;&gt; Chris: THANK YOU.

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:33.341
HOUSE DEMOCRATS AS I SAY SPENT

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:34.976
MUCH OF LAST WEEK ARGUING ABOUT

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:38.079
OMAR'S COMMENTS ABOUT WHY PEOPLE

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.348
SUPPORT ISRAEL AND FINALLY

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:41.082
PASSING A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.085
NOT ONLY ANTI-SEMITISM BUT ALL

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.921
FORMS OF HATE AND HERE WAS

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:50.291
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S REACTION.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.726
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YESTERDAY'S VOTE BY

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:54.662
THE HOUSE WAS DISGRACEFUL.

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:56.664
BECAUSE IT'S BECOME THE

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:57.498
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME AN

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.667
ANTI-ISRAEL PARTY.

00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:02.203
THEY'VE BECOME AN ANTI-JEWISH

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:03.304
PARTY.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:04.005
&gt;&gt; Chris: DOES THE PRESIDENT

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.240
HAVE A POINT HERE GIVEN THE FACT

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.143
THAT THE WHOLE DEBATE WAS ABOUT

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:10.545
OMAR'S COMMENTS THAT SEEMED TO

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:12.380
QUESTION WHY SOME AMERICANS

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:13.147
SUPPORT ISRAEL AND WAS VIEWED BY

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:16.184
SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IS

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:17.118
ANTI-SEMITIC AND GET THE

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:17.919
RESOLUTION THAT WAS FINALLY

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.854
PASSED DOESN'T EVEN MENTION HER?

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:20.488
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:21.522
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY VALIDITY

00:01:21.523 --> 00:01:22.090
TO WHAT HE'S SAYING.

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:23.991
A FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS A

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:24.792
COMPLETELY BIPARTISAN

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:25.193
RESOLUTION.

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:29.697
ALL BUT 23 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,

00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:30.364
THE 23 THAT VOTED AGAINST IT

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:34.001
WERE ALL REPUBLICAN.

00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:35.536
IT WAS COMPLETELY SUPPORTED.

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:36.204
SO IT WAS SOMETHING THAT IF

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:40.675
YOU'RE GOING TO CALL OUT

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:43.244
SOMETHING THAT IS BIGOTED,

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:44.412
WHETHER ANTI-SEMITIC OR ANYTHING

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:47.582
ELSE, THEN WE SHOULD SAY THAT

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:48.316
ALL OF THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND

00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:49.250
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.319
THAT WAS REALLY WHAT THE DEBATE

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.953
WAS ABOUT.

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:53.921
WE ARE GOING TO CONDEMN ONE SORT

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:54.655
OF BEHAVIOR, THEN WHY SHOULD WE

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.891
ISOLATED TO ONE GROUP, WE SHOULD

00:01:56.892 --> 00:01:59.761
CONDEMN ALL FORMS.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:00.928
&gt;&gt; Chris: YOU SAY -- AND I

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:01.696
SHOULD SAY THAT YOU COME FROM A

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:03.831
PURPLE DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.366
AND FOR 40 OF THE LAST 50 YEARS

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.935
HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:08.636
REPUBLICANS SO THIS IS A VERY

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:10.271
SWING DISTRICT.

00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:12.573
IF YOU SAY THAT CAME TO

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:14.041
WASHINGTON NOT TO ENGAGE IN

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:14.742
PARTISAN BICKERING BUT TO GET

00:02:14.743 --> 00:02:17.145
THINGS DONE.

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:18.846
BUT I WANT TO LOOK BRIEFLY AND

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.048
WE WILL MOVE ON AT CONGRESSWOMAN

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.550
OMAR AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH SHE

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.253
HAS DISTRACTED DEMOCRATS.

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:25.920
FIRST, SHE SAID THIS ABOUT

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.089
CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.589
ISRAEL.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.691
"IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMIN'S,

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:30.992
BABY.

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:32.693
AND SHE LATER QUESTIONED WHY IT

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.128
IS OKAY FOR PEOPLE TO PUSH FOR

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.463
ALLEGIANCE TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:39.867
NOW SHE'S GONE AFTER

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.169
BARACK OBAMA SAYING

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.903
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:42.637
BAD BUT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.072
CAME BEFORE HIM ALSO HAD REALLY

00:02:45.073 --> 00:02:46.774
BAD POLICIES, THEY WERE JUST

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:48.910
MORE POLISHED THAN HE WAS.

00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:51.712
I KNOW THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:52.713
PASSED SOME BILLS IN THE TIME

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.650
YOU'VE BEEN HERE, YOU PASSED A

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.885
MAJOR ELECTION REFORM BILL THIS

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:58.186
WEEK.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:02:59.353
LAST WEEK YOU PASSED A

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:02.356
GUN-CONTROL BILL BUT YOU GOT TO

00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:03.825
ADMIT THAT YOUR SPENDING, IT'S

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.194
NOT JUST THE MEDIA, YOU GUYS ARE

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:06.961
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME HAVING TO

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:11.299
DEAL WITH CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR AND

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.366
RASHIDA TO LEAVE ANNA BECAUSE

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:12.767
EYAL CORTEZ?

00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:13.401
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:14.902
THINK WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:15.303
OUR AGENDA.

00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:19.040
AS I WAS GOING.

00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:19.774
IT'S 435 PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.976
THEIR OWN BOSS.

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:22.677
THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY WHATEVER

00:03:22.678 --> 00:03:24.145
THEY WANT IN THE WORLD OF

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.313
SOCIAL MEDIA, IT'S SOMETHING

00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:27.448
WHERE YOU CAN'T CONTROL PEOPLE'S

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.782
SPEECH.

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:28.416
EACH PERSON HAS THEIR OWN

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.750
PRIORITIES AND THEIR OWN

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.386
OPINIONS AND WE HAVE ELECTED A

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:34.822
LOT OF STRONG WILLED AND VERY

00:03:34.823 --> 00:03:35.523
OPINIONATED PEOPLE SO I THINK

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:36.991
WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:39.260
TO DO IS TO SAY OKAY, THIS ISN'T

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:40.628
THE VIEWS OF EVERYBODY IN

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.295
CONGRESS, THESE ARE NOT THE

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:44.065
PRIORITIES OF THE ENTIRE CAUCUS,

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:44.799
BUT HOW DO WE MAINTAIN FOCUS ON

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.102
OUR AGENDA AS A WHOLE?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.738
AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS NOT

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.841
INDICATIVE OF WHAT OUR AGENDA IS

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:54.242
COMPLETELY.

00:03:54.243 --> 00:03:56.043
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE A

00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:57.511
VICE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE

00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.212
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND HERE'S

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.081
WHAT THE CHAIRMAN ELIJAH

00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:02.583
CUMMINGS SET AT THE START OF THE

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:04.685
COHEN HEARING THE WEEK BEFORE

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:04.986
LAST.

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:08.656
&gt;&gt; I SAID TO MR. COHEN THAT IF

00:04:08.657 --> 00:04:11.692
HE CAME IN HERE AND LIED I WOULD

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:16.464
NAIL HIM TO THE CROSS.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:16.831
DIDN'T I?

00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:18.065
DIDN'T I TELL YOU LIKE YOU

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:20.768
&gt;&gt; YES YOU DO, MORE THAN ONCE.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.403
&gt;&gt; Chris: IN THAT HEARING

00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:24.372
MICHAEL COHEN MADE THIS

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:26.841
CATEGORICAL STATEMENT.

00:04:26.842 --> 00:04:28.342
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR NOR

00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:30.912
WHAT I ACCEPT A PARDON FROM

00:04:30.913 --> 00:04:32.513
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:33.414
&gt;&gt; Chris: BUT NOW COHEN'S

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.250
LAWYER LANNY DAVIS SAYS THIS.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.119
HE, COHEN DIRECTOR'S ATTORNEY,

HIS PRIOR ATTORNEY TO EXPLORE

LAWYERS ADVISING PRESIDENT TRUM

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.096
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:49.830
QUESTION, DID MICHAEL COHEN LIE

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:53.301
TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND DO YOU

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:54.902
SUPPORT REFERRING COHEN TO THE

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR

00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:57.305
COMMITTING PERJURY?

00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:57.939
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.006
DON'T KNOW IF HE LIED OR NOT.

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:02.977
I THINK THAT THIS IS CHAIRMAN

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:03.577
CUMMINGS IS INCREDIBLY

00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:03.945
DELIVERED.

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:05.446
I KNOW THAT HE IS REVIEWING THE

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:06.380
ENTIRE TESTIMONY, ALL THE

00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:11.786
TRANSCRIPTS WITH MR. JORDAN, WHO

00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:12.553
WAS ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:15.222
WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS TO

00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:15.856
WHATEVER EXTENT POSSIBLE.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:16.490
&gt;&gt; Chris: HOW CAN YOU SAY

00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.092
YOU'RE NOT SURE WHETHER HE LIED?

00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:19.026
HE  HE SAID I NEVER ASKED FOR A

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:22.063
PARDON AND HIS LAWYER SAYS HE

00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:24.098
DIRECTED HIS LAWYER TO TALK

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.533
ABOUT A PARDON.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.267
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: AGAIN,

00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:27.635
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WENT DOWN

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:27.969
EXACTLY.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.770
I DON'T KNOW IF LANNY DAVIS

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.505
HEARD SOMETHING.

00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:33.374
PROBABLY I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IN

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:36.577
THE PANIC THAT WAS GOING ON WHEN

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:37.278
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO DOWN THAT

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.146
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THAT, LET'S

00:05:39.147 --> 00:05:42.616
FIGURE OUT WHATEVER YOU CAN DO.

00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:44.819
SO PROBABLY -- AND I IMAGINE

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.553
THAT CHAIRMAN CUMMINGS WILL END

00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:47.188
UP REFERRING HIM.

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.888
THAT'S JUST MY GUESS.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.191
WHEN HE SAYS -- ONE CHAIRMAN,

00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:51.559
CHAIRMAN CUMMINGS IS SOMETHING

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.960
LIKE I'M GOING TO NAIL YOU TO

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:53.561
THE CROSS, HE MEANS IT.

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.796
I'VE SEEN HIM IN ACTION AND HE'S

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:58.966
NOT GOING TO LET THIS GO.

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:00.067
&gt;&gt; Chris: THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:00.901
COMMITTEE, NOT YOUR COMMITTEE,

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.437
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SENT

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:04.638
DOCUMENTS LAST WEEK, DOCUMENT

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.708
REQUESTS LAST WEEK 281 PEOPLE

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:08.576
AND ENTITIES ASKING FOR

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:09.276
INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYTHING

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:12.346
FROM HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS TO

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:15.149
POTENTIAL INSURANCE FRAUD.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.752
AS SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT YOU

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:19.954
DIDN'T COME TO WASHINGTON FOR

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:20.654
PARTISAN BICKERING, AS I JUST

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:28.262
POINTED OUT, ONE, IS THIS A

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:28.963
FISHING EXPEDITION WHEN YOU'RE

00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:29.663
SENDING THE INFORMATION ON ALL

00:06:29.664 --> 00:06:30.297
THESE THINGS 281 DIFFERENT

00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:31.032
PEOPLE AND ENTITIES AND AGAIN,

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:34.001
ARE YOU ALMOST ENSURING THAT THE

00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:34.735
NEXT YEAR, TWO YEARS ARE GOING

00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:38.539
TO BE INVOLVED WITH THESE

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.174
HEARINGS THAT DON'T ACTUALLY --

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:40.908
I UNDERSTAND OVERSIGHT BUT THAT

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.343
DON'T GET THINGS DONE FOR THE

00:06:42.344 --> 00:06:42.810
AMERICAN PEOPLE?

00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:43.444
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.578
THINK IT WE ARE CAPABLE OF

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:46.547
WORKING ON MANY THINGS AT ONCE.

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:49.817
THE ISSUE IS THAT FOR TWO YEARS

00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:50.418
CONGRESS DIDN'T PERFORM

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.852
OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE

00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:52.720
BRANCH.

00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:53.487
WE ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED

00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:54.221
TO DO SO, SO THE REPUBLICANS

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:57.124
WHILE THEY WERE IN CHARGE SIMPLY

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.192
JUST DIDN'T DO IT DESPITE THE

00:06:58.193 --> 00:07:00.761
FACT THAT WE SAW SO MANY RED

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:02.897
FLAGS OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:04.098
CRIMES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:04.965
COMMITTED, ISSUES WE NEEDED TO

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.101
BE PROVIDING OVERSIGHT ON AND

00:07:07.102 --> 00:07:08.302
THEY JUST SIMPLY PUSHED IT UNDER

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.171
THE RUG, THEY DIDN'T DO ANY KIND

00:07:10.172 --> 00:07:10.905
OF INVESTIGATIONS WERE UNDER THE

00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:14.275
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION JUST FOR

00:07:14.276 --> 00:07:16.143
THE IRS INVESTIGATION,

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.645
1.3 MILLION DOCUMENTS WERE

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.680
PROVIDED.

00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:22.349
1.3 MILLION AND THAT WAS UNDER

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.485
REPUBLICAN REQUEST IN THE

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.252
WHITE HOUSE, THEY COOPERATED.

00:07:25.253 --> 00:07:27.021
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:07:27.022 --> 00:07:29.056
DISINGENUOUS TO SAY 81 WERE

00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:30.658
REQUESTED AND THIS IS SOME BIG

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.192
DEAL.

00:07:31.193 --> 00:07:31.859
THIS IS TOTAL PARTISANSHIP.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.860
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:34.462
WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR TWO YEARS

00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:36.997
OF A LACK OF INVESTIGATION AND A

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:37.531
LACK OF OVERSIGHT.

00:07:37.532 --> 00:07:38.866
&gt;&gt; Chris: AS YOU SIT HERE

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:39.633
RIGHT NOW, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU

00:07:39.634 --> 00:07:42.403
HAVE SEEN HARD EVIDENCE THAT

00:07:42.404 --> 00:07:44.004
DONALD TRUMP EITHER IN THE

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:44.605
CAMPAIGN OR AS PRESIDENT

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:47.675
COMMITTED A CRIME AND IF SO, A

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.710
CRIME THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF

00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:51.812
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS FOR

00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:53.380
IMPEACHMENT?

00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:54.014
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:54.782
BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.283
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO

00:07:56.284 --> 00:07:58.619
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.123
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE IS

00:08:02.124 --> 00:08:04.191
ENOUGH -- I FEEL LIKE

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.192
IMPEACHMENT IS AS MUCH OF A

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:06.026
POLITICAL PROCESS AS IT IS

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:07.928
ANYTHING ELSE.

00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:09.697
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.397
SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ALL

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:12.800
OF THE INFORMATION, AIRING IT

00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.135
ALL OUT SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN

00:08:14.136 --> 00:08:17.972
FEEL WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY AS

00:08:17.973 --> 00:08:19.507
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT THAT'S

00:08:19.508 --> 00:08:21.208
THE CASE AND THAT WE NEED TO

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:21.809
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.810
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS

00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:24.245
ABOUT GETTING TO THE TRUTH,

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:26.447
ABOUT SHOWING IT TO THE AMERICAN

00:08:26.448 --> 00:08:27.715
PEOPLE AND THEN WE GO FROM

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:28.015
THERE.

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:31.252
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF

00:08:31.253 --> 00:08:34.355
PEOPLE, THE CITIZENS OF THE

00:08:34.356 --> 00:08:35.089
UNITED STATES, DON'T BELIEVE

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.957
THAT IT HAS RISEN TO THAT LEVEL,

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.225
THEN WE CAN GO ANYWHERE.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:39.560
SO REALLY IT'S ABOUT EXPOSING

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.327
THE TRUTH AND IT'S ABOUT GETTING

00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:41.662
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND IT'S

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.031
ABOUT ASKING THE QUESTIONS OF IS

00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:45.533
THIS THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT, IS

00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:46.634
THIS THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:47.935
WE WANT TO SEE?

00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:48.569
IS THIS OKAY?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.537
IS THIS THE KIND OF STATE THAT

00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:50.871
WE WANT TO LEAVE OUR DEMOCRACY

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:52.873
AND TO OUR CHILDREN?

00:08:52.874 --> 00:08:54.041
AND RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.242
BELIEVE THAT IT IS, THAT'S WHY

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.043
YOU RAN FOR CONGRESS.

00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:56.677
THAT'S WHY SO MANY OF MY

00:08:56.678 --> 00:08:58.779
COLLEAGUES RAN FOR CONGRESS AND

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.448
I FRANKLY THINK THAT'S WHY WE

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:01.882
WERE ELECTED.

00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:02.683
&gt;&gt; Chris: FINALLY, I GOT ABOUT

00:09:02.684 --> 00:09:03.417
A MINUTE LEFT.

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.386
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, YOU

00:09:05.387 --> 00:09:06.420
ARE ON FOX NEWS.

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.154
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I AM.

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.290
&gt;&gt; Chris: AS YOU WELL KNOW,

00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:11.292
THIS WEEK THE DNC CHAIR TOM

00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:12.726
PEREZ ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE

00:09:12.727 --> 00:09:15.095
NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY OF THE 12

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.997
SCHEDULED DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:18.098
DEBATES OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:18.799
FOX NEWS.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.935
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT

00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:21.769
DECISION?

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.403
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: I

00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:23.137
THINK IF THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:25.139
AND I THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.006
THERE ARE BASICALLY NO DEMOCRATS

00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:26.707
WHO WATCH FOX NEWS SO TO ME

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.709
THAT'S PRETTY FAIR.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.345
&gt;&gt; Chris: IS NOT TRUE,

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:32.813
ACTUALLY.

00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:33.881
THERE ARE A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

00:09:33.882 --> 00:09:36.884
THAT WATCH FOX NEWS A LOT OF

00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:37.651
INDEPENDENTS.

00:09:37.652 --> 00:09:38.352
&gt;&gt; Representative Hill: MOSTLY

00:09:38.353 --> 00:09:39.019
IT'S BECOME MORE AND MORE

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.954
PARTISAN AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:42.256
I'M HERE BECAUSE I DO REPRESENT

00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:42.990
A PURPLE DISTRICT AND IS TURNING

00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.959
OUT THAT MORE AND MORE OF MY

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.060
CLOTHES ARE PURPLE, I DON'T KNOW

00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:46.994
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:48.762
WITH THAT BUT I THINK THAT THERE

00:09:48.763 --> 00:09:50.931
IS NOT A FEELING RIGHT NOW THAT

00:09:50.932 --> 00:09:53.367
THERE'S A LACK OF BIAS AND I'M

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:54.501
HOPING THAT WE CAN CHANGE THAT.

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:56.170
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TREATING ME

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:57.871
WITHOUT BIAS AND I APPRECIATE

00:09:57.872 --> 00:09:58.172
THAT.

00:09:58.173 --> 00:09:58.806
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.342
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:01.675
CHANGE.

00:10:01.676 --> 00:10:02.543
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT

00:10:02.544 --> 00:10:03.244
HELPS WHEN WE'RE SAYING WE'RE

00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:03.944
NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY OF THE

00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:05.579
DEBATES ON FOX NEWS.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.348
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:10:07.349 --> 00:10:08.048
WAS DRIVEN BY THE CANDIDATES,

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:10.317
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS DRIVEN BY THE

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.151
PARTY.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.853
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL OF THAT

00:10:12.854 --> 00:10:13.187
CHANGE.

00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:14.221
I WANT TO SEE THE MEDIA BECOME

00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:16.156
AS UNBIASED AS POSSIBLE.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.358
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE IN

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:19.526
THAT STATE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS

00:10:19.527 --> 00:10:20.060
REALLY UNFORTUNATE.

00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:20.761
&gt;&gt; Chris: CONGRESSWOMAN HILL,

00:10:20.762 --> 00:10:21.696
THANK YOU.
