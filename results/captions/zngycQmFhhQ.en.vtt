00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.428
Ok, we are now going to look in a bit more detail at some of the finite bits of Tiger I.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.228
First thing starting off on the left there obviously the Track Guards.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:19.862
The interesting thing about the Tiger I was

00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:22.800
that both the track guards left and right, actually lifted up,

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.582
to gain access there.

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:27.170
And also you'll note that everything is hinged on the side.

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.270
The reason being, of course, Tiger I had a transit track

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:34.640
so when it was to go on a railway i.e. because of the width of some of the tunnels

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.394
you couldn't actually get in on there with the normal track on

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:40.700
so they put a transit track on there and everything then hooked up

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:44.457
and the splash guards etc. were removed to allow it to gain access.

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.220
Another thing to note on there you have got an eyelet.

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:50.845
The reason for the eyelet was it just means that a lifting frame could be fitted in there.

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.160
When the lifting frame was in there, there was a hook and weight on the end

00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:57.450
and it means they could assist when changing the sprockets on the track.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.234
Moving our way across to the right.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:03.154
The first piece we come across is of course where the bow gunner / radio operator,

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:06.140
as they were one in the same person, actually was positioned inside.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:09.897
You can see on the outside there the mounting for the MG34.

00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:12.994
Interesting thing obviously about this was that movement wise

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.468
it had 15 degrees of movement left and right laterally

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:20.930
and also -10 to +20 degrees of movement in the vertical.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.091
Now obviously Tiger I,

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:23.245
one of the things about Tiger I was,

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:25.680
it was capable of doing deep wading.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.857
However, records show they never actually carried out any deep wading,

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:33.062
but because of that it made it quite expensive in the design process was,

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.451
on the outside there is a rim

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:40.450
and also you can see there's two eyelets there with butterfly screws.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.628
When it was preparing for deep wading

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:44.011
it just means that a cover could go on there

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.411
obviously to protect the bow mounted gunner there

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.017
and also to prevent any ingress of water going in.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.211
Moving away across the right hand side

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:53.700
we now really come across to the driver’s station.

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:56.434
Armoured drivers hatch which could be closed from the inside as well.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.714
A couple of interesting points,

00:01:57.737 --> 00:01:59.851
if you notice on the top there you have got two weld marks,

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:02.194
this was initially where the early version of Tiger I

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.777
would have had the binocular type periscope fitted

00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:08.422
but this was replaced, later on in the design stage.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.325
And of course finally finishing off really with the other side,

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.862
identical to the left hand side of the track and again

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:16.091
elevating up or can be moved up as well.

00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:17.870
Okay moving down the side of the Tiger then,

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:19.930
you can see more clearly the track configuration

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.177
and again we've got the driver later on

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:23.290
to give us some much more detailed thing on there.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.788
I want to mention about the transit track,

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:26.640
just a point to note on the transit tracks

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.828
is when they were fitted all the outer road wheels were taken off,

00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:31.942
obviously to make it easier to fit.

00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:33.450
Couple of things to notice on there.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.885
On top you can see we've got a tow rope.

00:02:35.908 --> 00:02:37.668
And also although not the original of course,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.510
you would also have a track rope located on the side here as well.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.714
Moving our way back down you can see very clearly there at the moment,

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:48.670
a good position of it is the mantlet, which actually housed the 88mm gun.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:50.594
Interesting point about this is we know

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.450
this is one of the first hundred production models of this particular mantlet.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.777
The reason we know that is because it has the cut away portion in this side.

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:59.257
The reason being of course, at one stage,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.811
when Porsche thought that he was going to actually have the contract,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.668
to produce all of the chassis etc. for the Tiger I,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.822
produced these turrets because the raised engine decks at the rear,

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:11.462
on the Porsche Variant,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.331
meant it would snag unless it had a raised portion on there.

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:17.405
So we know by that, that this was one of the first hundred production models.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.194
Now of course the thing that really made the Tiger I very distinctive

00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:24.034
and very impressive on the battlefield was the use of the 88mm.

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:27.497
This was based on the anti aircraft gun, the Flak 36

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.034
and actually Hitler himself insisted that the Flak 36 was mounted on to a tank chassis.

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:34.011
This of course caused huge problems

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:36.160
because the recoil was absolutely intensive.

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:37.860
And what you will find on the Tiger I

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:39.177
is use of a hydropnematic buffer

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.350
and a recuperator

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:42.925
very similar to what you get on modern main battle tanks.

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.450
And we will see that a bit later on as we get inside the turret.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.320
Again, another thing that made it very distinctive at the time

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:50.045
was of course the armour protection.

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:53.120
The armour protection made it almost in the initial stages of the war,

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:56.480
almost impervious to anything that the allies could throw against it.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.257
At its thickest part it is 100mm.

00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:00.982
It used rolled homogenous armour.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.394
Again the rolling process actually made it toughened

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:06.274
and made it stronger than anything else the allies had at the time.

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.885
And another thing while we are talking about the recoil that was produced by the 88mm,

00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:11.520
also you will find at the end of the barrel there,

00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.450
very distinctive, is the double baffle muzzle brake.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.102
The reason for this of course it actually reduced almost 70% of the recoil

00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:20.480
that you find inside the turret, and actually it was that important

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.177
that if it was damaged during a conflict or during operations

00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:25.851
the crews were told not to fire the main armament.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.851
Okay we are now going to start moving up onto the turret.

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:29.428
Just a couple of things to point out here,

00:04:29.428 --> 00:04:32.308
obviously the crew's positions we are going to have a look at in more detail later on.

00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:34.400
But as I'm looking down forwards at the tank there,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.320
at the right hand side you've got where the bow gunner/radio operator actually sat.

00:04:38.342 --> 00:04:39.988
Very simple hatches.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.777
And he also had his own periscope fitted there as well.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.451
Notice the rubber seals you have got all the way around.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.125
Working our way across towards where the driver's position is,

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.245
you've got a jacking block,

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:50.982
various tools storage positions

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:53.348
and you've also got a breather there for ventilation.

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:56.450
And finishing across to the left hand side there we have got the drivers hatch.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.040
Again we will have a look at that and get inside in more detail in a bit.

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:02.068
But the interesting thing to know and I must admit I didn't know until we came down here,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.028
when you see all the films, the photos etc

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:07.462
of somebody with their head out, driving the Tiger,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.725
it would have been a physical impossibility.

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:11.142
As soon as you look down in there you can see

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:13.520
that both the driver and the bow gunner

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:16.450
are more positioned centrally towards the centre of the tank

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.628
so it must have been somebody else sat on the side there,

00:05:18.628 --> 00:05:20.450
which is quite an interesting point.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.857
Look at the side of the turret, we have already explained the trunnions,

00:05:22.868 --> 00:05:26.171
you can also see the trunnions from out there and the mantlet cover.

00:05:26.182 --> 00:05:30.742
We see the first of our smoke grenade discharges.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.577
Tiger I had two banks of smoke grenade discharges,

00:05:33.588 --> 00:05:36.330
3 on either side of the turret, one mounted left and right.

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:39.931
And the controls for this are inside the commander’s station, we will have a look at those in a moment.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.577
And also you can see there we are looking at the right hand side of the turret,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.240
you've also got the first of our vision ports there.

00:05:46.297 --> 00:05:49.394
This would have been the vision port for the loader's station

00:05:49.554 --> 00:05:53.005
and gave him a very very narrow field of view through there.

00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:56.450
Okay we are now moving up on top of the turret and a few things to point out.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.920
The first thing I want you to notice there is the emergency or escape hatch

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:03.142
which is located on the rear right hand side of the turret.

00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:05.805
Incredibly heavy and a bit of a design problem there,

00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:07.702
that once it was opened it would just drop away,

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.845
obviously open from the inside, drop away but it needed someone on the outside

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:13.080
to actually push it back into position again.

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:15.200
And also you can see on a lot of records they actually used that

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.460
when they were restoring the ammunition on the Tiger I.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:21.314
It's quite a quick way to put ammunition through there and straight into the turret.

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.062
We will look into the turret in a minute.

00:06:23.097 --> 00:06:24.320
Another couple of things to point out.

00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:27.142
We have also got the armoured cover for the ventilations fans,

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.811
the fans beneath there provide ventilation for the crew inside

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.760
and also very very simple design for the loaders hatch.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:35.097
Two positions on the loaders hatch;

00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:38.811
opened or it could be just left a jar as well to allow some air to come in there.

00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:41.920
And again notice quite hefty rubber seals around the hatches.

00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:45.325
Located on the back of the turret which was the only storage that we can find on Tiger I.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.302
Okay., quite a small bin and you'd find in here

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:50.045
some of the tools and also some of the crews belongings as well.

00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:51.622
So you'd find the bin on there.

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:53.977
Quite an interesting thing about the Tiger I31 was

00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:56.331
it's actually the original padlocks that came with it

00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:58.605
which is obviously very very unusual.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.017
Moving our way across we have got a port here.

00:07:01.028 --> 00:07:02.537
This is a small arms port.

00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:06.125
And all it meant  was obviously the crew had some means there if people mounted the tank,

00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:08.182
whether it’s on the turret or the back decks,

00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:09.954
they could actually put perhaps one of the small arms

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:13.154
the MP40 through there and fire on them as well.

00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:15.497
Okay so just a small port there.

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:18.022
Working our way across and the final thing really,

00:07:18.022 --> 00:07:20.777
we've got located on the turret or the final two things we have got located on the turret.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.108
We've got another one of our vision slits.

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:26.450
Okay you find it the periscope or upper episcope was located behind there.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.450
This particular one is where the gunner would sit just behind this wall.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.720
And finally the last of our smoke grenade dischargers.

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:34.308
Okay looking at the commander’s station then,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.708
very very simple conical design

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:39.188
and again with a very simple commanders hatch there

00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:42.450
with a very heavy duty rubber seal located round the outside.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.091
A few of the key things to point out now.

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.514
You can see there are a number again of vision slits

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:50.982
behind there are located the periscopes which you will see when we get inside the commanders cupola.

00:07:50.982 --> 00:07:53.942
And also the azimuth indicator.

00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:56.994
Located underneath the rim here numbered 1 to 12

00:07:56.994 --> 00:08:02.034
all around the outside and all it was was a very simple way that the commander could lay the gunner,

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:05.794
whose got a similar thing just to the left of him in the gunners station, on to a target.

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:09.222
But again we will have a look at that in more detail in the gunner’s station when we get inside there.

00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:10.182
The final thing to note.

00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:11.885
The two hollow tubes you can see there,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.137
they were just a means there used to be a sun shield

00:08:14.137 --> 00:08:17.520
that could actually go up and protect the crew against the sun.
