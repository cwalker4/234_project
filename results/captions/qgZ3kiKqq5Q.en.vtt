00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.960
GUEST: This is a mystery for me.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.720
It is something that my husband and I inherited
from his aunt.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.120
Aunt Jean and her husband lived in Eureka,
and they did a lot of collecting, and collected

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.740
art glass, and this was in her collection.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.559
APPRAISER: Mm-hmm.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.420
GUEST: My husband called it a princess cup.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.210
It was, like, one of his favorite things.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.210
APPRAISER: Right.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.980
GUEST: I believe he called it a princess cup
because probably his aunt called it a princess

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.620
cup.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.680
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.620
GUEST: But we really know nothing-- I know
nothing about it.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.330
My husband, unfortunately, has passed away.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
APPRAISER: I'm sorry.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.360
GUEST: Today's his birthday, though, so I
just feel like it's all meant to be, that

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.190
we're here with one of his favorite things,
and I'm going to find out what it truly is.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
APPRAISER: And we are so fortunate to be able
to see one of the things here today that he

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.320
really, really did treasure, so thank you
very much for bringing it to us.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.540
You mentioned it was called colloquially the
princess cup.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.540
GUEST: Yes.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.540
APPRAISER: Affectionately known.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.850
The thing with this being a cup, of course,
is that it has lots of holes in it.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.390
GUEST: Yes, that's problematic.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.540
APPRAISER: It's known as a zarf-- that's spelled
Z-A-R-F.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.540
It's a very unusual-sounding word, but it's
actually coming from the Arabic for "envelope."

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.360
GUEST: Hm!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.400
APPRAISER: Which basically, you know, to enclose
something.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.320
GUEST: Okay.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.520
APPRAISER: And as we can see, because of the
holes we mentioned a second ago, it's not

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
going to work as a cup as it is.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.520
GUEST: Correct.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.729
APPRAISER: So it's going to have supported
a glass that would have been used to hold

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.729
coffee.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.850
It's essentially a coffee-glass holder.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.969
GUEST: Really!

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.079
APPRAISER: Yeah.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.200
GUEST: Wow!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.960
APPRAISER: Coffee was introduced into-- and
this is where we sort of find out where it's

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.649
from-- into Istanbul in the mid-16th century.

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.499
It's an Ottoman zarf.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.530
The Ottoman Empire spread across the Near
East.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.090
It incorporated Syria, parts of Iran, Iraq,
and so on and so forth, until the Ottoman

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.630
Empire fell in the 1920s.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.209
And so this was made during the Ottoman Empire,
probably towards the end of the 19th century.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:04.740
It's made of 18-karat gold, it's enameled,
and it also has a profusion of these old mine-cut

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.909
diamonds.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.910
So quite clearly, for a coffee cup, it's exceptionally
beautiful and handsomely crafted.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.360
The reason being is that just, with tea, and
with other drinking cultures across the world,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.970
coffee was seen as something that was still
imbued with a lot of ceremony.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.030
In, sort of, Ottoman Turkey and elsewhere,
in Iran and so on.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.140
And so the receptacles to hold the drink could
have been incredibly lavish and well-made,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.450
such as this one.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.160
This would have probably been used, even though
it is such a luxury, high-status thing.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150
It would have obviously shown the status of
the owner.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.680
They're also often given as gifts to various
courts and other high-status individuals within

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680
Europe and elsewhere.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.880
So it's a beautiful object.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.450
GUEST: Yes, I wondered...

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.220
I would never have guessed that that was its
purpose.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.480
APPRAISER: At auction, I would estimate this
to sell for between $3,000 and $5,000.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.420
GUEST: (laughing) Wow.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.340
Wow.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.640
I'm... really surprised.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.460
Pat would be so happy.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.960
That's-- that's amazing.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.180
APPRAISER: It's, it's a lot of money.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.850
GUEST: For, to hold a cup of coffee.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.850
APPRAISER: Exactly.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.850
It's beautiful.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.850
GUEST: It is.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.850
APPRAISER: It's really exquisite.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.850
GUEST: Thank you so much.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.220
APPRAISER: Well, thank you, thank you for
bringing it on.
