00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.440
Hello everyone welcome back to Dj's Aviation and another analysis video of mine to be exact.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.800
Have you ever thought about the Airbus A380 and its customers?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.300
If you looked really closely, you'd be able to see that some of the biggest carriers in the world haven't ordered this aircraft.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.400
That being American Airlines, United and Delta.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.660
What do these three airlines have in common?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.700
They are based in America, all three of them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400
In today's video, I hope to uncover to you

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.520
why American carriers haven't ordered the Airbus A380, so let's get started.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.240
The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger plane on the market today.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.480
With four engines and two levels, it's bound to catch anyone's eye at local airports.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.260
But, that being said, it hasn't caught the eye of some of the biggest carriers in the world.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.960
It has been noted throughout the years since production began of the A380,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.000
that there are multiple reasons why American carriers believe the A380 isn't the right choice.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.920
They are as follows:

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.680
preferences, efficiency, airports, capacity, economics, flexibility and the business model.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.840
These are just some of the reasons that have been stated by these airlines.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.080
In this particular video, I'll be going over each of these complaints (if you want to call them that)

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.020
from these carriers, and really diving into why they're thinking this way.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.580
We'll begin with the economics.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.200
Overall the economics of the A380, and also the 747-8/747-400,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.700
aren't completely fantastic, and this just isn't a lie.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.800
There are a number of other aircraft on the market which these US airlines believe are better suited to their operations.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.560
Let's take the A340 for example.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.760
If we are talking economics,
this A340 is the perfect example.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.240
While an absolutely awesome aircraft it is, the sad fact is it's already out of production.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.540
And when you think about how old it actually is, ceasing production this early is quite odd.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.640
If we take a look at the 767 or Airbus' A300, A320, A310 and A330,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.420
these have actually been flying for a lot longer than the A340.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.720
This is a similar case if we take a look at the A380.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.640
Production rates are in fact decreasing every single month, because it simply isn't fuel-efficient for airlines.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.540
This can be deemed as a challenge for any airline looking at operating an A380.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.920
It is no lie that the twin-engine planes on the market today are more fuel efficient,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.340
and the way US carriers think - it's not necessarily about

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.400
how many passengers that they can cram onto the one aircraft.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.460
Otherwise they would have ordered the A380, the 747-8, and be operating these on one hour flights.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.640
While on the topic of challenges, flexibility is another issue that the US carriers hinted at.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.500
If you're giving the likes of Delta, American and United

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.660
the choice on what aircraft to operate from let's say, Los Angeles to Sydney,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.600
it's extremely unlikely that they would choose the A380.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.120
Rather, you'd see them opt for let's say for the 777, or maybe in the next decade even the A350ULR.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.640
But if they needed more capacity what would the carrier do exactly? Well an airline like Emirates for example

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.860
would likely order more Airbus A380s, or just place extra ones on that flight, because they believe to get the extra capacity,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.760
they can just buy the world's largest passenger plane and put that on that particular route.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.680
But once again the likes of Delta, American and United, nine times out of ten will just add an extra daily service.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.800
More and more airlines across the globe are also following in these carrier's footsteps.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.580
They usually begin serving a destination with a three-times-weekly service.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.500
They'll continue to bump it up until its daily, then it'll be double daily, triple daily and so on.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.560
On routes that already have a huge demand like let's say, Singapore to Melbourne, or New York

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.760
to London Heathrow, more and more airlines end up adding double daily or even triple daily services.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.280
Other way[s] airlines combat this is through starting up services

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.560
to a growing route that they don't already operate in.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.140
This adds more weekly seats in total for travellers, and also gives them the option to choose multiple carriers.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.840
In saying this though, ANA were quite the rare case.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.080
They saw the A380 as a fantastic way to combat the huge demand for the Japan to Hawaii services,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.580
and have therefore placed an order for three Airbus A380s and an option for a further three.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.680
In regards to flexibility, there's something else that needs mentioning.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.100
This is the training of employees and purchasing of new facilities.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.700
If the US carriers opted for the A380, no doubt new hangars would be needed.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.560
But of course the employees that were already in the business,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.440
would now need to be trained to work on the A380. On top of the price that the airline has paid for this A380,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.620
which is by no means cheap, you're going to have to add therefore on all the operating costs,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.600
and then of course training, which is most likely going to be the last thing they'd be thinking about.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.160
All up, this is going to cost the airline quite a lot. So in terms of flexibility,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.240
the A380 to these carriers just isn't viable.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.880
One issue that doesn't require a huge explanation - and is relatively straightforward - is capacity.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.240
The A380 is a big - and I mean big - plane. It can seat up to 600 people,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.520
depending on the configuration that the airline opts for.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.980
That means in an ideal world, you need to sell all of these seats on every single flight that the A380 will operate on.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.820
Airlines like American, United and Delta believe that this may have been an issue on some routes.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.220
Therefore they believe there was no point in having all those empty seats on every single flight,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.080
when instead you could operate, let's say the A330 or 767 and completely fill them up

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.360
on each and every single flight that they operated. If you needed more aircraft to serve a particular route,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.840
you could always order more or lease them.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.240
But in saying that, usually twin-engine jets are a bit cheaper than quad jets, meaning American, United

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.260
or Delta could have just ordered double the amount that they may have ordered for the A380, let's say.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.100
This would mean that if one of these 767s went tech or something like that at one of the airports,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.300
they could always bring in, let's say the A330 or another 767, and you wouldn't really feel an effect as a carrier.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.700
There's another key point of difference between those airlines based in America and those in let's say Europe.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
If you take a look at British Airways, Emirates and Singapore, who all operate the A380,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.180
how many bases do they have as an airline? And then how many airports do they base the A380 at?

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.160
The answer is most likely one. Singapore utilise Singapore Changi, Emirates utilise Dubai,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.260
British Airways utilise Heathrow, and I'm actually also forgetting Qatar and Etihad,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.940
who also utilise Doha and Abu Dhabi only and that's respectively.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.080
But let's take a look at American carriers. While not using the A380, it's the complete opposite.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.460
America is so big that these carriers would prefer operating out of multiple different airports,

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.330
rather than restricting all travellers to, let's say, Los Angeles,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.860
and then dumping them all on the one daily A380 flight to London Heathrow.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.480
And mind you this would be the only flight a day that would from America to Heathrow direct.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.700
Through not operating the A380, while British Airways can utilise throughout America the A380,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:05.720
airlines like Delta, United and American have more of a choice, like the A330s, 767s, 757s, 787s and 777s.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.780
All these aircraft allow different capacity options,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.880
and mean that American, United and Delta can utilise these aircraft from different airports all across America.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.900
Following on from that idea that American carriers can space out their flights,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.640
if they were to have the A380 delivered, they would need to alter airports across the entire country.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:35.100
A similar situation is unfolding right now at Honolulu in anticipation for the ANA Airbus A380 flights from Tokyo.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.540
The airport was not capable of actually fitting an A380 at its gates,

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.060
and now is spending a lot of money, and I mean a lot of money to fix it and prepare it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.740
With so many hubs at smaller airports,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.140
it could certainly be argued that these airports simply were not made to fit the A380.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.620
On the other hand, airports like Los Angeles, with numerous A380 services, is one of the few.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.420
The A380s are most useful at congested international airports,

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.860
where there are a vast number of passengers and limited slot availability.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.260
These airlines in America, while operating through congested airports,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.760
have more of an opportunity to branch out and add more services than let's say at London Heathrow.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:27.180
This all ties in with the idea that purchasing an A380 can heavily depend on the airport it'll actually operate from.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.320
So all up, there are quite a few reasons why the US carriers have decided to not opt for the Airbus A380.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.640
I hope this video was not only a little bit interesting and enjoyable,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.020
but also you possibly have learned something from this as well.
