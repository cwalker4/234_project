00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.520
- [Narrator] Our everyday activities

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.030
are plagued with bad practices and habits.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.980
Some of these things we barely think about

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.950
but could vastly help us.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.000
From the most efficient
way to eat an apple,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.030
to the reason why those
feet on your keyboard

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.290
may be harming you.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.775
Here are 10 Things You most
likely Do Wrong Every Day.

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:17.947
(electronic chiming)

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:18.780
- Amazing.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.667
- [Narrator] Number 10,
prevent static buildup.

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.340
Static buildup is one
of those annoying things

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.270
that come from doing the washing.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.160
It occurs when clothes tumble around

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.150
and rub against one another in the dryer,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.170
and they exchange electrons.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
As some pieces of clothing
are positively charged,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720
and others are negatively charged,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.150
they become annoyingly
clingy to each other,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.950
leaving you in potentially
sticky situations,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.160
like when you have to pull a sock

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.620
from the inside of your pant leg,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.440
and hide it frantically because
you're at work or at school.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.620
This problem is easily resolved though,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.570
and it doesn't have to come

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.770
at the cost of buying dryer sheets.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.170
The solution lies in aluminum foil.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.980
Simply scrunch lots of
foil into hand-sized balls,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.450
and throw two or three
of them into the dryer.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.190
This time the foil balls will
discharge any static build-up

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.280
as they tumble with your clothes, genius.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.140
You can continue using them for months,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.620
and if they ever fall apart,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.750
just crumple some new foil over them.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.110
Number nine, hammering nails.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.460
Hammering nails is one of those

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.080
notoriously dangerous tasks
that inevitable lead you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.420
to flattening your thumb into a pancake.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.970
But that's mostly because
you've been doing it wrong.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.150
There's such an easy way
to protect your fingers

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.030
from the head of a heavy moving hammer.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.900
All you need is pencil
with a rubber on the end.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.740
Grab a utility knife and cut
a nail-sized slit in the end.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.090
The pencil acts as a holder

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.730
for the nail while your hammering.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.500
Keep your fingers safely
positioned behind the nail.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.490
No more pancake fingers.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.920
Number eight, eating an apple.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.050
Cutting an apple is one
of those simple jobs

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.600
that we don't even think about.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.810
Most of us would typically
cut the apple in half,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.070
and then cut out the core so that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.400
we are left with the nice yellowish flesh.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.130
There are a number of reasons this isn't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.720
the best way to cut an apple.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.220
Firstly, the core is totally edible,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.330
so you don't have to bin
it in the first place.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.030
However, a lot of people
don't like to eat it,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.340
which is totally understandable

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.870
because it's not the
nicest part of the apple.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.290
The best thing to do in this case,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.363
is use a spoon instead of a
knife when cutting out the core.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.030
This maximizes the
amount of yellowish flesh

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.610
retained for consumption,
so that you don't have to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.240
throw away perfectly edible parts

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.400
of the apple along with the core.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.210
Number seven, using chopsticks.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.820
Using chopsticks is one of those
needlessly difficult tasks.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.160
Most of us just opt straight
for ordinary cutlery

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.810
when faced with the
daunting task of using them.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.180
That's why you'd be glad to
know there's a better way

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.450
to hold these hand-held pinchers.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.730
All you need is a toothpick
and an elastic band.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.000
Snap the toothpick in
half and then place it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.660
in-between the two chopsticks,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.776
securing it tightly with an elastic band.

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.412
This will bind the sticks together,

00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:53.140
and allow it to rebound back

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.170
after you let go of your
finger pushing down the stick.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.620
It basically makes eating with
chopsticks 10 times easier.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.540
Number six, earphones.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.160
Earphones can be really annoying devices,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.260
particularly when the
wires get tangled up,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.532
and you spend more time unraveling them

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:11.080
than you do listening to music on them.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.790
That's why when you
just throw the earphones

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.510
in your pocket without much thought,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.550
your costing yourself a lot
of hassle in the future.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.930
What you should do is fold the
cables up neatly like this.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.530
Fold them into a loop,
and then use the wire

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.690
close to the end of the
head of each earphone,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.110
to tie a knot around the looped wires.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.750
This will tightly secure the wires

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.580
in a neat bundle, ready for the
next time you want to listen

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.120
to your hardcore reggae
metal or deep filthstep.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.420
Number five, stirring and pouring honey.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.990
How do you stir or store your honey?

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.210
If you've been using a
metal storage container,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.530
or spoon for this job, then
you've been doing it all wrong.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.870
There's a really good reason for this too.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.350
Honey is very acidic
with a pH of around four,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.850
meaning it can react with the honey,

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.850
and cause a change in
acceptable quality of the honey.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.600
This can also causes a
discoloration in the honey.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.650
That's why honey dippers have
been used for generations.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.800
They don't chemically harm the honey,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.420
meaning they don't impair
any of the honey's flavor.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.160
Honey dippers are also more
porous and their design

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430
is brilliant for preventing
the honey dripping

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.860
if you rotate it on the way to your cup.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.680
So, in the future, remember
that wooden utensils

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.080
or stainless steel spoons are preferable

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.330
when transferring honey from containers.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.842
Number four, opening jars.

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:30.230
Now to jars, we've all struggled
to open them at least once.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.010
It can be seriously embarrassing,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.940
especially when that
measly glass container

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.090
starts to put your strength into question.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.790
But as you know, brain beats brawn.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.880
You've likely just been doing it wrong.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.810
You can easily open a stubborn jar

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.510
using some household tools.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.310
First up, duct tape.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.060
All you have to do is attach the tape

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.860
to the lid of the jar like this,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.060
making a little handle at the end.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.230
Just pull on it and viola.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.630
Next up, another great
method, rubber bands.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.360
Simply wrap one around the
lid, and put on a rubber glove.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.820
This will give you some much-needed grip.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.400
Now it will be much
easier to open that lid.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.420
If the previous two tricks
didn't work then try this.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.610
Use a spatula or something
similar to hit the jar,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.690
either on top or at the bottom.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.440
If that doesn't work,
then grab a spoon and tap

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.260
all around the top edge of the lid.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.630
That should loosen the
seal, allowing the pressure

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.320
to equalize slightly, making
it easier to remove the lid.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.130
Finally, if all else
fails, grab a hairdryer

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.810
and heat up the lid with it.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.990
Or, you could turn the jar upside down

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.870
so the lid heats up in hot water.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.650
Then, grab a cloth and twist
the lid and it should open.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.690
This heat should expand
the lid, loosening it up.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.410
Number three, folding shirts.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.830
If you don't have your mom
to do all your washing,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.140
ironing and folding for
you, then you probably

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.640
just leave all your clothes bundled up

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.590
on the ground in some huge pile.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.470
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.110
There is an amazingly simple way

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.850
to fold all of your clothes
in under two seconds.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.500
All you have to do is
follow these simple steps.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.720
First lay your shirt down on the ground,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.940
and imagine three points on the shirt,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.140
positioned between the shirts
center line and outside edge,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.180
A, B and C, where A is
half way down the shirt.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.690
Start by pinching point
A with your left hand,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.690
and grab B with your right hand.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.130
Cross your right hand
over to pick up point C,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.650
and then unfold your arms and
fold the shirt back on itself.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.740
With just a bit of practice over time,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.300
you can perform this fold very quickly.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.690
It will save you a lot
of time in the future.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.100
Number two, post-it notes.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.860
Turns out most of us peel
post-it notes incorrectly,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.250
from top to bottom.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.410
This bad habit leaves us with curly edges

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.600
on our post-it notes.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.950
That means they lose
some of their stickiness.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.727
If you want your post-it notes to stick,

00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:45.660
well then just start at one side,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.590
and pull the note to the opposite side.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.820
Voila, a flat-lying note.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.730
Okay, this may be a classic
first world problem,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.060
but it matters if you care about

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.340
your sticky note actually being sticky.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.500
Before I reveal the number one spot,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.020
I'd like to remind you to subscribe

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.500

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.550
We upload amazing,
fact-filled list videos daily.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.410
Also, make sure to click that bell icon

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.610
to stay updated, or you'll
regret missing out on

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.020
some amazing knowledge that
could have filled your brain.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.250
Now let's get back to it.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.410
Number one, keyboard feet.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.320
Have you ever wondered
what those little feet

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.840
that extend out of the back
of your keyboard are for?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.900
Most of us, like myself included,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.100
assume they exist for ergonomics,
just to make the keyboard

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.720
more comfortable to type on.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.381
However, this isn't entirely true.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.520
It turns out that feet under
keyboards have been mandatory

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.220
since the beginning of the 80s,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.180
when the International
Organization for Standardization

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.720
stipulated that it should be possible

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.200
to adjust the rear
height of all keyboards.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.550
Back then, people were
used to typing at height

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.320
with machines such as typewriters,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.110
so the feet were meant
to adjust the keyboard

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.780
to a higher angle that
people were more used to.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.570
However, nowadays they are only important

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.610
for people who can't type blind.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.610
When the keys are extended,
people who have to

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.380
look at the keys, and typically
use two fingers to type,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.070
have a better view of the keys,

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.020
so it's advantageous for them
to have the feet extended.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.730
However, a lot of people
nowadays can type blind,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.300
and in this case, extending
the feet on keyboards

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.888
isn't much use, it can
actually be harmful.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.580
If your a blind typer, and
don't have to look at the keys

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.270
when typing, then extending
the feet can put your wrists

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.470
at risk if they are angled back too far.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.640
For this reason, blind typers
should keep the feet retracted

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.290
and use a flat keyboard.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.990
Various studies have even demonstrated

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.650
a beneficial effect on the
wrists when angling the keyboard

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.690
with a flat or negative incline.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.690
So, if your a proficient blind typer,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.838
then keep those keyboard feet retracted.

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:34.060
Did any of these hacks surprise you?

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.360
Do you know of any other
things most of us do wrong?
