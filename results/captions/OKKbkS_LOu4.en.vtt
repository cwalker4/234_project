00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.080
Why does time pass

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.830
It is a question so profound that few people would even think to ask it yet its effects are all around

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.389
Human beings live in a perpetual present inexorably sealed off from the past, but moving relentlessly into the future

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.269
For most people time seems to be something that is just out there a thing ticking away in the background fixed immutable

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.219
Time seems to go in one direction in one direction only, but physicists see it much differently

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.449
John Archibald wheeler said time is what stops everything from happening at once I

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.530
Wish I could explain what it would be like

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.839
For there not to be time

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.239
But I can't we experience time

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.288
We are psychological creatures that have time and that's kind of one of our defining characteristics, so if time weren't around

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.390
We don't really have even a good way to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.720
Describe what happens because happens, right?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720
That's a verb right there that has to do with time

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.309
So I think once you start wondering about this you get much further into the realms of philosophy than physics

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.970
I actually don't think it's that mysterious. We live in a world

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:23.079
That's full of stuff and this world happens over and over again with the stuff in slightly different positions

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.989
Time is just the label on all those different moments that constitute the history of the universe

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.569
It's very much like the page numbers in a book

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.729
One of the great minds who changed the way science thinks about time was Albert Einstein in

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.178
1905 he published his special theory of relativity

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.990
Which described the motion of objects moving near the speed of light?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.729
In it he demonstrated that time passes differently in different places depending on how those places are moving with respect to one another

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.819
So first I'm Stein studied the effect of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.349
Fast motion, and he found that space and time got mixed up if you moved more quickly and that's his special theory of relativity

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.070
the theory of relativity is so called because

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.489
Even the difference between time and space is relative to what observer is doing the measuring in

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.039
Particular to how fast you're moving

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.130
This is something that we never notice in our everyday lives, but once you start moving close to the speed of light

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.769
relativity becomes crucial

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.359
Einstein showed that the faster one travels the slower time goes for the traveler at the speeds at which humans move this is

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.510
imperceptible

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.950
But for someone traveling on a spaceship at speeds close to that of light

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.160
Time would slow down compared with its passage for people on earth

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.389
One of Einstein's great insights was to understand

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.840
That different people moving at different speeds through the universe

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.040
see

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.529
Different events as being simultaneous there was another important aspect of Einstein's theory which he didn't even realize when he published it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.070
The time was woven into the very fabric of space itself

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.839
It was actually not line Stein but another German mathematician named Hermann Minkowski

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.050
Who pointed out that Einstein's theory could be thought of as a theory of a single?

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.079
Four-dimensional space-time and I signed when he first heard this idea said well, that's just a mathematician talking

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.480
That's not really something that is very useful to physicists

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.550
But once he tried to fit gravity into his theory of relativity. He realized the space-time concept was crucial

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.969
Einstein used this insight to help develop his general theory of relativity which incorporated gravity

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.630
He published it in 1915 ten years after his special theory of relativity which was focused solely on motion

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.530
Einstein tried very hard he worked for ten years after inventing special relativity

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.330
To fit gravity into the framework and eventually he realized he needed a new framework, so he invented what we call the general

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.200
theory of relativity

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.459
Where Einstein says that this space-time stuff this four-dimensional world in which we live has a life of its own?

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.440
Space-time itself can move it has dynamics it has curvature

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.390
and it's that curvature that geometry of space-time that you and I

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.649
Experienced as the force of gravity and then he found the time was also

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.029
Changed by your proximity to a very massive object so like a black

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.290
Hole is the best example

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.629
But also just how close we are to the earth or to the Sun or anything else that has a gravitational field

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.680
changes the passage of time

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.920
With the general theory of relativity he demonstrated that massive objects warped the fabric of space-time

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.880
It is this curvature that causes time to slow down near them

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.630
Accordian general agility time

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.569
slows down near massive bodies

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.950
It slows down any place that gravity pulls you tour

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.630
Time slows down in proportion to the gravitational pull of a nearby object so the effect would be strong near a black hole

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.559
But milder near the earth, but even here it can be detected

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.040
Einstein's theories had to be taken into account when the GPS system was set up, otherwise it would have been inaccurate

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.390
These ideas about space and time being relative sound very

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.610
Wild and far out and removed for everyday experience, but to physicist. They are very very important. There's something we observe every day

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.120
One of the interesting things about Einstein's equations is that none of them suggest time goes in only one direction

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.569
They work equally well if time goes forwards or backwards

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.899
This is in contrast to everyday experience

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.170
One of the conundrums is that?

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.700
The laws of physics for the most part do not distinguish between time going forward and time going backwards and yet the actual

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.340
World that we experience certainly is different

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.270
forward to backwards one scientist who puzzled over the directionality of time was Arthur Eddington a 20th century

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.260
astronomer who defined the concept of the arrow of time based on observations made by the 19th century physicist Ludwig Boltzmann

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.510
In space there's no preferred direction. There's no difference in the laws of physics

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.959
If you look left or look right, but there seems to be an enormous difference between the past and the future

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.099
That's what we call the arrow of time, and it's a little bit mysterious

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.909
Why is the past so different from the future? We think it's not a difference in the deep down fundamental laws of physics

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.750
It's actually just a difference because of the universe in which we live

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.390
The arrow of time is just time as we experience one second following one other second following another second

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.189
It's just the x psychological experience of time and the fact that

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.059
Things change as we experience them, but it seemed to happen in the world forward so buildings get built

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.760
But they decay slowly, and it's that decay, there's at least partially responsible for the arrow of time

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.010
It's the increase of entropy so in thermodynamics. We know that things get more random over time and

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.259
That appears to be very fundamental to our experience of time and what's happening in the universe?

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:18.269
The arrow of time is based on the second law of thermodynamics, which says the disorder known as entropy increases with time

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:25.498
For example a building left untouched will slowly decay into its surroundings it will disintegrate into a more chaotic state

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.729
But it is highly unlikely that the building will become more orderly over time

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:34.829
This is because there are many more ways for a system to be disorderly than orderly

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.708
There can be many ways for something to break for instance

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:40.859
but only one way for it to be put back together again a

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:47.248
System will be less disordered in the past and more disordered in the future. This is the arrow of time

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:55.049
So how can the arrow of time be reconciled with Einstein's equations if time can go forwards and backwards according to relativity?

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.779
Does that mean it's possible to go backwards in time?

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:06.239
We actually don't know whether it's possible to travel backwards in time. We do know it's possible to travel forwards yesterday

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.779
I travel forwards 24 hours and Here I am right now

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:17.609
You can't help but travel forward in time our best guess is that you just can't travel backward in time

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:24.749
The theory of relativity does allow time travel to the future if I go down near a black hole

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:30.118
And stay there for one hour you may go forward by seven years by the time

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:35.219
I come back, so you've moved forward in time seven years while I move forward in time just one hour

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:43.529
Einstein's theories do allow for the formation of wormholes in space these are shortcuts that link otherwise distant places in the space-time continuum

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.410
So a wormhole is

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.540
a hole in

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.360
Space and time that comes out somewhere else

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.399
And it does it much faster than the speed of light potentially so it would be a way of

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.069
violating what we think of otherwise as a fundamental speed limit in Einstein's theories and

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:05.458
It does it in a way that doesn't obviously violate

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.979
Einstein's theories, but we're not sure that there's any actual way you can build a wormhole

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.070
They might be shut off from the rest of space and time and so could never actually use it to do anything

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.159
Although wormholes are theoretically possible, they're a highly implausible proposition

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:28.759
That's because the equations suggest enormous masses and energies would be required to create and manipulate one

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.290
There are two problems of the wormholes one is if you don't have one how you create it

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.529
And the other is if you do have one. How do you hold it open?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.969
So it doesn't collapse and prevent you from going through and in both cases

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.839
What we understand about these questions

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:48.079
points toward a

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.920
Conclusion that wormholes are probably forbidden by the laws of nature

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.039
What remains then is a mystery?

00:09:55.589 --> 00:10:01.489
Theory fails to forbid traveling backwards in time, but practice suggests it might just as well be forbidden

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.149
For now it would appear the arrow of time cannot be reversed

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.099
No, one knows. Why time passes, but it seems that no matter how people look at it

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.589
It goes in one direction in one direction only

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.540
You
