00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.470
Welcome to the show.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm Ellen and like many of you,
I am a baby boomer.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.810
We are the generation that grew
up drinking from garden hoses and

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.605
drinking orange Tang and
drinking from our parent's liquor cabinet.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:14.915
[LAUGH] Baby boomers were
born between 1946 and 1964.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.575
They call us that because
after the World War II,

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:19.815
there was a boom of babies being born.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.575
People were like, we lived through
the war, let's make whoopee.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:25.405
And-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING]

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:26.425
&gt;&gt; For you millennials,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.697
making whoopee is like Netflix and chill.

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:34.282
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHING] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; That's what it is.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:41.889
[APPLAUSE]
But they were married.

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:46.365
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's the difference.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:53.140
[APPLAUSE] So, millennials were
born between 1982 and 2004.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.220
These are people who will
never know the joy of using

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.080
the end of a pencil to dial the phone.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.745
Do you remember that?

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:01.350
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You would actually

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.425
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE] We're back.

00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:06.375
I have some news for baby boomers,
we are not the majority any more.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.335
A new census says that millennials
have over taken us, and

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.570
I know this because a 20 year old staff
member read it to me form the internet.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.420
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; So, I want to play a little game.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.740
I am gonna test the knowledge between
baby boomers and millennials and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560
see how well they know each other.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.964
Tracy Woods and Chantelle Miller,
where are you two?

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:27.220
[APPLAUSE] All right, so I'm gonna ask you
questions about the other generation and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.990
we'll see how well y'all know each other,
okay?

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.440
&gt;&gt; All right,
we're gonna start with the baby boomer.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.680
What does, and don't help, anybody,
because we want to see how much she knows.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.950
Okay.
&gt;&gt; What does yolo mean?

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.890
&gt;&gt; Yolo.
[LAUGH]

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.180
&gt;&gt; What do you think it means?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.572
&gt;&gt; It's an icon on the text messaging.

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:44.616
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:45.750
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No, no.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.440
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right,
&gt;&gt; You only live once.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yolo, yeah.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.930
