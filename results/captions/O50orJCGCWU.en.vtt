00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.004
All season long,

00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.714
we have been introducing you to amazing
educators who are changing kids' lives.

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.508
Our next guest is no exception.

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:10.286
He starts every class with a mantra to
get his students ready for the day.

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:11.553
Take a look.

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:12.951
&gt;&gt; I am number one.

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:14.078
&gt;&gt; I am number one.

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:15.296
&gt;&gt; I am number one.

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:16.655
&gt;&gt; I am number one.

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.185
&gt;&gt; I have everything it
takes to be number one.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.143
&gt;&gt; I have everything it
takes to be number one.

00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:22.303
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Scholarship.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:23.282
&gt;&gt; Scholarship.
&gt;&gt; Scholarship.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:23.967
&gt;&gt; Scholarship.

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:24.512
&gt;&gt; We all get.

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:25.128
&gt;&gt; Scholarship.

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:26.480
&gt;&gt; We all get-
&gt;&gt; Scholarships.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.735
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:31.402
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Welcome Michael Scruggs.

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.100
You're a fantastic human being.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.070
You start everyday with a mantra and
you've been doing this everyday for

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.890
eight years.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.430
&gt;&gt; Everyday for the past eight years.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.309
Now mind you, I have six classes and
I teach high school,

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.930
so I'm running around all day long.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.750
&gt;&gt; Six times a day.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.330
&gt;&gt; Six times a day is the best way to
get some exercise, some cardio in.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.181
&gt;&gt; Sure is.

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.594
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; You should make them run with you,

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:56.440
you should have a chain.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.280
&gt;&gt; Let me tell you this, now some of
them will jump up and run behind me.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.260
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; And I'm like hey,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
get it all out now cuz when instruction
time come, I want you sitting down and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.790
paying attention.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So it's all good.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.953
&gt;&gt; So you wanted to get that out there
because they will take that in and

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:15.002
they will remember those words and
I think our thoughts create energy.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.120
&gt;&gt; Most definitely, the power of life and
death is in your tongue and

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.110
what you speak shall come to pass.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.240
My thing is, I want my students to know,
not everyone can be the number one lawyer,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.440
the number one doctor,
number one police officer.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.218
But whatever you put your mind to, you
can be the best at anything you can do.

00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:33.831
And to see now,
my former students who are firefighters,

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.239
who are teachers,
who are in the professional world.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.755
Have graduated from college, and

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:42.030
they still recite this and
they believe that they're number one.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.580
Believe me, something big is happening and
I am excited.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.457
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:47.075
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.162
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; You've got that energy.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.806
&gt;&gt; I love it.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:59.144
&gt;&gt; Listen, it's good for all of us to
hear those words, but especially those

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:04.924
students cuz they come from families and
neighborhoods that are really tricky.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.591
And so even more so for them, right?

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:07.924
&gt;&gt; Right, you would be surprised,

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:10.550
a lot of people would be surprised
at what teachers see every day.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.705
I tell people all the time,
teaching is a calling.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:17.397
You have to realize that
you have to be selfless.

00:02:17.397 --> 00:02:20.803
And I have students who come
from some bad neighborhoods, and

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:22.190
who come from bad homes.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940
And I could even attest to that,
because I grew up in the inner city.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.000
I grew up in a single-parent household,
and for them to see their teacher

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.271
who has a bachelor's degree, a master's
degree, and I can relate to them.

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.040
It gives them hope that hey,
if he can do it, I can do it too.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.559
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you took two students that-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.487
&gt;&gt; This is what's really spectacular.

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:48.437
I mean,
everything that you're doing is, but

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:50.890
there are two students that
you actually drove to college.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.279
You helped them out?

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.720
&gt;&gt; I had some former students of mine who,
they didn't know they could go to college.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.444
And somebody would be like,
they don't know they can go to college and

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.239
they're seniors.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.728
They didn't know they could go to college.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:04.896
What I did, I will host ACT workshops,
I will do financial aid workshops,

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:07.559
just to teach them, hey,
you can go to school.

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.006
You can apply for school,
you can apply for college.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.835
And to see them get in, that's
the most amazing thing in the world,

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:18.078
and four years later,
to go to graduations.

00:03:18.078 --> 00:03:19.361
Now that's amazing to me.

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.504
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that must feel really good.

00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:21.314
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:27.356
&gt;&gt; I would love, actually you know what,
I want to meet one of your students.

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:28.676
Kylen come on out here.

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:29.454
&gt;&gt; My God!

00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:32.503
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My God!

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:37.497
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My God.

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:40.022
My God.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.422
My God.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.302
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:44.354
&gt;&gt; How you doing, Ellen?

00:03:44.354 --> 00:03:45.214
&gt;&gt; I'm good, how are you doing?

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:46.392
&gt;&gt; I'm great, nice to finally meet you.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.362
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.222
&gt;&gt; My God, that is crazy.

00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:50.255
That is crazy.

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:51.082
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:52.225
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Kylen's here.

00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:53.420
&gt;&gt; Man, my boy is here.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.630
&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm here.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.240
&gt;&gt; That's crazy.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.010
&gt;&gt; What year were you in class with him?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.300
&gt;&gt; Back in 2010, so about seven years ago.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.010
I was in Scruggs' 12th
grade US History class.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.460
&gt;&gt; And
he's the reason you went to college.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, he was a big factor
in me going to college.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.090
He was always in my ear from my 12th grade
year cuz I was not the most motivated

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.015
student-
&gt;&gt; At all.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:14.490
&gt;&gt; In school [LAUGH] I was not
the most motivated person in school.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.202
And Scruggs was always in my ear,
especially with his motto,

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:20.139
you are number one, you have
everything it takes to be number one.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.600
And it always stuck with me.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.790
And Scruggs always kept his hands on
me and made sure that I was okay and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.275
I had everything that I needed.

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:30.820
Even when it came to college, gave me a
wonderful recommendation letter, supplies,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.140
anything that I needed.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.540
Even offered to drive me
to school several times.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Unbelievable.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.390
We have to take a break.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.448
We're gonna talk more
with you two after this.

00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:41.202
We're back with Michael and
one of his former students, Kylen, and

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:43.258
is it your wife or
your girlfriend in the audience?

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:44.257
&gt;&gt; My girlfriend, Zoe.

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:44.793
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:45.657
&gt;&gt; Hey there.

00:04:45.657 --> 00:04:49.576
&gt;&gt; This is like family though?

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.401
&gt;&gt; Yes,
Scruggs is a big part of my family.

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.122
He knows everybody from my grandma on down
to my four-month-old daughter, Chloe.

00:04:56.122 --> 00:04:59.673
He calls and makes sure that she's okay
and she has everything that she needs.

00:04:59.673 --> 00:05:02.121
My grandma makes him his own
cookie pudding on holidays.

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:04.615
[LAUGH] That's how I know
he's family right there.

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:05.289
&gt;&gt; Cookie pudding.

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.501
[LAUGH].

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:07.224
That sounds good.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.664
&gt;&gt; It's the best, it's the best.

00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:10.449
&gt;&gt; That sounds very,
very good right now, cookie pudding.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.243
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:15.120
&gt;&gt; Michael, we feel everybody
needs more teachers like you.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.434
That's why we like celebrating anytime
we find a teacher like this, right?

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:19.714
I mean, this is the most important thing.

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:21.994
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:24.131
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; So

00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:28.492
Shutterfly cares about supporting
teachers who are sharing life's joy and

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:31.840
they want to give you $20,000 so
you can continue.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.793
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My God.

00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:39.250
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.891
&gt;&gt; So that's for you.

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:45.537
And Kylen,
you mentioned you have a baby girl.

00:05:45.537 --> 00:05:46.081
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:46.868
&gt;&gt; She's four months old.

00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:47.751
&gt;&gt; Chloe, yes, ma'am.

00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:51.065
&gt;&gt; We have our Mother's Day show
that unfortunately you missed.

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:56.586
But we gave away thousands and thousands
of dollars of baby gifts for Mother's Day.

00:05:56.586 --> 00:06:00.203
We're gonna give you every single thing
that we gave away for Mother's Day.

00:06:00.203 --> 00:06:03.515
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
