00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.280
First up: he is a visiting Professor of Economics at The New School University and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.160
the author of Democracy at Work, please welcome Richard D. Wolff.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.000
Professor? How are you, Professor?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.320
[WOLFF] Pretty good. [MAHER] Thank you so much for being here.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.600
I'll tell you why you're here. I did a story on the show a couple of weeks ago

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.840
I read in USA Today that they had crunched these

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.480
numbers and found out that to reach the "American Dream," the typical American Dream,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.840
they weren't asking for the world,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.520
you know, a vacation, a car - not two cars -
 maybe go out to dinner once a week...not crazy stuff

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.380
It would cost a family of four $130,000/year just to live like that.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.400
And the median income is $51,000 - to say nothing of the people who probably make less than that.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.020
$51,000 to $130,000...how do we close that gap?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.360
[WOLFF] Well, I think the first thing to face is that it means, as the article said

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.020
that only 1 out of 8 American households is able to have the "American Dream" right now.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.420
That we now live in an economic system that is saying to 7 out of 8 American families: "Not for you anymore."

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.260
You know, when I was a young man, we were told in school that capitalism was a great system

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
because it created and sustained a big middle class; that was a virtue.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.780
Well, if that applies, then we have to face the fact that we now have a system that can't do that.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.880
That has denied that to the larger number of our people.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.520
And that raises the question: can't we do better than this?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.760
Can't we do something about an economic system to make it work better?

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.180
[MAHER] And how do we do that? I mean, I know that you're a Marxist, right? I mean you actually were-

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.920
[WOLFF] No horns.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.500
[MAHER] No horns. And that's got to be one of the frustrating things about being a Marxist

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.920
is that right away when you say that word in America, people get hysterical. It's just an economic system.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.660
I mean, I don't think I'm a Marxist, but tell me why you are and why it's not scary.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.820
[WOLFF] Well, you know, it's really kind of simple.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.900
When capitalism developed in the world back in the 18th century in England and spread to Europe and then to us-

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.340
[MAHER] England is in Europe. [WOLFF] That's true - the rest of Europe.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.860
[MAHER] And I'm not a big time Professor. Alright, go ahead.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:35.400
[WOLFF] Anyway, when it did spread that way, it kind of had a commitment, if you want, to develop the world and grow things.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.280
And it had theorists who celebrated it:  Adam Smith, David Ricardo, the famous theorists-

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.300
[MAHER] The invisible hand.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.820
[WOLFF] Exactly. They looked at capitalism, they loved it, and they analyzed it.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.700
But then along came this other guy: Karl Marx, a little bit later.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.860
He looked at it and said basically: we can do better.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.120
And he developed an analysis based on that approach.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.660
And for me, as I think it ought to be for any rational person, you study the system based on the thinking

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.360
of the people who love it, but you also look at the thinking of the people who are critical of it.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.160
And then you come to your own judgement.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.420
We've been a nation - and it's my whole life experience in the United States - that has been hesitatant to do that.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.040
Doesn't want to weigh the two sides.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Wants to be the celebrator all the time, and never look at the side of the criticism.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.500
And I think when we grow up as a nation, it's time to look at that part of the way capitalism works

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.880
that is understood by the critics. And Marx was just a critic. That's all.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.360
[MAHER] So you don't think what happened with communism was Marxism?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.220
I mean, you don't think we already discredited that system?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.920
Because my theory - and of course, again, I'm not really a Professor of Economics, although I play one on TV -

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.300
is that my analogy is: a rushing river.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.240
You know, rivers only go in one direction.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.340
The Chinese actually tried to - or maybe they did - changed the course of rivers. They moved them.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.440
Now that's quite an exercise in hubris, when you think you can make the river flow backwards.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.060
To me institutions have to be grafted on the way human nature really is.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.480
You have to go with the flow of the river. Human nature is greedy, and selfish.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.040
Capitalism, I think, is the system that takes advantage of that. I just say put dams and locks on the rivers

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.280
but don't try to make the river flow in the opposite direction, which is what I think is what Marxism does.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.140
[WOLFF] Well I think what happened is that people got excited about Marxism and took it in directions that we don't want to go in again. We have to learn from that.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.960
But people have done that with almost any system of thought

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.420
including the lovers of democracy, the lovers of capitalism...

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.120
Some of them did things that in the name of that that we don't agree with, and we want to learn what not to do.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.200
And I think the Soviet Union, China and so on, give us lessons in what not to do.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.240
But Marx was not a thinker about socialism and communism - never wrote a book about it.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.419
His analysis was about capital.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.900
And he was interested in understanding what about it is positive and what about it isn't so positive.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.860
And how can we go further?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.960
I use this simple analogy:

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
If you wanted to understand a family down the street: mother, father, couple of kids

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.840
and one kid thought it was the greatest family ever; and the other kid said it was a disaster.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.280
If you wanted to understand the family you'd want to talk to both kids.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.220
It's not a question of which one is right or wrong.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.100
But you want the understanding of the celebrator and you want the understanding of the critic.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.900
Marxism, in the way that Marx wrote about, is the analysis of capitalism from the perspective of a critic.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.580
And I think we would only be better off if we had followed a little bit of that

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.660
so we would understand better the problems of capitalism.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.560
We would handle them a bit better.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.080
[MAHER] I'm wondering if any system...

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.040
I'm wondering if there's any system that

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.639
really is going to work in the future

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.650
when it seems like workers are facing

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.920
this storm of (1) automation, they can't stop that,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.800
robots take people's jobs,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.600
and (2) when they don't, it's people in countries overseas who work for a fraction of

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.820
what people will work for here in America. I mean, that's only going to get worse.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.360
How are we going to deal with that?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.480
[WOLFF] Well, I think that's very crucial to understand how how serious that has been.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.580
You know the early histories of capitalism in our country, in other parts of the world the last 200 years

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.040
we built up the industry in North America, Western Europe, Japan; those places.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.340
Capitalists made money there and they built their industries there

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.160
but the logic of capitalism, which is to make a buck, to make as many bucks as you can,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.200
has now in the last 30 years said:

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.640
"Why are we doing this in the countries of North America, Western Europe, where the wages are pretty high?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.020
Where the workers have struggled successfully to have a "middle class"?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.040
We don't want that anymore. We can do much better with a modern jet engine, with modern telecommunications.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.260
We can produce far away in China and India and Brazil paying a tiny fraction of the wages.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.340
And boy are we going to make a lot of money."

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.720
And that's what they've been doing, and that's what they're going to continue to do.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.740
And it means that the old centers of capitalism - us - are in a position of being abandoned

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.480
by the very system that brought us up but is now moving on.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.700
And if we don't do something as a nation to hold that in, to prevent that from continuing,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.120
we're looking at a situation in which cities like Detroit and Cleveland that we now see as such problems

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.600
are going to become much more typical of our country than even they are now.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.860
And I find that a very scary proposition.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:33.020
And I'm doubly scared by the fact that we seem to be a nation that is wary of confronting the problems of capitalism

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.900
because we have this history of a one-sided celebration.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.580
[MAHER] I think Cleveland's doing okay.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.320
Thank you, doc, I appreciate you coming by.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.460
[WOLFF] Thank you very much.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.920
[MAHER] Detroit's in trouble, I'll give you that one...
