00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.287
- We're learning things about
what President Trump does

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.056
before bed at night, and...

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.625
It's even worse than you think.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.894
- This week's "New York
 Magazine" reports that Trump

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.263
and the Fox News host
 Sean Hannity

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.632
speak on the phone
 most weeknights.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.001
The report also quotes a
 former White House official

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:38.504
who says Hannity and Fox
 create a feedback loop

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:43.343
that puts Trump in a
 "weird headspace," adding...

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.922
- Okay, okay,
you have to admit,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.258
it's cute that these two talk
before bed every night.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.626
Yeah,
they're like eight-year-old

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.795
tree house buddies
with those cans on strings,

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:06.699
you know, gossiping about which
girls they secretly paid off.

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:09.001
You know, or whether
it's "yanni" or "laurel."

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.570
It's laurel, by the way.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.840
But that feedback loop part is
really weird for me, right.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.608
They're saying
that President Trump

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.511
says something outlandish
to Hannity on the phone.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.546
Hannity then repeats it on TV

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.615
and then Trump watches that
and goes, "You see?

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.284
Exactly!
That's what I was saying!"

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.353
Trump is like that gorilla
getting riled up

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.388
on what he's doing
in the mirror.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.258
He's like,
"You see what he did?"

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.260
And here's my favorite part
of this story.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.662
White House staff know
that the calls happen,

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.831
thanks to the president
entering a room

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.868
and announcing "I just hung up
with Hannity."

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:46.205
Or even ringing Hannity up from
his desk in their presence.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:49.208
How are you both the president
and a star [bleep]?

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.344
How? Like, no other world
leader does that,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:52.845
you realize it.
Putin's never talking

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.047
to his assistant like,
"[Russian accent] Not big deal,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.617
"but I was at party with actor
who play Sheldon

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.619
"on 'Big Bang,' yeah.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.754
"Yeah, Elon Musk and Grimes
there too.

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.157
Just saying. Yeah. Yeah."

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.160
[eerie music]

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.861
So lawmakers in both parties

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:11.364
are against Trump separating
kids from their parents.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:15.234
And more surprising, even Trump
is against Trump

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.937
separating kids
from their parents.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.605
- We want to solve
this problem.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:21.874
We want to solve
family separation.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.710
I don't want children
taken away from parents.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:28.147
- Now, I know you might be
a little confused right now.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.784
Like, why would Trump hate the
policy that he himself made?

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.719
But let's be real.
You don't always love

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.588
everything you make.

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.557
And also--and also--

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.226
[cheers and laughter]

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.994
The president's--

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.730
The president can't just change
this policy.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.299
I mean, well, he can,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:50.303
but not without the approval
of his most trusted advisors.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:54.607
And the problem is, the members
of Trump's TV cabinet team,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.976
like, they seem to be fine with
everything that's happening.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.679
For instance, here's the
Secretary of Inhuman Services,

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.214
Laura Ingraham.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.583
- Since more illegal immigrants
are rushing the border,

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.819
more kids are being separated
from their parents

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.788
and temporarily housed
in what are essentially

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.356
summer cra--camps,

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.326
or as the "San Diego Union
Tribune" described them today,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.595
as looking like basically
boarding schools.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.663
[groaning]

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.166
- Yo, what--what kind of
freaky-ass summer camps

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.568
did she go to?

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.937
Was her family just dropping
her off every June

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.639
at state prison?

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.341
She was coming out like,
"Camp was so fun!

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.177
"We made license plates
and shivs!

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.180
And I-I got this teardrop
tattoo!"

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.848
You only get that
if you kill people.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:38.818
"Yeah."

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.519
But just to be clear,
once again,

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:43.623
the point is not how nice
the places are

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.124
that they're keeping these kids
in, right.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.959
The point is that
the federal government

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:49.695
is snatching kids
away from their parents.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.631
If you kidnap someone's kid,

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.633
but you keep them
in a really nice basement,

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.301
that's still not okay.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.803
Liam Neeson wasn't like,
"What kind of food

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:59.405
"are you feeding her?

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:00.973
"What? Sushi?

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.709
Well, I guess she has been
taken... care of!"

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:06.345
[laughter]

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:08.814
That's not how it works.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.349
[cheers and applause]

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.351
So...

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:14.186
So Laura Ingal--Ingraham--

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.489
So Lauran Ingraham clearly
won't be advising

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.325
the president to stop
separating these families.

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:21.761
And neither will Director
of False Equivalencies

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.229
Tucker Carlson.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.498
- This is one of those moments
that tells you everything

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:26.899
about our ruling class.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.801
They care far more
about foreigners

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.036
than about their own people.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.470
They don't care

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:32.738
because no matter what
they tell you,

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:34.540
this is not about
helping children.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:37.376
Lot of people yelling at you on
TV don't even have children,

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.346
so don't for a second let them
take the moral high ground.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.948
- Wow.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.252
This angry McNugget
seriously just said,

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.821
"You can't care about kids
unless you have kids."

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:51.691
That is the dumbest logic
I have ever heard.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.993
How does Tucker not get that
you can care about things

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.095
that don't directly affect you?

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:59.565
And I'm just glad that he's
a TV pundit and not a doctor.

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.834
It'd be like, "Dr. Carlson,
what should I do

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:03.736
about my cancer?"
Well, I don't have cancer,

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.971
so really, I don't give a shit.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.641
Yeah, I, uh, I just don't.

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.143
But, uh, but...

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:14.547
If you ever get hemorrhoids,
gimme a call, yeah.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.183
[laughter]

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:20.086
So top advisors
Tucker and Laura

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.621
clearly won't let the president
change this policy

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.457
that he hates so much,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.791
and it's gonna get even worse

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.626
if he watches
"Fox and Friends"

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.896
because Brian Kilmeade was
making every single argument

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.933
in one sentence
at the same time.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.568
- And as Nancy Pelosi steps
over the homeless

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.036
in San Francisco to hop
on a plane

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.938
to go to the border
to have a heart bleed

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.840
for the--for people
from other countries

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.109
that are coming here,
understand

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.511
we are $20 trillion in debt.

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:47.613
We have--
classrooms that overrun,

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.548
we have teachers buying
their own supplies.

00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:52.518
These kids come in fantastic,
Oprah Winfrey.

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.186
I'm glad you're upset about it,

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.590
but what--these kids get fanned
out to working-class

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:01.160
neighborhoods into our society
and then they have to be

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:03.396
paid for by--
English as a second language,

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:04.864
and then they gotta be schooled

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.400
and a lot of them, uh, sadly...
- Right.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.569
- In my neighborhood, turn
into, uh, um,

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.171
- MS-13.
- MS-13.

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.507
- What...

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.110
the [bleep] was that?

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:19.645
I'm sorry,
that's not an argument.

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.047
That was just like
conservative slam poetry.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.217
Just like,
Pelosi, Oprah Winfrey,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.622
killing the American dream
with MS-13, teen, teen,

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.190
teen, teen, teen.

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:34.293
[cheers and applause]

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:35.494
Look...

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.263
Look, man,

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.764
the fact of the matter is,

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:41.367
separating kids from their
parents is heartless, okay.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.702
And the only way
that we can stop the government

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:46.572
from doing it
is to demand change.

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.674
So get on the phone

00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:50.776
and call the people
who can actually do something

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:52.978
about this, and I'm not talking
about Congress.

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:56.115
I'm talking about the
policymakers at Fox News.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:58.984
Yeah, call them,
'cause they can do something.

00:06:59.017 --> 00:07:01.654
They work for the president,
which means they work for you.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.923
♪ ♪

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.492
- Today was a very bad day
for President Trump.

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.894
Not only was his favorite
comedian found guilty,

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:11.597
but then the man he picked
for Veteran's Affairs

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.599
was forced to withdraw
from consideration.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.134
And on top of all of that,

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:17.102
Trump's 23andMe results
came back

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:19.772
and they confirmed
that he's 50% Eric.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:23.876
So Trump did what everyone does

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.110
when they're feeling down.

00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:26.712
He called in
to a Fox News morning show

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.647
and it was honestly epic,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.349
because normally
when Trump has a bad day,

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.651
we know Trump watches
"Fox and Friends"

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:34.220
and yells at the TV,

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.121
but today he did the same thing

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:38.457
but we all got to listen in.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.059
And you could tell
from the start

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.562
that this was
going to be special.

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:46.065
- Thank you so much for being
with us, Mr. President.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.666
- Well, good morning,
 and I picked a very,

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.603
very special day because
 it's Melania's birthday.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.872
So I said, "Let's do it
 on Melania's birthday."

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.406
So happy birthday to Melania.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.475
- All right, hopefully there'll
be visits in between,

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:59.278
but have you decided on,
or do you want to tell us

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.547
what you got her?

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.215
- Well, I better not
 get into that

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:04.583
'cause I may get in trouble.

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:05.885
Maybe I didn't get her
 so much.

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:07.586
I'll tell you what,
 she has done--

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:09.421
I got her a beautiful card.

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:13.359
[laughter]

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.328
- How did Trump mess up the
world's easiest question?

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.730
It's like they threw him
a softball,

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:19.365
and he swung and hit himself
in the dick.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.435
[laughter]

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:26.405
And I mean, it's her birthday.

00:08:26.438 --> 00:08:28.874
I can't believe that Donald
didn't get Melania anything

00:08:28.907 --> 00:08:30.276
for her birthday.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:34.246
Now she might think he's not
a very good husband.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:36.749
Also, I would pay anything

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.751
to know what he wrote
inside that card,

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.886
that he definitely
didn't actually get.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.388
Like, "Roses are red,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.656
"love is a mystery,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:47.826
I had a historic
Electoral College victory."

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:50.963
Why did Trump say he called in
to "Fox and Friends"

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.865
because it was Melania's
birthday?

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:54.233
Like, what does that mean?

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.168
He's like, "Honey,
I've got a great celebration

00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:57.603
"planned for us today.

00:08:57.636 --> 00:09:00.239
"I'm gonna talk
to some TV people

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:02.441
while sitting on the toilet."

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.176
Like, "Oh, thank you, Donald.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:06.512
My life is a beautiful dream."

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:10.282
[laughter]

00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:12.418
Okay, so--so the interview

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.420
didn't get off
to a great start,

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.722
but then it got worse.

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:18.157
- I get along with Kanye.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.693
I get along with a lot
 of people, frankly.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:24.430
But Kanye looks and he sees
 black unemployment

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:28.067
at the lowest it's been in
 the history of our country.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.702
- Have Republicans
done a bad job

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:33.339
ignoring the black community
up until now?

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.207
- You know, I think
 it was just a custom.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.242
Uh, people don't realize,
 you know,

00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:38.844
if you go back
 to the Civil War,

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.380
it was the Republicans
 that really did the thing.

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:43.616
Lincoln was a Republican.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.218
- Republicans did the thing?

00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:48.253
[laughter]

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:51.724
Trump would make
a dope history teacher.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.258
It would be so easy to pass.

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:56.328
"Class, what was the turning
point in the Civil War?"

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:57.663
Uh, the thing?

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:59.531
"A plus!"

00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:01.233
Like, he's the first
sober person I've heard

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.203
doing drunk history.
That's amazing.

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.272
Now, this interview was so long
and incoherent and rambling

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:09.575
that even Trump's friends
on "Fox and Friends"

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:11.043
became uncomfortable,

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:14.079
and you could tell
by the looks on their faces.

00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:17.149
- That I will not be involved
 with the Justice Department.

00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:19.451
I will wait till this is over.

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:23.022
It's a total--
 uh, it's all lies.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.090
- All right.
 - It's an absolute disgrace.

00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:26.659
And by the way...
- I want to ask you--

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.060
- No, no, but think of it.

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:29.495
With their loss of
 the Electoral College,

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.996
that they should never lose,

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:33.298
because the Electoral College
 is set up...

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.068
700,000 from a group...

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:37.670
Years to approve them. Years.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.271
- But--
 - We have judges that are...

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.006
You would think that these
 guys would treat me great.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.409
I made them a fortune, so--
 but they treat me horribly.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:44.810
- Okay.
 - And certain people say,

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:46.445
"You're still looking good,
 Mr. President."

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:48.480
- All right. Right. Okay.

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:49.848
- There is no collusion
 with me.

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:51.150
- All right.
- Right.

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.685
- I would rather
 have the popular vote

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:55.320
because it's-- to me,
 it's much easier to win...

00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:57.289
- It's a--yeah, it's a totally
different set of goals,

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:58.791
as opposed
to Electoral College.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.025
- But we have
 an Electoral College.

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.594
- Right.
 - I got 306 and she got what?

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:04.897
223. So remember...
- Right.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.532
- There was no way
 to break 270.

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:10.002
I heard that on CBS
 and NBC and ABC--

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:11.370
they're all fake news.

00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:13.272
- Well, Mist--
 - I heard that for so long.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.740
- Right.
 - At CNN.

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:16.909
- Let's talk about--
 - Better than people think--

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:18.711
- Mr. President, the--right.

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.779
We could talk to you all day,
but it looks like

00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:22.414
you have
a million things to do.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:24.416
- [laughing]

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:27.486
[cheers and applause]

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:31.790
Oh, man!

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:33.759
Oh! Oh, wow.

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.160
I can safely say

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:37.529
that I've never seen
a news anchor try to bail on

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:40.299
an interview with the President
of the United States.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.701
Like, how is it that
he's the Commander in Chief,

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:45.637
but it's the couch people
who have better things to do?

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.939
We--we'd love to keep chatting,

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:48.273
but there's a video
of a dog skateboarding

00:11:48.306 --> 00:11:50.375
that we have to get to,
Mr. President, good-bye.

00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:51.844
Like, I never thought
I'd say this,

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.379
but I actually almost feel bad
for "Fox and Friends."

00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:56.582
Because if you're at a party
and some boring-ass dude

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:57.683
wouldn't stop talking to you,
you could just be like,

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.418
"Uh, I have to go get a drink."

00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:01.253
But these poor guys
are on live television.

00:12:01.286 --> 00:12:03.622
The only excuse
they could come up with was

00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:06.759
that Trump probably had
important things to do.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:09.728
When it was pretty clear
that he absolutely did not.

00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.865
He was like, "No, I actually
have the whole day free.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.100
After all,
it's Melania's birthday."

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:17.970
♪ ♪

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.538
- It came out last week

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:21.573
that Trump's personal lawyer,
Michael Cohen,

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:24.443
who is now in deep federal
investigation shit,

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:27.179
only had three clients
in the past year.

00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:28.447
All right, the president,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.415
who Cohen helped to pay off
a porn star

00:12:30.448 --> 00:12:31.784
that he had an affair with.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.286
His second client,
a major GOP fundraiser

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:35.621
named Elliott Broidy,

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.623
who Cohen also helped
to pay off a Playmate

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:39.191
that he had an affair with.

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:42.828
All right, and then Michael
Cohen had one more client.

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:45.164
All right,
out of 7 billion people--

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:48.634
7 billion people, who could
have wanted to join this club

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:51.003
and use Michael Cohen
as a lawyer last year?

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.806
Only one other person did.

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.875
And this person's identity
was a complete mystery

00:12:56.908 --> 00:12:58.243
until today.

00:12:58.276 --> 00:13:01.013
- This is CNN breaking news.

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.515
- We are now getting word
the lawyer for the president,

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:05.717
Michael Cohen has just
disclosed in court

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.021
that the client who had
requested to remain unnamed

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:12.457
was Sean Hannity of Fox News.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.826
- Thank you.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:14.827
[laughter and applause]

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.896
Thank you.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:21.733
[cheers and applause]

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:23.735
Yeah, it turns out,
Michael Cohen's secret client

00:13:23.768 --> 00:13:28.106
was Sean Hannity, which,
I'm sorry, is not a good look.

00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:30.008
You know right now,
Sean Hannity's probably

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.643
on the phone with his wife
like, "Hey, honey,

00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:34.479
"it's so weird how I used the
guy who pays off mistresses

00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:36.248
"to get me out
of that parking ticket.

00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.117
"[laughs]
It's funny, right?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.286
Hello? Hello?
Hello?"

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.856
Just think about how une--how
unethical this is for a moment.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:46.658
Right, Hannity has been
reporting on this Michael Cohen

00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:48.393
story from the beginning--
from the beginning,

00:13:48.426 --> 00:13:50.462
but he conveniently
never mentioned

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:51.964
that Cohen was his guy.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.498
And I'll tell you what else.
I'll tell you what else.

00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:56.201
Once you know that Hannity
has personal skin in the game,

00:13:56.234 --> 00:13:58.971
like with Cohen,
it's fun to go back

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.006
and look at everything he said
about the FBI raid

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:04.877
because now we can see that
Hannity wasn't just mad,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.245
he was scared.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.614
- President Trump's longtime
personal attorney

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:11.149
Michael Cohen just had
his office, his home,

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:13.452
and his hotel that he was
staying in raided

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.820
by the FBI today.

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.889
This is an unprecedented
abuse of power.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:20.592
Cohen's payment is a perfectly
legitimate business move.

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.127
Mueller's witch hunt
investigation

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.763
is now a runaway train
careening off the track.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:26.064
Spinning out of control.

00:14:26.097 --> 00:14:27.499
If you voted for Donald Trump,

00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:29.167
you better get buckled up

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.836
'cause this is gonna be
a rough ride.

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.671
- You know, now that we know
he was working with Cohen,

00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:34.473
that looks less like a news
show and more like a guy

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.174
really stressed,
giving himself a pep talk.

00:14:36.207 --> 00:14:38.377
He's just like, "Come on,
we gotta get buckled up.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.178
"This is gonna be a rough ride.
Hoo-ha!

00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:43.248
[sniffs]
Ahh!"

00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:44.816
- Tonight, from Washington,

00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:46.685
no one else is talking about
Sean Hannity today,

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:47.753
but he's here any--
[laughs]

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.955
Anyway.
I'm really glad to see you.

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:51.723
Hey, Sean.
- Is there any news?

00:14:51.756 --> 00:14:54.026
Anything happening?
- [laughing]

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.193
- All right, thanks, Tucker.

00:14:55.226 --> 00:14:57.029
- I'm just--
say this.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.630
I--you're like my brother,

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.699
but I'm glad,
for like a millisecond,

00:15:00.732 --> 00:15:02.100
the heat's off me and on you.

00:15:02.133 --> 00:15:05.404
Okay, so I'm--I'm feeling--
- Oh, I appreciate that.

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:07.306
- You know, it says a lot
about your news network

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.341
when all of your top anchors
are playing scandal tag.

00:15:09.374 --> 00:15:12.244
It's like, "I made fun
of the Parkland kids.

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:14.780
Tag, you're it!
I'm out! Thank God!"

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:17.316
Now, what people
are really wondering is this:

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.152
whatever legal advice was,

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.955
why didn't Hannity get it
from his regular attorney?

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.490
Right, instead of turning to
a guy who's specifically known

00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:27.292
for paying off mistresses?

00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:29.461
Why did he go to him?
But according to Hannity,

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:31.797
"Baby, this is not
what it looks like."

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.365
- To be absolutely clear,

00:15:33.398 --> 00:15:36.935
they never involved any matter,
any--

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:38.503
sorry to disappoint so many,

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.206
matter between me,
or third party,

00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:43.208
a third group at all.

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:45.711
And are my questions
exclusively almost focused

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.112
on real estate?

00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:48.947
- Wow, he really slipped in
the "almost" there.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.816
Did you hear it?
Yeah, it was super quick.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:51.883
It was super quick.
He was like,

00:15:51.916 --> 00:15:53.385
"All my questions
to Michael Cohen

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:54.920
"were exclusively,
almost, real estate.

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.121
"Exclusively almost.

00:15:56.154 --> 00:15:57.122
Exclusively almost."

00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:58.256
Yeah, he sounds like the voice

00:15:58.289 --> 00:15:59.558
at the end
of those medical ads.

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.859
Zernax is exclusively
almost side effect free.

00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:02.060
Exclusively almost.

00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:03.562
You can't say
"exclusively almost."

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.397
"Exclusively almost"
is the kind of phrase

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.898
that makes people
ask more questions.

00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:08.967
If someone tells you
that they exclusively almost

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.736
have sex with adults,
you're not hiring them

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.337
to babysit your kids.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.706
That's not what you're
thinking of right now.

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:16.108
But okay, fine. Okay, fine.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.709
Hannity claims
he was just getting

00:16:17.742 --> 00:16:20.545
some informal real estate
advice from Michael Cohen,

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:22.581
which makes what he said
a few hours earlier

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:25.617
on his radio show
all the more confusing.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.497
- Okay, okay, okay, whoa.
No, no. Whoa.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.664
Whoa. Okay, wait,

00:16:39.697 --> 00:16:41.166
So he's not your lawyer?

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:44.002
All you had was a few chitchats
about real estate,

00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:45.871
but you definitely wanted
attorney-client privilege.

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.172
Yeah, you definitely want that.

00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:49.941
What the [...] did you bury
under that house?

00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:51.910
No, I'm just saying, I've had
a lot of conversations

00:16:51.943 --> 00:16:53.378
about real estate.

00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:56.982
At the end of it I never went,
"This never happened."

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:58.583
What Hannity did was so shady,

00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:01.186
even when he tried to talk
about other things on his show,

00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:02.921
his own guests
had to call him out.

00:17:02.954 --> 00:17:04.956
And please, do enjoy.

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:09.127
- A foreign national using, uh,
Russian sources, of all things,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.996
to get it.
Is that a crime

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.597
in Alan Dershowitz's book?

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:13.865
- Well, first of all, Sean,

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:16.535
I do want to say
that I really think

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:19.671
that you should've disclosed
your relationship

00:17:19.704 --> 00:17:23.575
with, uh, Cohen when you
talked about him on this show.

00:17:23.608 --> 00:17:26.111
I think it would've been
much, much better

00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:27.479
had you disclosed
that relationship.

00:17:27.512 --> 00:17:28.814
You were in a difficult
situation, obviously.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.148
- If you understand the nature
of it, professor,

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:31.516
I'm gonna deal with this later
in the show--

00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:33.151
- No, I understand.
- It was minimal.

00:17:33.184 --> 00:17:35.053
I put out a statement about it.
- You should've said that.

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.521
And that would've been fair
to say.

00:17:36.554 --> 00:17:38.557
- It was such a minor
relationship

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.125
in terms of...
- You should've said that.

00:17:40.158 --> 00:17:41.793
- You--you should've said that.

00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:44.162
You--you should've said that.

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:47.466
♪ ♪

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.334
- I beseech
our American lawmakers

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:51.603
from Congress and Senate
to stop slinging mud

00:17:51.636 --> 00:17:54.606
across the aisle and come up
with a bipartisan solution

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:56.675
to an obvious epidemic
of gun violence

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.210
and mass shooting in America.

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:12.224
- I think, uh, that last kid
is very relatable.

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:15.460
I too do not wish to be shot
in the [bleep] face.

00:18:15.493 --> 00:18:17.562
Yeah.
Wherever Malala is right now,

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:21.032
she's like, "That's what
I've been saying, yeah.

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:23.502
We're all on the same page."

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:25.737
Now, most people
who see those kids

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.839
are impressed by how
articulate they are

00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:30.175
and they're inspired
by their passion.

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.077
Other people,
like ex-congressman

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.346
and paid CNN contributor
Jack Kingston,

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.948
they think it's suspicious
that these kids

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:40.218
say they don't want to be shot
in the face.

00:18:40.251 --> 00:18:42.120
- I think it's
a horrible tragedy

00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:43.288
and I am heartbroken,

00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:45.991
but I also know
that their sorrow

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:49.427
can very easily be hijacked
by left wing groups...

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.263
- But do you think it has been?
- Who have an agenda.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.998
I-I--well,
let's ask ourselves,

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:56.234
do we really think that--
and I say this sincerely,

00:18:56.267 --> 00:18:58.603
do we really think
17-year-olds

00:18:58.636 --> 00:19:01.940
on their own are gonna plan
a nationwide rally?

00:19:01.973 --> 00:19:05.477
- I say this sincerely, get
the [bleep] out of here, man.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.647
Really? Really?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.515
[cheers and applause]

00:19:10.548 --> 00:19:12.651
You think--

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.487
you think adults
can convince teenagers

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.355
to do something
they don't wanna do?

00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:18.523
Really?

00:19:18.556 --> 00:19:19.524
Like, you think these kids

00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:21.226
were actually pro-gun,

00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:23.128
and then, what,
George Soros showed up

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.663
and he was like,
"Who wants Skittles?

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:26.631
Yeah!"

00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:29.501
You're shocked that these kids
can plan a few events?

00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:32.170
Like, if this guy
had even seen one movie

00:19:32.203 --> 00:19:34.739
about high school, he would
know that planning rallies

00:19:34.772 --> 00:19:37.642
is at least 30%
of being a teenager, right.

00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:39.945
Yeah, the other 70% is falling
in love with vampires.

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:41.446
That's all it basically is.

00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:44.216
Now, some pro-gun advocates

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:45.750
are taking
the opposite approach, right.

00:19:45.783 --> 00:19:47.686
They do believe
that these kids are acting

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.821
without adult supervision,
and for them,

00:19:49.854 --> 00:19:51.489
that's exactly the problem.

00:19:51.522 --> 00:19:55.527
- The media's focused more
on a teenager's expertise

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.230
in supply-side control measures
for guns,

00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:00.165
which, Tucker, let's be candid:

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.566
they probably have not studied

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:03.835
a very complicated,
layered issue.

00:20:03.868 --> 00:20:05.537
- Yeah, you know what?
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.073
These kids may not
be professors in guns,

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.175
but maybe being in
a mass shooting

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.210
gets you an honorary degree,
yeah?

00:20:12.243 --> 00:20:13.578
Maybe? Just maybe?

00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:15.146
[applause]

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:17.115
Like...

00:20:17.148 --> 00:20:19.451
You do realize--
you do realize that if people

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:20.852
weren't allowed
to share their opinions,

00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:22.320
unless they'd studied
the issue,

00:20:22.353 --> 00:20:24.656
then Donald Trump would
never be allowed to speak.

00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:25.689
Right?
