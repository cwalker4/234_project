00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.840
So this week, my friend Matt and I took a
trip down the Salton Sea and let me tell you,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.660
it was quite the experience.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.110
The lake is basically a 115-year-old engineering
mistake that has arguably turned into an ecological

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.110
disaster.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.539
If you’ve never been before, I highly recommend
checking it out as it will make for a truly

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.530
unique and surreal experience.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.680
Anyway, here’s a short video I made documenting
our adventure.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:45.969
Our first stop was on the North East shore
at the Salton Sea State Recreation Area.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.920
For some reason I assumed that the lake was
closed off to the public for health reasons,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.920
so I was surprised to find that the state
Recreation area was very well maintained with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.890
a series of picnic tables under newish looking
wood canopies.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.470
When we got out of the car, we were immediately
hit with the Salton Sea’s infamous obnoxious

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.900
odor.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.890
Algae blooms occur periodically on the sea
and are fed by various chemicals in agricultural

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.390
runoff from the surrounding farmland.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.280
These blooms reduce the oxygen levels of the
water and create a bacterium that emits hydrogen

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.500
sulfide.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.140
In laymen’s terms, it smells like rotten
eggs.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.259
We walked out onto the beach toward the water,
which I imagine came up much closer to the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.189
campground years ago before evaporation took
its toll.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.950
The sea doesn’t have any bottom feeder fish
like Carp, so anything that dies in the lake

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.070
ends up washing ashore.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.560
In fact, most of the beach was comprised of
pulverized fish bones from the many fish die-offs

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.310
that have occurred throughout the past.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.270
When we were walking back to the car, I spotted
a brand new looking visitor center and thought,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149
“oh we have to go inside.”

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.930
We walked in and were greeted by a lone park
ranger who looked like she hadn’t seen visitors

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.060
in years.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.299
She was eager to show us a short informational
film on the sea, so we walked over to a little

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.140
movie room in the back and she popped in a
DVD.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.200
Here’s my rendition of what we watched:

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.080
“Welcome to the beautiful Salton Sea, where
over one hundred thousand visitors flock to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.520
every year to experience the lure of the sea.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.910
Recent studies have shown that bathing in
salt water actually has several health benefits.”

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.460
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.160
The propaganda-ish film we watched,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.220
produced by the state of California last year actually encouraged bathing

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.370
in the Salton Sea because of its possible
health benefits.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.800
I’m sorry, but I won’t be jumping into
that smelly bowl of soup anytime soon.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:54.660
We hopped back in the car and headed south
to our next stop; Bombay Beach.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.560
Once a thriving resort in the 1950s and 60s,
Bombay Beach is now the scene of a mostly

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.870
abandoned post-apocalyptic trailer park right
out of a Walking Dead episode.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.730
The town is home to some 300 residents as
of the most recent census in 2010 but from

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.819
what I observed, I’m willing to bet the
population is half that at most today.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.910
Abandoned manufactured homes and trailers
line the streets, meeting their demise at

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:31.370
the hands of vandals and becoming a canvas
for amateur artists.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.901
I ventured inside one of the old trailers
and got an uneasy feeling, so I didn’t stay

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:43.510
very long.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.310
We drove to the west end of the town and over
a dike that was built back in the day to prevent

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.400
flooding from the fluctuating lake levels.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.870
Past the dike were ruins of old trailers destroyed
in two great floods in the 70s, a make shift

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.040
pirate ship assembled from the rubbage, and
an eerie art display of painted fish bones

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.440
nailed to what I assume was the old Bombay
Beach pier.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.250
On our way out of town, we drove past the
Bombay Beach Drive-In which was lined with

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.959
shells of old cars and boats including an
AMC Pacer which had quite an impressive VHS

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.770
collection glued to its interior.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.190
Our next stop took us to the Southeast corner
of the sea, just outside the city of Niland.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.190
A place called Salvation Mountain.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.490
This art display is literally plastered onto
the side of a hill and is covered with Christian

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.050
sayings and bible verses themed around the
Sinner’s Prayer.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:52.780
I walked into one of the caverns and instantly
felt like I was transported into a Dr. Seuss

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.060
book.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.720
It was in here that I found a humble shrine
to the creator: a single laminated photograph

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.470
of Leonard Knight stapled to a corner.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.910
Knight passed away in 2014 and ever since,
the site has been cared for quite diligently

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.870
by a group of volunteers.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.060
I observed one of the curators, a bushy-haired
middle aged man in jeans, shouting at tourists

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.000
who were walking too far off the established
pathway and being disrespectful to the art.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.840
He was working diligently to repair and paint
a massive hole that had formed toward the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.130
middle of the mountain.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.830
On the outskirts of the property sat an old
Jeep Wagoneer and flatbed truck plastered

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.760
with similar bible verses and Christian themes.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.800
Just past Salvation Mountain lies a series
of vacant concrete slabs, the only remaining

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.229
vestiges of a dismantled military facility
dating back to the 1940s.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.630
It’s now become a sort of haven for the
downtrodden and those seeking to escape modern

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.460
society.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.810
An experimental art installation located within
Slab City known as “East Jesus” is assembled

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:20.300
from discarded waste and is constantly growing.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:29.520
The art on display range from social commentary
pieces to just downright bizarre.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.020
Interestingly, when the land was given to
the State of California by quitclaim deed

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.990
from the Department of Defense in 1961, new
legislation required that all revenue generated

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.080
from the property be transferred to the California
State Teachers Retirement System.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.509
Sorry teachers, but I wouldn’t recommend
quit your day job quite yet on account of

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:53.509
this place.

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.120
For our last stop, we headed up the west side
of the sea toward Salton City.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.330
But first, we took a detour off of highway
86 and onto an old paved road which leads

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.990
to the old Salton Sea Test Base, a remote
facility used by the military in the 40s for

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.580
weapons testing and then space capsule parachute
drops in the 50s.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.850
We passed a US Border Patrol truck on the
road and eventually reached a 40-foot sand

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.870
drift that had cut off the remaining mile
of road leading to the old base.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.160
Although we had a 4 wheel drive vehicle, we
decided not to take a chance of getting caught

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.970
in the soft sand so I sent my drone up to
travel the remaining mile.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.960
It appeared not much was left of the base
other than a small test building, remnants

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.789
of what appeared to be an old boat dock, and
testing pools lined with tarp now inundated

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:45.960
with sand.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:55.630
Finally, we reached Salton City.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:02.120
Developed in the 1960s with an extensive infrastructure
of roads, sewer line and power grid, the city

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.820
never really took off due to its isolation
and lack of job opportunities.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:13.670
According to the 2010 census, 81% of the surveyed
lots remain undeveloped and 38% of the habitable

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.990
residences are unoccupied.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:22.849
Driving through the city, you’ll find remnants
of what once was a luring resort community.

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:28.449
The Salton Bay Yacht Club attracted many of
the well-to-do of the 50s and 60s and featured

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:31.410
prominent groups like the Beach Boys.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.079
Flooding destroyed the marina and the yacht
club was eventually demolished in the 80s.

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:41.130
All that’s left of it now is remnants of
its parking lot and dead palm tree trunks.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.350
The first nine holes of the PGA Salton City
Golf Course opened in 1963 and attracted celebrity

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.480
golfers like Desi Arnaz, Frank Sinatra and
Dwight Eisenhower.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.730
What remains is a barren desert landscape
with paved golf cart paths.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:05.209
Tourism began to diminish in the 70s due to
the Sea’s rising salinity and flooding problems.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:10.080
By the 80s, the local economy of Salton City
along with most of the other lakeside communities

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.560
had crashed, causing homeowners and businessowners
to abandon their properties.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.260
All that’s left now is the skeleton of a
place that was once called “a miracle in

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.580
the desert.”

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.920
Well that’s about it for my Salton Sea adventure,
I hope you’ve enjoyed this video and I look

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.320
forward to posting some more soon.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.870
And just a reminder to never stop exploring
because a new adventure always awaits.
