00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.885
This week on VICE

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.360
The global threat caused by skyrocketing demand

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.860
for meat.

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:17.065
Our focus is on making the meat

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:18.300
as cheap as possible

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.875
that's where we often have

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.040
environmental catastrophes

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.105
Then crisis that humanity is facing

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:32.785
in our global water supply.

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:33.875
Something's happening

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:37.145
this drought is worse than anything you've ever seen. In the history of farming

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:38.335
here in silicon valley yes.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.435
Those red spots represent groundwater depletion

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:42.435
it's happening all over the world

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.435
*music*

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:09.175
The World Health Organization recently classified processed meats

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.055
in the same cancer causing group 1 carcinogens

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.485
as tobacco, diesel exhaust, and asbestos

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:19.835
But some scientists feel that our global addiction to meat

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.985
might pose an even greater threat.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.985
*music*

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.985
*music*

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:39.565
So this is the very first step of getting the

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:42.080
stem cells out of a piece of muscle.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.420
if we just take a very small piece of it, in a couple of days

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.405
those stem cells will fall out.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.085
Once we have sufficient number of cells

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.495
we will provide the conditions for them to

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:52.905
uh grow into a tissue

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:53.405
meat

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:53.905
 

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:54.405
 

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:56.075
so what is it that you are actually doing here in this lab?

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:58.085
We are creating hamburgers from stem cells.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:01:59.845
Dr Mark Post is famous

00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:02.505
for his work in creating the first

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.655
synthetic burger. And how long does that whole process take to turn

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:07.535
these tiny little stem cells into meat?

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:11.415
About seven weeks, so that's much faster than a cow

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:12.635
much much faster than a cow

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.515
So this is the new McDonald's. Yes. Can I try? No.

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:17.675
 

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:19.745
Mark's first burger cost him more than

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.995
$325,000 to make

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:25.965
This will be the first time a burger made with

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.895
cultured beef has been cooked.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.045
It's close to meat, there's quite some intense taste

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.260
But Marks' hopeful

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.760
he can produce them cheaper

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.865
and on a larger scale. What are your biggest reasons for

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.935
for wanting to make this sort of synthetic meat in the first place?

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.875
The demand for meat is going to increase and

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:46.625
there is no way with current livestock production method

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.215
that we can match that demand. So that we'll put a lot of pressure

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:51.795
on food security. If we would all say

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:54.585
let's refrain from eating meat

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:57.365
five days a week, it would work out fine.

00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:58.560
But we're not doing that.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.365
We're actually doing the polar opposite.

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:01.000
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.500
Global meat production has quadrupled

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.500
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.000
 

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.425
Since the 1960s and by 2050

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.980
it will increase by half again.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.980
One country that's capitalized on that explosive growth

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.060
is Brazil, which is now behind only the US

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.660
for title of largest beef producer in the world.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.580
There's a hell of a lot of resources that go into a feedlot like this, I mean water,

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.745
energy,  absolutely everything is done

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:30.805
for maximum efficiency and that means that each one of these cattle gets to eat about

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:31.435
 

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:33.985
48 pounds every single day. Pedro Morolo,

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.805
owner of the feedlot explained to us how it works.

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:39.995
 

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:43.245
 

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:46.465
 

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:47.965
 

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:52.155
Oh wow! Look at these skinny little runts.

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:55.125
These guys are the cattle that have just arrived

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.020
 

00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:00.425
These are the ones that are about to go for slaughter?

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:03.155
 

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:04.155
Wow, look at the difference in size

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:06.900
that three months can make. You've fed these guys pretty damn well

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:08.185
 

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:09.815
 

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:10.540
Feeding all these cattle

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.920
is already a massive operation and  Pedro

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:15.980
is planning on doubling his production

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.465
to keep up with global demand

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.025
So what is this they're mixing up here?

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:21.025
 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040
 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.200
And how much feed do the cows eat every day?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
450 tons a day? Wow.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.500
This system is called a concentrated animal feeding operation,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.200
or CAFO.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.000
This CAFO is designed to make these

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.380
cattle gain nearly 400 poiunds

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.460
in just 90 days.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.860
These cattle have been cooped up in their pens but now

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.995
they've finally reached the end of the road; they're just being herded

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:50.020
towards the final weighing station before heading out to one of

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.740
several slaughterhouses across the country

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.120
So many cattle have you got in today?

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:33.640
Uh, everything's done on such a massive scale. The amount of cattle

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:34.695
that they're processing

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880
is crazy.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.480
And business is expected to get even better

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.920
Brazil's about to be allowed to export fresh

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:03.660
beef directly to the US.

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.745
Americans ate more than a hundred pounds of read meat

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.800
per person in 2014, and now Africa

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.720
Asia are moving toward that same diet.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:21.205
We spoke to Ken Cook

00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:24.975
A food policy expert about the state of meat production today.

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:26.965
70% of

00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:30.235
the land devoted to agriculture on the planet

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:33.215
is devoted to meat production. That's almost a third

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:35.380
of the entire surface area.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.000
That many acres producing red meat

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:40.855
pork, chicken, all of that is

00:07:40.855 --> 00:07:42.895
completely unsustainable.

00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:46.215
Let's assume that the world population will grow to

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.255
9 billion people by 2050.

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:50.755
There isn't enough land, there isn't enough water,

00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:53.405
there isn't the capacity for the Earth's

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:56.415
atmosphere to absorb all of the CO2 and

00:07:56.415 --> 00:07:58.445
the methane that would come out of animal agriculture.

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:00.085
The problem is

00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:02.815
that our focus is on making the meat as cheap

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.765
as possible, and as they cut those corners,

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:09.085
that's where we often have environmental catastrophes.

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:11.215
To see how meat production can lead

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:13.635
to those environmental catastrophes, we went to

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:15.635
Duplin County in North Carolina,

00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:17.205
where the pork industry is

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.275
so big the hogs outnumber people. So this is the

00:08:20.275 --> 00:08:22.765
lagoon right here. See the pipes coming out?

00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:25.465
It doesn't smell pretty either. Larry Baldwin

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:28.425
monitors CAFOs in North Carolina for the water keeper alliance.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.435
This is the situation. The pigs are in there, they're

00:08:31.435 --> 00:08:34.455
defecating, you know, so you've got urine and feces dropped through

00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:37.195
the floor, but then there are slots through that concrete

00:08:37.195 --> 00:08:38.605
the waste falls through that

00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:41.435
and then gets flushed into the lagoon which is what you see over here.

00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:44.315
So that's where we can see the pipes coming straight out of this

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.985
Each one of these buildings has a pipe

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:48.905
that empties into the lagoon . That's a hell of a lot of waste

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:51.535
Right here. People would be outraged, even

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:54.565
suggesting that's the way we would handle human waste.

00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:55.875
What's the difference?

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.685
And when you see this region from the air, the scope

00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:01.975
of these hog CAFOs and their waste is  incredible.

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.915
 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.940
So up here you can see every single CAFO is

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.460
attached to these huge lagoons

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.020
There's hundreds of them, there's such an intense concentration here

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:45.475
The ground simply cannot absorb this much waste.

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:48.125
And according to NAME  of Cape Fair riverwatch

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:51.145
that's wreaking havoc on local waterways.

00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:54.165
Now this stream's surrounded by

00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:56.195
You see, nitrogen and phosphorus

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.065
level off the chart, bacteria levels off the chart

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.855
it's raw, feces.

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:04.615
And how many sort of streams like this are you looking at

00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:07.345
in North Carolina? Thousands. If you're a fisherman

00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:09.985
or if you're a swimmer,  if you're throwing your ball for your dog

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:11.885
you gotta deal with the dangerous levels of bacteria.

00:10:11.885 --> 00:10:15.065
and this stream flows downstream into the northeast

00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:18.095
and part of the Cape Fear Basin which is part of the

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:19.295
the river basin in North CaRoLiNa

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:22.245
it's a problem, you have to pay more to treat your water which means you have

00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:25.145
to pay more to drink your water. You drink this water?

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.825
A fifth of North CaRoLiNiAnS drink out of the Cape Fear Basin

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:32.285
and it isn't just the quality of the water that's the problem,

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:35.255
in meat producing regions in the west,

00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:36.255
it's the quantity.

00:10:36.455 --> 00:10:39.065
In the dry high plains region, many feed crops

00:10:39.065 --> 00:10:41.255
draw water from the Ogallala Aquifer,

00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:43.815
which is now losing water faster than if can be

00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:45.785
replenished. Mike Callicrate

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:48.655
a small cattle rancher in this area  broke down the relationship

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:51.585
between water, corn and industrial meat.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.035
It takes about 2500 gallons of water

00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:57.895
to produce a bushel of corn. And if an animal

00:10:57.895 --> 00:11:00.925
eats 50 bushels of corn in its time in the feedlot,

00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:03.665
we're looking at about 125,000

00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:06.915
gallons of water per animal under the industrial model.

00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:09.835
So when it comes to those industrial scale feedlots, the majority

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.335
of the water that they're using actually goes into

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:15.495
producing the corn? That's correct and the reason that

00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:18.915
JBS has a big feedlot at Yuma Colarado is because there's water.

00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:21.985
and they don't pay one dime  for that water

00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:25.435
and they pay below the cost of production of that

00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:29.025
corn. The corn is the cheapest thing that we can feed

00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:32.425
because we buy it below the cost of production. The water

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:33.895
is subsidizing that operation

00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:37.935
So, with free water and cheap corn

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:41.085
the price of mass produced beef is kept artificially low.

00:11:41.085 --> 00:11:43.775
The question is, how much of the Ogalalla Aquifer

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:46.625
do we need to support an industrial model

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.805
or any model as far as that goes, and if we are so

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:52.405
foolish as to let that precious resource run out

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:53.705
that's a tragedy.

00:11:54.935 --> 00:11:57.515
Mike showed us the scale of land and water

00:11:57.515 --> 00:12:00.575
used by the giant meat producers here.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.120
So we're just flying over Yuma County in Colarado. This is one of the huge

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.140
huge scale feedlots. You've got a hundred thousand cattle

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.880
in this one feedlot down here. Is this call corn down here, these circular crops?

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.135
While this is the system that produces most of our meat

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.595
we spoke to one farmer who 's going in a drastically

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:54.335
different direction. The system

00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:57.115
that depletes your resource base

00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:58.725
will eventually crash and burn.

00:12:59.205 --> 00:13:01.735
Joel Salitan is part of the farm to table movement

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:04.765
that focuses on responsible production. He uses

00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:07.260
a system called rotational grazing

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.340
holla holla

00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:18.005
So you just move these cows from this patch into her?

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:20.735
Yes, so every day the cows get a brand new salad bar

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:23.515
that was one day's plate full of food,

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:25.995
today they get a new plate full of food

00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:30.025
So there's a huge difference between where they were just now and

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:33.025
where they are now? Sure, this looked just like this yesterday

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:36.115
at this time, and in fifty days

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.105
this will look like this again

00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:40.260
So this is the way that cows have traditionally grazed on grass right?

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.780
This is the role of herbivores in nature

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:46.835
On this type of farm, every animal has a role

00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:49.855
and even their waste plays a part. Joel 's

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:52.715
demonstrating for us this integrated system that he's got going on.

00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:55.575
So he's actually moving his egg mobile containing

00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:58.675
all the chickens right to the spot where the cows have just been.

00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:01.195
doo doo

00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:03.445
We follow the cows with

00:14:03.445 --> 00:14:06.065
the eggmobile, the chickens then scratch through these cows

00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:08.765
paddies and help break them into the soil, eat out the fly larva

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.705
and actually sanitize the field

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:14.715
before the cows come back through so it's a very

00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:17.565
multi speciated system.  I've never seen anyone so excited to

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.585
eat shit before.

00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:24.295
 

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.325
 

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.495
 

00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:31.555
 

00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:34.015
 

00:14:34.015 --> 00:14:36.895
 

00:14:36.895 --> 00:14:39.975
 

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:42.185
 

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.555
 

00:14:46.555 --> 00:14:49.755
 

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:52.885
 

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:55.145
 

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.145
 

00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:00.675
 

00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:03.315
 

00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:06.225
 

00:15:06.225 --> 00:15:08.915
 

00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:11.795
 

00:15:11.795 --> 00:15:14.485
