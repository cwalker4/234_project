00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.550
Earth.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:12.550
November 14, 1969.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.970
Three astronauts, with spacesuits, food, water,
and a battery of scientific and communications

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.359
equipment, prepared to fly to the moon.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.670
Thousands gathered at the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida, including President and Mrs. Richard

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.410
Nixon, to witness the historic launch.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.550
It was raining that day, but that was no cause
for delay.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.800
The ship that would carry them into space
was designed to launch in any weather.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.020
But how would it respond to a powerful electrical
storm now gathering above the launch pad?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:14.370
That was just the beginning of the incredible
journey of Apollo 12.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:22.470
With three astronauts fastened into their
seats, the countdown proceeded.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.320
Astronaut and Mission Commander Pete Conrad
would say later: “The flight was extremely

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:37.180
normal, for the first 36 seconds.”

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.920
The five engines of the Saturn 5’s huge
first stage were designed to burn through

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.920
5 million pounds of liquid oxygen in just
two and a half minutes, and to send the spacecraft

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:06.570
up 67 kilometers above the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.060
When it reached an altitude of 2000 meters,
something unexpected happened.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.680
Racing through the stormy environment, the
rocket generated a lightning bolt that traveled

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:31.340
down its highly conductive exhaust trail.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:43.050
Another bolt hit 16 seconds later.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.980
All of the spacecraft’s circuit breakers
shut off.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.230
The tracking system was lost.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:02.020
A young flight controller in Houston, Texas
instructed astronaut Alan Bean on how to turn

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.430
on an auxiliary power system.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.040
The mission was back on track.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.900
Once in Earth orbit, all systems appeared
to check out, and flight control officials

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.569
gave the crew the green light to leave Earth.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.210
The astronauts were not told of concern that
the lighting strikes had damaged the pyrotechnic

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:42.989
system used to deploy the parachutes that
would ease them back through the Earth’s

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.519
atmosphere.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:54.290
If that system failed, the astronauts would
not return alive.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.159
This mission would have its share of perils,
not unlike those faced by a long line of past

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:08.950
explorers, whose courage and restless spirit
propelled them into the unknown.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.220
This one, however, was backed by years of
technology development, test flights, astronaut

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.620
training, and the largest support team back
home that any mission ever had.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.720
But hundreds of thousands of kilometers out
in space the three astronauts were pretty

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.830
much on their own.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.130
What made Apollo 12 unique was the friendship
and chemistry of its crew.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.150
Conrad, Bean, and Richard Gordon were all
Navy men.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.050
Working and training together on the Gemini
program, they had gained each other’s respect

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.340
and trust.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.240
Now, hurtling across more than 400,000 kilometers
to the moon, they prepared to fullfill the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.970
mission’s goals.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.960
One was to set up a scientific station designed
to record seismic, atmospheric, and solar

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.100
data.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.840
Another was to visit an unmanned lunar probe
called Surveyor III that had landed there

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.060
two and a half years before.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.800
The idea was to bring back a part to study
the effect of the lunar environment.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:45.420
A third goal was to improve on the landing
of Apollo 11 just 5 months before.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.460
Dropping down over a region called the Sea
of Tranquility, pilot Neil Armstrong found

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.720
himself heading straight for a crater full
of boulders.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:08.900
He had to fly over the planned landing site
and find a new one.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:17.120
Now kilometers beyond the target, the lander,
called Eagle, was literally running out of

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.760
gas.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.960
With less than 30 seconds of fuel left, Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin finally touched

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:49.110
down on a landscape obscured by dust stirred
up by 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.270
the vehicle’s thrusters.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.710
Future astronauts would have to be able to
make precision landings at locations dictated

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.259
by science.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.229
That meant they would have to touch down on
landscapes filled with all kinds of rocks

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.699
and craters.

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:16.990
For Apollo 12, the science pointed to a region
known as the Ocean of Storms, some 2000 kilometers

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.660
from where the Eagle had landed.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.800
Here, the landscape is dark from lava that
cooled to form its flat expanse billions of

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.420
years ago.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.490
Within it, an impacting asteroid had hollowed
out Copernicus crater, perhaps showering the

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.780
region with rocks blasted out from deep underground.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.530
To sample this geological treasure trove,
the astronauts sought to land at a series

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:54.030
of smaller craters about 45 kilometers away.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:08.229
After a journey lasting 83 and a half hours,
the crew fired the spacecraft’s engine to

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:14.979
go into an elliptical lunar orbit.

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:22.050
Five hours later a second burn put the spacecraft
into a circular orbit 111 kilometers above

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.300
the lunar surface.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:35.360
The next day, Pete Conrad and Allan Bean entered
the lunar module, Intrepid.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:09:41.009
Separating from the command module, they dropped
down toward their target.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:46.160
Pete Conrad would rely on improvements in
the ship’s landing radar to find his way

00:09:46.160 --> 00:10:19.570
to touchdown.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:26.420
Pete Conrad and Alan Bean landed without a
hitch.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:36.600
Now, they prepared to climb down the ladder
to experience a whole new world.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.939
The plan was for Earth to experience it too,
courtesy of a color video camera that was

00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:48.970
designed to send back a live signal.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:54.260
Conrad was careful to keep it pointed away
from the Sun to protect its sensitive imaging

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.260
tubes.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:02.970
Unfortunately, it caught the glare from Intrepid’s
shiny surface, and blew.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:09.439
Back on Earth, the television networks cancelled
their coverage.

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:14.739
Millions of viewers then went about their
day.

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:22.179
Which left Conrad and Bean to go about theirs’.

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:28.339
The astronauts spent the first of two four-hour
moonwalks setting up science and communications

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:47.250
equipment, taking photographs, and seeing
what was there.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:12:06.070
There were discoveries and surprises aplenty.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:11.189
One was a series of mounds out in the open,
perhaps made up of material ejected from the

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:20.049
craters upon impact.

00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:25.420
Two and a half hours into the moonwalk, the
astronauts flipped their wrist-mounted checklists

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.959
to their next task.

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:36.679
They opened an unlikely page, placed there
by the Apollo 12 back-up crew.

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:42.730
This little prank hardly distracted from their
central goal: to walk among the craters making

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:48.439
observations and picking up rocks.

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:55.910
That was part of a major, unheralded, scientific
quest of the Apollo program: to find clues

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.309
to where the moon came from.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:04.060
At the time, there were three leading theories.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:11.970
The so-called fission theory, championed by
George Howard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:20.250
held that the moon was once part of the Earth,
cast off by the rapid spin of its young parent.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:28.790
That might explain the Pacific Ocean, a giant
hole in the Earth’s surface.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.119
Then there was the capture theory, which held
that the moon was a wayward object that floated

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:37.362
through our solar system and was pulled into
orbit by Earth’s gravity.

00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:47.470
A third idea came from the American astronomer
Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, known at the

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:53.100
time for his attacks on Einstein’s theories.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.040
He suggested that the Moon formed near Earth
and gradually fell under its gravitational

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.769
spell.

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:10.290
In that case, moon rocks should resemble those
of Earth.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.350
Finding out which theory is correct would
also yield clues to the formation of the solar

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:26.949
system at large, and perhaps even to the birth
of our own planet.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.920
Day Two on the Moon.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.800
Neither Conrad nor Bean had been able to get
much sleep.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.759
Excitement got the best of them.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:44.190
The pair now left Intrepid for a second, and
final, moonwalk.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:51.439
The suits they wore had been built for spending
time on the Moon’s surface, with five layers

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:57.459
stitched together to maintain constant temperature
and air pressure.

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:04.239
Because direct exposure to the sun could heat
the suits to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the innermost

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:10.360
layers circulated water around the astronaut’s
body to keep him cool.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:17.309
On the outside was a shell to protect against
micro-meteors that routinely batter the moon’s

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:18.709
surface.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:24.419
The astronauts found that lunar dust was so
abrasive that this outer layer quickly sustained

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:30.119
damage, and so fine that it crept into the
rotating wrist joints.

00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:39.110
This time, the plan was to move out along
the edge of Surveyor Crater and pay the probe

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.309
a visit.

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:49.799
Along the way, there were pictures to take,
samples to collect, coring tools to drive

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:55.060
into the ground.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:02.389
It was a world filled with optical illusions
and strange juxtapositions.

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:10.699
The lunar landscape appears monochromatic,
a bright gray.

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:20.509
With no atmosphere, the light is harsh, with
shadows cast in deep black.

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:26.869
But close up, the moon offers a variety of
rich and colorful details owing to its tumultuous

00:16:26.869 --> 00:16:30.419
past.

00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:36.309
The Ocean of Storms is an ancient basin that
was hollowed out by a huge impact and filled

00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:38.779
with lava.

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:42.879
Finally, the team arrived at Surveyor.

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:49.779
They cut off select components to take back
to Earth.

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:55.999
Scientists would make a surprising discovery
lodged in the camera was a colony of bacteria.

00:16:55.999 --> 00:17:00.910
Did it sneak into the component upon its return
to Earth?

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:06.670
Or, had it somehow survived for two and a
half years on the moon?

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:14.709
To this day, no one knows the answer to this
intriguing question.

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:22.579
One final stop remained: Block crater, where
a basketball-sized impactor had exposed the

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:30.269
lunar bedrock, leaving a wealth of new samples.

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:38.420
One rock they picked up is known as KREEP,
for potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:45.430
It’s thought to be a piece of bedrock that
formed over 4 billion years ago… on a lunar

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:51.330
surface that was entirely molten.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:58.269
Just a few years later, this evidence would
coalesce into a radical new idea of the moon’s

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:00.360
origins.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:08.370
At the dawn of the solar system, Earth shared
an orbit with a Mars-sized body now called

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.370
Theia.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.100
Its orbit became unstable and it headed in
Earth’s direction.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:27.730
Theia struck Earth at an oblique angle, causing
the Earth to spin faster and debris from both

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:36.850
bodies to fly into orbit.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:52.610
When the dust settled, the debris began to
coalesce in Earth orbit, forming the Moon.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:58.100
The moon, then, comes primarily from the outer
layers of the Earth and Theia.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.090
That’s why overall the moon is less dense
than Earth.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:10.210
From this violent beginning, the moon gradually
cooled, and the magma that lined its surface

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.960
hardened into a crust.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.049
It was now time for Conrad and Bean to prepare
for the return flight home.

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:31.200
Along with their gear, they packed up 75 pounds
of scientifically priceless dirt and rocks.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.830
In the years to come, these samples, and those
from the remaining Apollo missions, would

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:49.190
continue to yield clues to the history of
the moon, and its companion, Earth.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:20:21.659
Even as Conrad and Bean lifted off from the
moon, there was still more science to do.

00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:39.490
The lander rose up to join the command module,
docking flawlessly.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:45.730
Conrad and Bean transferred their samples
and equipment.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:54.710
Then they released Intrepid, sending it hurtling
back down to the Lunar surface.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:59.690
The idea was to use the impact of a crash
landing to calibrate equipment that would

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:08.990
monitor moon quakes and asteroid impacts.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:15.110
When it hit, the impact resonnated like a
bell for over half an hour, as seismic waves

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:19.559
rippled through the moon’s interior.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:27.929
There was one more thing left to do: get home
safely.

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:39.910
Just before arrival, they gazed at a brilliant
scene of Earth moving across the sun.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:49.200
Apollo 12 hit Earth’s atmosphere at 40,000
kilometers per hour.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.679
The parachute pack opened just fine.

00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:59.890
Not even a bolt of lightning could spoil this
trip.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:06.690
The crew of Apollo 12 had shown how it’s
done, even adding flair to efficiency and

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.200
precision.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.230
Well, almost.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:18.980
At splashdown, Alan Bean got beaned by a camera
that had not been secured.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.990
His five stitches would be forgotten.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:30.330
What no one could forget was a camera magazine
filled with exposed film that had gotten jammed

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.870
and then accidentally left on the lunar surface.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:44.179
Ironically, given the magnitude of their accomplishment,
the astronauts reported catching hell for

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:46.280
that oversight.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:53.149
Conrad, Bean and the other astronauts of Apollo
will go down in history as the first to step

00:22:53.149 --> 00:23:01.440
off our planet.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.639
Four moon landings later, the program faded
away in the wake of declining expectations,

00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:18.580
social discord, and the politics of those
turbulent times.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:25.009
The incredible journey of Apollo 12 lives
on as a symbol for those who may one day revive

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:38.700
the instinct to travel beyond our planet,
in search of clues to the origins of our world,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:56.960
and our place in the cosmos.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:13.649
