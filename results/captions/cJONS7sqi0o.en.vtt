00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.059
Are we alone?

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.930
Recent amazing
discoveries have given us

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.850
more hope than ever that our
universe is full of life.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.390
So why don't we see it?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.890
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.450
Why don't we see
alien civilizations?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.720
We've asked this question
before here on "Space Time,"

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.830
and if you haven't
seen that episode

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.000
you should check it out.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.790
But today we'd like to go deeper
because it really does seem

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.860
like there should be aliens.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.410
The Kepler Space
Observatory has told

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.600
us there are a couple
of hundred billion nice,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.850
watery planets in the Milky Way
and probably billions of them

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.050
are Earth-sized planets
around sun-like stars.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.630
Many of them have
been around long

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.300
enough to produce
a civilization that

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.670
could have easily colonized
the entire galaxy by now.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.590
So why is the Milky
Way so un "Star Warsy?"

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.670
This genuine oddity is referred
to as the Fermi paradox

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.710
and the resolution
for it has to be

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.730
that there's some
sort of great filter

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.650
that either makes
intelligent life extremely

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.580
rare in the first place or
that wipes out, essentially,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.390
all advanced
civilizations before they

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.520
get to the galactic
empire stage,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.369
whether by a nuclear war,
environmental catastrophe,

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.910
accidentally making
a black hole that

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.560
swallows the planet, et cetera.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.930
Personally, I'm not buying it.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500
I just don't think that there's
an inevitable great filter

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.680
still ahead of us.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.290
As we saw in a
previous episode, we're

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.980
not so far from building
starships ourselves.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.080
Surely, some
civilizations must make it

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.070
through these growing pains
and manage to reach the stars.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.220
So where are they?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
Well, there's another deeply
sad and deeply inspiring

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.260
possibility.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.690
Humanity may be one of the
very first interstellar species

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.282
in the history of the galaxy.

00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:36.610
But before we get all emo,
let's science this right.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.300
We know of exactly one
instance of intelligent life

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.470
happening, the case of Earth.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.490
And as if it wasn't hard
enough to do statistics

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.730
with a sample size
of one, we also

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.391
have to deal with a
massive selection bias.

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.640
Of course we're going to
observe at least one instance

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.330
of intelligent life happening
because we are that one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.520
instance.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.050
In a way, it doesn't matter
how improbable sentience is.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.740
As long as it
happens once, it will

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.300
be there to observe itself.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.690
Here we're touching on the
anthropic principle, which

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.330
states that an
observer will always

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.634
observe a universe that can make
observers or a planet that can.

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.300
We'll talk about the
cosmic implications

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.130
of this more in another
episode, but for now we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.430
need to acknowledge
that this selection

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.190
bias allows that life could be
extremely rare, or even unique.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.290
Given that, can we even begin
to assess the likelihood of life

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.110
out there?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.420
Yeah, we can science anything.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.630
So let's dig into whether
we should really expect

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.670
to see a Salarian Empire.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.070
Let's take the knowns.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.670
Now, Earth certainly
required a number

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.010
of very special
conditions to build life

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.607
and it's hard to know how
essential each of these was

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:40.190
or how frequently
these conditions are

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.060
met through the galaxy.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.820
I'm going to avoid
details of the biology

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.330
here because we
can say a lot just

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.360
based on how much
time it took to get

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.760
through each step on the path
to building technological life.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.430
We can crudely summarize
the big leaps that lead up

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.190
to intelligent life
as one, assembly

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.300
of self replicating RNA
from organic molecules;

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.070
two, RNA based
proto-cells; three, DNA

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.890
and the first actual cell-- this
is the moment of a biogenesis,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.770
life from not life; four,
increasingly complex

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.050
single cells; five, the first
multicellular organisms so

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.120
plants, animals, et cetera; and
six, the first intelligent life

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.880
form capable of counting
to six on You Tube.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.520
Now, the crazy thing,
the thing that I

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.150
find the least intuitive,
is that the first three

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.480
steps in that chain
combined-- the appearance

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780
of true cellular
life-- happened faster

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.980
than any of those later steps.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.460
so fast, in fact, that
it seems hard to believe.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.180
And in fact, so fast
that our galaxy probably

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.750
should be brimming with
at least simple life.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.700
Let me explain.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.610
See, around four
billion years ago,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.160
pretty much just after the
Earth had first cooled down

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.190
from being a giant
hellish magma bowl,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.749
we think that it
totally got pounded

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.790
by a meteor storm that
lasted a couple of hundred

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.380
million years.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.190
This is the late
heavy bombardment,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.850
and it probably
obliterated the surface.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.820
We think we know this
because we flew to the moon

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.210
and found evidence of it.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.420
Up until recently, the
earliest known evidence

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.590
of life dated to roughly
3.5 billion years ago,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.000
fossilized blue green algae
beds-- stromatolites--

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.650
found in Western Australia.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.170
The place was covered in
this greenish-purple slime

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.890
that reeked of rotten eggs.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.570
Yeah, the beach was
horrible back then.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.987
Basically, Earth was once
a giant slimeball planet.

00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:24.820
And it looks like Earth
went from magma ball

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.630
to slimeball in less
than 300 million years.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.330
What?

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.420
That seems crazy fast.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.040
But it also suggests
that this first step,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.250
the genesis of life, is
not the great filter.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.920
But wait, the abiogenesis
thing gets even weirder.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.020
See, nature has provided
us with a perfect time

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.402
capsule for studying
the very early Earth,

00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:49.380
zircons-- super hard silicate
crystals whose formation

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.200
can be dated precisely by
the ratio of decaying uranium

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.380
versus lead decay
product locked inside.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.950
And get this, just
recently a zircon

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.980
was found containing the
possible signature of life

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.760
and dated at 4.1
billion years ago,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.240
from before the late
heavy bombardment.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.020
That little crystal
contains what

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.930
looks like biogenic carbon.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.180
That's a fancy way of saying
there's too little carbon

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.440
13 compared to carbon 12.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.930
See, photosynthetic
finds C12 a bit yummier,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.010
and so it absorbs more of
that than the heavier C13.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.320
Pretty much all carbon
enters the biosphere

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.170
from the photosynthesizing
bottom of the food chain.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.480
Any carbon that's been
through living systems

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.960
will have the same C13
light isotopic ratio

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.300
that we see in this zircon.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.510
Now, there are other
nonbiogenic explanations,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.700
but this is extremely suggestive
that life was abundant on Earth

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.340
remarkably soon after it
first coalesced from stardust

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.230
and that life either survived
the late heavy bombardment

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.710
or formed again after that
or the late heavy bombardment

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.600
never happened.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.240
That's actually a
possibility, too.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.920
But either way, it
looks like Earth

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.000
became a slimeball teeming with
life in a crazy short amount

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.570
of time.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.790
How on earth did this happen?

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.000
Two options.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.020
One, given the right
conditions the genesis of life

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.460
happens like that, and two, it
didn't happen on Earth-- life

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.934
was seeded from space, an
idea called panspermia.

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:12.725
Look, there's no question
that lots of rock

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:15.520
gets ejected into space
after meteor impacts

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.100
and can move between planets.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.750
We've found plenty of
meteorites originally from Mars.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.570
A lot of the ejecta
from Earth is

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.650
going to be swarming in bugs.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.960
Could similar
bacterial astronauts

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.790
have once survived an
interstellar journey to Earth?

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.020
Some bacteria are
certainly hardy enough

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.020
to survive launch and landing.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.210
This has been tested.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.320
If these bacteria
were frozen solid,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.380
they could plausibly survive
a very, very long journey

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.120
and you only need one out
of billions to make it.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.170
Maybe the solar wind
pushes infested material

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.460
into interstellar
space so that tens

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.140
of thousands, even millions,
of years later a single bug

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.770
winds up on a brand new planet
and boom, instant slimeball.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.320
Questionable, but it
would mean that life only

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.520
needs to evolve once from
scratch in any given galaxy.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.540
Now, this should
be very testable.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.940
Earth was infested
fast, so that means

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.610
this stuff should be out there.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.440
Mars must have been
hit when it had water.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.966
Did it go slimeball?

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:14.090
There should be something
like stromatolite fossils

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.770
on its ancient surface.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.670
We haven't seen them yet,
but they'd be hard to spot.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.400
These cosmic cooties should
be findable in space, too.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.450
So either fast abiogenesis
or panspermia, one of them

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.750
must be true.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.530
However, both suggest
that the galaxy

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.980
should be teeming with slimeball
planets filled with life.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.400
Now, that's exciting.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.060
We don't have a telescope
to find them yet,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.420
but we could soon.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.900
These planets will
have atmospheres

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.010
driven by biotic processes.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.390
If we could analyze
light passing

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.005
through these
atmospheres, we would

00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:47.680
see signatures of
oxygen, ozone, methane,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.420
nitrous oxide at concentrations
impossible without a biosphere.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.340
Properly fund NASA and
its terrestrial planet

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.820
finder and we could find
extraterrestrial life

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.030
within 20 years.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.220
So it's entirely
possible that we'll soon

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.000
discover that the galaxy
is filled with life.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.360
But this just makes it
weirder that the Milky

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.740
Way isn't swarming with
ancient alien civilizations.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.260
There is a filter, but it's
not the genesis of life.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.810
The clue might be that the
Earth stayed a slimeball

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.790
for nearly three billion years.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.450
The first multicellular organism
turned up only 600 to 800

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.680
million years ago
and life as we know

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.300
it quickly exploded after that.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.780
Was this a random lucky event
that we just had to wait for?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.919
No, multicellular life evolved
independently dozens of times.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.510
It just took a really long
time for those single cells

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.130
to become complex enough
to form large collaborative

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.919
structures capable of
collective reproduction, i.e.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.670
plants, animals, a species
capable of making the Kerbal

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.490
Space Program.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.930
And speaking of space
programs, technological life

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.800
took a little while
longer, but not

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.930
really so long on the overall
scale once we had complex life.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.110
After the Cambrian Explosion, it
was only around half a billion

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.660
years to go from
jellyfish to moon landing.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.950
Of course, maybe the
emergence of intelligence

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.660
is a random and unlikely
event, and this one

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.510
is the hardest to assess.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.580
However, it's worth
noting that we

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.390
do have other
species on Earth that

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.920
seem to be moving down the same
big brain path independently

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.710
of humans.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.580
So what is the great filter?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.300
Maybe it's just time.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.080
If life is common, then of the
billions of Earth-like planets

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.690
in the galaxy, only
a tiny fraction

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.050
needed to have a small
head start on us in order

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.890
to have produced the
Federation of Planets

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.550
and Stargates and stuff by now.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.770
So what if humanity
started early?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.210
Of all of the sun-like
stars and Earth-like planets

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.590
that will ever form over
the full past and future

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.150
history of star formation in
our universe, Earth is early.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.350
It's part of the
first 8%, according

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.340
to recent Hubble Space
Telescope based calculations.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.270
We have emerged in the
epoch of life in a universe

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.310
abundant in the rich resources
of past supernova explosions,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.980
but after the violence of the
starburst and quasar epochs.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.010
It strains
believability to imagine

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.730
that life didn't or
won't happen elsewhere,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.520
but it is possible that we
are a very early outlier

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.670
and that any other civilizations
are so distant as to not yet be

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.010
apparent.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.070
Is humanity a first
generation intelligence,

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.680
one of the species that
will watch and maybe guide

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.510
as other intelligent life
emerges throughout the galaxy?

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.720
Well, there's something to work
towards on the next episode

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.620
of "Space Time."

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.980
Last week we talked about
Miguel Alcubierre's warp drive.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.860
You guys had a lot to say.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.530
Let's do it.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.460
A lot if you noticed
my mistake in saying

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.720
that Miguel Alcubierre is
Spanish, rather than Mexican.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.060
That was my mistake.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.410
We cram a lot of details into
each episode of "Space Time"

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.450
and sometimes things like
this do slip through,

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.730
so thank you for catching it.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.230
Miguel Alcubierre was, in fact,
born in Mexico and, in fact,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.779
educated up to
master's level there.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.320
Eric Vilas wonders
what it would look

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.930
like seeing an
Alcubierre warp bubble

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.285
race by from the outside.

00:10:55.285 --> 00:10:55.910
This is tricky.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.701
The bubble would
definitely leave some sort

00:10:57.701 --> 00:11:00.240
of light signature because
light inside the bubble

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.140
can traverse the walls in any
direction besides forwards

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.330
and our negative mass matter
may also end up on the outside.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.420
Because the bubble
is superluminal,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.190
any light that we see
would trail the bubble just

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.480
like the sound of
a supersonic jet.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.220
Ahead of the bubble,
you'd see nothing

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.970
unless it stopped, in which case
all the photons and particles

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.310
that are captured on its journey
would blast you into oblivion.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.320
Now, a few of you took
issue with my statement

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.490
that it's never aliens.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.840
And fair enough, it's never
aliens until it's aliens.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.860
The point of this philosophy
is that the alien hypothesis

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.960
is a bad place to start
because you can explains almost

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.650
any weird natural phenomenon
as having been produced

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.020
by a super intelligent,
extremely high tech

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.190
civilization with
inscrutable motives.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.580
Really anything.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.820
It's a week hypothesis
until you've generally

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.200
ruled out everything else or
you actually see the mother ship

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.090
and take an unsuspiciously
blurry photo of it.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.330
So Nate asks if we can please
do another challenge episode.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.000
Absolutely, we'll do one soon.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.750
