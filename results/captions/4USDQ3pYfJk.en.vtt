Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.740
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.660
Thank you very much, thank you. Okay, now when we first started making my TV series

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.330
in '89, we made the first episode—
it was basically me, George, and Kramer.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.200
George was kind of a Larry David
character, Larry had a funny neighbor

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.720
named Kramer so we threw him in. We used as little imagination as possible.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.000
All Larry and I really wanted to do was
have two guys talk in an idiotic way

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.390
about completely stupid things, which is
not nothing. We did not want it to be

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.510
about nothing, we wanted it to be about
being stupid. Okay, so we make the first

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.450
episode, and I don't think anybody liked it
that much.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.280
They eventually said, "okay, you can make a few more but you need a real female

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.710
character. All you've got is three stupid
guys." Now, in the TV network world of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.460
those days when the network executives
say, "we have an idea to make your show

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.390
better," it is always, without fail, without
exception, the worst idea you have ever

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.780
heard, which is not their fault. It's not
their job to have funny ideas. It would

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.229
be like if a geologist sent me out into
the desert to find the mineral bauxite.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.979
I could never find it. I don't know what
bauxite is—I'm not a geologist. Even if I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.500
found it I would not know that I had found it.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.740
I can't tell one rock from another. This
is why most TV sitcoms are not funny—

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.460
bauxite: if you're not a geologist, don't
go looking for it. Anyway, when the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960
network tells you what they think you
should do, it is called a "network note."

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.080
"The network has a note" is what they say,
and in this case we thought, "okay, that's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
not a bad idea. We should have a real
woman character in the show. We've got

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.760
three stupid guys, let's add a smart
woman, that's funny. My point is, this

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.080
person you see over here, Julia, how you
doing sweetie, you okay?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.540
It's only a couple more hours.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.760
This person, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who
agreed to do this part with three stupid

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.520
guys and used it to launch one of the
most brilliant and spectacular show

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.460
business careers of all time, this person
is a "network note."

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.100
That's what you're looking at.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.840
That is a humble beginning, which is also
not nothing.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.820
Okay, so then we fleshed the idea out a
little more, we decided, okay, let's make

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.030
it a girl that Jerry used to date, it
didn't work out, but was so much fun to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.360
hang out with, they decided to continue
the relationship as friends. A completely

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.460
absurd idea, could never happen in real
life...it's a TV sitcom, it's good enough.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.340
Okay, so, now as lame-o as all this is, I
was still required as an actor to play

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.960
this situation—that she and I were a
couple, we broke up, there was this other

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.489
aspect to our relationship that enabled it
to survive but without the romantic

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.730
element, you know, there's some layers and
complexity to that and, candidly speaking,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.000
way, way beyond any acting ability that I
possess.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.300
So, how did I do it? Because obviously I did it. 
People bought it; they

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.940
believed it. They believed the relationship

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.940
and I think it's fair to say 
the show went on to do very nicely.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.420
Here is how I did it: 
I just really, really like Julia.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.520
I could not get enough of her.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.110
Nine years...I was not acting. I
couldn't! I thought she was funny,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.550
charming, beautiful, intelligent, every
single second I ever spent with her, on

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.180
stage and off, bingo, no acting required,
just read the lines in the script,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.940
180 episodes, syndication, DVD, 
streaming, piece of cake.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.260
(applause)

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.999
Now, after the show was over and I
started seeing her on other shows having

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:05.069
relationships with other TV characters, I
can't say that was the easiest thing for

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.909
me to handle. I suffered quite a bit of fake pain from

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.800
this fake relationship. But, I guess
somewhere in the back of my mind I knew

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.120
that these are the things that were
required of her to do if she was ever

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.879
going to receive the Mark Twain Prize, so
I accepted it and I couldn't be happier

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.400
for her that tonight she is here
accepting this great honor.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.100
Congratulations, Jules, love you.
