00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.860
[Police Siren]

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.860
Right in the middle of a residential part of El Salvador,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480
this massive operation has been going on for years,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.040
and it is estimated that there are over $30 million dollars

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.940
in fake currency

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.200
stashed in this one little place.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
According to the US Secret Service,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.020
Peru is the number one producer of counterfeit dollars in the world.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.480
Criminal gangs have also been caught making millions

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.480
of Euros and fake Peruvian Soles.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.660
That pickup truck over there is just loaded with boxes

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.340
with fake notes, like, probably millions

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.100
in fake notes.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
And there's more and more and more being packed right there.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.120
It's actually so heavy that the tires are deflating already.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.760
The first Peruvian-made counterfeit dollar was detected in the United States back in 2003.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.280
Since then, the illicit trade has grown exponentially.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.800
Last year, US authorities identified just over 16 million fake dollars of Peruvian origin.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.920
Widespread counterfeiting has the potential to undermine the value of the currency,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.440
putting small business owners and unsuspecting US shoppers at risk.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.740
We wanted to find out how easy it was to get hold of top-quality fake dollars.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.940
Lima's old center and the notorious Azangaro Street are well known hubs for forgeries.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.280
This is where we began the search for the best counterfeit dollar notes in the city.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.300
After a few inquiries, we were introduced to Mario.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.220
His eight minutes turned into two hours, so we decided to go for a ride, and then met him at different parking lot.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.740
Despite the mutual edginess, we managed to finalize a deal.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.860
The idea was to use this purchase as a starting point to develop a relationship with Mario.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.160
These four $50 notes are the ones that the guy just gave us right now.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.360
To my uneducated eye, these ones here -- the ones that we just got,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.620
look actually of much better quality than this one, which is actually badly cut at the border.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.960
And then of course there is this $100 note that the guy just gave us that doesn't look convincing at all.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.600
So now it's time to test the notes we've got.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:48.940
Along with Peru's local currency, US dollars are also widely accepted in many of Lima's shops and restaurants.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.380
We went back to see Mario to tell him that the quality of the forgeries he sold us was not good enough.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.020
He called a contact, whom he assured could get us better merchandise.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.040
Mario went off to call some other contacts, but after the recent bust,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.960
getting people from his network to start selling again was proving difficult.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.620
We kept meeting up with Mario, who offered us different qualities of forged dollars.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:08.640
Eventually, he came up what he described as the best counterfeit $100 bills on the market.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.360
They actually did look very real. So we agreed to buy them.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.460
I paid Mario the equivalent to 180 real US dollars for 2000 counterfeit ones.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.060
The poorer areas on Lima's outskirts are the main hub for the production of counterfeit money.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.900
Illegal printing facilities and safehouses where forgers worked are regularly busted by the police.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.140
Police caught this gang trying to smuggle fake dollars into the US.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.940
A liter is a slang term for $100,000 in counterfeit notes

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880
We met with Mario again.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.460
I wanted to know how I could smuggle the notes he had given us into the United States.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.680
He said he had contact, a book binder who would conceal the notes inside the cover of a book.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.600
I followed his advice and bought a book about Peruvian cocktails.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.320
However, the day before we were due to meet the book binder, the police raided Azangaro Street.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.400
The book binder was caught and arrested with dozens of forged documents.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.140
A few days later, the book binder was released.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.280
I suggested we meet at a hotel where we had installed secret cameras.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.340
Mario and the book binder seemed rather uneasy on arrival, and looked around the room,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.680
seemingly trying to spot hidden cameras.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.820
We had managed to buy some of the best fake dollars on Lima's black market.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:26.900
The high quality of the forgery is why Peru leads the world in counterfeit note production.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.900
We wanted to find out how these notes are actually made.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.020
We went to see Oscar, who works at a printing house in Lima.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.060
He was going to demonstrate the first stage of forging a note -- the printing.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.700
Cotton paper is hard to obtain, and is also considerably more expensive than bond paper.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.100
We wanted to see for ourselves the finishing techniques used to make fake notes believable.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.820
After months of chasing leads and meeting different counterfeiters,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.420
finally we managed to convince an expert in the craft to let us film him at work.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.400
This is the $20 note that he just finished,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.860
and this is the one, an original one, and they do look pretty similar.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.000
And they both have this texture he was explaining me about.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760
So this is it.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.700
Lima's fake money.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:53.920
Despite police efforts,  for each counterfeiter caught, dozens more remained undetected.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:03.060
And even when caught, many forgers usually pay their way out of police custody, or serve lenient prison sentences.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.660
With more and more people learning the skills required to forge a note,

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.440
it's unlikely that the output of Peruvian fake dollars will stop anytime soon.
