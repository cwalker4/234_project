00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.282 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I LOVE TURTLES.

THAT'S HOW MY WRITING CAREER

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:52.919 align:start position:0%
BEGAN WITH TURTLES.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.455
I-- I LIVED IN BAYO, NEW JERSEY,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.090
IN A FEDERAL HOUSING PROJECT.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:57.957

THE RIVER HERE.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.726
&gt;&gt; WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

DOGS.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.829 size:84% position:42%
WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:03.496 align:start position:0%
CATS.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.630
SO THE ONLY PETS I WAS ALLOWED

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.334 size:88% position:44%
TO HAVE WERE TURTLES, LITTLE

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.869 size:81% position:41%
DIME-STORE TURTLES THAT WE

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.238
BOUGHT AT WOOLWORTH'S, AND THE

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.006
LITTLE ROUND BOWLS WITH THE PALM

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.606 align:start position:0%

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.307 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ON THE LITTLE

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:15.741
ISLAND WITH THE WATER AROUND IT?

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.043 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:17.577 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.945 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I HAD A TOY CASTLE.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.714
I COULD FIT TWO TURTLE BOWLS IN

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start position:0%
THE TOY CASTLE.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.952
SO I HAD A NUMBER OF TURTLES.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.453 size:88% position:44%
BUT THE THING IS ABOUT THOSE

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.155
LITTLE DIME-STORE TURTLES, THEY

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start position:0%
DIE VERY SOON.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.390
I FED THEM THE TURTLE FOOD, AND

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.593
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING EVERYTHING

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.594
RIGHT AND, YOU KNOW, IN A FEW

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.428 align:start position:0%
MONTHS THEY'D BE DEAD.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.996
AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.830 align:start position:0%
THEY WERE DYING.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.066
BUT IT CERTAINLY WASN'T MY FAULT

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.167 align:start position:0%
SO I DECIDED --

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.868 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WAS IT MURDER?

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.836
&gt;&gt; THAT THEY WERE COMPETING FOR

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:44.770 align:start position:0%
THE TURTLE THRONE.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:47.039
THEY WERE KILLING EACH OTHER TO

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.474 align:start position:0%
DETERMINE WHO --

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.142
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WOULD BE THE KING

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:49.843 align:start position:0%

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.513
&gt;&gt; THE TURTLE KING, YES, IN THE

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.113 align:start position:0%
CASTLE.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.882 size:81% position:41%
THAT WAS MY FIRST FANTASY,

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.383 align:start position:0%
TURTLE CASTLE.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.886
IT PRECEDED "GAME OF THRONES" BY

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start position:0%
MANY YEARS.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.088

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start position:0%

READING AS A KID?

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:35.021
BECAUSE I READ A TON WHEN I WAS

CLAD DANCING GIRL.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:15.895
AND THEN I ENCOUNTERED TOKEN WHO

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:16.996
PUZZLED ME FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.030 size:81% position:41%
LIKE THE BIRTHDAY PARTY --

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:19.498

THE FELLOWSHIP OF RING BEGINS

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.135 align:start position:0%

BUT YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:36.015 align:start position:0%
THEY DO IT.

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:38.718
&gt;&gt; AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE ABOUT

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.088
TOKEN, BUT BY THE TIME I I GOT

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:47.493
TO RIFFEN DALE AND THE LOVERS, I

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.728
THOUGHT THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.331 align:start position:0%
EVER WRITTEN.

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:53.733

300 YEARS BEFORE THE EVENTS OF

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.127 align:start position:0%
"GAME OF THRONES"?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.361
&gt;&gt; YES, BEFORE WE CAME UP WITH A

&gt;&gt; THAT WILL BE THE SECOND HALF.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.761
I HAVE TO WRITE A SECOND ONE.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:56.996
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS THE FIRST

HALF!

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.799 align:start position:0%

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:03.035 align:start position:0%
THIS IS 700 PAGE LONG.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:07.506

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.545 align:start position:0%
TO VOLARIA?

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.581 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT STARTS WITH AGON THE

CONQUEROR AND HIS TWO SISTERS,

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:19.485
AND IT GOES UP TO THE REGENCY OF

THE BOY KING AGON III.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.856
THERE ARE LOTS OF DRAGONS AND

NOT TO ADD TO THE CHORUS OF WHAT

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.668 align:start position:0%
HAS TAKEN SO LONG.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:40.973
