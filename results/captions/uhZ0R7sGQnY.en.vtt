00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.907
 The world economy in

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:11.178
crisis. Europe in shock.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.714
Riots, mass unemployment,

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.115
extreme parties on the

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.952
march. It was not supposed

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.122
to be this way. After the

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.757
war, the European Union

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.092
was built to secure

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.727
cooperation, prosperity,

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.929
and peace in Europe. And

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.564
later, a common currency

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.600
was introduced, the Euro.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.202
It resulted in a long

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.170
boom, but it ended in a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.172
spectacular bust.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.976
Where did Europe go wrong?

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.482
And is the United States right

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.483
now repeating the

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:52.119
same mistakes?

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.996
Hello, I'm Johan Norberg.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.431
And this is Malmo...Sweden,

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.534
my hometown. If we had

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.535
been standing here in the

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.703
Middle Ages, we'd be

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.338
looking at 	the busy piers

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:12.906
of the waterfront.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.274
It would be lined with ships

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.777
right here. In the 14th

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:17.978
century those ships could

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.780
carry more than 30,000

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.315
barrels of herring,

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.316
carried to different

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.017
European ports in a single

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.253
year. At that time, Malmo

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.088
was part of the Hanseatic

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.623
League, an economic union

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.891
of cities not unlike

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.193
today's European Union.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.795
By the 16th century, Malmo

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.096
was known throughout

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.531
northern Europe as a city

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:38.832
of savvy business energy,

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.200
and of a commitment to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.636
commerce.  No one better

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:43.637
represented the

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.671
entrepreneurial spirit of

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.074
Malmo than Jorgen Kock.

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.675
In the 16th century, he was a

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.277
very successful banker and

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.845
trader...and the mayor of

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:57.050
Malmo. This building was

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.452
Jorgen Kock's home, and

00:01:58.452 --> 00:01:59.453
the center of his vast

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.954
business operations. He

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.689
even had his bank there up

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.292
on the second floor.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.393
Now it's a restaurant and a

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.061
conference center.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.997
This place...and this city

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:10.998
represents the

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.265
entrepreneurship and the

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.600
international trade that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.601
once made Europe

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.737
prosperous. So, it makes

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.305
it an ideal place to hold

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.173
a conference on the crisis

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.475
that is now shaking the

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.877
world. Don Boudreaux, an

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:24.978
economist from the United

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.813
States and I have invited

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:27.814
some of the world's

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.249
leading young thinkers.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.385
They're here for a couple

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.353
days discussing the

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.688
reasons for the crisis

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:35.689
that is now affecting

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.190
Europe; the potential for

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.358
that crisis to affect the

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.227
United States, and how it

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:41.228
might affect the

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.230
day-to-day lives of all of us.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:05.986
The whole debt crisis

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.423
started in Greece.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.424
Is there more involved than

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:11.992
financial stability?

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.394
Well, there's no connection

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.796
between the people of

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:17.798
Greece and the politicians.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.501
Every rule has been broken,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.503
every rule has been broken.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:26.773
We've all seen the stories, or

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.809
read the newspaper reports.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:29.543
Are the conclusions

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.011
we draw from them

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.013
universal?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.449
Now, you gentlemen

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:36.783
have discussed the economic

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.786
and financial aspects of the

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.455
debt crisis. I wanted to touch

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.457
upon another subject,

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:44.458
namely the consequences

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.960
for freedom and democracy,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.195
essentially those values

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:49.930
that the EU is supposed to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.264
safeguard. I mean, and now

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.265
we see that with the

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.633
fiscal compact, and the

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.402
moves towards even deeper

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.137
political integration that

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:58.171
the powers of national

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.172
parliaments- and

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.474
ultimately citizens to

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.542
influence the EU is

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.479
diminished, and I think

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.913
that will create a

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:07.714
backlash that will make it

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.549
difficult to manage the

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.651
situation. Would it be

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.087
better like to have

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.589
measures take now, rather

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.991
than postponing it?

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.059
Particularly in Southern

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.760
Europe, you will lose

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.229
political support for the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.296
measures that need to go

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.498
through. And I think what

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:25.499
you are going to see is

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.566
the rise of nationalist

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.701
movements, of the left and

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.702
the right. You see that in

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:29.703
Greece now. You see Greece

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:30.704
might become the norm;

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:31.705
first for Italy, for

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:32.706
Spain, for Portugal.

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:33.707
I mean...even in Austria,

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.475
for example. Levels of

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:36.943
hostility to the European

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.478
Union are now running at

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.180
close to 50 percent.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.748
So those values of freedom

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:45.585
of democracy are not as old

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:46.453
everywhere in Europe as

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.988
we'd like to think, and

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.990
should not be taken for granted.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.991
Also, I think

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.659
that the concept of

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.460
liberty in the European

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.763
Union has been skewed from

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.967
a focus on basic freedoms

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.802
towards a much more

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.171
expansive concept of

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.438
freedom. If you look at the

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:06.473
Charter of Fundamental Rights,

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.974
for instance - it does not

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.342
only protect

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.177
freedom of expression, and

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:11.545
these values...it also

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.513
protects consumer protection,

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:14.981
social security,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.183
and all these things

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:17.484
and you see that

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.286
European courts are now

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:20.120
starting to make decisions

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.924
that could result in

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.292
austerity measures being

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:26.126
declared a violation of

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:28.128
human rights.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.768
The whole debt crisis started in

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.603
Greece...the canary in the

00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:38.605
coal mine... if you will.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.608
I went there to see what

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.009
might be in store for the

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.011
rest of us.	

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.013
The Greek government

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.014
falsified the

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.016
public account to make it

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.918
into the Euro. And as a

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.919
Euro member, they had

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:53.920
access to the European

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.622
credit card- so they could

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:56.823
borrow even more.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.059
They even lied about the

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.960
budget deficits to their

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.295
own people! But at the

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.296
same time, it made it possible

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.965
for them to buy votes

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:06.766
by increasing wages; by

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.869
increasing public spending.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:10.870
When these lies

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.305
were exposed, the

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.306
lenders didn't want to

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.641
lend more to Greece and

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:15.775
the politicians had to

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:16.109
tell the voters that,

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.645
"We are out of money." At this

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.981
point- people reacted and

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.049
protested, but not against

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.618
spending, but against

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.186
paying for it. So instead,

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:27.754
they've started supporting

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.322
extremist parties;

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.325
providing simple solutions

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.393
and blaming the usual

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.961
scapegoats. It's always

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.063
nice to be able to have

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.065
your cake and eat it, too-

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.100
and send the bill to

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.571
somebody else. 

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.139
Diomidus Spinellis is a

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.607
computer engineer whom the

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.175
government turned to-

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.812
to reform the tax system.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:53.813
I was very optimistic...

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:54.814
because all I could

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:55.815
see around me was

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.317
low-hanging fruits; things

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.818
I could see that you just

00:06:58.818 --> 00:06:59.619
have to lift your hand and

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:00.587
pick them and you can make

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.622
a change. Many of those

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.958
low-hanging fruits are

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.959
still here after two and a

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:06.960
half years...

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.962
and this makes me sad.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.934
Revolt in order to find

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.436
something better...from the

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.972
annual policy in Greece.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:19.973
Have you lost faith in

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:24.377
the politicians? Yes...yes.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.378
There's no connection

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.780
between the people of

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.248
Greece and the politicians.

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.317
We feel completely

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:34.054
that no one...no one

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:35.789
respects our wishes.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.258
The prices are going up...

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:39.259
the salaries are going

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.260
down...yeah...people have

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.429
to cope ...with the situation.

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:43.430
When I had my

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.364
exams to get into the

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:44.964
university, I was thinking

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.934
that, "Wow! I'm going to

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:48.935
become a pharmacist, I'm

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.870
going to have a good job;

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.839
I'm going to have a

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.407
drugstore; I'm going to

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.376
have a good life." And

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.977
now...I just...I hope I

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.047
get 30 Euros in 8 hours by

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:04.150
becoming...by being a waitress.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.251
And I don't know

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:05.819
what I will do.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.220
It's about 20 % of the people

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.956
in...of the population

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:10.957
lost their job during the

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.726
last 5 years.

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:14.094
20 % is unemployment.

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.763
And that's why many people

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:19.165
leave Greece...in order to

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.302
find...to have a better future.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:22.969
Do you see young,

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.170
talented people leaving

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.472
Greece? I see it every

00:08:25.472 --> 00:08:26.806
day. People...colleagues

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.807
here from my department

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:28.842
have left for universities

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.176
abroad- we're more likely

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.045
to draw many high-quality

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.580
people with very good

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.115
qualifications here.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.316
And of course, those were

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.318
easily hirable abroad.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.623
Stergios Sifnios runs an

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.658
orphanage in Athens.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.327
The situation right now

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.562
in Greece...it's very, very

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.797
bad because the social

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:52.298
services...the state

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:53.933
social services are not

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.601
working well. 

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:55.402
It must have been...

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.604
gone very far...

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:58.972
a parent says that,

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:00.907
"I'm so worried about

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.576
my future; I can't keep my

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.311
child in the family."

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.780
Can you tell us about

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.049
such an example?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:09.949
What motivates them?

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:11.451
What do they say sometimes?

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:12.452
You must understand that...a

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:15.388
parent to come to ask us help,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.090
especially in Greece,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.727
where the ties in the family

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.829
is...or was very strong,

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:26.266
it is very strong...

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.033
So you can

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.636
imagine if a parent come

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:31.137
to us, to ask for us help-

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:32.138
it means that you

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.206
really...the problem is

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:35.208
very deep.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.280
I'm frustrated and most extremely

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.315
worried by the turn things

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.217
are taking, by the rise of

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.752
population; by the rise of

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.755
French parties who are

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.124
promising empty words.

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.460
Gabriel Sakellaridis is

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.461
one of the leading

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.728
economists of the new

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:59.799
popular leftist party: Syriza.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.834
Right now we have

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:01.935
a situation that is

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.003
impossible, in my point of

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.004
view, to have all this

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:08.174
debt burden repaid. 	

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.175
But you don't object to the

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.177
bailout money going to

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.680
Greece; you object to the

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.014
conditions that you get

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.016
those loans on?

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:20.920
Yes. I mean for us...what we

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.957
want to say is that right now-

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.159
the money that we receive

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:29.596
only go in order to repay

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.599
our debt. I think Euro

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.101
zone is going to break up

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.103
under these policies,

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.104
because they are not only

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.105
implemented to Greece-

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.540
they are implemented to

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.975
other countries as well,

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.977
such as Portugal, Italy,

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:44.978
Spain, Ireland. And you

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.980
see the situation in this

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.982
country after some months

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:49.949
of the implementation of

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:50.950
these policies. The

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.051
situation is getting worse

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.052
and worse.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.053
Are you worried?

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:56.756
I am extremely worried.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.058
But I want to believe

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.995
that if I work hard...

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.997
things are going better.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.869
I think that Greece shows

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.005
that when you...

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:13.873
ignore economic realities,

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.975
and you build a...

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:18.511
political project on

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.014
basically sand, there are

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.982
huge dangers to those

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:23.983
ideals that you want to

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:24.984
safeguard. And that

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.987
affects the average Greek,

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.556
whose future is being eroded.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:31.291
The problem in Greece

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.292
is that Greece was

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.293
allowed to be a free rider,

00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:36.496
so it came in on an

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:37.497
illegitimate basis.

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:38.498
But people thought that...

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:39.499
Then that's a political decision!

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:40.500
Well...it is and it isn't,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.601
in the sense that

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.036
it's a political decision

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.037
not just made by the Greeks,

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.038
but made by everybody

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.039
else as well.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.874
Yes, exactly, at the European level.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.844
The word austerity is now giving

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.845
the creeps to pretty much

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:54.047
all of Europe, but notably

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.049
in Greece, because nobody

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.551
wants to see that their

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.552
standard of living

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.155
forcedly going down

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.156
because of the government,

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:05.224
because of the mistakes

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.092
that the government made.

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.994
Do you think that this

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.128
is a way out?

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.130
It is! I mean...living

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.066
beyond your means you know...

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.334
stops at some point; you can't do

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.070
it forever. Also you can't

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.504
spend other people's money

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.573
forever, and politicians

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.674
have been doing that, and

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.308
I understand that Greeks

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:23.476
have been living beyond

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.477
their means for a long

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:27.013
time, but they will have

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:29.849
to change that, especially

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:30.650
people in the public

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.451
sector. They will have to

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.086
take the responsibility

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:36.022
of...you know...

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.957
dealing with the situation.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:40.393
People of the public sector, you said?

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:42.128
Yes! Yes.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.663
Now, say you take an

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:46.032
average worker of this

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:49.035
public sector in Greece...

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:50.570
a teacher, for example.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.705
How is she, or he held responsible

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.774
for what's going on in the country?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.842
When government

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:57.210
runs out of money, then

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.511
it's obvious that you will

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.346
lose your job.

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:04.651
So I don't, ..see any reason

00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:05.551
of these people saying,

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.554
"Oh, we have these jobs...

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:09.656
we need to keep them.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:10.657
We haven't done

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.658
anything wrong." Now...if

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:12.659
If I had to pinpoint one

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:13.826
responsible for what's

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.129
going on, in Greece,

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.130
in Europe just in general,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.131
it would be the financial

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.668
sector. It would be the

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.670
urge, the greed- that's

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.671
driving people to look for

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.738
more profits. That's why

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:26.973
so much money has been

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.341
invested in bonds...

00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:30.143
in Greek bonds, for example,

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.477
because they were

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.812
promising a higher yield.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.280
Everyone is self-interested.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.515
It's not just banking sector,

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:37.317
it's you and I.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.018
We have...we are self-interested;

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.019
so we act based on

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.021
self-interest.

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.023
So...banking sector is not

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:47.226
an exception. Second thing

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.796
related to that...no one

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:52.298
is too big to fail, even banks.

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:53.333
You know...if they

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.500
make mistakes they should

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.703
take responsibility for that.

00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:58.237
And I think it is

00:13:58.237 --> 00:13:59.572
government that is saying,

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.106
"Oh we have to save this

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:01.974
bank, or we have to save

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.776
this company, we have to

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:04.310
save these people

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.712
just because it's going to

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.581
have you know, domino effect

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:09.849
the rest of the economy.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:10.983
I think that's a mistake.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.618
Brussels is responsible

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.820
for gathering together

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.355
many different countries

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.390
of different level,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.492
of different GDP size,

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:20.159
for example.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.327
Greece just accounts for

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:23.329
6% of the EU's GDP.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:25.698
But altogether, it's their

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.266
fault basically that this

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.267
union was founded with a

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:31.070
common currency which is

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.072
tying it up so closely

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.108
together. But with a

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:35.575
different budget, with

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.710
non-coordinated non-

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.678
harmonized budget and

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:40.980
fiscal policies, and that

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.981
appears to be a way out.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.016
I mean, if the EU had a

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.017
balanced fiscal policy,

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.086
as in the taxes would be

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.287
pretty much the same level

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.288
everywhere, that would

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.524
create a homogenous labor

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:53.459
market, for example, in the EU.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.927
Well, I agree that,

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.562
you know, that would be a

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:57.897
solution to have more

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.031
stable Europe. But I don't

00:14:59.031 --> 00:14:59.966
think that's good for the

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.834
economies of Europe.

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:02.835
I think it's better to have

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:03.703
the position among them in

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.705
terms of the currencies

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:07.573
they have, in terms of

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.710
their fiscal policies, in

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.711
terms of the taxation.

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.847
So I would actually argue

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:15.848
that we should go back

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.451
and abolish the Euro or have

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:19.452
even like, you know,

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.254
various Euro areas. 		

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.989
But you know, you have to

00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:25.525
remember that Europe has

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.060
not been the same every

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.430
5, 10 years. I started living

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.498
there when it was only

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:34.000
12 countries. I left it when

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.568
it was 15 countries...

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:37.603
now it's 27 in the EU.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.573
And they had political goal,

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:44.177
disregarding the economics.

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.278
And that is

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.212
haunting them, and the

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:49.048
sooner they face the truth,

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.750
the sooner we will

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.452
be able to get out of the crisis.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.453
So really...the only

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.454
certain thing about

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.389
this situation is its

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:57.590
complete uncertainty,

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.224
wouldn't you say?

00:15:58.224 --> 00:15:59.959
Yeah. I would agree. 		

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.727
Hey, you mentioned political

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.462
leadership, and that's

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.064
exactly what we looked at

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:06.065
with the film crew in

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.066
Brussels; the fact that

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:07.967
they knew that they were

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:08.968
going to have problems

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.804
with debts, with deficits

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:12.805
and easy money.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:13.906
So they built these rules

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:14.907
and institutions to deal with it,

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.275
but the problem was

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.743
that in the end, no one

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.545
cared about them.

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.581
It's a sorry tale,

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:23.082
it's a sorry tale.

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:25.918
It could have been

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.854
done so much better with

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:29.989
a little bit of courage a civile,

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.757
or "civil courage,"

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.259
if you like.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.295
When the sovereign debt

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:37.530
crisis exploded, the

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.998
people of Europe looked to

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:39.999
Brussels, the home of the

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.334
political elite.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.135
This was their opportunity

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:47.006
to show what they are made of.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.408
In 2002, the EU said it had

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.878
strict rules on debts and deficits.

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:54.947
In 2003, they broke those rules.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:55.948
But there was one thing it

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.183
would never do...bail out

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:58.184
a country that had

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.318
borrowed too much.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.987
In 2010 they did.

00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:02.488
But there was one thing

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.489
that they would never do:

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.323
They would never buy

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.325
government bonds from countries

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.326
that had borrowed too much.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:10.663
Just the next week they did.

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:11.931
Now they say they have new

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.033
strict rules on debts and

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.868
deficits. The question is:

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.670
Will they stand by their

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.838
words this time?

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.974
This is Fritz Bolkestein.

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:23.509
As a former member of the

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:24.510
European Commission,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.779
he has experience from the

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.247
top level of European

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:30.983
politics. Why does this

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:31.984
happen again and again?

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.786
They said that we had the

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:34.787
Stability Pact and then

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:35.788
they broke the rules and

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:36.989
nothing happened, they

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:37.990
said that they wouldn't

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.091
bail out any particular

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.092
country, but then they

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:40.993
bailed out Greece.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.962
Every rule has been broken,

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.630
every rule has been broken;

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.734
every remedy that now is

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.003
proposed...infringes the

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.805
original treaty.

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:59.045
What was the discussion like in the

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.913
Commission when the rules

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:01.447
were broken?

00:18:01.447 --> 00:18:04.784
Very little, very little, very little.

00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:06.285
Is it fair to say that

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.120
a lot of people in

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.689
influential positions knew

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.190
that there were problems?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.191
Yeah. Early on? Yeah.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.893
But they didn't really have

00:18:13.893 --> 00:18:15.261
the guts to do something about it.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.696
That is true, I afraid that

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:17.697
is true...because the

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:18.698
situation in Greece, and

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:19.699
also in Italy was known-

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:21.701
but not acted upon.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.871
I think the European Union

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.006
is a marvelous thing,

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:30.943
if only because it's kept the peace.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.278
I was born in 1933,

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.512
so I know what I'm talking about.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:36.415
And that is now the

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.216
normal situation.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.385
It has never been the case,

00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:40.586
now it is the case.

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.622
So I am a supporter of the

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.623
European Union, but what

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.924
we needed was a little bit more

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:46.625
common sense, and a

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.195
little bit more of guts.

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.496
Then I think we would not

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:53.332
be in the pickle that we are now in.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.372
Isn't there a lack of

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:00.606
credibility right now for

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:01.140
the Commission?

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.942
It began with a fiscal pact

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.744
on debts and deficits,

00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:06.545
and just one year later

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.547
several countries broke

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:09.215
those rules. But at least

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.250
you would never bail out

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.285
countries that broke the rules.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:15.287
And in 2010 you did-

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.288
but at least you wouldn't

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.556
buy their sovereign government

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.791
bonds, but then you did.

00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:20.026
And now we have this new

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:21.794
fiscal pact, and you have

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:23.696
new targets for Spain's

00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:24.930
deficit and you have

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.333
already renegotiated that...

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.267
that deficit rule.

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.802
So the question is: Why should

00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:32.672
we take your word for granted

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.140
this time?

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.375
It's very important to

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.377
differentiate very clearly, the

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.178
political decisions which

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.880
are based on statistics,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.950
and statistics itself.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.020
And I think that in cases

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.221
which you mentioned

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:52.892
statistics was published

00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:54.827
correctly, of course with

00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.762
that problem was Greek

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:59.799
deficit figures for 2009,

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.968
and actually our experts

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:06.272
helped to solve these

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:07.873
problems. By letting Italy

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.109
in when it was not

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:11.010
satisfying the criteria,

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.413
they could later not very

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.648
well refuse Greece.

00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:18.150
That is the true reason why

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.352
Greece was let in-

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:21.587
not because they falsified

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:22.588
their statistics, which

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:23.589
they did of course,

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:26.125
but because the European

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:27.126
Council- which is the heads

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:29.328
of states and governments,

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.329
thought that they

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:31.330
could not refuse

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.031
Greece what they had

00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:33.032
allowed Italy, so there

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.934
you have the curse of the

00:20:34.934 --> 00:20:38.204
evil deed. So, it means

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:41.173
that statistics already

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:44.009
produces a good quality

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.044
basis for sound decision

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:47.046
making, but what we wanted

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:51.917
to do to go further and to

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.320
ensure that never in the

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.289
future we will have,

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.290
you know, any political

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.458
interference into

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:03.562
statistics- and this is what

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.999
we proposed was our regulation.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.000
This lack of guts among

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.935
politicians...what's the

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.003
reason for this? What part

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.738
of human nature explains

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.406
this? Well, (laughter)

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.342
that's a big question.

00:21:16.342 --> 00:21:17.510
I'm not really used to talking

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.111
about human nature.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.947
But what I do know is that

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:25.017
not many people like

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:29.555
standing alone...

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.395
most go with the herd...

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.463
although people who stand alone

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.466
are not necessarily incorrect.

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:53.846
What do you think is the

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:54.847
underlying cause of the crisis?

00:21:54.847 --> 00:21:55.848
I gather you think

00:21:55.848 --> 00:21:56.849
it's something more than

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:58.717
just purely financial matters.

00:21:58.717 --> 00:21:59.718
The origins of this crisis

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:00.986
lie, in my view,

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.054
in the development of

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.589
a kind of a win-lose capitalism.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:04.657
Too few people win,

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.325
everybody else loses.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.326
And I think this is most

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.327
obvious in the world of

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.828
ordinary people, most

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.497
people rely on wages.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:12.131
Wages have been falling

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:14.767
relative to GDP growth

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:16.836
since 1968, so people

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:18.837
think labor has been

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:19.839
earning less and less.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:20.839
And they've made up the

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:21.574
difference with debt.

00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:23.642
I think you're partly correct,

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:25.244
but I'm not quite as

00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:26.245
pessimistic as you.

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:28.147
In fact, in the U.S.

00:22:28.147 --> 00:22:30.149
wages have not declined...

00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:31.150
that's a myth. What's happened

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.018
in the last ten years is the

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.153
Federal Reserve has

00:22:34.153 --> 00:22:35.354
increased the money supply

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.422
too much.

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:38.290
Government officials have tried

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.291
to increase artificially the

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:40.292
supply of home ownership.

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:41.694
I think it's these more

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:43.229
economic factors that

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:45.197
drove this bubble and then

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.031
that bubble was inevitably

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.100
destined to burst, and it did.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.702
We agree that you

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:50.703
know that the culture

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:51.704
should be improved.

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:52.838
I'm in favor of less crony

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:53.839
capitalism, less influence

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.641
to special interest groups.

00:22:55.641 --> 00:22:56.642
We both agree that

00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:58.043
those matter; but I don't

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.044
think that the culture of

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.512
capitalism has become so

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:03.015
decrepit, and so bad that

00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:05.217
fundamental change on that

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.218
front is required.

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.053
I think the real problem

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.355
lies with the state,

00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:11.290
lies with the state's efforts

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.658
to prop up its cronies.

00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:14.660
Actually, just to put it very

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.895
simply, successful capitalists

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.896
hate capitalism.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:18.897
And what they do

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.599
is they conspire often

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:21.600
with each other. And this

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.735
is what all legal cases in

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:23.769
competition are about.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:24.770
They're not about the

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.771
government, they're about

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.972
cartels forming,

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.240
oligopolies forming,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.241
that essentially say to small

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.010
businesses to people who

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.011
want to break in - no you

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:33.012
can't, we're gonna buy you

00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:34.013
out, we're gonna stop you,

00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:35.047
we're gonna create

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:36.048
barriers to market entry.

00:23:36.048 --> 00:23:37.082
If you were a real free

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.617
marketer I'd suggest yes

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.019
have that critique of the

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:41.153
state, agree with it...

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:42.221
but for goodness sake-

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:43.222
look at the history,

00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:44.590
look at the reality.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.591
Let's also have a critique of the

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.592
private sector. I have

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:47.593
looked at the reality.

00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:48.460
I've actually researched

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.461
this in great detail.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.330
And in the U.S. the history

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.565
is monopolies are almost

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.066
always a product of the

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:55.200
government and the

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.036
anti-trust laws, it's

00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:58.037
called in the U.S., is

00:23:58.037 --> 00:23:59.939
used mostly to suppress

00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:00.873
competition, not to

00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:02.541
promote competition.

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.810
Name me one private sector

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.478
monopoly that has lasted

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:07.713
on its own consumers- that

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:08.714
did not have any support

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:09.715
from the state.

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.716
Well, I think you can look

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:11.717
at what's happened in food

00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:12.918
retail. I think you can

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:13.919
look at what's happened in

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.521
finance and auditing and

00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:18.157
almost any large business

00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:19.992
sector, what you see over

00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:20.993
time is a conspiracy

00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:22.194
against competition by the

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:23.996
dominant players in that market.

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:24.997
Reality of the

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.031
situation is if you want

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.166
to start a business,

00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:29.301
if you want to become

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.302
independent, if you want

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.137
to innovate now in both my

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.138
county, United Kingdom and

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.274
United States- economic

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:36.275
power concentrates, they

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:38.043
own too much and they

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:38.811
won't let you in.

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:39.678
How can you say that?

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:42.014
Google just started in 1998;

00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:43.015
it's one of the most powerful

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:44.016
companies in the world.

00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:45.017
The thing didn't even

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:46.518
exist 15 years ago!

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:47.519
But that's because it's a new

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.520
technological development,

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.421
in a new market area.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.422
But, that's... And now many

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:51.423
people are worried about

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:53.759
Google's monopoly power.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:54.860
And I would... And that

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.861
exactly makes my point!

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:56.895
And I would...no, no, no.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:57.997
I would bet them.

00:24:57.997 --> 00:24:59.965
Google is free. Google is free!

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:02.568
How is anyone hurt by Google?

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:04.336
It's expanded our horizons,

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.070
our opportunities...as

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.071
consumers and businessmen.

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:07.573
Because you cannot as a

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:08.574
small player, as a small

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:09.575
business starter -

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:12.077
you cannot - the Internet

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:13.078
you know, the ideologues of

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:14.079
the Internet used to say

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:15.481
it's a great space where

00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:16.482
the small can come and

00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:17.616
compete together with the big,

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:19.685
but the reality is the opposite.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:20.686
Look at how...

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:20.819
...But that's

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.154
because Google is efficient!

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:23.422
No, it's not just because

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:24.423
of market efficiency.

00:25:24.423 --> 00:25:24.990
I'm a great fan of Apple.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.291
I'm a great fan of Google.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:27.359
These are all good companies

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.360
who do great things.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.995
But what they actually also do-

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:30.996
is to create barriers to

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.998
market entry, is create

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:35.000
shut-outs, is to create

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.001
forms that are, in effect,

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:39.004
a form of monopoly power.

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:40.005
Now what I find that is

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:41.006
really disturbing is-

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:43.008
that the modern right

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.009
can't see this...it's

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.010
blind to this. It's says,

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.245
oh it's just a successful company,

00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:47.379
and there's no problem

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.547
with a successful company.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.681
But nobody has

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:50.816
thought this in economic

00:25:50.816 --> 00:25:51.984
thought for hundreds of

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:53.986
years until Milton Friedman

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:54.987
per versed at the

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:55.687
teachings of Hayek.

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:57.723
And I think what Friedman did,

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.925
if I may go on, which I

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:00.959
think is so worrying, is

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:01.960
he said we are going to

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.961
have competition law based

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:04.930
just on consumer welfare.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.632
And consumer welfare,

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:07.633
which kind of sounds weird,

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:08.634
what does that mean?

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:09.802
It means low prices.

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:10.803
The only model that we

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:11.804
need is low prices,

00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:12.805
because if we have low

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:15.073
prices as the model for

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.074
competition, monopolies

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.309
can't deliver you low

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:18.410
prices and they will break.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.478
I disagree with you.

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:20.579
I think Friedman was right.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:21.079
If you look at the history

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.214
when government

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:23.215
has stayed out, yes

00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:24.616
you have the large firms.

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:26.418
It's very difficult for

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:27.419
inefficient firms to

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.987
compete with their larger

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.522
rivals- but consumers

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:32.057
benefit. The history of

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.293
capitalism in America and

00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:37.696
in Europe tells me that

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.398
competition is very dynamic.

00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:40.332
The only way it can

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.166
be suppressed for any

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.801
length of time is when it

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:43.802
gets government

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:44.803
privileges. I think I fear

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:46.538
this is ideology speaking,

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:46.839
not truth.

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:49.074
If you look at... I think

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:50.909
it's facts speaking.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.312
I recently went to Greece and

00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:56.515
I've never seen that depth of

00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:57.716
fear for the future and

00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.818
hopelessness among people,

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:02.354
combined with a rejection

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.422
of the old political

00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:04.256
class...the sense of

00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:05.824
that they've been betrayed by

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.459
politicians who promised

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.595
them everything, and now

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:10.596
we see the results of that.

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:11.830
And my fear is that

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.866
this is just the beginning-

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:14.833
that this might happen

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.368
to other European

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:17.369
countries as well.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.538
I'm coming from France Paris,

00:27:19.538 --> 00:27:22.107
and I observe some similar

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:25.344
symptoms. I mean, public

00:27:25.344 --> 00:27:26.712
finances, the way of

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:30.983
conducting public policy.

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:33.285
And French are very afraid

00:27:33.285 --> 00:27:35.120
of what happens with Greece.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.256
My question when I look

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.191
at France and other countries

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:41.426
is that: we always

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.327
seem to get new politicians

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.896
to say that,

00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:45.664
"Look we have an easier

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.698
way of fixing the problems.

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.567
We can somehow

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:51.270
find the money, or the

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.971
kind of ways of raising

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:55.207
new loans that will make

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:56.508
the transition easier."

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:57.576
You are exactly right.

00:27:57.576 --> 00:27:59.545
I think French always

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:00.946
consider that they have

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:02.748
been betrayed since maybe

00:28:02.748 --> 00:28:04.082
fifteen years about.

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:07.185
They don't believe in politicians

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.954
anymore...really, really...really.

00:28:08.954 --> 00:28:11.623
This question of betrayal is

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:12.891
very important, because

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.962
we had such an increase of

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:17.963
extreme party in France

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:18.964
like in Europe, but in France

00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:20.766
we had the National French

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:23.969
gaining 20% in the election.

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.103
This is the first time

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.104
it's so high

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:28.807
and this is I think the

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:29.708
very, very, the first

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.643
symptom of this crisis.

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:37.983
We have France- which is not

00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:40.986
believing in Europe anymore,

00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:41.987
in globalization.

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:43.822
They want to protect again,

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:44.489
and go back to

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:46.258
France and protect

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:48.627
itself...and Europe is

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:51.196
seen as danger.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.298
Before it was Asia,

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.000
it was China...and now it's

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.802
Europe, it's Europe.

00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:58.837
And this is such a horrible

00:28:58.837 --> 00:28:59.938
irony, because the whole

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:01.940
European project was

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.575
supposed to build international

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.943
understanding and an end

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.112
to nationalist sentiment

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:08.981
and so on. It is a bit

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:10.249
paradoxical and sad

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.450
because people, French

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.652
people, were very proud

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:15.120
belonging to Europe, and

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.756
now it seems that they are

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.958
rejecting Europe because

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:21.760
of economy position.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.962
And people are afraid to see

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.831
that everything is decided

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:29.101
in Brussels for economic items.

00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:31.236
We have elected a

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:32.938
French president, of course,

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.974
but it seems that

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.976
Brussels decides for everything.

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.711
And the French people

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:41.913
don't want that.

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.849
And they vote against...

00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:46.285
if we had a referendum

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:47.986
in France, I'm sure people

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:49.187
rejected Europe.

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:50.689
The greatest risk is that

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:52.991
there is no trust anymore

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.992
in any kind of political

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.994
institution. And when that

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:56.995
happens at the same time

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.530
that we see mass

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.832
unemployment, people -

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:01.667
they don't get a job.

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:03.468
It might even be that they

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.771
lose savings if we have

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:07.706
bank collapses or

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.875
hyperinflation. Then we've

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.276
seen that historically;

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.278
that's how a society

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:13.812
completely breaks down.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.514
I'd like to know what

00:30:15.514 --> 00:30:16.314
happens exactly now in the

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.783
United States?	 		

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:19.017
I think that America might be

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:21.253
in worse shape than it looks.

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.488
Partly because they

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:24.356
have not really dealt with

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:27.292
the last financial crisis

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.828
and the banks were

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.196
heavily loaded with

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:32.731
unsustainable debts.

00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:34.766
They didn't disappear; they

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.034
were just in a way sort of

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:38.704
transferred to... to the

00:30:38.704 --> 00:30:39.705
government. If you look at

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:40.272
the average rate of debt,

00:30:40.272 --> 00:30:43.075
it's even worse in America

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:45.177
than it is in the Euro system.

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.178
It's just that we

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.612
have a couple of outliers

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:49.214
like Greece, like Italy

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.416
and so on. But

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.251
America's future is completely

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:55.020
dependent on getting more

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.054
growth and get down that

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.055
debt to sustainable

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:58.724
levels. If they don't,

00:30:58.724 --> 00:31:00.659
they might be the next Greece.

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:06.998
If California were

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:07.999
a separate country,

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:09.301
it would have the world's

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:11.002
9th largest economy.

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:13.171
It's the home of Apple,

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:14.906
Silicon Valley, a lot of

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:15.907
agriculture, wine,

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:18.410
Hollywood, and yet it has

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.011
the lowest bond rating of

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.012
any of the 50 states in

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.013
America. The people in

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:23.014
that building here in

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:25.016
Sacramento cannot balance

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:27.018
the government's budget.

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.820
Why is that? 		

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.022
The problem is caused by

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:32.023
the politicians making the

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:33.525
promises, but then not

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:34.559
funding those promises 		

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.229
This is David Crane.

00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:38.230
Although a life-long

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.030
democrat, he served as

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.031
a special advisor to

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.235
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:44.236
Now he's heading Govern For

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:46.338
California, an initiative

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:48.607
to get a few good people

00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:49.608
elected to the state

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:51.309
legislature.  I found

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.044
that even though I had

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.547
spent all of my life

00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:56.515
interested in politics

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:58.850
and I had backed candidates

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.885
and I considered myself

00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:00.986
knowledgeable about

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.388
political issues, that I

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:04.990
knew nothing about what

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.991
really took place

00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:07.993
politically in California.

00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:10.996
The best example I can

00:32:10.996 --> 00:32:13.265
come up with is in 1999,

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.000
when it was a dot com boom

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.536
in the United States and

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.004
stock markets were doing

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:20.005
really well, and the

00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:21.807
California State Legislature

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:22.808
voted overwhelmingly

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:23.842
including Republicans.

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:27.279
Overwhelmingly, to grant a

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.280
retro-active pension

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.382
increase to government

00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:32.017
employees that amounted to

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:33.018
probably two, the issuance

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:34.219
of two hundred billion

00:32:34.219 --> 00:32:35.020
dollars' worth of debt.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.021
And the math that they

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.355
were employing at that time

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.391
indicated that the

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:40.392
stock market that they

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:41.927
anticipated would grow ten

00:32:41.927 --> 00:32:42.928
times faster in the 21st

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:44.196
century than it grew in

00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:45.197
the 20th century.

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:47.098
And I think very few of

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.099
the politicians actually

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.434
understood the math.

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.435
So I think a lot of it is

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:53.038
financial illiteracy, and

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:55.040
that can only be solved by

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.975
electing better people to

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:58.977
the state legislature. 		

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:17.762
This is Stockton,

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:19.764
California located about

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:20.765
2 hours by car from

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:23.034
San Francisco. 		

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:24.135
Good Evening. Welcome to

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:24.736
a special Stockton City

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.104
Council meeting... 		

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:27.839
10 years ago it was

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.841
booming...filling with

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:30.842
Americans and immigrants

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:31.843
alike, dreaming of greater

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:34.679
prosperity. Now those

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.014
dreams have died...

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.016
only the buildings are left. 		

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.419
This bankruptcy will ruin

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.154
our property taxes, which

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:44.456
will ruin our schools

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:46.024
which ruins our future. 		

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.025
...and as our financial

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.026
people said in the meeting

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.895
we just came out of,

00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:51.029
it looks like we're going

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.030
to be in difficult

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.431
circumstances for 10 years.

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:54.799
10 years, and so that

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.968
seems an endless

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:59.804
amount of time to a mayor

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.172
who hopefully will be here

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.207
another 4 years...but

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.509
10 years to deal with these

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:06.978
kinds of decisions and

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:09.247
budget cuts and restructuring

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:13.451
is really a mountain

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.220
that we have to climb.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.187
What's the root

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.656
cause of these fiscal

00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:18.990
challenges to Stockton? 		

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.325
We've had some very poor

00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:21.326
decisions made in the

00:34:21.326 --> 00:34:22.327
past. There is some

00:34:22.327 --> 00:34:23.328
agreements made with

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:24.329
employee groups that we

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:25.330
can't afford any longer.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.331
And there was also a debt

00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:27.766
that we got into for

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:28.800
facilities that were built

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.801
in Stockton and we

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.169
can no longer afford. 		

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.705
We have millions of dollars

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:34.873
in debt that we have to

00:34:34.873 --> 00:34:35.907
pay off that we simply

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.475
don't have the revenues for. 		

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.077
The problems that cities

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.078
like Stockton, California

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:41.379
are facing or San Jose,

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:43.381
California; the State of

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:44.516
California are all

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:45.850
problems that were

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.353
foreseeable many years ago.

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:49.354
The leaders at that time

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:50.922
spent a lot of money.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.390
They, they bonded a

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.392
number of infrastructure

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:55.527
projects that they -

00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:56.661
because they felt that the

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.662
money would continue

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:58.396
to come in. 		

00:34:58.396 --> 00:34:59.965
I think the key is

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:01.466
to find a few good people.

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.969
You know, the bad news

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:04.469
is that you have a

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:05.570
state legislature, which

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.738
is governed by people or

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:07.739
run by people that are not

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:08.740
financially that literate

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.975
and have these

00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:11.476
short-term horizons.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.477
But the good news is:

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:14.879
is that it doesn't take a change

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:15.814
of very many of those

00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:16.648
legislators to transform

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:17.682
California governance.

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.184
At our organization,

00:35:19.184 --> 00:35:20.885
Govern for California,

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:21.886
we require the following

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:22.988
of the people that we were

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:24.489
interested in supporting:

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:26.758
One: High levels of basic

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:28.193
intelligence - which is

00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:30.295
lacking- seriously lacking

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:32.197
among state legislators

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:35.467
Two: Financial literacy -

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:37.002
which is lacking more than

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.470
anything else among state

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:39.971
legislators. Three:

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.606
Diligence - I know state

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:42.607
legislators who don't even

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.608
read their own bills, the

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:44.609
bills that they themselves

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:45.610
introduced, they don't

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.311
read their own bills.

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:50.281
Four: Electability -

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.282
People that will be liked

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:52.217
by their fellow citizens

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:53.218
so they have a chance of

00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:55.387
getting elected And Five:

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:56.388
And the most important is

00:35:56.388 --> 00:35:58.223
Courage - and we define

00:35:58.223 --> 00:35:59.958
courage as the willingness

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:00.992
to stand for something

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.028
greater than themselves.

00:36:04.763 --> 00:36:06.698
California famously is

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:07.699
a trendsetter; where

00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:09.567
Californians go...much of

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.636
the world seeks to follow.

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.637
But where California is

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:13.638
going now is not so

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.774
appealing: unsustainable

00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:16.775
government debt and

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:17.776
looming municipal

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:18.777
bankruptcies.

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:20.578
Is California moving toward

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.279
a dangerous edge?

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:22.547
Is the rest of the U.S.

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:25.016
and the world following it? 		

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:26.985
From what I can tell,

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:29.120
my generation is the

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.121
un-greatest generation

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.122
perhaps that's ever lived

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.023
in the United States.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:36.127
We cut our taxes, we issue

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.962
debt, we make promises

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:41.166
that we don't fund and we

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:42.200
leave it all for the next

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.202
generation to handle. 		

00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:51.009
Tanja, you've been living

00:36:51.009 --> 00:36:52.844
in the United States for,

00:36:52.844 --> 00:36:54.913
for quite a while, right?

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:55.480
Yes, 7 years. 		

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.015
7 years? I mean- you can

00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:59.017
judge, do you think the

00:36:59.017 --> 00:36:59.951
U.S. is heading in the

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.453
same direction as the EU?

00:37:01.453 --> 00:37:02.454
I think so.

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:04.222
Unfortunately, it is...

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:05.223
especially with the

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.224
government spending that

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.225
is going out of proportions.

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.194
It's not just, you know,

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:10.195
the current president,

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:12.130
also the previous president,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.766
even though he was calling for

00:37:14.766 --> 00:37:16.734
economic freedom and

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.703
saying that he will do

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:20.705
anything in order to make

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:21.740
the country freer,

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.741
he did just the opposite.

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:26.411
So, yes...America is on the

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:28.947
path to collapse as well,

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:29.948
on many levels.

00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:32.884
I think a lot of Americans

00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:34.519
are not in synched with

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:35.520
the reality, but if you look

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.388
at our past, there have

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:38.523
been countries that

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.991
prospered, and then they

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:41.493
collapsed because of their

00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:43.361
mistakes. I think no one

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.996
is untouchable, and

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:45.997
America is behaving like

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.332
it's untouchable.

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:49.200
So I think America is

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.002
losing the grip, and actually

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.003
the competitiveness in

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:53.505
the world. Let's take

00:37:53.505 --> 00:37:54.506
California for example,

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:55.507
what's going on over there?

00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:57.509
A very bankrupt economy.

00:37:57.509 --> 00:37:58.576
Exactly! It's suffering

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:00.445
a huge budget deficit

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:01.946
and you have cities

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.115
filing for bankruptcy.

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.116
Businesses are moving

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.351
out of California

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:07.852
to the nearby states.

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.854
And the other states

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:10.622
are taking advantage of that,

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.557
which is... I mean a normal

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:13.558
process.  I think what

00:38:13.558 --> 00:38:14.626
we are forgetting here

00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:15.960
right now and what the

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.462
world has been forgetting

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:20.231
the past decade or so is

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:21.599
that there are always good

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.600
times, and there's alway

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.302
bad times because of

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:25.904
business cycles or

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:26.538
economic cycles.

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:27.972
That's why so many people

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.741
were misled into thinking

00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:30.742
that the market will only

00:38:30.742 --> 00:38:32.076
continue growing.

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:32.744
That's why so much money

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:34.846
was pumped into the Greek

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:37.749
economy. That's why so

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:39.384
many people did not see

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:40.819
this crisis coming in

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:41.819
the first place. 		

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:49.394
I think it's known as we all know...

00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:51.296
on a globalized world like as

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:54.365
the subprime mortgage

00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:55.366
crisis that started in the

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.568
United States and moved

00:38:56.568 --> 00:38:57.569
into Europe. I think that

00:38:57.569 --> 00:38:58.570
in all likely chances that

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.271
the current Euro crisis

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:03.541
may spread out- not to all,

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.643
into the Atlantic but also

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.645
into the developing

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.947
countries...in my view,

00:39:08.947 --> 00:39:10.815
it's like a real prospect.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:11.816
But what I think the

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.284
real crisis for the U.S.

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.286
is- is that the level of

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:17.121
economic shock to the world.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.122
If Europe goes down,

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.123
we'll push the U.S.

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:22.627
recovery back down even in

00:39:22.627 --> 00:39:23.828
to double-dipping back

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:24.929
into recession.

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:27.165
And what that means is then

00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:29.200
it's very difficult then for

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.201
the U.S. to recover,

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.469
because we have jobless

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:34.472
recoveries. And if the

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:36.975
U.S. can't start people

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:39.477
again into jobs...it won't

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.012
solve its debt crisis;

00:39:41.012 --> 00:39:42.981
it won't start being

00:39:42.981 --> 00:39:43.982
productive again. 		

00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:47.885
Phillip, I want to get to

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.554
the point where I think that

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:51.990
we agreed that the crisis

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.026
we are facing- it's also

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:57.829
primarily a productive crisis.

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:59.998
From that point-

00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:00.999
and I think that's not

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:02.900
part of the solution,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.970
for this crisis- should also

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.705
be solving the

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:10.241
productivity crisis.

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.343
What we saw happening

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:15.146
was exactly the opposite.

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:18.616
The fact that most of the

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.019
solutions...the portrayed

00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:23.488
solution was more on the

00:40:23.488 --> 00:40:24.856
consumer side of the balance.

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.025
So like...we add the problem

00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:29.360
like the sub-prime mortgages,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.963
and there were needs.

00:40:31.963 --> 00:40:34.265
And we tried to solve

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:37.035
those needs by artificially

00:40:37.035 --> 00:40:40.405
responding to the demands-

00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:41.873
rather than answering

00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:42.874
the main causes. 		

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:44.142
I think that's completely

00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:46.377
right...and I think that's

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:47.378
what's happened is the

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.613
short-tem electoral cycle

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.682
that we have prevents

00:40:50.682 --> 00:40:53.484
long-term solutions.

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.485
It seems like there's

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.486
quite a bit of corruption

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:56.554
involved. It's all about

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:58.122
what they personally want.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.158
I think my generation is

00:41:00.158 --> 00:41:01.326
pretty angry about the

00:41:01.326 --> 00:41:02.327
amount of debt that we're

00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:03.328
going to be shouldering.

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:04.329
They're trying to make

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:05.330
sure that they're making

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.331
the popular choices, rather

00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:07.999
than necessarily making

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:09.667
the hard correct choice.

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.669
...a culture of borrowing.

00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:16.007
There's been a lot of

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:17.008
focus on the European

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:18.509
debt crisis where countries

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:19.510
like Greece are on the

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.012
brink of bankruptcy.

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:22.013
But what about the

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:24.148
United States- home of

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.017
the dollar, the world's

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:27.552
reserve currency?

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:29.354
I'm in Washington, D.C.

00:41:29.354 --> 00:41:31.189
to find out.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.662
Today, the U. S. Government

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.564
is spending over

00:41:39.564 --> 00:41:42.200
a $1.40 for every $1

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.534
that it takes in in revenue.

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:45.903
Today, the federal government

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:47.939
has accumulated liabilities

00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:49.040
and unfunded obligations

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.544
of over $550,000

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:55.747
per household...

00:41:55.747 --> 00:41:58.416
and growing rapidly.

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:01.919
This is David Walker.

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.921
As long-time head of the

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.289
U. S. General Accounting Office,

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:06.924
few people know U.S. Government

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:09.093
finances better than he does.

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:11.229
For the past few years,

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.097
he's been on a fiscal tour

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.098
all across America

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.500
talking about the

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.502
financial state of the union.

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:18.503
The United States

00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:21.472
is not Greece but then again,

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.473
Greece is the

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.775
cradle of democracy;

00:42:23.775 --> 00:42:25.009
it was once the greatest

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.611
civilization on earth.

00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:27.879
It once controlled most of

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:30.248
the known world,

00:42:30.248 --> 00:42:31.749
and Greece is now a mere

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.884
shadow of itself-

00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:34.519
because it strayed from

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:35.520
the principles and values

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.587
that made it great.

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:37.655
And Greece has got somebody

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:40.525
to bail it out - the United States

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:41.526
does not.

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:45.530
Financial literacy is a

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.330
particular problem in the

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.566
United States- and it's even a

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:50.034
bigger problem in the

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.169
congress of the United States.

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.271
There's no way

00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:54.439
that an American family

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:56.174
or an American corporation

00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:57.508
could run its finances

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.477
like the U.S. government.

00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:01.179
Too many of our elected

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:02.180
officials, no matter how

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.181
well- intended, are career

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:05.483
politicians; they're human

00:43:05.483 --> 00:43:06.951
beings. They don't want to

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.052
lose their job.

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.053
A lot of them think that the

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:10.688
people can't handle the truth,

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.623
and so they don't tell

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:13.624
them the truth. A lot of

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.259
them don't have answers to

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.260
these problems or, if they

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.261
do have answers, they

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.796
involve tough choices.

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:24.869
Public pressure is

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:25.870
critical because

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.905
ultimately a vast majority

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:28.906
of current elected

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:29.907
officials are career

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.609
politicians, and they want

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:32.677
to keep their job.

00:43:32.677 --> 00:43:35.279
And if the public pressures them

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.280
to act and holds them

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.516
accountable for failing to act,

00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:41.118
then they will ultimately

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.988
change...because many of

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.022
their top priorities is to

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.557
keep their job.

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.025
There are a number of

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.527
common denominators between

00:43:49.527 --> 00:43:51.762
countries, and some of the

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:52.763
challenges that exist at

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.298
the federal, state and

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:55.366
local level here in the

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:56.567
United States.

00:43:56.567 --> 00:43:58.536
In many cases, governments

00:43:58.536 --> 00:43:59.470
have grown too big,

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.472
promised too much, and

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:04.408
waited too long to restructure.

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:06.344
I think we just don't know

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:07.311
how to use money.

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.312
I know that people my age

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.313
never expect to get

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.115
Social Security benefits.

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:13.484
Hopeful, but I wouldn't

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.820
say very optimistic.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.591
A lot of people claim that

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.527
the problem is still the slack

00:44:22.527 --> 00:44:24.228
capacity, unused workers.

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:26.097
Why not just increase

00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:28.633
demand, employ all those

00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:29.634
workers; put those

00:44:29.634 --> 00:44:31.402
factories back to work ...

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.004
Well, it's important to

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:34.005
look at the cases that

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:35.006
actually have been working.

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:36.741
For example, take Sweden.

00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:38.576
We have decreased taxes,

00:44:38.576 --> 00:44:40.545
we have deregulated,

00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:42.213
and we have cut down

00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:43.214
on government spending

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:44.048
and in 2011

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:46.517
we made a budget surplus

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.586
of 10 billion dollars.

00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:50.254
A single data point, right?

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.255
Look at these other countries:

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:53.257
Greece, Spain, Italy

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:54.258
- they're all depressed.

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.661
The problem is slack capacity...

00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:59.230
excess capacity....too many

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.164
workers unemployed.

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.165
Let's put 'em back to work.

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:03.234
How do you get workers back

00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:04.235
into the employment ranks?

00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:05.236
You gotta increase demand

00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:06.237
for what they do.

00:45:06.237 --> 00:45:06.938
The only way to increase

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:07.939
demand for what they do is for

00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:08.940
government to spend more,

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.441
because the private sector

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.877
isn't doing it.

00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:13.878
Well, this is the things that

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:14.912
Keynesians always say:

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.582
Just pump more money into

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:18.583
the economy. But it's

00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:19.584
important for us to look

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:21.619
at all those times we have

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:22.587
implemented these kinds of

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:24.689
theories and the results

00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:25.690
have always been devastating.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.657
Japan in the 90s,

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:29.293
the U.S. in '01 and '08.

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.294
What we do need is

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.729
free man, free markets

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.331
and productivity.

00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:35.333
We as persons are good,

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:36.267
we can create things.

00:45:36.267 --> 00:45:38.002
But we can't do it when

00:45:38.002 --> 00:45:40.304
we are...buried under a burden

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:41.973
of government regulations.

00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:42.974
Look, all that's fine.

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:43.908
But when we have

00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:44.909
massive unemployment,

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:47.078
massive excess capacity,

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.613
none of that's going to

00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:50.615
work unless demand is

00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:51.616
increased- and government's

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:52.617
the only agency

00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:53.618
that can get demand

00:45:53.618 --> 00:45:54.685
throughout the entire

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.354
economy. Well, is there

00:45:56.354 --> 00:45:58.022
any limit on exactly how

00:45:58.022 --> 00:45:59.023
much debt we will put on

00:45:59.023 --> 00:45:59.957
our children and our

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.459
grandchildren before we

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:02.727
realize that this way of

00:46:02.727 --> 00:46:03.728
thought is not working?

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:05.963
Is there any hope the

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:06.964
situation, we will not, we

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:07.965
will all be Greece in

00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:10.434
15, 10, 5 years?

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.036
During the last two months,

00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:14.338
I have met more immigrants

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.407
from Ireland, Greece, Spain,

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:17.408
in Stockholm, in Sweden...

00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:19.243
than I have during my

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.244
entire life before.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.246
Is this witness of a

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.247
well-functioning idea, of

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:25.316
a good solution to a very

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:26.317
big problem? Maybe Ireland

00:46:26.317 --> 00:46:27.318
is not spending enough

00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:29.987
money. Maybe they...

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:30.988
the money supply...should

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.024
increase in Ireland.

00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:36.027
Maybe fiscal deficits in Ireland

00:46:36.027 --> 00:46:37.828
should rise. Let me ask

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:38.829
you about a more specific

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:39.830
problem though.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.831
So you know, we have

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:41.832
these problems with banks here,

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:44.502
and in the U. S.

00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:45.503
Surely, the only way we can

00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:47.805
save the banks, are,

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:51.242
is through, more...

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:52.410
government support

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.411
for the banks.

00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:54.412
Well, once again,

00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:55.413
we can look to

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:56.814
a very recent example.

00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:59.016
The European Central Bank

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:00.751
has issued one trillion Euros,

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.486
in the liquidity means

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:03.487
to the European banks.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:04.889
And what happened was that

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:05.890
Spanish bonds went down

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.059
for about one month,

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:09.060
and then it went right up

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.061
again because this is not

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:11.095
a sustainable way of

00:47:11.095 --> 00:47:12.330
solv...solving the

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.899
solvency issue in Europe.

00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:15.900
Isn't the problem though

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.901
austerity? Austerity is

00:47:16.901 --> 00:47:19.537
sweeping across Europe,

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:20.538
and austerity is what's

00:47:20.538 --> 00:47:22.340
keeping the economies from

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.341
growing, it's what's

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.209
keeping the banks in trouble.

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:26.210
We just have to

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.211
open the spigots, all this

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:28.846
austerity stuff, this is

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.347
old-fashioned economics.

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.348
We've learned, since

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.983
Keynes, that we need

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:34.752
new stuff, spending.

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:35.753
Well...there's been a lot

00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:36.754
of talking about austerity

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:38.589
in Europe, in Spain and

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.125
other countries, but if we

00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:42.526
really look, what kind of

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:43.527
measures have been

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.528
implemented? I haven't

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.730
seen much austerity, not really.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.732
America's still in

00:47:47.732 --> 00:47:48.733
pretty bad straights;

00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:49.734
the unemployment rate

00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:51.602
remains stubbornly high.

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.804
Shouldn't we spend more in America?

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:55.339
Isn't the Keynesian remedy

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.340
appropriate for the

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.575
United States at least?

00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.376
Well, however we twist and turn

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.245
this...we has to reach the

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.246
conclusion that this is

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:03.714
a crisis of productivity.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:04.715
It's a crisis of

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.517
living over our means.

00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:08.853
If the United States wants to

00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.321
go down the European path,

00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:12.289
I would suggest...stimulants,

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:13.791
and I would suggest the

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:14.792
Keynesian way of doing it.

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:16.560
But if you actually want

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.561
to have a brighter future

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:18.429
for your children,

00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:19.430
I suggest some more saving

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:20.431
and some more working.

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:21.966
Seems we're in a dilemma

00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:25.102
here....that austerity,

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:25.970
at least to me,

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.971
seems inevitable in most parts

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.639
of Europe. On the other hand,

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.640
you have people in

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.641
the streets, also in many

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.976
countries protesting

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:32.977
against this, and it's

00:48:32.977 --> 00:48:34.945
also understandable.

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.180
How do we solve that?

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.082
It's a huge democratic problem,

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:39.083
I think. Tocqueville

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.084
supposedly said that

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:41.952
democracy can only exist

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.554
until the voters discover

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:44.555
that they can vote for

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:45.556
themselves, not just from

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:46.290
the public treasury.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.259
And I think we see that

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:50.161
that has created the addiction

00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:52.062
to public benefits...entitlements

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.664
that we see in Europe.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.232
So now in Denmark,

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.001
we have the tax authorities

00:48:57.001 --> 00:48:58.469
who are able to access your

00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:00.271
phone records... Really?

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:01.438
...without a court

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.807
warrant, without

00:49:02.807 --> 00:49:03.874
reasonable suspicion.

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:04.675
If you are a pensioner,

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.676
you have to report it to

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:06.444
your municipality.

00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:07.444
If you leave your country

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.946
for long periods...most

00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.881
municipalities have websites,

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:11.882
hotlines, where you can

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:12.883
call your, you know,

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.685
and report your neighbor

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:15.686
if you suspect them

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:16.887
of receiving entitlements

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.622
that they don't have the right to.

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.623
It seems like the

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.724
financial big brother is

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:21.725
watching all over you.

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:23.194
Yes, and you know, there's

00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:24.195
no uproar, there's no

00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:26.063
revolt about this because

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.164
the system that we have

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.933
created...creates this

00:49:28.933 --> 00:49:31.135
perverse incentive for

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:32.136
the citizens to care about

00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:33.537
what their neighbors are doing.

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:34.538
Not out of compassion-

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:36.540
but out of, you know,

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.541
self-interest

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:38.309
that you don't want someone

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:39.677
else to abuse the system.

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:40.678
So in many ways we

00:49:40.678 --> 00:49:40.778
have created this

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:43.247
Byzantine Kafkaesque...

00:49:43.247 --> 00:49:44.949
system of

00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:45.950
laws and regulations

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.251
that in some ways

00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:48.385
subject the average Danish citizens

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.321
to measures that we know,

00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:51.322
that we knew in the old

00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.056
Eastern Germany.

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:54.158
Hopefully one day we will be

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:55.993
out of this crisis situation.

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:58.128
Brussels will need to

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:00.497
think very hard as to how

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:01.498
to prevent these crises

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.499
from happening over and

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.568
over again. And to me,

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:05.569
as an economist, it seems

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:07.238
that the only way out is

00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:09.974
to have, actually further

00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:11.275
integration in Europe,

00:50:11.275 --> 00:50:13.644
is to have a unified fiscal

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:14.645
and budget policy- because

00:50:14.645 --> 00:50:16.213
the imbalances between

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.015
these countries are so big.

00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:19.016
The European Union,

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.017
the Commission, its

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:22.386
institutions, do not have

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:23.387
legitimacy in the European

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:25.589
populations, and also,

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.424
you know, if you live in Ohio

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.425
and Pennsylvania you feel

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.294
American, but if you live

00:50:30.294 --> 00:50:31.295
in Greece and Denmark-

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:32.296
you don't feel...you don't

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:33.430
have that same bond.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.032
I think that it was a

00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:37.234
mistake to build a massive

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:38.235
political union upon

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.237
basically the internal market.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.338
The internal market has

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.107
worked wonderfully in creating

00:50:43.107 --> 00:50:46.911
wealth, and democracy...

00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.979
securing that in a continent

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.915
with a very bloody history.

00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:51.916
But we simply

00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:52.716
do not have that

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:55.185
shared history and culture

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.120
that is necessary for a

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.254
centralized political

00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:00.057
union, and therefore

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.492
I think it's a huge mistake,

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:03.093
and it undermines the very

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.461
purpose of the EU.

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.462
So you're suggesting not a

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:06.463
step forward in

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.464
integration, but maybe

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:08.465
even a step backwards

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.034
towards sustaining the

00:51:10.034 --> 00:51:11.035
four freedoms between

00:51:11.035 --> 00:51:12.002
these nations?

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.505
Yes. I would...I would advocate

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:17.141
a more simple model that was

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:18.142
based largely on the four

00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:20.010
freedoms- and not for the

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.612
political integration, and not

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:25.349
necessarily a common currency.

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:26.350
What we're seeing

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:27.952
with Europe and the

00:51:27.952 --> 00:51:31.188
U.S. is trillions of

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.556
currency units created,

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:36.060
and yet growth is stalling.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.061
So basically,

00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:38.028
instead of getting back to

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:40.397
growth by production and

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:42.733
reform and competitiveness-

00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:44.702
we're just printing new money,

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:46.737
creating money out of thin air.

00:51:46.737 --> 00:51:48.172
And that creates

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:49.173
these bubbles, because

00:51:49.173 --> 00:51:51.008
money ends up somewhere.

00:51:51.008 --> 00:51:52.009
It creates the financial

00:51:52.009 --> 00:51:53.377
bubbles which become very

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:55.245
destructive and destabilizing.

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:56.246
But all these

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.247
other things that

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.616
we're talking about in

00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.985
terms of overspending,

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:01.986
over-indebtedness...

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:02.987
So what do you think happens

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:03.988
then, when we're in a

00:52:03.988 --> 00:52:04.989
crisis and we're trying to

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:07.658
solve it by inflating the

00:52:07.658 --> 00:52:09.193
bubbles again, just

00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:11.829
creating new...more money?

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:13.998
Ultimately, it just makes

00:52:13.998 --> 00:52:14.999
matters worse.

00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:17.901
It's understandable that it

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:19.837
happens-but it's a kind of

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:21.672
desperation. It would be

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:23.207
something like giving

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:24.308
steroids to an arthritic

00:52:24.308 --> 00:52:27.044
patient. It's a miracle

00:52:27.044 --> 00:52:28.645
drug to begin with-but if

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.447
it's over-used, it becomes

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:31.448
worse than the problem.

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.217
But it's incredibly scary,

00:52:33.217 --> 00:52:34.218
because if we build

00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:35.986
the recovery...not with

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.688
reform and competitiveness

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:38.689
and real production,

00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:40.024
but just in printing

00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:41.025
more money, we create

00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:43.560
even more unsustainable bubbles.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.561
Where would that end in

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:45.896
the future...in the long run?

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:46.430
Absolutely...well,

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.734
the worst part is likely

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.469
to come in terms of the

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.872
social instability.

00:52:54.872 --> 00:52:56.006
What we're seeing for

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:58.575
the public in the U.S.-

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.778
it will be a difficult time

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:01.845
for a long time.

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.347
I know that people my age

00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:04.448
never expect to get Social

00:53:04.448 --> 00:53:06.083
Security benefits.

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:08.585
This bankruptcy will ruin

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:10.254
our property taxes, which will

00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:12.356
ruin our schools-

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:13.357
which ruins our future.

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:15.092
It's about 20 percent of the

00:53:15.092 --> 00:53:16.960
people...of the population

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.961
lost their job during the

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.163
last five years.

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:20.697
It could have been done so

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.900
much better with a little bit

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.068
of courage a civile,

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:26.570
of civil courage...if you like.

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.172
When I had my exams

00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:29.173
to get into the

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.174
university, I was thinking

00:53:30.174 --> 00:53:32.810
that, "Wow! I'm going to

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:33.944
become a pharmacist,

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.512
I'm going to have a good job;

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.947
I'm going to have a drugstore;

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.583
I'm going to have a good life."

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:44.054
And now...I just...I hope I

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.423
get 30 Euros in 8 hours by

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:48.592
becoming...by being a waitress.

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:50.427
And I don't know

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:50.694
what I will do

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:53.263
...if we had referendum in France,

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:55.332
I'm sure people rejected

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.734
Europe. ...just to put it

00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:58.802
very simply, successful

00:53:58.802 --> 00:53:59.770
capitalists hate

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.737
capitalism. The word

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.906
austerity is now giving

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:03.907
the creeps to pretty much

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:04.908
all of Europe... But if

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:05.909
you actually want to have

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:06.910
a brighter future for your

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.145
children, I suggest some

00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:09.179
more saving and some more

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:10.180
working. A lot of

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.149
people are scared about the

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:13.484
future...especially young people.

00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:16.720
But you know...unfortunately,

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.721
politicians don't get the story.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.856
They don't want to

00:54:18.856 --> 00:54:21.358
realize the severity of

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.793
the problem; they don't

00:54:22.793 --> 00:54:23.861
want to do anything.

00:54:23.861 --> 00:54:24.962
They don't have the courage.

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:26.630
Europe is today one of the

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.532
richest continents in the world.

00:54:28.532 --> 00:54:29.533
And my hope...my

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:31.902
dream is that Africa, and

00:54:31.902 --> 00:54:32.102
indeed my country,

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.704
Mozambique, one day will

00:54:33.704 --> 00:54:35.672
become also wealthy.

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:39.309
And we need to understand

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.978
the deep causes of today's

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:44.281
crisis, so that Africa and

00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.249
Mozambique can avoid the

00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:47.851
same mistakes that Europe

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:48.852
is making today.

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:52.055
In a way, it's not all gloomy.

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:54.091
We've had 10 bad years of

00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:56.160
crisis, but at the same

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.161
time we've probably

00:54:57.161 --> 00:54:58.395
created something like a

00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.463
quarter of all the wealth

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:00.464
that mankind has ever

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:02.466
created over those 10 years.

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:03.133
Absolutely...and we

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.135
have to be careful not to

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.336
destroy that, because the

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:08.338
market is the only source

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.340
of widespread prosperity.

00:55:11.108 --> 00:55:12.109
You know...we're not

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:13.944
talking about numbers when

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:14.945
we're talking about this.

00:55:14.945 --> 00:55:15.946
It's really about people-

00:55:15.946 --> 00:55:17.614
it's about their dreams.

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.615
It all comes down to that

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.684
young woman I met in Greece.

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.819
She wanted to own

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:23.754
a drugstore, and now she's

00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:26.823
content just being a waitress.

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:27.491
And our way of dealing

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:28.825
with this crisis will

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:29.826
decide the fate of her

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.662
and millions like her.
