00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:06.460
I believe today's the easiest time ever in
the history of mankind to think big. Ever!

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm talking EVER. And you'll find out why
by the time you're done watching this entire

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.679
video. I'm going to cover things that you
can implement for you to start thinking bigger

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.980
than you've ever thought before. And here's
why; this is my argument.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.259
What is difficult is for you and a group of
people to decide to create the pyramid in

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.909
Egypt without cranes. Now that's difficult
to think big. That's impossible, some would

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:37.010
say. What would seem impossible is for you
to invent a machine that weighs tons and tons

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.300
of weight to tell 400-500 people at a time,
go in that machine right there and fly 4,000

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.429
miles. It's not going to crash, you're going
to be safe. And a billion people say, "Okay,

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.390
I believe you." That's impossible. That's
difficult to say I'm going to think that big.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.260
I'm going to create this ship. It's okay you
guys can get on this ship. I know we don't

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.850
see what's out there, your name is Christopher.
Christopher, go out there. And we don't know

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.410
what's going to happen. We're going to make
it out of wood because we don't know how to

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.680
make it out of metal at that time. You go
straight, and eventually you're going to get

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.710
to maybe another land, and you can call it,
it's your land, while people have been there;

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.990
that's impossible. That's not thinking big.
That's impossible to a lot of people. Landing

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.020
on the moon for the first time, it had never
been done. We don't even know what's out there.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.969
You know what? Why don't we just go up there.
We don't know what's out there. We keep looking

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.890
through these lenses and you know, it's kind
of cool. I think there is something out there,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.250
and it's called this, and it's called that.
Let's go check it out! That's difficult. Today,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.431
for an entrepreneur to think big, piece of
cake today. It requires energy, it requires

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:42.340
you knowing the formula. It requires effort.
Requires the desire, but if you're somebody

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.229
that's watching this and saying, "Pat, I absolutely
want to think big," I'm going to cover it

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.719
with you here today.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.420
But before I get into my points, I want to
first of all thank a lot of you guys. Today's

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.211
my birthday, and we've had so many people
send us gifts from all over the place. I want

00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:03.280
to thank you. We started off with some strange
- what do you call that from our friend, Mark

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.550
Molina, what do you call it? An exotic dancing
gram, he sent to my headquarters for a lady

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.800
to come and sing happy birthday to you. I
appreciate that, but I'm not the wolf of life

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.040
insurance industry. I think he mistook me
for the wolf of Wall Street. We got so many,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.530
I mean, balloons galore, we could start a
balloon business here. I got here from John,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.740
John, you sent me this here, John, an attorney
from New York, and your son, Andrew. Andrew,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.950
buddy, I love the note you sent. You keep
listening to your pops, and you keep learning

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.550
about what it is to become an entrepreneur.
One day in the future we could possibly vote

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160
for you to become a president.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.340
I like this gift here from. . . Senna, you
know I'm a Senna fan. My daughter's name is

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.260
Senna. Exactly - S E N N A. This is how much
I love this guy, Senna. And Armand sent me

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.370
a nice little thing here, Senna, I appreciate
that. I'm not going to go through all of them.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.750
I'm just giving you a flavor here. James Dean,
James Dean, if we go through the top it says,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.200
"Dream as if you'll live forever, live as
if you'll die today," which he did, but that

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.970
quote is a great quote, and I'm going to leave
one of these here that was funny for me. I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.470
get shoes sent to me all the time because
of a video I did a long time ago on how I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.240
used to set up meetings, when I was a financial
adviser at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. I would

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.751
send a box with a shoe in there saying now
that I have one foot in the door, help me

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:29.610
get the second one in. And these guys got
a little more creative. They decided to send

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.540
me Air Jordans. And I've got to give them
love. This is from Arash Kari. Arash, you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.770
are the man, and you are creative. And I can't
wait to get the second shoe of this pair,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.670
but I appreciate all the Happy Birthday messages
I got on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.550
Thank you for all the love. More and more,
every time I hear this message, this validates

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.170
how many entrepreneurs we have around the
world that are following this content that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.380
want to do something big with their lives.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.370
So let's get right into the episode on how
to think big as an entrepreneur. Listen. The

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.290
usual suspects you'll hear about is what?
Books, associations, environment. Pat, you've

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.110
got to read the right books, you've got to
have the right associations, you've got to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.850
have the right environment. Absolutely, these
are the usual suspects. Whatever I cover with

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.849
you does not discount this. You need to do
this, but I'm covering things you don't typically

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.889
hear about, the unusual suspects. Then I'll
give you a plan on the end of what to do,

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.840
and some things I'll cover, there's going
to be a bunch of points. I don't know how

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.259
many points it is. I'll have them all here.
It won't be in any specific order. You need

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.689
to take notes even though it's typed out on
my website. But you'll probably have a lot

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.110
of questions you'll want to ask about this
that we'll start a dialog on the bottom.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.570
Okay, so let's get right into it.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.289
#1: One of the things is that I love doing
is I look at everything on thinking big from

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.930
the standpoint of math. So let's just say
math. Math has a lot to do with thinking big.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.789
Let me make my case to you on what I mean
by math has a lot to do with thinking big.

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:10.450
The way I used to do it was this. I used to
ask myself, what number comes after three?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.270
So if I can make three dollars, do you think
I could make four dollars? Everybody would

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.770
say what? Of course. Okay, if I could make
100 dollars, could I make 200 dollars? Yes,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.229
Pat, where are you going with this? If you
can make $1,000 can you make $2,000? Of course.

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.129
If you can make 10 grand in a month, can you
make 11 grand a month? Yes, of course you

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:38.819
can. So when does this stop? Never. It only
stops when you no longer are applying math

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.129
to thinking big. See, thinking big to me is
purely math. No number is an end number. If

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.819
I ask you right now what's the biggest number
in the world, you can't think about a number.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.219
Because there isn't a number that's the biggest
number in the world. A billion times billion

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.599
times billion is still a number that's bigger
if you give another multiplication times another

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.800
billion. And that's still not the biggest
number. If you go against another billion.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.689
And another billion and another billion. There
is no number that's a limit. People aren't

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:09.580
going to hit these numbers. Billionaires seemed
impossible until somebody became a billionaire.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.900
Today, Elon Musk could be the first guy that
could potentially be a trillionaire if he

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.320
goes at the pace that he's going. This is
going to happen. But you need to take these

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.919
big numbers that seem impossible, and I'm
starting with this first, you need to take

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.930
numbers that seem impossible, and just know
it's numbers. There is nothing to be afraid

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.370
of numbers. It's purely math! What is so big
about numbers? Nothing is big about numbers.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.020
You need to look at math first, period. The
difference between a small thinker and a big

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.280
thinker is multiplication. The big thinker's
multiplying. The small thinker is addition.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.699
He's only adding. Two plus two plus two plus
two plus two is ten. Two times two times two

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.460
times two times two is not ten. It's a lot
more than that. It's multiplication, but it's

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.870
math. Multiplication, addition, math. It's
purely math. So start off with whatever you

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.509
think seems absolutely big that you cannot
do. Bring it down to a number. Look at it

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.979
as the number you haven't done yet, that's
all it is, a number you haven't done that

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:16.300
you eventually need to get to to do. The number
one thing that I like to do is, I look at

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.889
everything as math. I bring it down and make
it a smaller bite, then I know I can get the

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.860
bigger bite, but I've got to get the smaller
bite based on that.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.629
#2: Next point about how to think bigger.
So whatever the big thinking idea is that

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:35.229
I have, whatever the big thinking idea is
that I have, I need confidence to be thinking

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:42.610
bigger. And confidence happens with smaller
victories. If you can have small victories

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.939
in a game, or in business, you eventually
start believing you can have the bigger victories.

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:52.909
But a bigger victory doesn't all of a sudden
happen. A big victory is a combination of

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:57.710
many, many small victories that didn't stop
after another one. You have one victory, boom,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.589
go get another one, and another one, and another
one and another one and another one. All of

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:05.949
a sudden, you have a massive victory. So you've
got to have a lot of your small victories

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:09.099
that are taking place together while you're
going at it.

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:13.590
#3:Another thing that I would do is, say you
have a big idea. And you want to do something

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.370
big. Say you have a goal in your business,
you want to do something big that's never

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.930
been done in your business before. Test it
with five people, and see if you can convince

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.689
one of them that believe you. It's a very
interesting exercise. Get five of your team

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:31.740
members. You've got five sales people? Meet
with them individually, or in a group setting.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.720
Or take five of your employees. Take your
wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.200
husband, brother, sister, mom, dad, best friend
- whatever it is. And tell them you have an

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.940
idea. Hey, you know what I'm thinking about?
What are you thinking about? I'm thinking

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.460
about doing this, this, this, and one day
we're going to do this and . . . and see their

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:53.430
reaction on how it is. If you can convince
them to believe you even this much, it's possible.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.320
Does that make sense? I don't know if that
made sense. Try to convince somebody about

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.560
the big idea that you have and watch their
reaction. That ought to tell you a lot.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.900
For instance, I remember when I had nothing
going on. I was broke, $49K in debt, I had

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.650
nothing going on. I was driving a Ford Focus.
I would go intentionally to Ferrari dealerships.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:19.010
And you know what I would do? I would go,
walk in, I'd walk in and I'd walk around the

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.290
dealership and I'd be looking at the cars
and I wanted to ask myself, can I convince

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:31.100
this car salesman by the way he looks at me,
does he believe I can actually be a qualified

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.260
buyer? And if you go in and nobody comes to
talk to you, they don't believe you're a qualified

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.490
buyer. If you go in and they come and talk
to you like you know what, he just acted like

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.730
he believes I can buy this, maybe I can one
day buy this.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.560
Go to a real estate showing where they're
selling three million dollar homes. And walk

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.860
in. And walk around. And say, I'm here for
this open house. Great. And see if the listing

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.020
real estate agent believes you. Watch the
reaction. The first thing they'll do, they'll

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.491
go like this [looking down], they'll come
up, but forget what you look like. You know

00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:06.200
what they look at? At your body language,
at your eyes, the way you walk. If you convince

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.710
them, they're trying to tell you, I believe
you could potentially one day own a three

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.380
million dollar house. That's what they're
really saying to you. So take your idea and

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.951
share it and pitch it to three to five other
people can see how they react to you. If their

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:22.180
reaction is believe it, even if it's 10 - 20%,
then it's possible for you to actually go

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.180
out there and hit that. You've just got to
think bigger, right? Test it out with the

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.180
people around you.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:33.530
#4: Another one is, study people. When I say
"study people," I don't mean by studying people

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:38.880
in the way where everybody says, "Go study
this person, go study that person." Study

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.320
what that person studies. So, for instance,
don't just study Michael Jordan, study who

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.430
Michael Jordan studies, which is David Thompson.
Don't just study David Thompson, study who

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.130
David Thompson studies. And go deeper in that.
Don't just study, you know, I used to study

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.560
the people I was looking at in business in
the insurance world, and I would say, "Man,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.450
what makes that guy special? Who did he study?
He studied Teddy Roosevelt. He studied Coach

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.130
Bear Bryant. He studied Churchill. Man, let
me see why he studied those people." This

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:16.110
other guy was so strategic. He studied Alexander
the Great. He studied Darius. Why did he study

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.360
those guys? Oh, now I understand. This guy
here, he studied the Chinese emperors and

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.740
what was he doing studying the China Dynasty
and all these guys have built this big military.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:32.330
Why was he studying them? This other guy here.
. . layer it, layer it. Why was Tony Robbins

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.690
studying this guy? Why was Reagan studying.
. . why was Kennedy. . . why were these people

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.780
reading. . . Who are they studying? So go
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. What

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.070
this does to you is this. Let me tell you
what this does to you. It tells you that the

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:53.330
person that you admire now, at one point,
they doubted, but they studied other people

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.330
that injected belief in them to make them
believe that they can be the person they are

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.310
now, that you admire.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.820
I hope I'm making sense. I'm not trying to
get too technical. Go study who they study,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.820
and that will give you a source of inspiration
to know that you can one day be the person

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.830
that you're looking at, saying, this is impossible
for me to be like this person. No, you can,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.650
based on studying the people that they studied.
Let me continue.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.930
#5: So, next point. Again, Paul's going to
put the numbers here, I'm not putting numbers

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.580
here. Next point is this. I believe, just
like when I said earlier to you when I said

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.780
it's easier to think big, it's also the most
important time to think big. I said this on

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.220
a video, I've been saying it on Mentions,
I've been saying that I believe 100% of world's

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.800
problems are going to be solved by entrepreneurs.
I believe that. I believe 100% of world's

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.240
problems are going to be solved by entrepreneurs,
if we keep giving birth to entrepreneurs,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.510
entrepreneurs who make it, they have one ability
- they're problem solvers. They look at something

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.140
complex, they make it simplified, they add
five steps to it, you follow it, you win,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.180
you make, you can solve cancer. You can solve
health issues. You can solve job creation.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.500
You can solve economy challenges that we're
facing in the world. You can solve anything

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.350
we have going on. Every single problem in
the world can be solved by ent. . . every

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:19.350
single one of them. Our educational system,
our political system, our oil challenges we're

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.710
having - anything that we have can be solved
by entrepreneurs. So, as you're watching this,

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.100
a lot of times the first motivation for somebody
who's never been an entrepreneur will say,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.921
it'd be kind of cool to have a lot of money
and to have this. . . That's great. There's

00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:38.240
nothing wrong with all that stuff. Don't let
anybody convince you having a big house, having

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.030
cars and having toys is not important. If
you like it, you go get it. But, it's got

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.550
to be bigger than that. It's got to be bigger
than that. You've got to want to do something

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.870
bigger than that. Today, know that the world
is counting on you to solve some big problems.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.610
You can run your business, but know that you've
got to figure out a way for your business

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.880
that's making a lot of money to also make
a positive impact on the world. Social cause,

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.840
positive impact in the world, with you being
an entrepreneur.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840
#6:

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.190
Imagination. Big thinkers, if you're ever
around big thinkers - today, we just had a

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.530
meeting, literally a meeting right now. It
was a meeting we had right now with me, you,

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:19.010
Paul and Tom, right? And we're writing stuff
on the board. All of a sudden, boom! Mario

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.550
says something. Then I said something. Then
Paul said something. I think Paul started

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.790
it. Paul said something and I said, "Paul,
that's a great idea." And then I said something,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.300
then Tom said something, then Mario said something,
and then Mario went to the bathroom and then

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.990
he came back, but then Tom said something,
Paul said something, and then it led to a

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.852
massive idea. Then I asked Tom to send an
email to a couple of guys we've got to get

00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:45.220
a call on from Australia and we're doing a
call now about this massive idea that has

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:52.630
to do with the business that we're running
today. But it lead to them because it's like,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:58.710
"What if we could do this? And what if that
takes place? How about if. . what if it cost

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.950
this much? What if. . ."

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.290
Seeds, seeds, seeds, and the roots keep growing,
keep growing, keep growing and then boom,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.700
all of a sudden you've got a massive idea.
So imagination, especially if it's a group

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.280
of people that are also people that are imagination
type of people, and that goes. That goes,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:21.880
so the big thinker is all about imagination.
A big thinker is all about imagination.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.400
Nike used to get killed. Nike was getting
killed. A guy, there's a whole complicated

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.620
story behind it. Some people say it's not
him, some people say it's an Italian Mafia

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.890
guy from New York that came to Nike and said,
the way we're going to save it is there's

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.040
a guy that's coming out of college, North
Carolina, he's the most incredible basketball

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.630
- he's going to be the greatest basketball
player of all time. He goes to Nike and says,

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.770
let's sign this guy and give him a half a
million dollar contract. What are you talking

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.390
about? We don't have money. I'm telling you,
forget all these other chumps you're giving

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.250
50 to $100,000. Give this one guy a half a
million dollars and look what will happen.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.830
No! And then Michael comes, they talk. And
all Michael, he wanted was an exotic car,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.410
apparently in the negotiation ended up with
them giving him a half a million dollars for

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.510
two years, or a million dollars for two years,
and a Lamborghini or something. So Mike, he

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.300
signed a contract and then today, you know
what this [shoe] is going to make Mike be

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.880
worth in the next ten, fifteen, the number's
estimated 20 billion dollars in ten years.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.820
Imagination. This guy imagined what would
happen if we brought MJ to Nike to solve Nike

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:25.620
and Nike dominates everybody. And basketball
used to be Reebok. Basketball used to be Converse.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.670
Magic was Reebok. Wasn't Magic Reebok? Converse,
all these - nobody was looking at Nike as

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.140
basketball. And then it took off. Imagination.
So you don't necessarily have to be an entrepreneur

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.140
by the way. You can be working with an entrepreneur
in a company and you all of a sudden come

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.091
up with an idea like this that takes the business
to the next level. You're a big thinker. You're

00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:48.890
linked to a big thinker. It wouldn't happen
without you, because you're a big thinker,

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.890
right? So imagination.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.600
#7:
Next one. You've got to turn off the noise.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.540
You've got to turn off the noise. The noise
needs to be turned off. And I'm talking different

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.580
types of noises. One is too much social media
time with newsfeed, it's noise. Too much.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:07.610
I don't need it. Too much political stuff
right now, you think a big thinker is looking

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.740
at every single thing about Hillary Clinton
and she's doing this, did you know she did

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.049
this and did you know Trump did this and did
you know. . . They get bullet points in the

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:17.889
morning when they wake up because current
affairs, you've got to know what's going on

00:17:17.889 --> 00:17:21.579
with politics, if it's the country you're
living in. But if you go diving into it, then

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:26.649
you reading the conspiracy theories, Alex
Jones, and Rachel Maddox and all this other,

00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:31.940
oh my gosh, did you see what Anderson Cooper
said, or Sean Hannity. . . you're too much

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:38.629
into it. That's noise. Way too much noise.
Way too much noise. Clinton and Trump are

00:17:38.629 --> 00:17:42.970
not going to change your life. They're not.
They're not going to change your habits. They're

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.361
not going to make you better entrepreneur,
they're not going to make you sharper, they're

00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:49.929
not going to help you come up with better
ideas. They're actually going to consume your

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:52.850
mind with things you shouldn't be thinking
about that's going to piss you off. Because

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.879
regardless of who you support, you don't like
the other person. So the other person's going

00:17:55.879 --> 00:18:00.670
to piss you off nonstop. Turn off the noise.
Turn off the noise of negative friends, small

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.761
thinkers. Turn off the noise of family members
that don't support what you want to do. Don't

00:18:04.761 --> 00:18:08.130
even bring up the ideas in front of them.
Some of them you can't get away from. Some

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.441
of them are your parents. Some of them are
your brothers and sisters, siblings. Some

00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:14.799
of them could be a boyfriend, girlfriend.
Some of them could be your spouse. Some of

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:18.782
them could be your cousin. Turn it off and
if you know you bring up an idea it's going

00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:23.060
to go to negative time, do not bring it up
in front of them. Turn off the noise. Turn

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:29.409
off the noise. Stop any distractions, any
negativity, make time to think, about what

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:34.460
you could do to think bigger in the business,
in whatever company, whatever business you're

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.330
running, as a real estate agent, insurance
agent, as a technology, IT, it doesn't matter.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.379
What can you do to think bigger yourself to
be the dominant force in the company you're

00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:46.071
part of, in the business you're part of, in
the industry you're part of. What can you

00:18:46.071 --> 00:18:48.760
do? Think bigger. Right? Think bigger.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760
#8:

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.021
Next one, test the capacity of an idea. What
is the capacity of an idea? Take out a piece

00:18:54.021 --> 00:19:00.669
of paper and pen, or board and marker. Test
out the capacity of an idea. Okay, what would

00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:04.919
happen if this step. How big can this thing
get? It can get this big. How big is the market

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:10.970
for this? It's pretty big. How big can that
market be? How big's the market in New York?

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.999
23 million people. How big's the market in
LA? 4.2 million. How big is the market in

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:20.379
Houston? 3.8. Didn't they just pass Chicago?
Chicago's now 3.6 or something? That's a pretty

00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:24.909
big market. How big is this market for this?
What if we actually. . . what if we sell to

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:28.529
this market? What if we get into that market?
What if we got more people that were doing.

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:31.520
. . what if we got more people to sell the
product? What if we got somebody. . . what

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:42.870
if. . . Capacity's pretty good, if we do this.
But test the capacity. What if I take this

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.600
to even a whole different level? Remember,
Mark Zuckerberg wasn't necessarily a big thinker.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:57.529
He was a developer, a mind. The big thinker
where Facebook became what it is is who? What's

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:08.710
his name? Sean Parker. So Sean Parker was
played by who in that movie? Justin Timberlake.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.980
Sean Parker's the Nabster guy and he [Mark]
said, Man, I feel like we have a million dollar

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.590
opportunity. And Sean said, no, no, this is
a billion dollar opportunity. Right? And he

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.899
comes and sees the capacity, and he says,
what if we can get into this? What if this

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:27.129
is not just universities? What if this is
not just colleges? What if we go into Canada?

00:20:27.129 --> 00:20:32.220
What if we go into Europe? We haven't even
gone. . . what if, what if, what if? And man,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:40.520
he's got a point! What if? Boom! Today, 1.7
billion users on Facebook. Dominant over everybody.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.149
Zuckerberg's worth 50 something, Sean's worth
a few billion. A bunch of people made a bunch

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:54.860
of money, but everyone was thinking about
what can they do to test the capacity? So

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.730
everybody was testing the capacity of how
they can make it bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.320
A group of big thinkers that said, what if
we can make this thing even bigger? Test the

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.320
capacity.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.820
#9: Next, let the idea loose. Let the idea
loose a little bit. Let it loose. The Tasmanian

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.179
Devil needs to be let loose at times. You
can't lock up a Tasmanian Devil. You won't

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:17.320
know it's capacity. You've got to let him
lose at times. You got to let a great idea

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.960
loose at times and see what it leads to. It
could take you to places you never thought

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.419
you could get to, but you've got to let the
idea loose at times. You've got to let the

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:28.769
idea loose at times. And you'll see it spread.
It's kind of like test the capacity but let

00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:34.289
the idea loose. So imagination, you know,
test the capacity, let the idea loose, they're

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:37.999
all kind of somewhat together, but each one
of them I want to tell you so you kind of

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:39.879
understand the purpose of each one of them.

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:40.879
#10

00:21:40.879 --> 00:21:46.470
Next, curiosity. Ask a lot of questions. For
instance, I'm in an industry, I had a call

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:54.409
today with a very, very, very, very big company.
Let's just say a few hundred million dollars.

00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:58.179
We had a conference call today with them,
and they're very interested in what we're

00:21:58.179 --> 00:22:04.899
doing, and I brought up the idea to them on
what I want to do. And I was telling them

00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:08.960
all these ideas I have with what I'm thinking
about doing. And I started questioning certain

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:17.220
things. And, he's like, "Wow, it sounds like
you know the market pretty well. And we're

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.669
curious about this. Because we were curious,
we asked this question. When we asked this

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:24.519
question, we got this answer. And when we
asked this question, it made us research this

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:28.309
and this research brought us to another question
that led to another question and we got the

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:32.240
answer here. And then we also looked at this
here because we were curious what could happen

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.090
if we could do this, and we got stuck because
one question we couldn't answer and then we

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:40.840
figured this out, then we contacted the right
person, then the right attorney whose $1200

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.840
an hour, and then she introduced us to this
person, and we got this answer. But we were

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.750
curious. And we asked the right questions.
And so collectively, they're on the call,

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.600
now we're meeting, New York, big meeting,
etc. etc. and that could lead into a whole

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.879
different story, because we're curious on
how we can make an industry that I'm a part

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:06.440
of that's probably the most boring industry
in the world, the life insurance industry

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.330
that no one's paying attention to, but because
we're curious, we're finding ways to disrupt

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.650
this entire industry that I am in love with.
That people think, Pat, you're out of your

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.230
mind. How do you love life insurance? I LOVE
what we do, right? But we were curious. And

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.509
I'll get into a little bit more on that later
on in the video.

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:26.509
#11

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:30.490
Next, ask the question when you're thinking
big, why don't you. . . and answer it. And

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.429
I'm not just doing this motivational video,
Why not you! Why shouldn't you win! No, no.

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:40.249
Forget motivational. Let's get logical. Why
not you? Actually answer that. Why can't you

00:23:40.249 --> 00:23:45.390
be somebody that can do something in your
business that's never been done before? Why

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:52.220
not you? Answer it. So give the argument,
logically, here's why not me. Because I don't

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:58.649
work hard enough. You can fix that. Stop being
lazy. Well, whatever, but because I'm not

00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:04.999
that good in sales. You can learn sales. So,
okay, because, I don't know much about the

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:10.330
product. You can learn the product! But why
not you? Because no one in my family's been

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.690
rich. So what? No one was rich in Zuckerberg's
family before he became who he is today, and

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:20.021
nobody was in Job's. Job's mom even gave him
up for adoption. So, whatever, but. . . so

00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:29.850
why not you? Make your argument. Why not you?
Truly get into it. Then, give the other argument.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:37.970
Why not you actually doing this? Why shouldn't
you be the person? And say, I'm a very smart

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:44.320
person. I love people. I actually like to
make money to make a difference in the world.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.019
And you know what? I care for people. And
I have some things I want to do. If I get

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:53.249
money in my pocket, I'll be good with it.
And I've got a big heart, and I have talent

00:24:53.249 --> 00:24:59.070
and . . . And I know the right people. Boom!
That's why not you. Make both cases, as if

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.360
you're an attorney representing yourself.
One, why not you, meaning you shouldn't be

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.429
the person, and the other, why not you, meaning
you should be the person. Sell both of them.

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:11.840
And then see which argument wins. Something
tells me the argument on this side's going

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.529
to win. But make the argument. Take a sheet
of paper and make that argument. Why not you?

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:21.600
Question that a little bit. Who convinced
you you can't do it? Who convinced you you

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.510
can't be part of a group of people. I watched
so many guys on YouTube that, even some of

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.869
these guys are considered experts by big magazines
and they've written New York Times bestsellers

00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:39.530
and they say some shit like Oh, you know,
entrepreneurs are born. Give me a damn break!

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:44.840
Entrepreneurship can be taught. Entrepreneurship
is an inspiration that comes from here [belly]

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.850
that want to solve a big problem. What do
you mean entrepreneurship is something you're

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:54.289
born with? I completely disagree with that
statement. I fully disagree with that statement.

00:25:54.289 --> 00:26:00.869
Jumping 48"? That's God-given ability. You
can't do that. Entrepreneurship? It is a formula.

00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:04.330
If you hang around other people that think
like this, and you watch this video, and you

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.159
watch all of Valuetainment or some of the
people that are feeding the right type of

00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:13.309
content to you, and the right books you read,
your imagination won't stop working. Because

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:18.369
the entrepreneur is numbers, solving problems,
how can I do it better, faster? Why can't

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:24.980
you learn those skills? Why can't you? You
can. So why not you? And don't let anybody

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.230
convince you that people who solve some big
problems and are big thinkers have to be born

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.100
being big thinkers. I'm here to tell you you
can figure out the formula to thinking bigger.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.309
Don't let them convince you that these elite
people, sometimes I sit around with my friends

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:45.039
that are worth money as well. I'm around these
guys all the time. So now you know, hey Pat,

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:48.030
come around the meeting, we're going to have
some party with these billionaires. Okay great.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:53.450
I'm going with these guys. And, you know,
I was always special because. . . Oh my gosh,

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.869
stop it already. When you almost lost everything,
you did not think you were special. None of

00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:02.249
us do. And then we have our break, and we
win. You can do it as well.

00:27:02.249 --> 00:27:03.249
#12

00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:05.840
Next one, cut the fat. Cut the fat out of
your life. Let me tell you what I mean by

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:13.129
cut the fat. if video games is not how you're
planning making your money, cut the fat. If

00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:17.510
you have these three hobbies of you playing
badminton in Bakersfield or you're playing

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.179
ping pong or bowling league or all this other
stuff that's requiring nine hours of your

00:27:21.179 --> 00:27:29.119
time? Cut the fat! If you've got three girlfriends
or three boyfriends, cut the fat! If you party

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:34.869
at the nightclub three times a week, cut the
fat! If you're going out there, not taking

00:27:34.869 --> 00:27:39.489
life seriously and there's two bad habits
you have or vice that no one knows about?

00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:45.240
Cut the fat! It's hold you back from thinking
big. Stop it. It's not helping you out as

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.749
much as you think it is. Cut the fat. You
know exactly what I'm talking about. I don't

00:27:49.749 --> 00:27:52.259
need to explain it to you. You know what I'm
talking about. Think about it. You're thinking

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:55.669
about it right now. That thing you're thinking
about? Cut it! If you want to think big. It's

00:27:55.669 --> 00:28:00.890
holding you back. It's not worth it. I promise
you. Whatever thing that's giving you fulfillment,

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:05.029
it ain't going to give you as much fulfillment
as thinking big. I guarantee you that part.

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:08.270
It ain't going to give you as much fulfillment.
You've got to cut the fat.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.270
#13

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.150
Next is believers. Be around believers. Now
there's a part of this that's environment,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:17.710
but I'm talking about believers that believe
in your idea. You know, this could actually

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.299
happen. What if we could actually do this?
You know, what if we could actually pull this

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:26.499
off. You need believers. Just like Justin
Beiber has his fans, he calls them what? Believers.

00:28:26.499 --> 00:28:29.320
You need believers is what you need.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.779
#14:

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:38.789
Next, this one's a little technical, so I'm
going to try to explain it to you in a way,

00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:44.120
but it's a little bit technical. Momentum
vs. Resistance. Momentum vs. Resistance. What

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:53.659
is momentum vs. resistance? Big thinkers typically
have one of these two on their side. No one

00:28:53.659 --> 00:29:04.559
goes and takes the normal way out of being
a big thinker. It's either they get themselves

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:08.940
caught up in the momentum that's taking place
in their industry or they go absolutely against

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.320
resistance and they win, and they become a
hero. You want some points? I'll give you

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.139
some points. For instance, John F. Kennedy
had momentum. MLK went against resistance.

00:29:19.139 --> 00:29:23.009
Now both of them were assassinated. I'm not
telling you you're going to get assassinated.

00:29:23.009 --> 00:29:30.659
I'm telling you they both did something that
history favors both of them. JFK, MLK. JFK

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:38.830
had momentum, MLK had resistance. History
books, 2000 years from now, if Armageddon

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:43.230
doesn't happen and we're still around, and
our great, great, great grandkids are around?

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:50.139
They're going to know about JFK and they're
going to know about resistance, MLK. Let me

00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:56.759
continue. Today, on this [resistance] side,
you would have Elon Musk. Resistance. Why?

00:29:56.759 --> 00:30:04.760
You tell me the last time somebody broke into
the car market and gave Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.159
all these guys a run for their money. You
tell me the last time someone did that. Who?

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:14.049
Fisker? Fisker failed. Who else are you thinking
about? When was the last time? How many years?

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:18.950
No one has. Elon Musk went against resistance.
Let me get this straight, you're going to

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:23.120
create an electric car? And you're going to
take market away from these bigger guys? Yes.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:31.490
How are you planning on doing that? It's resistance.
He went against resistance. The other one,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:36.350
PayPal. Resistance. Why? No one's going to
trust - remember back in the days when people

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:39.499
didn't trust buying things online? I don't
trust giving my credit card information. Remember

00:30:39.499 --> 00:30:45.600
those days? Today, how often do you give your
credit card information online? They had resistance.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.399
There was resistance for it. Amazon was resistance.
You're going to stop selling books in bookstores?

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:58.629
No, no, no. Borders. No, no, no, Barnes &amp; Noble.
Resistance. He proved, he won. Almost went

00:30:58.629 --> 00:31:04.679
out of business, but he won. Now momentum.
Netflix is momentum. Someone says, that's

00:31:04.679 --> 00:31:10.269
almost resistance. No, it's momentum. Today
I watched a movie, what movie did I tell you

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:13.489
guys about that I was very impressed with?
The Accountant, with Ben Affleck. I'm not

00:31:13.489 --> 00:31:19.739
a Ben Affleck fan, but Ben Affleck did Good
Will Hunting, phenomenal and The Accountant,

00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:24.960
best movie of the year for me, phenomenal
movie, right? Right now, you know what momentum

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.100
is? Today is not making movies, it's making
episodic series, whatever you want to call

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:37.019
it. House of Cards or Narcos, give me some
of them. All these other things that are out

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:40.989
there. That's momentum. So people are, YouTube
wants to do that, you have Roku, you've got

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:47.130
Hulu, everybody. That's momentum. People are
in the momentum way. In mortgages in 2003,

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:52.049
2004, when mortgages were skyrocketing? Everybody
was getting into the pick a payment loan.

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:59.280
That was momentum. You're riding the momentum.
But in 2008, Big Short, the movie, that was

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.879
about what? Michael Lewis wrote it. That was
about resistance. Same industry, one way was

00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:09.309
momentum, the other one is resistance. They
said, No, this is going to collapse. Here's

00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:13.820
300 million dollars. You're out of your mind!
Goldman Sachs. Here's 300 million dollars.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:19.149
Yes, haha, he's an idiot. Resistance day one,
made a lot of money, millions of people lost

00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:24.049
their homes. Resistance. So what are you doing?
I'm in the resistance game. I'm in the life

00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:28.250
insurance business. I'm not in the momentum
business. I'm in the resistance business.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.549
I'm in the resistance business today. I'm
in the business that most people say, Oh,

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:36.450
I'm not going to get into insurance. I'm in
a business right now where the financial industry

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.820
regulation, regulation, regulation. I'm in
the resistance business. But here's what I

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.960
do know about the resistance business. I do
know 41% of Americans don't have any life

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.479
insurance. I do know 95 million adults today
don't have life insurance. I know we have

00:32:47.479 --> 00:32:51.580
the fewest amount of life insurance agents
we've ever had in America in a LONG time.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:59.830
Nearly 50 years. 50 years. I know what's happening
in the industry. There is resistance in our

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:06.200
industry. I know the industry lacks multi-cultural
agents. I know the industry's increasing in

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.879
multi-cultural clients that like to be sold
preferably by multi-cultural agents. I know

00:33:10.879 --> 00:33:15.179
the industry has resistance because 25 year
olds coming out of college are not turned

00:33:15.179 --> 00:33:19.690
on by the life insurance industry. We're doing
it. And we're very comfortable saying life

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.179
insurance. Our competitors are afraid. Don't
use the word, people don't like it. I don't

00:33:23.179 --> 00:33:29.630
care if you don't like it. I love the industry.
Resistance. Resistance. I know people buy

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:35.179
shoes, cars, homes, clothes, no one buys life
insurance. Life insurance is so. . . it's

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:40.399
resistance, I know it. But I see a massive
opportunity with it, because I see exactly

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:44.140
what's going on with the industry. I chose
resistance. You don't have to choose resistance.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.789
There's momentum, there's resistance. You
choose which one you want to be a part of.

00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:54.100
And by the way, I can go on right now VR,
virtual reality is the hot thing right now.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.460
Hot thing, virtual reality. You've got offense
[momentum], you've got defense [resistance].

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.830
You can put it up the way you want to put
it up, but you've got offense, defense, I

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:08.549
already covered a bunch of these things I
have here. Momentum vs. resistance.

00:34:08.549 --> 00:34:13.530
How is your business going to be part of either
one of these things? Is it going to be momentum

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.560
or is it going to be resistance? Big thinkers
figure one of these two out. You know, if

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.280
we do this, what if this thing gets like this,
there's momentum. You know there's so many

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.970
problems in our industry, what if we actually
solve it. We're heroes. Resistance. Which

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:31.109
one do you want? Big thinkers chooses one
of these. Make a list of it, in your company,

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:36.460
in your field, in your industry, in your profession
you've chosen to be part of. Which of them

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:42.609
do you want to be part of? You can choose
either. I chose resistance, many choose momentum.

00:34:42.609 --> 00:34:43.609
You can choose your own.

00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:44.609
Let me continue.

00:34:44.609 --> 00:34:45.609
#15

00:34:45.609 --> 00:34:50.619
Next, look where no one's looking. Look where
no one's looking. I've said this so many times.

00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:57.260
You go to a bar, men, when you go to a bar,
who is everybody looking at at that bar or

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.790
nightclub? Who? The hottest girl in the club.
And everyone knows which one it is. It's the

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.869
girl in the green dress. Everyone's checking
her out. And guess who's around her? Everybody.

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:10.559
You know what your odds are? If there's 500
men in that nightclub, there's one of her,

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:15.300
it's one to 500. Do you know what those percentages
are? .2% chance she's going to say yes to

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.680
you. Do you want those kinds of odds? You
don't want those kinds of odds. Go find the

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.590
eight, and look what happens with the eight.
The eight has only 30 men looking at her.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:29.299
You're one of them. You've got a 3% chance.
It's higher chances. Go look at places that

00:35:29.299 --> 00:35:34.079
no one's looking at and see who's more interesting.
It's not always the sexiest thing on the outside

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.980
that's the best company to be a part of, or
the best industry to be a part of. Sometimes

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.099
it's where no one's looking. Everyone's going
here [left]. You go here [right]. Everybody

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:49.400
and their mother's joining this incredible
next movement that's going to be the revolution

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.410
of . . . that's great. Let them go. You go
look at something no one's looking at. Massive

00:35:54.410 --> 00:36:00.839
opportunity. Blue Ocean, Red Ocean. Shark
infested market everyone's biting, killing

00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:04.089
each other, there's only a couple of sharks
you're dealing with. You can actually negotiate

00:36:04.089 --> 00:36:06.340
with those sharks and say, hey listen, I've
got a big bite. You want to share this? Yeah.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.720
Here's a bite for you, here's a bit for me.
Cool? Pepsi, Coke. Big market. You take some,

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.100
I'll take some. Are we cool? We're cool. But
only two. Everybody else wants to fight for,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.670
why? Everyone wants to fight for, you know,
beer. Look, dude, what do you want? You're

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:28.180
a big shark, I'm a big shark. Yea, go eat
the food. I'll give you some. Here's yours.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.490
Fine. Let's go do it. Go where no one's looking.
It's so much easier.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.490
#16

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.140
Next, deliberately forbid conventional solutions.
Stop thinking about the conventional way of

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.000
doing things. No, you've got to be an out
of the box thinker. You've got to be an out

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.770
of the box thinker. You can't think about
every single way everybody else wants to solve

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:48.430
that problem. Drop conventional thinking.
Big thinkers kind of look at it different

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:53.320
ways. They stick to it and they don't constantly
change all the time, because once something

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.670
works, you stick to it, and then when you
have to make certain adjustments or adapting,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.410
all that other, you don't make overhauls,
because when you make overhauls, man, it hurts

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:08.829
you. But you make adjustments. Some say Tiger
Woods could have beaten Jack Nicholas' record

00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:14.020
of the most masters if he wouldn't have dramatically
changed his swing, when he did. That took

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.440
his game back two to three years, and then
he got hurt, because it was a major shift.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.970
And I know people say the knee, the back,
all this other stuff, but he could have won

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.030
most masters, because it was goo dramatic
of a shift. There's a lot of motivational

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:28.780
speakers that like to say, you know, look
what Tiger did, and he made the shift, even

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.970
in. . . I get it. It probably validates an
argument that person's trying to make at that

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.890
time. But sometimes when something works,
work it, but while you're going to your game

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:42.700
plan, try all the other unconventional way
of solving that problem that industry or company

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.920
or the product is facing.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.680
So what do you do now? Let's say you have
your plan in place. What do you do now? Now

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.109
you've got to work backwards. So think big.
Where do I see myself being 10 years from

00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:54.700
now in this business, in this company, in
this industry? Put a 10-year plan. How about

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.101
five years? Then three, then one, then six
months, then three months. Then today, put

00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:05.329
a one, two, three plan together. Today I need
to focus on one this, two this, three this.

00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:08.490
Everything needs to be tied to a number. Why?
Because big thinking has to do with what?

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:14.809
It's the first thing I said - math. So everything
is math. You notice numbers here. It's math.

00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:19.530
Put your numbers together, start thinking
bigger, and next thing you know, you'll actually

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:24.150
say, you know what this big thinking stuff
is not as difficult as I thought it was. But

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:28.819
I hope you take this whole message very seriously
on how to think big. And I wanted to give

00:38:28.819 --> 00:38:34.839
it to you in a way that most people, you know,
the typical traditional things you read on

00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:39.980
magazines that, set goals, you know, do this.
I want to give you a completely different

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.750
way of thinking about bigger that some of
the other outlets don't talk about. But my

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:49.329
challenge to you is don't make this about
you. Make it about a bigger cause, the world

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:54.650
is depending on you to think big, and solve
problems today more than ever. And like I

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.880
said earlier, it is easier today to think
bigger than ever before.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:03.049
Mario, let me get my pillow here. By the way,
some of you guys, Mario wanted me to send

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:07.360
a message to you guys and thank you guys for
the most incredible heartfelt messages you

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:15.510
guys have been sending him about Street Team.
Mario's so thankful about all the messages.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:19.490
I love you! If you haven't seen them, don't
worry about it, but Mario's been getting a

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:23.080
lot of love from people that watch Street
Team. Paul, you're part of that as well, so

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.930
I've got to throw you in that, too. You're
part of that as well. They're trying to figure

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.750
out and see what's going to happen with Street
Team. We're going to be launching a lot of

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:32.820
new stuff here soon, so stay tuned. If you

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.810

asking for $8,000 or $6,000 or $10,000 or
$5,000. Free content that we have here.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.089
Mario: We have the contest videos.

00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:05.950
Patrick: That's right. By the way, for some
of you guys, when we did the 100,000, if you

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:10.640
haven't posted your video yet, October 25
is the last day to post your video. We already

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.970
have a ton of people that have posted, and
Mario's put the top 15 or 16 playlist that

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.130
you can see. Just go on YouTube and type,
"Why I love Valuetainment." You'll see a bunch

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.751

We're going to choose three of them, where

00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:27.690
you'll fly in here to Dallas, Texas, and you
and I will get some one-on-one time for three

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:32.700
hours for me to do the business planning with
you for your business in 2017, but only three

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.500
of you will be chosen to come here and spend
some time with us. So if you haven't submitted

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:41.460
it yet, you can also email Mario. Why don't
I give them your email address - marketing@patrickbetdavid.com

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.430
- Paul, let's put that email address here,
marketing@patrickbetdavid.com. He'll get back
