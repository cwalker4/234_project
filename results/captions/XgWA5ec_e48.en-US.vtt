00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
Tom Cruise is one of the world’s most famous
people, but he keeps his offscreen life extremely

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.460
private— and that goes for his three kids
too.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.360
“He loves all his children,” a source
said. “And each of them has a right to their

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.750
own story.”

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.660
Isabella Jane Cruise.
Isabella Jane Cruise was born on December

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.940
22, 1992 in Miami, Florida.
Since Isabella’s biological mother could

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.899
not take care of her because of financial
constraints, she was adopted by Tom and Nicole

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.859
from a hospital in Miami. Tom and Nicole knew
Isabella’s biological mother as she was

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.160
associated with the ‘Church of Scientology,’
a multinational network which Tom and Nicole

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.769
were a part of.
The then celebrity couple was going through

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.180
a tough time as they were dealing with Nicole’s
miscarriage. They then decided to go for an

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.131
adoption, and with the help of the authorities
from the ‘Church of Scientology,’ they

00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:09.500
legally adopted Isabella. She brought a ray
of hope into Tom and Nicole’s traumatic

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.620
relationship. Nicole formed a strong bond
with her daughter and the bond strengthened

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.360
over the next few years.
Nicole and Tom got divorced when Isabella

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.280
was just nine years old. The divorce left
Isabella devastated and strained her relationship

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.200
with her parents. She severed her ties with
Nicole and even stopped calling her ‘Mom.’

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.510
Scientology played a major role in causing
problems in their relationship. A few scientologists

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.910
called Nicole a ‘suppressive person’ and
blamed her for her tumultuous relationship

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.690
with Tom and her children.
Isabella then developed a cordial relationship

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.130
with her father’s third wife, Katie Holmes.
In an interview, which was given right before

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.260
his wedding with Katie, Tom thanked his children,
Isabella and Connor, for being supportive

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.360
and for welcoming Katie into their life. Unfortunately,
that relationship too, was short-lived as

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.510
Isabella moved to Britain right after Tom
and Katie ended their marriage in 2012.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.590
However, Isabella maintains a cordial relationship
with her father. The father-daughter duo is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.379
often seen spending quality time with each
other. Isabella surprised many when she got

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.390
married to an IT consultant named Max Parker
in 2015. The absence of Tom Cruise and Nicole

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.579
Kidman in her wedding sparked off many speculations.
Though Tom took care of the wedding expense,

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.400
he kept himself away from the ceremony. Nicole,
on the other hand, was not even informed about

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.590
the wedding. In 2016, Nicole had an emotional
reunion with her daughter and met her son-in-law

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.219
for the first time. In 2018, Isabella paid
tribute to Nicole by including her mother’s

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:56.959
name in her newly launched fashion line.
As a kid, Isabella aspired to become a screenplay

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.380
writer. However, Tom and Nicole kept Isabella
away from the blinding glamour of Hollywood.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.220
They never took her to any events or premier
shows. Since she was homeschooled, she did

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.959
not get the opportunity to attend a regular
school.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.120
For her higher studies, Isabella was sent
to London, where she studied art. She then

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.980
completed a 12-month diploma in professional
hairdressing at ‘Sassoon Academy.’ By

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.540
then, she had gained considerable knowledge
and experience in hairstyling and make-up.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.599
She joined the prestigious ‘Delamar Academy
of Make-up &amp; Hair’ at Ealing Studios in

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.010
London. She is now focusing on starting her
own chain of styling and make-up academies.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.849
Isabella is happily married to Max Parker
and lives in a semi-detached house in Croydon,

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.090
London. She moved into her new home, along
with her husband in 2017. She has opted for

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.250
a modest lifestyle instead of leading a lavish
life in Los Angeles. She has also declined

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.700
financial support from her parents. In fact,
Isabella and Max were seen moving into their

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.019
new home without any professional help. It
certainly looks like the couple has decided

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.860
to lead a simple and happy life.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.850
Connor Cruise.
Connor Cruise was born on January 17, 1995,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.780
in Florida.
Connor was four months old when he was adopted

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.810
by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. No information
about Connor’s biological parents is available.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.500
According to a few sources, Tom and Nicole
adopted Connor to save their marriage, which

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.199
was in jeopardy because of their personal
and emotional differences.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.290
Connor was unaware of his adoption as he was
not informed about it by his parents. When

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.860
he had asked about his skin color, he was
told that he had inherited the traits of Nicole's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.070
ancestors from Australia. In 2012, during
a news conference of his film ‘Red Dawn,’

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.550
a reporter asked him about his biological
parents. A confused Connor turned towards

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.400
his father for an explanation, and thereafter
the truth was revealed to him.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.449
Prior to this incident, everyone was under
the impression that Connor knew about his

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.370
adoption. Connor later stated that his newly
acquired knowledge would not affect his relationship

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.550
with his parents. But the damage had already
been done as he confessed that many of his

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.650
unanswered questions were now answered and
that a few things which had been bothering

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.200
him were cleared out of his head.
In fact, he went on to say that things like

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.280
Nicole making little efforts to get her son's
custody during her divorce and Tom's inability

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.921
to love him the way he loves his biological
daughter, Suri, made more sense to him. All

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.220
these statements explained a lot about his
strained relationship with his father and

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.879
mother.
Connor was homeschooled by his aunt. He was

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:52.800
later enrolled at a Scientology School. Initially,
he disliked the idea as he did not support

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.509
the philosophies of ‘The Church of Scientology.’
But later on in his life, he too, became a

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.919
scientologist, just like his sister and father.
He also completed his high school education

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.830
from a Scientology School.
Unlike his sister Isabella, Connor was exposed

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.319
to the film industry right from his childhood.
Connor enjoyed hogging the limelight so much

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:21.100
so that he decided to pursue a career in the
field of entertainment. Interestingly, a career

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:28.040
in acting was not always his preferred choice.
When he was a kid, he wanted to become a pilot.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.010
When he expressed his desire to his father,
Tom started taking him to various flying clubs.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:40.110
As Connor grew up, he shifted his focus to
acting. In 2008, he got his first acting break

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.729
when he portrayed the younger version of Ben
Thomas in the film ‘Seven Pounds.’ Next,

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.250
he was seen in a minor role in the 2012 film
‘Red Dawn.’

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.879
When Connor was moving ahead with his acting
career, he developed a passion for music,

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:00.379
which led him to shift his attention towards
DJing. His discography includes a remix of

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:05.289
the popular track ‘Feed Me Diamonds,’
which was released by ‘Ultra Records.’

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.629
Post its release, the track was played in
‘The David Letterman Show.’

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.879
Connor has collaborated with many popular
artists like Andy Caldwell, The Black Eyed

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:20.939
Peas, and The Veronicas. Another hit track
composed by Conner is titled ‘Refined.’

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:27.100
On October 26, 2011, he performed at ‘Nickelodeon's
TeenNick HALO Awards,’ which was held at

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.000
the Hollywood Palladium. Connor is now better
known by his stage name ‘DJ C-Squared’

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.159
and is currently working on several collaborative
albums.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:42.380
Connor was in a relationship with a surfer
and fishing expert named Phylicia Bugna. He

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:48.600
broke up with her in 2017 over religious differences.
He was rumored to be dating his childhood

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.080
friend, Lillie Parker.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.689
Suri Cruise.
Suri Cruise was born on April 18, 2006 at

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:01.250
Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica,
California.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:06.930
Even before Suri Cruise was born, the international
media was obsessed with gossips over her expected

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.340
birth. While rumors were abound around the
high-profile relationship between her parents

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.950
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes since they were
spotted together for the first time in 2004,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:23.659
after they made it official, Katie's pregnancy
became the new spotlight of various tabloids.

00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:28.650
It was partially fuelled by Tom himself who
revealed that he had purchased a pricey sonogram

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:35.700
machine for on-demand tracking of fetus Suri's
development. Her birth in April 2006 was extensively

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.990
covered in the media. An infant Suri made
her first media appearance, along with her

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:46.610
parents Tom and Katie, on the cover of the
2006 issue of the 'Vanity Fair' magazine,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.810
which sold more than 70,000 copies. Since
then, media outlets have constantly reported

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.500
on every detail about the little celebrity,
from her uncanny similarities to her mother

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.350
to her incredible fashion sense even as a
child.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.510
In 2012, she began attending a new prestigious
$40,000 per year school in Manhattan which

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:13.040
opened in fall that year. She also trains
in ballet and gymnastics.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.930
After five and a half years, her mother filed
for divorce on June 29, 2012, and a settlement

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.180
was reached on July 9, 2012.
It was widely reported that Suri Cruise's

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.220
mother filed for divorce from Tom Cruise because
she feared that Cruise would abduct Suri,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:35.130
and also felt intimidated by the Church of
Scientology. Cruise later accepted to lawyers

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.610
that one of the reasons Katie sought divorce
was because she wanted to protect Suri from

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.029
the controversial religion he practices. He
also revealed that his daughter was no more

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:50.410
a practicing member of the religion. According
to the doctrines of the "space-alien cult",

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.840
those who leave the religion are disowned
by the church, branded as 'Suppressive Persons',

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.000
and are prohibited from meeting even close
family members. Apparently, the church made

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.810
an exception for its renowned celebrity member
Tom. However, it was reported in September

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:11.240
2017, that Tom has not seen his daughter in
the past four years since August 2012.
