00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.200
you've seen the movies whether we're
beaming up Scotty

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.019
or using a portkey modern fiction is
full of teleportation but that's all it

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.600
is fiction right
well maybe not it turns out that human

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.880
history is full of examples of real-life
teleportation and scientists have even

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
achieved quantum teleportation in the
laboratory but is human teleportation

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.350
even possible and if so how often does
it happen prepare to be surprised in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.879
this video we'll take a look at five
strange and mysterious real-life cases

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.010
of teleportation every story you're
about to hear has been well documented

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.610
and has baffled scientists and mystery
lovers alike brace yourself because the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.399
teleportation cases in this video will
stick in your head and drive you crazy

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:08.640
are you ready
good let's go Gil Perez Mexico City

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.720
October 25th 1593 we know about this one
from the country's official records and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060
while you might not trust 400 year old
paperwork I think you'll find the case

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.450
compelling on that seemingly innocent
October morning a group of soldiers were

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
standing guard outside the palace but
there was something strange about one of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.200
the guards he was wearing a foreign
uniform and wielding a different type of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
musket to the rest of the soldiers he
looked confused

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.530
so authorities took him in to ask him a
few questions questions like who are you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.149
and what are you doing here
the man replied to say my name is Gil

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.380
Perez I was ordered this morning to
mount guard at the doors of the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.180
governor's palace in Manila I know very
well this is not the governor's palace

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.650
and evidently I am NOT in Manila why or
how that may be I do not know

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.660
but here I am and this is a palace of
some kind so I am doing my duty as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.110
nearly as possible Manila and Mexico
City are nearly 9,000 miles apart

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.040
on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean
Perez and the authorities couldn't

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.110
understand what he was doing there
the man was later jailed for two months

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.630
until the ship from Manila docked in the
city

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.790
the soldiers on board the ship knew
Perez and were able to confirm that he

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.220
was in Manila the day before his
ill-fated visit to Mexico City but in a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.040
time before powered flight
how did Perez travel so far so quickly

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.330
and why did he have no memory of the
journey perhaps it will have to remain a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:03.050
mystery dr. Geraldo Vidal this
well-known account of teleportation

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.340
comes to us courtesy of doctor Geraldo
Vidal and his wife

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.989
Bravo David Alma in 1968 the husband and
wife duo were driving their Pujo 403

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.970
along a remote Road near boyos Aires
Argentina when they were suddenly

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.340
surrounded by a thick fog everything
went black and the Vidal's were rendered

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.739
unconscious meanwhile concerned friends
and family members called the police and

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.010
launched a search but it turned up no
trace of the husband and wife luckily

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.330
this story has a happy ending a full 48
hours later

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.340
Geraldo Vidal called his family to let
them know that he was safe but that he

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.070
and his wife were in Mexico City around
4,000 miles away they had no idea how

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.210
they got there
it later transpired that Vidal and his

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.900
wife regained consciousness while parked
along a road that they've never seen

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.130
before
they both had sore necks and felt like

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.560
they'd spent a long time asleep the car
had been badly burned somehow but it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.460
started up okay and the couple drove
around until they found someone who

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.200
could tell them where they were no
explanation has been found for what

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:28.100
happened to the Vidal's on that
mysterious day in the 1960s Luci J we're

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.770
back in the 60s again but this time were
headed to the 1800s to meet a 13-year

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.690
old girl who's known only as Lucy J by
1865 Lucy had demonstrated a whole heap

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.780
of unusual powers once when falling ill
she used her skills as a medium to

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.690
contact spirits in search of a cure she
followed out the instructions that were

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.950
provided through automatic writing and
the cure was successful and nursed her

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.390
back to health
Lucy was also able to generate beautiful

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.890
flowers and stunning smells from out of
nowhere and she was said to have the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.230
ability to make objects appear and
disappear will but it wasn't just

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.690
objects in Lucy could teleport according
to testimonies from the time she was

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.040
also able to blink in and out of
existence often returning with strange

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.090
objects from faraway places one
researcher who studied her John s Ladd

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.110
described Lucy's teleportation in detail
saying her reappearance was

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.470
instantaneous
in the twinkling of an eye she stood

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.700
before you fresh and blooming and
without any indications of exhaustion

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.060
although her absence may have been from
the morning into the evening

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.610
no scientific explanation for Lucy's
mysterious abilities has ever been

00:05:50.610 --> 00:06:01.380
provided David Lange a strange case of
David Lange could easily be filed as a

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.000
mysterious disappearance if not for a
few subtle factors that make this case

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.740
unique back in 1880 the farmer was out
in the fields when he suddenly

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.070
disappeared into thin air in plain view
of five witnesses his wife Emma his two

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.940
children George and Sara and two of
their household servants were all

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.860
looking in Lang's direction when he
vanished mid-step perhaps the

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.850
understandably Lang's wife screamed at
his sudden disappearance and the five

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.590
witnesses rushed over to look for him
but even when they widen the search and

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.580
called for reinforcements stamping the
ground to find any holes that Lange

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.370
might have fallen into they were unable
to find any trace of him but the mystery

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.479
doesn't end there
months after his disappearance Lang's

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.750
children noticed something strange in
the grass where their father had been

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.940
standing it had turned a mysterious
yellow color and formed a perfect circle

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.120
that was 15 feet in diameter stranger
still when Sara called her father's name

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.729
both of the children heard a response
the voice of David Lang faintly calling

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:14.310
for help over and over until his voice
died away and disappeared so exactly

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:21.560
what happened perhaps we'll never know
and it will always remain a mystery

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:31.839
the mysterious man from to read the year
was 1954 and on a normal day a normal

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.629
man boarded a normal flight but when he
arrived at Tokyo International Airport

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:43.180
the normality was replaced by something
a little bit more mysterious when the

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.589
man whose name is unknown and so we'll
call him mister II handed over his

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:53.710
passport authorities noticed something
suspicious the passport looked authentic

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.419
enough but it listed his country of
origin as a mysterious place called

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:05.349
tourette unfortunately for mr. II no
such place existed when they asked him

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:10.689
to show them on a map he pointed to the
principality of andorra but the man

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:14.349
insisted that he'd never heard of
Andorra and that his home nation was

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:19.629
over a thousand years old
weirder still he told them that he was

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:23.469
flying to Japan for business explaining
that he'd been doing so for the last

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:29.319
five years as proof he showed them his
passport which was covered in customs

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:34.990
and visa stands from his travels he also
carried legal currency from various

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:40.860
countries and even a driver's license
that was issued by the torrid government

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.510
the mystery was never solved after a
prolonged interrogation

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.250
the man from torrid was sent to a nearby
hotel where he was guarded by two

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.769
immigration officers the following
morning after spending the night outside

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:02.170
the door the officers went into the
hotel room and discovered the mystery

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.569
had vanished without a trace
could he have teleported back to some

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:13.090
parallel dimension one thing's for sure
it wouldn't have been easy for him to

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:18.850
escape the hotel the only exit was a
15th storey window that overlooked a

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:25.630
busy street and no one had seen any sign
of an escape attempt there are also no

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.930
clues as to where the man is now perhaps
he made it back to his native tourette

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:37.780
wherever that is what do you think about
these mysteries and if you could

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.930
teleport anywhere where would you choose
to go let us know with a comment and be

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.740
