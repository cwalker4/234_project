00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.960
Donald Trump is here tonight...

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.320
Now I know that he's taken some flak lately, but...

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.900
No one is happier, no one is prouder to put
this birth certificate matter to rest

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.880
than the Donald. And that's because he
can finally get back to focusing

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.980
on the issues that matter. Like...

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.320
Did we fake the moon landing?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000
What really happened in Roswell?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.240
And where are Biggie and Tupac?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.260
All kidding aside obviously we all know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.820
about your credentials and breadth of
experience...

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.500
For example.. No, seriously just recently

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.420
in an episode of Celebrity
Apprentice at the steak house...

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.500
The Men's cooking team did not impress the judges
from Omaha Steaks.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.260
And there was a lot of blame to go around,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.000
but you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the
real problem was a lack of leadership

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.920
and so ultimately you didn't blame
little Jon or meatloaf...

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.420
You fired Gary Busey.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.840
and these are the kind of decisions that
would keep me up at night.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.500
Well handled, sir! Well handled!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.660
Say what you will about Mr. Trump he
certainly would bring some change to the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.460
White House. Let's see what we've got up there..

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.400
Sitting at the same table, I see Mike
Bloomberg.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.520
Mike, a combative controversial

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.620
New York billionaire is leading the GOP
primary

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.540
and it is not you!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.000
That has to sting a little bit.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.820
Although, it's not an entirely fair
comparison between you and the Donald.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.040
After all, Mike was a big-city mayor...

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.620
He knows policy in-depth...

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.200
And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is!

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.180
Well let me conclude tonight on a more serious note.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.720
I want to thank the Washington Press Corps.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.260
I want to thank Carol for all that you do.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.820
You know, the Free Press is central to our democracy, and...

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.000
Nah! I'm just kidding!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.980
You know I've got to talk about Trump!

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.480
Come on!

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.800
We weren't just gonna stop there!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.060
Come on!

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.340
Although I am a little hurt that he's
not here tonight!

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.760
We had so much fun the last time!

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.500
And it is surprising. You've
got a room full of Reporters, Celebrities,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.500
Cameras, and he says no.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.880
Is this dinner
too tacky for the Donald?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.780
What could he possibly be doing instead?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.520
Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.700
Tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.580
What's he doing?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.020
The Republican establishment is
incredulous

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.140
that he's their most likely nominee. Incredulous! Shocking!

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.780
They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be President.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.980
But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world...

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.600
Miss Sweden,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.540
Miss Argentina,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.580
Miss Azerbaijan!

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.659
And there's one area where Donald's
experience could be invaluable...

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.840
and that's closing Guantanamo because Trump
knows a thing or two about

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.680
running waterfront properties into the ground.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:04.400
all right that's probably enough I mean
we've got more material no no I don't

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.940
want to spend too much time on the
Donald following your lead I want to

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.469
show some restraint because I think we
can all agree that from the start he's

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.849
gotten the appropriate amount of
coverage befitting the seriousness of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:28.570
his candidacy I hope you all are proud
of yourselves

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.220
the guy wanted to give this hotel
business a boost and now we're praying

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.560
that Cleveland makes it through July

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:58.710
mm-hmm it's not the fault of immigrants
or unions or some liberal socialist

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.980
scheme it's very simple Republicans in
Congress and Republican governors have

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:17.430
been blocking these ideas for the last
eight years is that simple so so look I

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.450
just want to be clear not everybody
votes on the economy I understand there

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.630
are other issues but if your concern is
who's going to look out for working

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.920
families if you're voting your
pocketbook

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.060
if you're asking who's actually going to
stand up for the guy on the construction

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:47.390
site or the guy in in the factory or the
woman who's cleaning a hotel room or or

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.420
just somebody who's really working hard
the working family if that's your

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.890
concern
this isn't even a choice because the

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.630
other side has nothing off for you

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:14.879
the other side's got nothing on for you

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.370
I'm going a little off script here but I
just want to repeat this if your concern

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:32.890
is working people then this is not a
choice I don't care whether you're white

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:42.010
black Hispanic Native American polka dot
male/female care if what you care is

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.110
who's going to be fighting for ordinary
folks who are fighting for a better life

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.120
for themselves and their children then I
don't know how you vote for the guy

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:01.030
who's against a minimum wage against
unions against making sure that

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:07.420
everybody gets a fair shot against
legislation for equal pay against sick

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.340
leave and and family leave it against
all the things that working families

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:20.680
care about so if you're voting for the
other team it's not because of the

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:34.779
economy it's not because of the economy
you got to be got to be clear about that

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:41.690
I'm either even even if even there even
the Republicans on the other side don't

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:50.269
really know what the guy's talking about
they really don't they really don't you

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:58.240
ask him they're all like I don't know
then they've gotta duck the other way i

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.500
am i joking no so so you can choose a
path that divides us with harsh rhetoric

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.470
and pits working people against each
other

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:17.769
all the while pushing policies that will
just help folks at the top doing better

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:25.490
but that's not helping working families
or we can transform our politics so

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:30.320
they're responsive to working families
so that all people of all races and all

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:37.730
backgrounds does get a higher wage and
all folks get quality health care at a

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.970
decent retirement and all children in
this country get a better education that

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.380
lets them dream bigger than their
circumstances that's what Hillary

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.769
Clinton believes and that's why I'm
supporting her for president the United

00:09:51.769 --> 00:10:04.560
States and that's why you should too

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.990
now that to me that in and of itself
would be enough to make the choice but

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.860
we've got some other choices you can go
the path that denies climate change is

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:26.590
real or you can choose a path where
American jobs and businesses lead the

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.640
world to combat it you know over the
last seven years we have doubled

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:38.110
renewable energy in this country we
remember remember when we were all

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.340
concerned about our dependence on
foreign oil well let me tell you we've

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:50.140
cut the amount of oil we buy from other
countries in half remember when the

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.730
other team was promising they were going
to get gas prices down in like ten years

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:06.520
and we did it did it so so we've been
able to shape an energy policy that's

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.790
good for families good for your
pocketbook and with secretary Clinton's

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:16.720
help America ultimately led nearly 200
other nations to an agreement to save

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.410
this planet for future generations

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:28.209
maybe maybe you don't care about this
maybe you think ninety-nine percent of

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:37.410
scientists are wrong or you can welcome

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.639
but but but the point is we're not done
with this so where we go from here is up

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:46.179
to you you can vote with the climate
deniers who want to tear up the

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:50.589
agreements we've crafted and doom our
kids to a more dangerous world or you

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:55.119
can vote to keep putting people back to
work building a cleaner energy future

00:11:55.119 --> 00:11:59.920
for all of us that's part of what's at
stake in this in this election that's

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.790
one of the reasons I'm supporting
Hillary Clinton for president you know

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:12.069
Hillary mentioned how we operate on the
world stage

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:16.149
now let me just say I know the other
guys talks about making America great

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:25.510
again I America is really great

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.580
and just the other day somebody was
writing about wow when you look at the

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:37.130
surveys in the world turns out that when
Obama came enough is the world didn't

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:45.920
think we were that great but now they
think we're the greatest but then we're

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.750
the strongest they think we're the best
position we we were in a hole before I

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.600
came into office but right now the world
the rest of the world thinks we're

00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:01.970
pretty darn great and by the way you can
look that up that that's effect that's

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:08.060
not like just something I just made up
and tweet it so you know they're

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.610
actually like surveys done they pull
people so you actually know what people

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.590
think you don't just assert it and it
turns out that's what they think you can

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.920
look it up
