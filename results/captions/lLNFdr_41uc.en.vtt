00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.590
The clone wars acted pretty much like a galactic
civil war, splitting up the entire galaxy

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.970
into two halves, among the republic loyalists
and the separatists.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.640
Once the war became official, scores of republic
citizens fled to separatist space to fight

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
for their cause, ranging from everyday people
to former republic senators.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.349
Even some Jedi left the Republic and joined
the Separatist Alliance, both for political

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.369
reasons, and even to learn the dark side from
Count Dooku himself.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.150
Such former Jedi that served Dooku were known
as Dark Acolytes.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.380
So who were these Jedi?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.820
One of the first Jedi to join Dooku was Kadrian
Sey.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.320
She was a Zabrak Jedi Knight, who was assigned
long term missions in the outer rim.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.410
While in the outer rim, she found herself
in the middle of the separatist crisis, which

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.899
was a series of movements across multiple
planets that sought to free themselves from

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.360
the Republic’s corrupt grip and become independent.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.539
Supposedly she herself was swayed by the cries
of these people, as when the Jedi called her

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.360
back to join them against the separatists,
she refused and abandoned the Jedi ways.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.840
She instead decided to join the enemy of the
Jedi, Count Dooku, who happily welcomed her

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.909
to his movement and made her one of the first
dark acolytes.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
After being taught the dark side of the force
and constructing her red lightsaber, she became

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.000
one of Dooku’s trusted bodyguards.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.119
She didn’t really do much, other than get
killed by Quinlan Vos when he revealed to

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.600
everyone present that he was an undercover
Republic agent.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.610
Next is Tol Skorr.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.110
Like most Jedi, Skorr was taken in by the
Jedi at a young age and was taught in the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.400
ways of the jedi.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.799
He eventually achieved the rank of Jedi knight,
and was granted the title of General during

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.850
the start of the Clone Wars.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.299
During one of his first missions in the clone
wars, he was shot down in a dogfight and almost

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.969
died on Korriban before being rescued by Count
Dooku.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.670
Grateful in having his life saved, Skorr pledged
his allegiance to Dooku and fell to the dark

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.680
side after he was trained by the Sith Lord.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.140
After constructing his new red lightsaber,
he served Dooku mostly as a bodyguard and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.469
as an assassin.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.760
He was sent in one mission to Korriban along
with Quinlan Vos to retrieve a sith holocron

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.140
known as the Holocron of Heresies.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.880
Later, Skorr, along with ventress, was assigned
to kill Quinlan Vos due to his apparent failures.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.889
The two dark acolytes tracked Vos down, but
were met with another Jedi, Obi Wan Kenobi.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.760
After many duels among the four, the two Jedi
were able to escape.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.600
After his failure to kill Vos, Skorr was assigned
to oversee a secret Separatist project on

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.970
Saleucami.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.669
During the battle of Saleucami, Skorr was
killed by Vos after the enraged Jedi force

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.330
pushed Skorr to his death.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.109
Next is Sora Bulq.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.739
He was a Jedi Master who was extremely talented
with the lightsaber, being able to compete

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.220
with even Mace Windu on some level.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.680
Because of this skill, he was one of the main
lightsaber instructors in the Jedi temple.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.560
Outside of his Jedi affairs, he grew to become
disappointed with the Galactic Republic, frustrated

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.350
with seeing it become consumed in corruption.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.370
When the time came, Bulq answered the call
and joined the Jedi strike team to capture

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.609
the separatist leaders on Geonosis.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.870
Although he fought in the arena, he never
fought in the battle that took place after,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.230
as his gunship was shot down before it got
a chance to land.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.799
After the battle, the Jedi Order assumed he
had died, so they left him.

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.260
But he didn’t die, and was found by Jedi
Master Tholme, who took him along with him

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.230
on a mission to confront Dooku.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.470
Although they both failed in defeating him,
Dooku did have a chance to plant the seeds

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.130
of dissent within Bulq, by telling Bulq that
the only way to end the corruption of the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.010
republic was to have the Jedi rule it, and
that the Jedi council was limiting the order’s

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.190
potential by having it serve a corrupt senate.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.199
Bulq agreed, after becoming sadden over the
fact of learning how many of his former students

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.360
had perished in the battle of Geonosis, the
battle that was instigated by the Jedi council.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.700
When Bulq got back to Coruscant to drop off
the injured Tholme, he then went on to create

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.229
a splinter faction of Jedi who refused to
fight in the clone wars, and basically refused

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.630
to obey the Jedi council’s orders.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.970
This splinter faction was supported by Dooku,
who then set up a plot to trick the Jedi into

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.370
believing that Windu was a ruthless killer
by making it seem like he assassinated the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.450
dissident Jedi, to make it seem like the Jedi
council was led by maniacs and to encourage

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.760
even more Jedi to leave the Order.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.770
This plot was supported by Bulq, who at that
point had joined Dooku.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.220
Though the plot was uncovered and foiled by
Windu and a few other Jedi, who had discovered

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.600
Bulq’s fall to the dark side and his allegiance
to Dooku.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.280
Afterwards, Bulq became one of Dooku’s most
trusted allies, becoming the leader of the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.480
other Dark side acolytes.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.900
On the other side of the galaxy, the Jedi
Council was in shock to learn that one of

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.760
their greatest lightsaber duelists would betray
them, with even Mace Windu taking on some

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.850
of the guilt, believing that him teaching
Bulq Vaapad played a role to his fall to the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.480
dark side.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.730
During the war, Bulq was given great power
and responsibilities within the confederacy,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.910
being given power to govern entire planets
and execute leaders of planets that were a

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.090
risk to the separatists.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.440
Near the end of the war, he was given command
of a secret separatist project on Saleucami,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.440
known as the Shadow Army, which was the separatists’
attempt at creating their own clone army.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.920
During the battle of Saleucami, Bulq was slain
by Quinlan Vos during a duel, to which his

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.890
body was later consumed by lava.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.370
The most famous Jedi to join Count Dooku was
Asaj Ventress.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.130
Originally from Dathomir, Ventress was reluctantly
sold as a slave in order to protect the Nightsister

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.130
clan.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.530
After her slave master got killed during a
raid by pirates, she was taken in by Jedi

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.780
knight Ky Narec, who taught her in the ways
of the force and made her his Jedi padawan.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.780
Together, they protected the town they lived
in by continuous pirate raids, until one day

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.110
Narec was killed in a skirmish.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.140
Her master’s death made her snap and brutally
slaughter all the pirates and eventually all

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.800
the warlords that they served, taking over
the Outer Rim planet Rattatak and making it

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.090
her personal kingdom.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.770
Such anger from her master’s death led her
to the dark side.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.430
A few months after the Clone Wars began, Count
Dooku started to search for an assassin to

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.430
teach.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.020
He was brought to Rattatak by one of his contacts,
who introduced him Ventress.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.740
After impressing Dooku by eliminating all
the gladiators in the gladiatorial arena,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.200
Ventress was taken in by the Sith Lord and
taught the powers of the dark side, finally

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.550
ending her training by giving her two curved
red lightsabers.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.240
As a Separatist commander, she led many battles
with the droid army and successfully killed

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.610
multiple jedi during her campaigns.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.240
Anakin Skywalker became her arch nemesis,
in which she dueled the talented Jedi knight

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.020
multiple times, usually being overpowered
by him and forced to retreat.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.340
But she did give him the scar over his eye,
so she gained a point there between their

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.790
rivalry.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.450
Her fate splits up into two parts among Canon
and Legends.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.430
In Canon, she was betrayed by Count Dooku
and was forced to flee from a battle.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.840
She made her way to the nightsisters and there
she planned on killing Count Dooku.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.680
But she failed multiple times, both by being
overpowered by the Sith Lord and later being

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.080
betrayed by her secretly implanted ally, Savage
Opress, who turned on her during their duel

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.860
against Dooku.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.960
After her failed assassination attempts and
witnessing her people’s massacre, she ditched

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.570
her past life and joined the life of bounty
hunters.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.710
She later helped Ahsoka Tano prove her innocence,
and even helped the Jedi Council near the

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.919
end of the Clone Wars, where she and Quinlan
Vos went undercover to assassinate Count Dooku.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:38.040
They of course failed, but this time, Ventress
was killed by Dooku after sacrificing her

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.120
life to save Vos, whom she fell in love with
during their mission.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.810
She was then buried on Dathomir.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.389
In Legends, she remained as Dooku’s servant
up until the battle of Boz Pity near the end

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:54.870
of the war, where she was betrayed by Dooku
who used her as bait and shot her down, leaving

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.930
her behind just so he could make his own escape.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.300
She barely survived, and after recovering,
she ordered herself to be transported as far

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.830
away from galaxy affairs as possible.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.090
Her fate is currently unknown.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:12.180
Finally, we have Quinlan Vos, whose allegiance
to Dooku is kind of all over the place in

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.120
both Canon and Legends.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.930
Initially, Quinlan Vos was a Jedi Master who
typically underwent undercover missions for

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.690
the Jedi Council.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.660
In Canon, he was assigned a mission to assassinate
Count Dooku.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.800
Early on, he met up with Asajj Ventress, who
was a bounty hunter at the time, and he tried

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.520
to learn her knowledge on Dooku’s secrets
and whereabouts.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.730
Later, he was taught the dark side of the
force by Ventress, as he believed that would

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.370
be the only way he could defeat Dooku.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.880
During their company of each other, Ventress
and Vos fell in love, but kept it hidden for

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.950
the most part.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.600
When the time came, they both attempted to
assassinate Dooku, but failed, with Vos being

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.029
captured by Dooku, while Ventress barely escaped.

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:57.920
As a prisoner, Vos was tortured, both physically
and mentally by the Count, finally succumbing

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.790
completely to the dark side.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.980
When Ventress attempted to rescue Vos, he
attacked her, proving to her that he was truly

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.980
gone.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.560
Secretly, Vos became Dooku’s new right hand
man, taking on the public name as Admiral

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560
Enigma.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.560
Unaware of this, the Jedi set up a mission
to rescue Vos from Admiral Enigma.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.180
Knowing this, Dooku set up a plot to deceive
them, by staging Vos as still a prisoner,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.750
while in fact he was loyal to Dooku.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.920
After being rescued, Vos was taken back to
the Jedi Order and was believed to have been

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.460
back to the light side.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:36.260
In reality, Vos was an undercover agent for
Dooku, and he went on to undermine many missions

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.030
for the Jedi.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.200
Suspecting him to be an undercover agent for
Dooku, the Jedi council sent Vos once again

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.779
to assassinate Dooku along with a few other
Jedi to prove to them that he was still on

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:48.180
their side.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.750
During the assassination mission, Ventress
and Vos confronted Dooku, but were defeated

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.600
by him, who took the life of Ventress right
in front of Vos.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:02.680
Seeing his lover die, Vos used his newfound
strength to beat Dooku, but spared his life,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.640
believing it wasn't the Jedi way to kill an
unarmed prisoner.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.861
Dooku escaped, and the other Jedi that were
with him suspected Vos spared Dooku because

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:15.240
he was still his agent, so they took him in
as a Republic prisoner.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.990
When taken before the Jedi council, Vos confessed
that he had fallen to the dark side and all

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.100
the questionable actions he had done while
undercover.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.530
The Jedi listened and took his honestly well,
stating that they were at fault with giving

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.279
him such a crude mission involving assassination,
and that his fall to the dark side was partially

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.280
their fault.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.250
Afterwards, Vos was allowed to rejoin the
Jedi order, where he led a few battles near

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.700
the end of the clone wars.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.060
In Legends, Vos was instead given the task
of going undercover behind enemy lines and

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.100
set up a secret spy network, that would feed
Republic intelligence crucial information

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.260
on their enemy’s tactics and strategies.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.260
Eventually, Vos was able to infiltrate Count
Dooku’s inner circle, becoming a Dark Acolyte,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.570
seeking the find the other sith lord.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.890
After Vos revealed himself as an undercover
Republic agent and killed another Dark Acolyte

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:10.360
by the name of Sey, he was captured by Dooku,
who was able to bring Vos to the dark side.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.980
After his fall to the dark side, Vos was made
into a trusted aid by Dooku, giving him a

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.980
red lightsaber crystal from the sith holocron
he had retrieved earlier from Korriban.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.420
Knowing Vos was still loyal to the Jedi, Dooku
took advantage of this and sent Vos on false

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.241
assassination missions, making him believe
he was killing the secret Sith lord, while

00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:34.970
in reality they were just republic senators
or other allies of the republic.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.930
Despite his seeming loyalty to Dooku, Vos
still went out of his way to save other Jedi

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:45.020
in danger, as he did with Obi Wan when he
was hunted by Ventress and Skorr for his apparent

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.060
failures.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.339
In the end, Vos revealed to Dooku on Saleucami
that he was a Jedi the entire time and that

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:53.750
the Dark side had never fully taken him.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.520
Although he was unable to kill or capture
Dooku, Vos was able to kill his other two

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.250
dark acolytes, Skorr and Bulq.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.940
After his undercover mission was finished,
Vos returned to the Jedi and later led his

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:16.510
own battles near the end of the clone wars.
