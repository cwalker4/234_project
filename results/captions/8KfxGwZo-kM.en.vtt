-Stephen Miller was on
your show on Sunday,

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.670 line:92%
and he came out guns blazing.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.539
I want to show -- for those
who missed it, and first of all,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:07.741 align:start size:94% position:6%
I feel bad for anyone
who missed it.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.710
But let's just show a bit of
a super cut of the highlights

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.911 align:start size:94% position:6%
of your interview
with Stephen Miller,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.613
and then I have some questions.
-Okay.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.048
-Why don't you just give me
three minutes to tell you

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.850 align:start size:94% position:6%
the truth about Donald Trump
that I know,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.284 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that all
of our campaign staff know?

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.321
-Because it's my show, and I
don't want to do that. So --

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.056 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Well, this isn't -- this
isn't a courtroom

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.724
and I have a right to speak.
-Stephen, Stephen, settle down,

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.326 align:start size:94% position:6%
settle down. Calm down.
-Jake.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.727 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I have a question for you
about issues.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.831
-I would be with the President
on a campaign plane with a rally

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.266 align:start size:94% position:6%
in 20 minutes,
and he would be able --

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.868
-You've already made this point,
Stephen.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.737
-A self-made billionaire,
revolutionized reality TV,

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.773
and tapped into something
magical that's happening

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.276
in the heart of this country.
The people that you don't --

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.844 align:start size:94% position:6%
-The President has an approval
rating in the 30s.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.645 line:92%
-The people -- the people --

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.647 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I don't know what magical
you're talking about.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.182
There's one viewer that you care
about right now,

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.483 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you're being obsequious --
-No, but you're being --

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.818 align:start size:94% position:6%
-You're being a factotum
in order to please him, okay?

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.086 align:start size:94% position:6%
-No. You know -- you know who
I care about?

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.454
-I think I've wasted -- I think
I've wasted enough

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.889 size:75% position:38%
of my viewers' time.
Thank you, Stephen.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.690
-You know who I care about?
-As Republican lawmakers

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.193
call for Attorney General
Jeff Sessions to resign.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:05.632 size:84% position:42%
-So...So I had to ask.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.135 line:92%
You -- you know Stephen Miller.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.870 align:start size:94% position:6%
You've interacted with him
before. Were you --

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.973
did that catch you off-guard,
the tone of that interview?

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.142 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah. I've known him
for a long time.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.710 align:start size:94% position:6%
He was a press secretary
on Capitol Hill

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.550
for quite some time.
And I knew that he was sometimes

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
unusual to interact with.
-Mm-hmm.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.387 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.922 align:start size:94% position:6%
-But, no,
I was not expecting that.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.158
I was not -- I would not have
booked him if I thought that

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.793 align:start size:94% position:6%
that was what was going to
happen.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.161 align:start size:94% position:6%
-You -- does it feel
at some point,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.131 align:start size:94% position:6%
a little bit like a rodeo,
and you're just trying to stay

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.501 align:start size:94% position:6%
on top of the interview
with that?

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.237 align:start size:94% position:6%
-It was -- it was just so...
[ Sighs ]

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.573
Most of the time, when people
come and they want to represent

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.709
their point of view, and I've
interviewed President Trump.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.577 line:92%
I've interviewed Rex Tillerson.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start size:94% position:6%
We've interviewed
lots of people.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.647
Most of the time when they want
to get across

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.748 size:75% position:38%
their point of view,
even if they think

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.618 align:start size:94% position:6%
you're being unfair, or they
don't like the questions,

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.120 size:81% position:41% line:92%
there's an effort made

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start size:94% position:6%
to have a certain behavior
like a human being.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:06.926 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.562
Which makes sense,
'cause human -- you're a human.

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.930 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I'm a human being.
-Humans are watching.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.767 align:start size:94% position:6%
My viewers are 90% human.
-Yeah.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
-10% cats.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.607 align:start size:94% position:6%
And there's also usually,
in politics,

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start size:94% position:6%
an effort to be likeable.
-Mm-hmm.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.613 size:75% position:38% line:92%
-To convince people.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.949
And I certainly understand
the White House point of view

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.584 align:start size:94% position:6%
that the media's unfair
to them,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:36.523
and doesn't give them their due,
and all of that.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.225 align:start size:94% position:6%
But, you know, this wasn't --
it wasn't a conversation

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:42.095 align:start size:94% position:6%
where he wasn't allowing me
to ask questions,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.163 align:start size:94% position:6%
he wasn't answering
my questions.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.465 align:start size:94% position:6%
He started repeating himself.
It was just bizarre.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.101
-He was complaining that you
weren't giving him time to talk

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.303
about issues, and yet every time
you tried to cede time,

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.306
it seemed like he went back
to things he'd already said.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.307 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yeah.
-Do you feel like --

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.276
-Like the story about
the President coming up with --

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.810 align:start size:94% position:6%
riffing off the news.
-Yeah.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.183
-If you missed it at 9:01,
he told it again at 9:07.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:03.750 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.752 size:88% position:44%
-You said, had you known
it would go like that,

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
you wouldn't have had him on.
-Yeah.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.289
-You must have this balance,
that I'm sure people ask you

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start size:94% position:6%
about this all the time, like,
who you allow on your show.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.429
And there are people with
certain hateful rhetoric

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.666
who are now in the White House.
-[ Laughs ] Right.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
-And so how do you decide,
as far as just being

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start size:94% position:6%
a gatekeeper as to guests...
-Yeah.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.672 align:start size:94% position:6%
-You obviously have a lot
of Trump people on your show.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:29.075 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you think that's important?
-Well, he's the President.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.910 size:88% position:44%
And Republicans control
the House and the Senate

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.812
and the White House.
So I think it is very important

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.647 align:start size:94% position:6%
to ask them questions
and to speak truth to power

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.916
and also to just get information
from them and have them explain

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:39.953 align:start size:94% position:6%
what they're doing.
The way it works normally,

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.288 align:start size:94% position:6%
is you have a Sunday show,
or even a weekday show,

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.958
and you ask the White House
we would like this guest

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.927
or we would like that guest.
On Sunday, it's really just

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.362 align:start size:94% position:6%
a, "who are you putting out
this Sunday?"

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.064 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Mm-hmm.
-This is how it was during

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.333 line:92%
Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.702 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they tell you
who they're offering.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.838
That Sunday, you know, they were
offering Nikki Haley

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:02.108 align:start size:94% position:6%
and CIA Director Pompeo,
and Stephen Miller.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:06.579 size:88% position:44%
And I wanted Nikki Haley
or CIA Director Pompeo.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
-Yeah.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
-But we got Miller. And, look,
I'm happy -- he was --

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.188 align:start size:94% position:6%
The big news was
the Michael Wolff book...

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.122 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Yep.
-Which the White House

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.525
cooperated with, otherwise
I don't think it would get

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.828 align:start size:94% position:6%
a quarter as much attention.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start size:94% position:6%
-The falling out
between President Trump

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.933
and Steve Bannon,
and Steve Bannon was responsible

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.501 align:start size:94% position:6%
for getting Stephen Miller
on the campaign.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.338
They did used to work closely
together. And immigration.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.974
Those were three big issues,
and Stephen Miller, you know,

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.910
could talk to all three of them.
So we booked him.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.014 size:84% position:42%
-He called Steve Bannon
"grotesque" a few times

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.716
during your interview,
and he came back to that point,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.917 size:88% position:44%
Steve Bannon, obviously,
has fallen out of favor

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.654
at the White House,
and the knives are out for him,

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.790
despite the fact that he
was a guy who also seemed

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.058 line:92%
to have knives out quite a bit.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.695
Do you have any empathy for
these sort of fallen members

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.231
of the Trump Administration,
once they sort of fall out

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:02.235
and they're sort of, ravaged by
their once-colleagues?

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.337 align:start size:94% position:6%
-I wouldn't call it empathy,
but, I mean, the truth

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
of the matter is, Steve Bannon
played a huge role

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:09.876 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the final months
of the Trump Campaign.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.412 align:start size:94% position:6%
And in the first,
whatever it was,

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.013 align:start size:94% position:6%
eight months
of the Trump presidency.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:17.617 align:start size:94% position:6%
And to pretend that he didn't
was silly.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.585
And when President Trump issued
the statement -- and this is

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.255
really where the conversation
with Stephen Miller started

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:25.258 size:88% position:44%
to go off the rails --
is when I started to ask

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:28.528 align:start size:94% position:6%
about the fact
that the President had said

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:29.395 line:92%
Bannon didn't play a role.

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.697 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I said, "well, what about
all these issues?

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.700
I was defending Steve Bannon,
which is one of the reasons why

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.504 align:start size:94% position:6%
his attack on me and CNN
subsequent -- like, you know,

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:41.040 align:start size:94% position:6%
we're liberal media,
we're biased.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.376 line:92%
I was defending Steve Bannon.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:43.910 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.079 align:start size:94% position:6%
-That's liberal?
-You lefty. [ Laughs ]

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.981 line:92%
You bleeding heart lefty.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.451 align:start size:94% position:6%
You did say he was talking
to a audience of one,

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.419 size:84% position:42%
and very quickly after,
Donald Trump tweeted --

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.190 align:start size:94% position:6%
sort of, I felt like brought
truth to the statement.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start size:94% position:6%
And said, "Jake Tapper,
fake news, just got destroyed

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.861 align:start size:94% position:6%
"in this interview
with Stephen Miller

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:02.695 line:92%
"of the Trump Administration.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.298
"Watch the hatred and unfairness
of the CNN flunky --"

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm sorry about that.
[ Laughter ]

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.535 align:start size:94% position:6%
But then you wrote back --
-I said "factotum."

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.371 align:start size:94% position:6%
-[ Laughs ]
-That's a word.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start size:94% position:6%
-[ Laughs ] -You -- you wrote
back with an emoji.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.675 size:81% position:41%
