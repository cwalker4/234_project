00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.540
The Grandmaster of the Jedi Order during the
centuries leading up to and throughout the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.860
Clone Wars, Yoda was the leader of the lightside
Order right before the dark times and was

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.340
regarded as the most powerful Jedi to ever
exist in history up to that point.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.500
But exactly how powerful was Yoda and what
was the centuries old Jedi Master truly capable

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.649
of when unleashing the full might of his abilities?

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.960
For this video we’ll go over his greatest,
demonstrated feats in regards to his lightsaber

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.480
combat skills, direct force abilities, and
then finally his extensive knowledge of the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.969
force for non-combative purposes.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.480
When it came to lightsaber combat, Yoda was
second to none.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.309
A master of all 7 standard lightsaber forms,
Yoda specialized in form 4 as he believed

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.510
it best suited his small stature and short
reach.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.070
Form 4, also known as Ataru, essentially required
the user to utilize the force to enhance their

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.850
bodies and use them as a weapon alongside
their lightsabers, performing physical feats

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.250
that would otherwise be considered impossible.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.890
This was purely an offensive form, and to
use it at its most effectiveness one had to

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.229
always be on the attack and constantly moving
around.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.479
And Yoda not only specialized in this form,
but straight up perfected it, as when fighting

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.560
at his full strength the Jedi master was able
to overpower any opponent of his as every

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.580
strike he dealt was done with flawless precision.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.979
But on top of his mastery of form 4, Yoda’s
speed that he was able to achieve through

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.130
the force was what made him so deadly in one
on one combat, as only a very small handful

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.240
of force users of his era could even compete
with it at full force.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.650
Just to give you an idea of the difference
of speed between Yoda and other Jedi Masters,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.341
Yoda once demonstrated this very fact to a
group of padawans a few decades prior to the

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.320
Clone Wars during a lecture.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.140
Completely unarmed, Yoda had the 3 Jedi Masters
Plo Koon, Saesee Tiin, and Depa Billaba attack

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.780
him at their full strength.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.840
And even with 3 of some of the most talented
duelists attacking him all at once, the unarmed

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.619
Yoda was able to evade their blows with complete
ease.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.350
A lesson to show the students that with the
full power of the force even a weapon wasn’t

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.080
required to overcome some enemies, and to
perhaps even show them all why a small, old

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.050
man like himself was the one who held the
title of Grandmaster as well.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.220
Beyond that, Yoda had also demonstrated in
beating some of the other greatest duelists

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.190
to exist within his lifetime, including even
Mace Windu, who was unable to fully contend

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.760
with the Grandmaster’s fury of attacks during
a practice duel.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.380
Even Count Dooku himself, who was regarded
as the finest duelist of his generation, was

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.550
unable to contend with Yoda for more than
a few seconds before going on the defensive.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.430
During their fight in Attack of the Clones,
Dooku was actually very confident that he

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.360
could beat his former Master.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.750
When they began, he unleashed his full power,
only to have it be completely repelled by

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.010
Yoda’s defensives.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.170
The Sith Lord’s initial confidence in victory
was quickly shattered in only mere seconds,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.500
as he was now fighting for his life against
his former teacher.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.230
He finally had to resort to a cheap trick
to distract Yoda so he himself could flee

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.400
onto his ship.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.270
Funny enough, when Dooku got back from his
duel with Yoda, he quickly added the Jedi

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.430
Master to the list of people General Grievous
should never confront in battle, later telling

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.660
the Cyborg General that he better pray to
the stars that he would never be forced to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.020
engage with Yoda, as it would mean his certain
death.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.090
Even Palpatine, who was regarded as the most
powerful Sith Lord to ever exist, was genuinely

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.570
afraid of fighting Yoda in a lightsaber duel,
as he knew he would likely lose.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.860
That’s why when they dueled in Revenge of
the Sith, Palpatine desperately tried to get

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.270
away from Yoda and create as much distance
between the two, so he could instead use his

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.260
force abilities to fight, in which case the
Sith Lord had the advantage in.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.690
Yoda knew of this fact as well, which is why
he worked so hard to get close to his opponent

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.720
in an attempt to re-instigate their lightsaber
duel.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.510
But even when Yoda did get close again, Palpatine
didn’t take any chances and instead unleashed

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.520
the full power of his force lightning, which
was enough to repel the already exhausted

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.960
Grandmaster into knocking him back into the
Senate central chamber following the force

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.150
repulse that was created between the two.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.870
Compare this duel with Palpatine’s fight
against Mace Windu, and you can see the difference

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.729
in how the Sith Lord treated his two opponents,
where with Windu he was confident enough in

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.090
his own lightsaber skills to continue dueling
with his opponent, but when against Yoda he

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:51.550
quickly resorted to his force abilities which
he was far more confident in.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.650
With all of this being said, Yoda’s biggest
weakness when it came to his lightsaber dueling

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.090
abilities was of course his age.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.379
His intensive fighting technique was extremely
taxing on his old body, which resulted in

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.949
him only being able to sustain himself at
full strength for a short period before needing

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.330
to retreat due to exhaustion.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.520
When it came to using the force itself as
a weapon, Yoda demonstrated feats that were

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.360
unimaginable to most other force users.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.849
One of his most notable uses of the force
was during the Battle of Coruscant.

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.199
During the initial landings of the Separatist
armies on the city planet, Yoda casually stared

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.069
down the thousands of battle droids that were
approaching him before picking up hundreds

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.639
of them and lifting them up so they’d collide
with the incoming enemy starfighters.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.840
Shortly afterwards he denied a massive separatist
transport of unleashing its droid compartments,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.870
in which he then pushed back so that it would
collide and explode into another transport

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.780
ship that he was also manipulating with the
force.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.490
Later in that same battle Yoda, with the help
of Mace Windu, was able to force push thousands

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.889
of battle droids back.

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.999
He then continued to fight in the frontlines
of the planet-wide engagement along with the

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.870
other Jedi in a battle that was said to have
lasted an entire day.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.210
Another notable feat of his was using the
force to bring down the top of a mountain

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.360
in order to create a massive avalanche as
a way to destroy a small army of battle droids.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.840
A less direct but extremely powerful force
ability that Yoda was a master in was battle

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840
meditation.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.669
It’s usage was capable of amping up nearby
allies, boosting their moral and making one

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.919
man feel like a hundred when they fought.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.610
His most notable use of this ability was during
Kashyyyk, where the heavily outnumbered Clones

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.110
were able to overcome near impossible odds
as a result.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.220
His usage of the force for defensive purposes
were also beyond that of any force user of

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.220
his era.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.229
His ability to contain Palpatine’s force
lightning, which was known of being capable

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.469
of turning beings into dust at full power,
was perhaps Yoda’s greatest feat in demonstrating

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:51.060
his mastery of using the force for defense.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.680
All in all, when it came to using the force
for combative purposes, only a small handful

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.560
of either Jedi or Sith could contend with
him without being utterly obliterated.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560
A great example of what a fight between Yoda
and most other force users would look like

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560
was shown when Ventress tried to confront
him.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560
While quite formidable of a fighter and very
dangerous against most other Jedi, Ventress

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560
was nothing when compared to Yoda, who casually
disarmed her like she was a lightsaber rack.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560
She was so little of a threat to Yoda that
he even returned her weapons back to her after

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560
making a fool of her.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560
Also in Canon, Yoda straight up fights a gigantic
force mountain, and wins with relative ease

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.259
by overpowering it with his own force abilities
and forcing it to submit to his will.

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:17.720
Which in of itself is one of his most incredible
feats even among Legends material.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.349
With centuries of studying and exploring all
aspects of the force, Yoda was basically an

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.270
archive of Jedi lore all to himself.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.289
He was so knowledgeable of the force, that
he was capable of creating Holocrons from

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.039
scratch and locking them so that only those
worthy in the lightside were allowed to open

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:35.830
them for their contained secrets.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.559
He was also known to sense disturbances of
incidents happening across the galaxy, whether

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.939
they be catastrophic events or just the intense
feelings of a fellow Jedi.

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:49.330
And finally, one of his more unique abilities
was using the force to straight up sustain

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.280
himself during his final years.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.770
By the time he was training Luke, Yoda’s
physical body had gotten very sick and was

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.949
on the verge of death, with it only being
sustained by the force and his sheer will

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:01.930
to train the galaxy’s last hope.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.900
The very moment he believed Luke was ready,
Yoda stopped sustaining himself with his powers

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:22.999
and slowly let his age overcome him as he
became one with living force.
