00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.203
Ms. Sanders: Good afternoon,
welcome back.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.642
Today, the President
and First Lady

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.811
welcome President
Emmanuel Macron

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.646
and Mrs. Macron
to the White House,

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.383
beginning the first state visit
for the Trump administration.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.719
This visit will celebrate
the long and enduring friendship

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.488
between France
and the U.S.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.524
Discussions will include
economic, diplomatic,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.159
and global issues.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.961
The First Lady has taken
an active role

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.729
in every detail
and planning of the visit,

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.797
including the state dinner,

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.365
which will be held
tomorrow evening.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.035
And we're looking forward to
a very successful state visit.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.939
As you all saw, we now have
three Democrat senators

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.575
who have announced they will
vote to confirm Mike Pompeo,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.211
President Trump's
highly qualified nominee

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.080
for Secretary of State.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.681
However, a majority of Democrats

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.517
continue their
pointless obstruction

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.119
to score cheap political
points with their base

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.122
as a willful attempt to
undermine American diplomacy.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.725
Regardless, the President
is looking forward

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.593
to Mike Pompeo's confirmation,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.896
so he can continue
doing an incredible job

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.431
on behalf of
the American people.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.701
I also want to commend the
heroic actions of James Shaw Jr.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.304
early Sunday morning
at a Waffle House in Tennessee.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.307
Mr. Shaw saved lives
when he wrestled a gun

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.609
from an active shooter
who had opened fire.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.812
The President offers
his condolences

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.313
to the victims
and their families.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.916
He is monitoring
the ongoing situation

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.751
and the White House
is in regular contact

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.186
with state and local officials.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.088
Finally, I want
to congratulate the Duke

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.323
and Duchess of Cambridge

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.592
on the birth of their
third child, a baby boy.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.794
And from one mother to another,

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.097
I know the reality of being
outnumbered can be very scary,

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.666
but I know she
and Prince William

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.935
will continue to be
amazing parents.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.403
So congratulations to them.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.238
And with that,
I'll take your questions.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.139
Jonathan.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.640
The Press:  Sarah,
on North Korea:

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.876
Is the President willing
to accept anything

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.512
short of complete
denuclearization

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.814
before lifting any sanctions?

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:57.884
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly,
the goal is denuclearization

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.085
of the Peninsula,

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.222
and we're going to continue
the maximum pressure campaign

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.325
that has been ongoing
to North Korea

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.694
until we see concrete actions

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.164
taken towards complete
and total denuclearization.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.999
The Press:  But does that mean
no sanctions lifted

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.867
until that's achieved?

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.301
Are you willing to
go incrementally?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.437
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly,
no sanctions lifted

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.973
until we see concrete actions

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:21.841
taken by North Korea

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.476
to denuclearize

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.644
The Press:  When the President
said in his tweet

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.646
that they had agreed
to denuclearize,

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.048
where did they do that?

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.683
Have they already
agreed to do that?

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.519
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly, in a
number of the conversations,

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.920
including the comments,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.524
I'd refer you back to also
South Korean President Moon,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.759
who has said that North Korea
has expressed a will

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.295
for complete denuclearization.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.464
And certainly,
that's the focus

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.833
of any conversation
and negotiation

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.935
that the United States
will have with North Korea.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:49.869
Steve.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.004
The Press:  Sarah,
to what extent will

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.072
the Iran nuclear deal
come up in the conversation

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.674
between the President
and President Macron?

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.744
And what does President Trump
want to hear from Macron

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.379
on this thing?

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.114
Ms. Sanders: Look, I'm not
going to get ahead

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.682
of any conversations

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.785
that we expect to take place
over the next couple of days.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:08.788
As you know, they just
landed a few minutes ago,

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.557
and haven't even arrived
here at the White House.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.458
I'm not going to presume

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.093
what those conversations
will look like.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.061
We certainly expect

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.696
that that will be part
of the conversation,

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.331
and we'll keep you posted

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.100
if we have any specific details
to put out about that.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.635
The Press:  And is the President
still leaning

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.437
towards decertifying the deal

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.739
when it comes up
again on May 12th?

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.341
Ms. Sanders: I don't have any
announcements on that front,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.376
but the President has
been extremely clear

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.844
that he thinks
it's a bad deal.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.446
That certainly
has not changed.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.148
Jim.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.950
The Press:  Wanted to
ask you a question,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.918
sort of following up on what
you were asked this morning

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.820
about Michael Cohen.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.223
It was noticed by some that you
didn't close the door one way

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:47.193
or the other on the President
pardoning Michael Cohen.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:50.196
What is your read
on that right now?

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.497
Ms. Sanders: It's hard to close
a door on something

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.899
that hasn't taken place.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.335
I don't like to
discuss or comment

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.803
on hypothetical situations

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.071
that may or may
not ever happen.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.275
I would refer you to
personal attorneys to comment

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.444
on anything specific
regarding that case,

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.745
but we don't have
anything at this point.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.947
The Press:  And can I just
ask you about a tweet

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.416
that the President
put out last week?

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.384
He tweeted a lot
over the weekend.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.186
But last week, he said --

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.589
he was talking about sanctuary
cities in California and saying,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.925
 There is a Revolution
going on in California.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.160
Soooo many Sanctuary areas
want OUT of this ridiculous,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.229
crime infested &amp;
breeding concept. 

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.999
We haven't had a chance
to ask you about that tweet.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.333
When he used
the word  breeding, 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.669
was he making a derogatory term

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.471
about Latinos in California --

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.273
that they breed a lot or that
they're prone to breeding?

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.408
Was he talking about --

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.410
Ms. Sanders: No, he's talking
about the problem itself

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.178
growing and getting bigger.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.179
The Press:  What does
that mean though?

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.247
Ms. Sanders: Sorry,
I've answered a couple.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.615
Justin, go ahead.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.651
The Press:  I also wanted
to follow up on a couple

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.653
of the President's tweets.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.321
The first was earlier
this morning.

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.756
I'm wondering
if you could explain

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.124
the President's tweet
that he had ordered

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.594
DHS not to allow large caravans
of individuals into the country.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:59.232
So, if you can say both
what specifically he ordered

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.101
DHS to do, and what
that would mean for individuals

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.671
claiming refugee status
within the United States.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.073
Ms. Sanders:  Look, the
President continues to monitor

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.808
the ongoing situation.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.044
A sovereign nation that
cannot defend its borders

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.246
will no longer be
a sovereign nation.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.947
The Trump administration
is committed

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.050
to enforcing
our immigration laws,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.619
whether people are part
of the caravan or not.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.622
If you enter the United States
illegally, let me be clear --

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:23.923
you've broken the law,

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:26.159
and we will enforce
the law through prosecution

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.493
of illegal borders.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.562
While we are committed
to doing everything we can

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:31.364
on the border
to secure our nation,

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.366
we need Congress to do
their job as well,

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.335
and to pass legislation
to close the legal loopholes

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.104
and prevent us from
securing our borders

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.505
and protecting Americans.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.642
The Press:  And then
in the other tweet

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.177
that the President
did over the weekend,

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.046
he said that he didn't see
Michael Cohen flipping

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.614
to get out of trouble
with the government.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.583
I guess that prompts
two questions.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.586
The first is, what the President
believes his personal attorney

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.822
might have done to get him
in trouble with the government.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:58.758
And secondly, what
the President has done

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.861
that he is worried
Michael Cohen could flip about.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:02.995
Ms. Sanders:  The President
has been clear

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.231
that he hasn't done
anything wrong.

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.900
I think we've stated that
about a thousand times.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.335
Beyond that, I don't
have anything to add

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.369
beyond the President's tweet.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.037
Matthew.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.505
The Press:  Thanks, Sarah.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.974
There have been a number
of documented cases

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.744
in the press recently of
EPA Administrator Pruitt

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.179
at least appearing
to be dishonest

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.914
about requesting
raises for aides,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.016
about his relationship
with a lobbyist

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.619
who had business
before the EPA (inaudible).

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.455
Is the White House concerned
at all about this pattern?

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.623
And is there concern about him

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.925
testifying before
Congress on Thursday,

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:36.395
as scheduled, where these issues
are probably going to come up?

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.197
Ms. Sanders: We're continuing
to review a number

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.600
of the reports
that you mentioned,

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.503
and we'll let you know if we
have any changes on that front.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.303
Ashley.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.105
The Press:  Sarah,
President Macron is hoping

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.406
that a proposed side deal

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.308
between the U.S.
and European powers

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.244
could strengthen
the Iran deal enough

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.613
that President Trump would
feel comfortable staying in it.

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.249
So, is that sort of
a fool's errand?

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.117
And the President has said
it's a bad deal.

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.720
Does he believe there's anything
that could be done to fix it

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.355
in a way he'd be
comfortable with?

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.656
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm not
going to get ahead of

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.224
any potential conversations

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.360
that are going to take place
over the next couple of days.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.029
But as the administration
has policy announcements,

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.697
we'll be sure to
share them with you.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:12.598
Mara.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.633
The Press: Thank you, Sarah.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.334
Just to go back to Jonathan's
question about North Korea,

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.103
the President tweeted
pretty flatly,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.138
 &amp;they have agreed
to denuclearization. 

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.842
And then, you're saying
that they just agreed

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.076
to talk about it.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.045
What is
the President's definition

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.847
of complete denuclearization?

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.715
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm not
going to negotiate

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:30.716
with you guys.

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.886
I'm going to leave that
to the President and Kim Jong-un

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:36.722
to walk through what some of
those details would look like

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.457
when that meeting takes place.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:41.160
But I can be very clear
that we expect it not

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.629
to just be mentioned in words,

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.732
but there have to be
concrete actions that take place

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.202
towards total denuclearization
of the Peninsula.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.603
The Press:  Does that mean
removing all nukes --

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:51.504
our nukes and theirs?

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:52.872
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm not
going to get into

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.040
the negotiations

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.943
of what will take place and what
the agreement will look like.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.911
But there have to be
concrete actions

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.414
that stop the denuclearization
of the Peninsula.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:04.116
The Press:  Sarah,
President Macron appears to have

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:06.219
a very robust agenda
coming to Washington.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.887
He wants to change
the President's mind

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.790
on a lot of different things --
on the Iran nuclear deal,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.893
on keeping U.S. troops
in Syria, on tariffs,

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.462
and maybe even on
the Paris Climate Accord.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.763
Does he have an open mind?

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.099
Is it possible that
he will change his mind

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.835
after President Macron
gets through with him?

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:27.106
Ms. Sanders:  I think that
I feel very confident

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.308
that we have the best
negotiator at the table.

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.245
Look, you have two leaders
that have an incredibly good --

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:32.845
The Press: So, there's
a great negotiator

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.046
and not-such-a-great negotiator.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.248
Ms. Sanders: Hold on,
let me finish, let me finish.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.582
That's not what I said.

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:39.218
I said that we have a great
negotiator at the table.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:43.823
I certainly was not commenting
on President Macron's abilities;

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.758
simply stating the obvious,

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.593
that we have an incredibly
good negotiator

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:49.328
at the table
for the United States.

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.664
But what you do have
are two leaders

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.933
who have a great deal
of respect for one another,

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:55.835
who have a great friendship.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:59.205
Certainly, both have
a great deal of interest

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.274
in doing what is best
for their country

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.810
but being able to have very open
and candid conversations

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.646
because of the relationship

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.114
not only that
the leaders have built,

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.816
but that has existed
between the two countries

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:13.452
long before either
of these individuals

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.388
arrived on the scene.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.189
And we're going to continue
that relationship.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:21.060
But I think we can expect this
to be a very productive

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.462
and very positive state
visit for both countries.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.563
The Press:  Positive for France?

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:25.798
Ms. Sanders:  I said
for both countries.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:26.766
The Press:  Could the President
change his mind

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:27.800
on some of these things?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.734
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm not
going to get ahead

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.735
of conversations

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:30.937
that are going to take place.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.772
But as we have any
policy announcements,

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.607
I'm sure you guys
will be the first to know.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:35.574
The Press:  His mind is open?

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.310
Ms. Sanders:  Again,
the President wants to make

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.744
good deals for this country.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.147
And if he feels like
he can make a good deal

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.648
that benefits this country,

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.885
he certainly is going to engage
in those conversations.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:46.852
Peter.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.120
The Press:  Sarah, why should
North Korea believe

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.588
that the U.S.
is an honest broker,

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:50.890
when the President
has said publicly

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.526
that he would like to get
out of the deal the U.S.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.794
and others made with Iran?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.596
Ms. Sanders:  Look,
the President has been clear

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.066
from day one that he thinks 
that's a bad deal.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.902
I don't think any deal
that he would sign and agree

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.037
to he would consider a bad deal.

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.206
The President wants to do
what is in the best interest --

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:08.574
The Press:  So, he would never
backtrack on this deal?

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.009
Ms. Sanders:  The President
wants to do what is in the best

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.811
interest of our country

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:12.745
and even in the world.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:16.182
And particularly
having North Korea

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:19.318
and the Korean Peninsula
free of nuclear weapons,

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.786
I think, is a good thing
for everybody,

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.321
and I think even you
would be hard-pressed

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.622
to find something different.

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:24.557
The Press:  Sarah,
beyond what you said about --

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:25.658
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, Peter,
I've got tight time

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:26.826
and I'm going to keep moving.

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:27.994
Steve.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:30.496
The Press:  Yeah, Sarah,
I just want to follow up on that

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.365
about North Korea.

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.835
I'm wondering,
what gives you any optimism

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:41.273
that the North Koreans are
really looking to denuclearize?

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.576
Because of the statements
that they're making,

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:44.810
everybody seems to be jumping

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.113
on the very positive
aspects of the statements.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.281
But they were also saying
over the weekend

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:52.284
that their completion
of the nuclear arsenal,

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:55.554
which they call their
 powerful treasured sword, 

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.191
firmly guarantees forever
the country's security

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.359
and well-being.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.030
That doesn't sound like any
wiggle room on denuclearization.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.998
Ms. Sanders: Certainly,
we're not going to make mistakes

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.700
from previous administrations,

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.770
and we're not going
to take the North Koreans

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.771
simply at their word.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:14.640
Like I said before and we've
said many times before,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.543
the maximum pressure campaign
is going to continue

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.446
until we see concrete
actions taken by --

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.882
look, we're not naïve
in this process.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:26.085
We've seen some steps
in the right direction.

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.720
But we have a long way to go.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.956
We also have seen a major change

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.825
in what has taken
place in the past

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:35.728
by having our allies and
partners in the region step up

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.997
and do much more
than they have in the past.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.066
China has taken
a more active role

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.867
in putting pressure
on North Korea.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.070
They can certainly do more --
we hope they will --

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.938
and will continue
working with us.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:50.076
And that's all at the direction
and because of the relationship

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.045
that the President has built
with President Xi of China.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.146
Yamiche.

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:55.247
The Press:  I have two
quick questions.

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:56.549
The first one is,
that the New York Times

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.819
and others reported
that federal prosecutors

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:02.321
have recommended charges against
the New York police officer

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.689
involved in Eric Garner's death.

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:05.825
But the Justice Department
has expressed

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.326
some strong reservations.

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.762
Where do things stand
with the case of Eric Garner,

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:11.597
and when does
the Justice Department --

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:12.898
when are they going
to make a decision

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.567
about the police officer

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.135
and whether or not
they're going to charge him?

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.837
Ms. Sanders: I don't have
an administration update

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:18.804
on that front

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.406
but would refer you
to the Department of Justice

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.841
to get further details.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.075
And I'll work on getting an
update for you and let you know.

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.043
The Press:  And the second
question I have

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:25.077
is the President tweeted --

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.245
The Press:  Can you let
all of us know?

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:29.281
Ms. Sanders: Sure. Usually when
we let one, it's kind of a --

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:30.816
it's not exactly a secret.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:33.686
But, yeah, I'd be happy
to share that with everybody.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.754
The Press:  The second question
is the President tweeted,

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:38.090
 James Comey illegally
classified documents

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.992
to press in order --

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:42.194
leaked documents to press

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.263
[in order] to generate
a Special Council?

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:45.998
Therefore, the Special Council
was established

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.533
based on an illegal act?

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.301
Really, does everyone know
what that means? 

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.170
What does the President
think that means?

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.339
And is he indicating that the
Special Counsel should be fired

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.940
because of the way
that it was begun?

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.610
Ms. Sanders: As we've said
many times before,

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.147
we have no intention of
firing the Special Counsel.

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:04.617
We've been beyond
cooperative with them.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.519
We're continuing
to cooperate with them.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:09.388
Turned over nearly --
over a million pages

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:11.490
and documents
to the Special Counsel

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.424
and have been cooperative.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:13.526
The Press:  So,
what does it mean?

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.560
Ms. Sanders:  Exactly what
the President has been

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.661
saying all along --

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:16.795
The Press:  Yeah,
but the question that he posed?

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:17.963
Ms. Sanders:  -- that this was
a false premise

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.431
that this entire thing
started on.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.735
We continue to repeat
that we think that the idea

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.304
that the Trump campaign
was involved in any collusion

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.640
with Russia
is a total witch hunt.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.075
Our position on that
has been very clear

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.510
since the beginning
of this process,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.813
and the President is echoing
exactly what that position is.

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:35.681
Jon.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:37.016
The Press: Thanks a lot, Sarah,
over the weekend,

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:39.718
a fourth House Republican

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:43.722
called for the EPA Administrator
Scott Pruitt to step down.

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:46.058
He said he's the wrong
fit for the EPA.

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.826
What's your reaction to that?

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:49.528
Ms. Sanders: Again,
we're reviewing

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.796
some of those allegations.

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:54.466
However, Administrator
Pruitt has done a good job

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.835
of implementing
the President's policies,

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.371
particularly on deregulation;

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:03.075
making the United States
less energy-dependent

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:05.211
and becoming more
energy independent.

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.145
Those are good things.

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:09.415
However, the other things
certainly are something

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.749
that we're monitoring
and looking at

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.618
and I'll keep you posted.

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.953
The Press:  Last week,
Andrew Wheeler

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:15.955
was confirmed by the Senate.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.624
He is Scott Pruitt's
deputy at the EPA.

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.994
Couldn't he easily implement
all of the President's agenda

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.329
if Scott Pruitt stepped aside?

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:25.864
He wouldn't have a dark cloud
hanging over the agency.

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.200
What's your view on that idea?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.069
Ms. Sanders: We're very excited
that the Democrats

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:33.472
have finally allowed another one
of our nominees to go through.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:37.142
We hope that they'll allow some
of the other several hundred

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.378
that sit waiting
to be confirmed --

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.347
very highly qualified
individuals --

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:44.984
we hope that they'll continue to
follow in the footsteps of that

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:48.454
and get a lot more people within
this administration working.

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.789
Blake.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.258
The Press: Thank you, Sarah,
on the Iran nuclear deal,

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.526
President Macron
said don't leave

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.161
if there's not a better option,

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.797
and then the Iranian
Foreign Minister tweeted today,

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.067
 President Macron is correct
in saying there's no "Plan B"

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.203
It's either all or nothing. 

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.606
So, my question to you is,
does the White House believe

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:09.775
that there is actually
a realistic

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.610
"Plan B" out there?

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.911
Ms. Sanders:  We certainly think

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.313
that there should be
a better deal,

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:18.484
one that actually
is positive, that works.

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:22.254
And we don't really typically
look to the leadership in Iran

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.056
to determine what
our foreign policy is.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.791
The Press:  And then later
today, on Mike Pompeo --

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:26.692
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, I'm going
to keep moving

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:27.960
just because we're
running out of time.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.894
John.

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.162
The Press:  Thank you, Sarah.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.264
You may not be willing
to be specific

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:36.535
about the matters that President
Trump and President Macron

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.070
will negotiate on,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.106
but the French Finance
Minister Bruno Le Maire

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.676
was very specific
at the World Bank

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.277
and IMF spring meeting.

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:49.381
He said on Friday,
the French will insist on,

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:53.152
and I quote, "a full
and permanent exemption,"

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:58.290
of any trade tariffs
the United States

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.893
might want to impose on France.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:04.263
He went on to say that if they
are going to be a partner

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:07.333
in dealing with China
and other countries,

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.134
they cannot have,
what he called,

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:12.037
a  sword of Damocles 
hanging over them.

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.572
That's pretty strong language.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.508
Is trade and a permanent
exemption --

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:17.876
Ms. Sanders:  We can at
least agree on that.

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.111
(Laughter.)

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:22.448
The Press:  Is it on the table
as Minister Le Maire wishes?

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.817
Ms. Sanders:  Again, we
certainly expect this to come up

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.919
in conversations
over the next two days.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.521
When we have any
policy announcements,

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:31.457
we will absolutely
let you know.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.492
Kevin.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.594
The Press: Thank you, Sarah,
two quick ones, one on Syria:

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:39.231
Is it fair to say the President
agrees with the French President

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.266
that a precipitous or too-quick

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:44.069
removal of America's
presence from Syria

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:47.673
would be a danger or damaging
to the Syrian people?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.842
And if there is agreement there,

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.977
is there a possibility
that the two will come

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:53.912
to some sort of
a formal announcement

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.914
during his time here?

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.518
And a follow on Mike Pompeo,
what would be

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.586
the number one issue

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:03.389
that the President would like
him to tackle assuming that,

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.324
as expected,
he is approved today?

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:10.028
Ms. Sanders: First, I'll talk
about the Syria question.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.565
Again, certainly something
that will come up.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.435
The President is committed
to defeating ISIS.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:19.605
That is our primary goal
and function

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:21.673
and of being there.
We want to see that happen.

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:23.842
The President also wants
to see the partners

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:26.245
in the region
step up and do more,

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.447
both militarily
and financially.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.715
And that's going to be something

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.618
that I can imagine
will be raised,

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.319
and we'll keep you
posted on that front.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.656
When it comes to
Director Pompeo,

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:40.025
it is absolutely outrageous

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.328
that he would not
move through quickly.

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.731
He is extremely qualified
for the position.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.867
The Washington Post,
a number of other outlets

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:51.804
that certainly aren't typically
the biggest advocates

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.139
of this President,
have said confirm him already.

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.809
I think you have to
look back at history,

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.278
specifically to Secretary
of State confirmations

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:00.813
and bipartisan votes.

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:03.315
John Kerry was confirmed 94-3.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:06.351
Hillary Clinton
was confirmed 94-2.

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:09.521
Condoleezza Rice
was confirmed 85-13.

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:12.458
Colin Powell was confirmed
unanimously by voice vote.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.626
I think that if you even look
at some of the questioning

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.261
that has been brought up
by the Senate,

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:19.865
no one doubts
Pompeo's qualifications

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.567
and his ability
to do the job.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:24.036
So, I think that not only
is the White House

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.238
but all of America should
be calling on the Senate

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.040
to actually do their job,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.409
do what they are required
and expected to do.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:33.011
And that is to help
government function

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:35.948
and to help on the safety
and the security of our country.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.684
This is an incredibly
important position.

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.285
And that plays
a big role in that

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.621
and they should certainly
support Mike Pompeo

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.623
and get that done
and get that done today.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.926
And I think, frankly, for
particular members of Congress,

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.529
that it's very hard
for them to justify

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.931
voting in favor of someone
like John Kerry

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:56.468
and not following suit and
voting in favor of Mike Pompeo.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.336
Richard.
The Press:  Just on Pompeo,

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.404
does the President
consider Republicans

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:02.841
who oppose Pompeo's nomination
to be obstructionist?

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:06.445
And separately, what does it say
to the rest of the world

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:09.248
if Pompeo can't get
a favorable recommendation

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.883
out of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee?

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.417
Ms. Sanders: Certainly,
don't think that those members

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.520
are being helpful.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.588
And I think what
it says to the world

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:19.024
is what we've been
saying for a long time,

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:21.093
is the Senate has got
some real problems

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.195
and they need to figure out
how to actually show up

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:24.630
and do their job
a little bit better.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:26.798
Mike.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.834
The Press:  A couple of --
one on NAFTA and Iran.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.837
On NAFTA, has the administration
decided whether to bring --

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.673
renegotiate the deal
back to Congress?

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:38.143
Is there a chance
that those changes

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.945
won't need
congressional approval?

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.547
And just about Iran,

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.616
that deal has been
being looked at

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:45.984
by a team
that was appointed by --

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.085
Ms. Sanders:  Let me
address NAFTA first.

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:51.189
On NAFTA, those conversations
and negotiations are ongoing.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.591
I don't have any updates
for you on that front

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.792
beyond what we've already said.

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.561
The Press: The President's Iran
team was mostly put in place

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:56.862
by McMaster and Tillerson.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.864
Does the President still have
confidence in that team?

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.633
Has he been briefed on
their developments lately?

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:05.237
And does he and John
Bolton support

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:06.939
where they're at right now?

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.006
Ms. Sanders:  Absolutely.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.541
The President has got
a great deal of confidence

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:13.211
in a number of members
across the board

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.948
that remain part of his team --
his national security team.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.150
Great group of people.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.686
And the President has been
working very closely with them.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:23.388
And most of those individuals
have been on and part

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.723
of the administration
for some time.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.225
April.

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:28.327
The Press: Sarah, a couple
questions, two questions.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.195
Going back to the issue
of Eric Garner:

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.431
A couple weeks ago,
when I asked you about

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.499
Alton Sterling, Stephon Clark,

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:38.503
and the issue of Eric Garner,
you said it was a local issue.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.039
Does this White House
give the directive now

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.408
to the Justice Department
that it's a local matter

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:45.711
and that's why it kind
of been held up?

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.480
Is that what's going on now
with this Eric Garner case?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.482
Ms. Sanders: I can't speak
to anything specific

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:54.653
in an ongoing process

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.722
that is taking place with
the Department of Justice,

00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:59.725
but we haven't given
specific instruction to them

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:02.060
other than to follow the law.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.464
And when it is a local issue,
there is not a lot we can do.

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.566
But when the Department
of Justice has a role to play,

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:08.967
we want them to be independent

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:10.168
and follow the law
on that front.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.770
The Press:  And last thing,
I want to follow up on Jim.

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.039
What you said --  breeding. 

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:18.343
The President was very clear at
his statement about this issue.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.511
He said, in a tweet,

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.179
"There is a Revolution
going on in California.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.683
So many Sanctuary areas
want OUT of this ridiculous,

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:27.386
crime infested &amp;
breeding concept."

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.287
What did he mean by "breeding?"

00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:30.789
Ms. Sanders:  Again,
the President has recognized

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.224
that this is a major problem,

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.993
and a lot of people,
even in California,

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.696
want to see the issue
of sanctuary cities addressed.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.431
And the President is doing
what he can to do that.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.899
The Press: But what does
"breeding" mean?

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:41.967
What does "breeding"
mean to this President?

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.035
Because when you
think of breeding,

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:44.736
you think of animals
breeding -- populating.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.205
Ms. Sanders: I'm not going to
begin to think what you think --

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.273
The Press:  But can you tell us
what the President thought?

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:51.443
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly,
I think that it can mean

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:53.245
a lot of things
to a lot of people.

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:56.615
But the President is talking
about a growing problem.

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:57.683
And I addressed that with Jim,

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:59.685
and I don't have
anything else to add.

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:01.553
Lalit.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.522
The Press: Thank you, I wanted
to ask you about Afghanistan.

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.524
There have been quite
a number of attacks

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.325
in Afghanistan
the last few days.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:11.196
This is the first
fighting season after President

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:12.798
announced his official policy.

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:15.400
How do you see the situation
in Afghanistan now?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.501
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry, 
what was the last part

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.537
of your question?

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.238
The Press:  How do you see the
situation in Afghanistan now?

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:21.039
Ms. Sanders: We're continuing
to move forward

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.974
with the strategy
that was announced,

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.710
and I don't have any
other policy announcements

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:25.310
at this time.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.378
I'll take one last question.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.412
Brian.

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.814
The Press: Thank you very much,
two quick questions.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:31.116
One, just to define

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.051
what the President
meant about  breeding. 

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:37.823
To be specific, he's not talking
about people having babies, yes?

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:38.724
The Press: He's not?

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.758
Ms. Sanders: Not that
I'm aware of.

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.560
I'd have to ask him
to dig into that deeper.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.361
The Press: But how do you know
he's not talking about that?

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.696
Ms. Sanders: I just said,
"Not that I'm aware of."

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.298
And I would have to ask him
to be more specific.

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.533
The Press: Okay, and in regards
to the Mueller investigation --

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:49.601
Ms. Sanders: Guys, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to hear Brian.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.403
The Press:  In regards to
the Mueller investigation,

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:56.274
I understand this administration
says that there's no collusion.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:58.910
So, if we take the President
at his word,

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.146
he can't be aware of everything
that went on underneath him

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:02.781
by everyone who works for him.

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:05.984
So, if there's someone who
worked for him underneath him

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:10.155
that is guilty or is prosecuted
by the Mueller team,

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:13.024
would he not support those
who did wrong,

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.493
even if he was unaware of it?

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:16.561
Ms. Sanders:  Certainly, we want
everyone to follow the law.

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:18.797
But I'm not going to comment
on a -- once again,

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.165
a hypothetical situation.

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:22.734
The President has been
clear he and his campaign

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.504
were not involved in collusion.
If he had, I'm pretty sure --

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:27.239
The Press: I'm not
asking about that.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.707
Ms. Sanders: Okay, you guys
would have found that out.

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.108
The Press: I'm asking about
those who work beneath him.

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:31.309
Ms. Sanders: And
I'm addressing that, Brian --

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.944
The Press:  But he would
support -- right,

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.212
he would support
the prosecution of --

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:36.081
Ms. Sanders:  The President
would absolutely support the law

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:38.216
and individuals
following the law.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:41.620
What the President
doesn't support is a year

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.689
wasted distracting the world

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.358
and the country
from the great things

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.193
that are happening
in this country,

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:51.296
from talking about issues that
Americans actually care about.

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:53.331
That's what the President
would probably

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.733
tell you to stay focused on.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.535
And with that, thanks, guys,
we'll see you tomorrow.
