00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.870
This plant, it’s incredibly important.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.020
It’s called coca and it mainly grows here.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.992
I’m right in the middle of it right now.

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:20.020
Right down here, in southern Colombia,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.740
spending the day with the anti-narcotic police, who are
looking for coca plants to destroy.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.220
Coca is harvested by local farmers,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.919
shredded, soaked in chemicals,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.460
and then cooked down into a paste.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.380
This paste is sold to cartels that use a series
of chemical processes

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.970
to turn it into the white powder we call cocaine,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.409
which is then shipped around the globe,

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.720
the biggest portion ending up in the United States.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.300
But this isn’t a story about cartels or
drug trafficking.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.780
It’s not even a story about cocaine, really.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.000
This is a story about this leaf and the families
who grow it, out here deep in the jungle.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.500
It’s these families who are most affected
by the cocaine economy and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.800
it's these families who are caught in the middle of Colombia's war on drugs.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.100
It’s a Friday evening and I’m at a police base that’s right at the cusp of Colombia’s vast Amazon rainforest.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.200
This is Colombia at some of its most rural.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.600
And this region has historically been a top
coca producer in the country.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.420
The intelligence unit just got done briefing
us on

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.520
a possible location of some fields where coca
is being harvested and processed.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.200
We touch down in a couple of spots, but only
find abandoned farms, no coca.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.880
But then after a few hours, we spot it, a
clearing deep in the jungle

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.040
and rows and rows of this light green coca leaf.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.999
We land at this coca farm and find that it’s
run by a family.

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.439
There are kids here, no guns, no resistance.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.959
Just beside their house is a shed where they’ve
been shredding the leaves,

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.499
which are now soaking in chemicals, the step
before they get sold off the the cartels.

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.249
And the police aren’t here to arrest them,
but rather destroy their operation.

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:48.360
Around 6 months of work and very likely, this
family’s only income prospects right now.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.000
The troops are clearly aware that they’ve derailed
this family’s year.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.540
Coca farms like these fuel an incredibly dangerous
cocaine industry,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.920
which hurts tens of thousands of people every
year.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.620
So are these coca farmers the bad guys?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.169
If not, why are we burning their shed?

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.829
And if they’re farmers, why don’t they just
grow another crop that isn’t illegal,

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.660
like pineapple or potato?

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.519
To find this out, I needed to go back into
the jungle,

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.519
but not in helicopters surrounded by police

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.080
but on my own.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.420
Look at this chart.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.640
This line shows coca production over time.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.020
And look what's happened since 2013.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.640
Coca production has hit an all-time high.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.079
And the largest portion of the resulting cocaine is ending up in the United States,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.540
which is the biggest cocaine market in the
world.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.920
Far away in Colombia’s capital, Bogota, the government has been trying for decades to curb this problem.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.530
Over the years, they’ve tried two main tactics
for eradicating coca cultivation:

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.259
The first entails flying over these fields and blanketing the whole area with this plant killing chemical,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.260
which is the same as the roundup chemical
that you use to kill weeds in your yard.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.980
The other strategy is the one that I was a
part of:

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.710
Sending out troops to manual destroy the crops
by uprooting it

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.960
or burning the sheds where the harvest is
being processed.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.600
But there are some major problems with these tactics.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.400
First, spraying entire areas with this plant
killing chemical doesn’t just affect the coca fields,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.479
it affects anything else it touches.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.639
Killing food crops and the whole rainforest
that surrounds these fields,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.500
which is some of the most biodiverse forest
on Earth.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.300
The UN and the WHO also found that these chemicals are

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.669
potentially a cause of cancer for the residents
in these areas.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.189
So in 2015, the Colombian government suspended
the chemical dumping strategy.

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.340
So now they’re looking for new solutions.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.050
And last year they implemented something called
the crop substitution program,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.760
where the government is going to pay one million
pesos per month, which is like $327,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.819
to any farmer who eradicates their coca crop
on their own and starts growing a legal crop,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.160
like oranges or pineapple or yuca.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.320
After a very bumpy ride, I made it to a community
that used to be an epicenter for coca production.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.020
But last year, they signed up for this crop
substitution program.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.220
All the farmers in the community signed a
pact that they would willingly transition to a legal crop.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.580
During my conversations, the farmers kept
throwing math problems my way.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.840
These farmers live and die by prices.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.389
Prices of farm supplies, prices of seeds,
prices of transportation

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.600
and of course, the price that they can sell
their crop for.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.480
Keep in mind that where I am is a place that is almost completely absent of any central government presence.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.800
There aren’t good roads, security, reliable
markets.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.640
And so when you start to do the math of all the
costs associated with growing something else,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.660
it just doesn’t add up, which is why coca
thrives out here.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.540
As this farming community tries to survive outside the cocaine economy,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.599
they’re experiencing what it feels like
to be just another rural community,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.240
cut off from Colombia’s mainstream economies.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.240
The government might may be able to pay these farmers to get rid of their coca,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.960
but without roads, markets, banks, and connections
to the rest of the country

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.340
these new economies will not take root.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.380
So now think back to that family whose shed
the police burned down earlier.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.160
They live an hour’s helicopter ride from
any town.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.219
So they don’t really have any other economic
options beyond coca,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.540
which is really the only commodity they can transport
to a market.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.980
Though I did find one family that represents
a success story for the crop substitution program.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.790
They mainly grow passion fruit.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.800
But they also grow corn, yuca, tomatoes, peppers, and
raise animals.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.960
Passion fruit juice, incredible.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.060
They switched from coca last year after an
entire lifetime of growing it.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.840
And it’s gone really well for them.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.060
But you’ll notice that this family has a huge
plot of land.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.290
Most of the farmers out here don’t have
that big plot of land.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.330
And they don’t have the ability to cultivate
so many crops to replace their coca.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.480
So as of now, all of these solutions continue
to be bandaids.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.080
Dumping roundup on these fields, manually
eradicating, even the crop substitution.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.280
The only lasting solution will come when the
government

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.460
invests in connecting these communities to
the rest of the country,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.260
so that legal economies can actually take
root here.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.120
That’s going to take time and money, but
until the government does this long, slow work,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.840
farmers will continue to find a way to participate in the only economy that pays.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.080
Alright, that's it.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.100
Borders: Colombia is over. Thank you for watching,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.260
I learned so much about this country reporting these videos and I hope you did too.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.340
Everything from the border, up to the hippos, and then learning about this new style of music.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.980
And I even got to go eat some fruit in Bogota, which was really fun.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.060
Next step for me is I'm going to start looking into the next location for Borders,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.800
so stay tuned for that.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.240
And also I should tell you that Vox just started a membership program.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.000
For $5 a month you can get access to

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.480
a bunch of behind the scenes stuff.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.780
I did this extended interview with this drummer that I met reporting episode 3 of Borders.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.780
And you can see that whole thing if you become a member.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.500
So you can go check that out on the YouTube channel and thanks for watching Borders.
