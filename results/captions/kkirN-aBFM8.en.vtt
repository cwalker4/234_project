00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Unearthly
inspirations... compelling

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.420
ordinary people to perform
extraordinary acts.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.420
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL CREMO: They've
thought it best to use members

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.330
of the human population to
communicate their message.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.460
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Heavenly
visitations... inspiring

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.830
everything from war to peace.
&gt;&gt; DAVID WILCOCK: They could

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.500
have imparted that information
to Joan of Arc to give her the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.500
confidence that ultimately led
her military campaign to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.420
victory.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And close

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.000
encounters... that leave behind
mysterious clues to our past...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.170
and our future.
&gt;&gt; NICK CISKE: I thought,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.500
"It's not gonna come out to
anything," and then something

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
that appeared to be a real
message regarding aliens

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.170
emerged.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Millions of people

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.500
around the world believe we
have been visited in the past

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
by extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
Did ancient aliens really shape
our history?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
And if so, have they been
helped by individuals among us--

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.710
chosen to communicate
important messages?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rendlesham Forest.
Suffolk County, England.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:14.880
80 miles northeast of London.
During the Cold War, more than

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.830
12,000 American officers and
enlisted men were stationed at

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.670
two Air Force bases on the
forest's northern and southern

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.670
edges: RAF Bentwaters and RAF
Woodbridge.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.000
Shortly after midnight on
December 26, 1980, military

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.670
radar detected an unidentified
flying object.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.960
And there were civilian reports
of strange, flickering lights

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.830
in the sky.
Within minutes, military

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.000
policemen, including Staff
Sergeant James Penniston and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.960
Airman First Class John
Burroughs, were sent into the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.750
woods to investigate.
What they encountered was

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.670
something the experienced
servicemen had never seen

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.500
before.
&gt;&gt; JAMES PENNISTON: By the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.670
dissipating light, I started
seeing a silhouette of a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.710
triangular craft.
It was completely black in

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.750
color, except for these
occasional bits of blue and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.330
orange light and yellow light
running through it.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.670
&gt;&gt; JOHN BURROUGHS: There was
blue lights.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.960
There was like an orange spear
above it.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.670
There was a white light that
would come out underneath it,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.830
and then there was like a misty
orange haze.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In his report,
Sergeant Penniston described the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.170
strange craft's dimensions as
roughly six and a half feet tall

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.880
with nine-foot sides.
He also noted unusual markings--

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.830
raised symbols similar to
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: I was expecting to
find, I don't know, USAF,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.000
something like that.
And what I find is glyphs,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.170
pictorial glyphs, making no
sense at all.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.960
Then I was running my hand over
the side of the craft, it was

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.080
very warm to touch.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Upon touching the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.000
craft, the 26-year-old
serviceman claimed he received

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.210
a strange and powerful vision.
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: It's ones and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.210
zeros, and ones and ones, and...
it just makes no sense.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.790
Take my hands off it-- it
stopped.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.830
And then, uh...
then there was a bright flash of

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.830
light.
&gt;&gt; BURROUGHS: And then at that

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.080
point whatever it was appeared
to go up in the air and take

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.750
off and go back towards the
coast.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.830
And we didn't have any more
contact.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Penniston and
Burroughs were ordered by the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.670
deputy base commander to treat
the alleged sighting as if it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.000
had never happened.
Still, after three decades,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.670
James Penniston remains haunted
by his strange vision.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.460
So much so, that he felt
compelled to keep a written

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.500
record of it.
A record he kept locked away

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.750
for nearly 30 years.
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: It's like, like

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.500
someone was holding a picture
up, okay, of this, zeros

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.750
and ones and... I could see it
in my mind's eye, okay?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.830
So I recorded those one
afternoon.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.670
What do they mean? I don't know.
&gt;&gt; MAN: More and more

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.120
scientists feel that
contacting...

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.710
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could the strange
numbers from James Penniston's

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.830
vision be some type of
extraterrestrial code?

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.670
If so, Penniston would not be
the first to claim to have

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.830
received messages from
otherworldly visitors.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.750
In fact, history is filled with
accounts of people compelled

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.290
into action by contact with what
they claim to be an

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.670
extraterrestrial, divine or
supernatural being.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.080
Abraham... Mohammed...
and St. Paul are described as

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.380
having been inspired by visits
from God.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.420
Moses... Confucius... and the
legendary Cambodian figure

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.960
Preah Pisnokar are said to have
met strange visitors who passed

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.420
along moral codes and
philosophies.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.000
&gt;&gt; DR. WILLIE DYE: God chose
them because of their integrity,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.500
because of their faith.
Men that were leaders that God

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.330
had chosen to put in certain
positions.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.830
People respected those
leaders.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.500
And people knew that they were
people of God.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.830
&gt;&gt; GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: According
to the ancient astronaut

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.460
hypothesis, visions are not
divine at all.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.620
They were, in fact, visits by
extraterrestrials where our

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.960
ancestors thought it was a
vision, but it never was.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.460
The person didn't quite
comprehend that he or she was

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.170
visited by flesh and blood
extraterrestrials.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.540
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Perhaps the best
known example of a man receiving

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.170
specific instructions from an
extraterrestrial source can be

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:48.380
found in the story of Moses.
According to the biblical book

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.460
of "Exodus," Moses first
encountered God in the form of

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.620
a burning bush.
It was here that he was given

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.000
his mission: to deliver the
Hebrew people out of slavery in

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.920
Egypt... and into the Promised
Land.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.790
Later, at Mount Sinai, after he
had safely brought the Jews

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.960
into the desert, he was handed
the Ten Commandments as laws

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.670
given to man, directly by God.
&gt;&gt; CREMO: Eventually, these

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:31.920
moral codes were the foundation
of a whole worldwide religion.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But to ancient
astronaut theorists, the story

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.960
of Moses may be interpreted as
not only a divine, but also an

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.250
alien, encounter.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: According to the

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.210
Old Testament, Moses went up on
Mount Sinai to meet with

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.540
quote-unquote "God."
And I quote, "And they saw

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.540
the God of Israel, and there was
under his feet, as it were, a

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:06.380
paved work of sapphire stone.
And it was like the very heavens

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.750
in its radiating clarity."
And my question is, does

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.620
something like this exist, or
was it some sort of a

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.540
misunderstood metallic ramp?
But it gets even better.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.790
Moses actually describes Earth
seen from outer space.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.880
The quote is, "Thereupon I saw
the whole round of the Earth,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.000
at once the depth of the Earth
and the vast altitudes of the

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.210
heavens."
I mean, here he describes Earth

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.000
as being round.
At the time, that should've not

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.500
been known, according to
mainstream scientists.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Is it possible that
Moses was inspired by a force

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.960
not only from the heavens
but from another world?

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.750
If so, is it possible that
other divine inspirations have

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.960
also had otherworldly origins?
(opera music playing)

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN YOUNG: Puccini said
that his great opera, <i>Madama</i>

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.960
<i>Butterfly, </i>was from God-- that
he wrote it down-- but it came

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.290
directly from a divine source.
William Blake, whose entire

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.540
opus, his writing and painting,
was based on repeated

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.830
angelic visitations.
Brahms said that his music came

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.170
from something beyond himself.
He was the one who wrote it

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:39.000
down, but he had to give credit
to something beyond himself.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could great works
of art, music, literature,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.330
and religion really have been
gifts to humanity from

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.290
other worlds?
If so, then why weren't these

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.330
gifts given directly from
aliens to man, instead of

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.120
being communicated through
human intermediaries?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.460
Perhaps an answer-- like many
alien messages-- can be found

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.460
in one of the oldest, and
holiest, places on Earth.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If, as ancient
astronaut theorists believe,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.040
extraterrestrial beings have
been contacting us throughout

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.540
the centuries, then what are
they trying to tell us?

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.120
&gt;&gt; DAVID WILCOCK: It appears,
again and again, that here on

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.920
Earth we're dealing with
something that could be

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.670
called the hidden directorate--
a directing force of

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.580
intelligent beings, who may
even be our progenitors...

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.750
and have been working with
humanity ever since we began

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.120
evolving on this planet, and
will intervene, at key points,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.000
to try to nudge our development
in a certain direction.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.960
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: Why were some of
our ancestors told to construct

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:09.620
a building...
or to build an ark?

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:15.460
Personally, I think, to ensure
mankind's survival.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.290
There are stories of malevolent
gods, of malevolent

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.620
extraterrestrials.
But, by and large, the stories

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.460
that we have from ancient
times, the gods were actually

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.880
very benevolent.
And these extraterrestrials

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.000
have helped us throughout
the millennia to survive

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.540
to this day.
(thunder crashes)

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One of the oldest
and most widespread stories

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.500
of divine or unearthly
intervention in human events

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.920
can be found in the many great
flood myths.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.920
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: There are flood
myths all over the world, not

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.710
just in the Bible.
You can find them all

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.670
throughout South America.
You can find them in Native

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.250
American traditions.
You find them in the Celtic

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.290
traditions; the legend of the
Ragnarok; the deluge.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.750
It's in Asia.
Native Africans have

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.290
flood myths.
So the story of Noah is not an

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.250
isolated event that only
happens in the Bible; it's part

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.960
of a bigger story.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The oldest

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.620
documented flood myth is the
story of Utnapishtim in the <i>Epic</i>

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:32.120
<i>of Gilgamesh.</i>
The ancient Sumerian tale was

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.120
discovered on a series of clay
tablets dating back thousands

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.420
of years.
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: Utnapishtim has a

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.960
story which is almost identical
to the story of Noah.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.040
There's only a few
slight differences.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.920
In the Utnapishtim story, the
beings that spoke to him and

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.830
warned him about this spoke
through the walls of his house,

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:02.920
and his house then became the
craft that was used to evacuate.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like Noah,
Utnapishtim collected every type

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.540
of animal in anticipation of
the flood.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.540
But could it have really
been possible to collect every

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:19.250
type of animal and fit them all
in a single craft?

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.790
Or might the ark have been a
metaphor for another, much more

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:30.000
advanced, and extraterrestrial,
form of transportation device?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.830
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: The ark in the
Sumerian story is shaped

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.880
like a cube.
We now have physicists that are

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.330
developing hyperdimensional
physics models in which they're

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.210
actually plotting out the
mathematics of how these higher

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.040
dimensions are constructed and
what they look like.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.960
It's called a tesseract.
A tesseract is a cube

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.460
within a cube.
So it's possible that the cube

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.330
that was referred to in the
original <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.500
could be describing a star gate
portal that used this type of

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.750
hyperdimensional geometry as a
way to ensure that Utnapishtim

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.330
and all the animals and the
people that he saved wouldn't

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.960
be here on Earth at all.
And that's how they were able

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.830
to survive the deluge.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Around the world,

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.040
many churches, temples and other
holy structures are said to

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.000
have been divinely inspired by
angels, gods, and even beings

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.460
from other worlds.
But why?

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.830
To honor and praise a supreme
being... or might there be

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:50.080
another purpose?
Angkor Wat, Cambodia.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.620
In the 16th century, one of the
first westerners to see this

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.290
elaborate temple, Portuguese
monk Antonio de Magdalena,

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.040
described it as an
"extraordinary construction as

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.580
like no other building
in the world."

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.880
With each side measuring nearly
a mile long, Angkor Wat remains

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.790
the planet's largest
religious structure.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.580
Although mainstream
archaeologists believe Angkor

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.040
Wat was built in the 12th
century, by King Suryavarman II,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.170
as a state temple and capital
city, Cambodian legends

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:32.040
maintain it was built as far
back as 600 BC by Preah

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.290
Pisnokar, the offspring of a
commoner father and a mother

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:43.330
who came from the heavens.
When grown, Preah was said to

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.750
be abducted up into a flying
palace by a group of

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:52.330
otherworldly beings led by the
god Indra.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.830
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The message
Preah received was to be a

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.000
leader for his people,
and a teacher.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.960
He was taught all these
different things when he was up

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.380
at Indra's heaven, this flying
palace up in the sky.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.170
When he came back to Earth,
after this long education,

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:19.290
Preah was basically the chosen
one to teach his people in the

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.830
ways of the world and
the universe.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to the
myths, Preah was also

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.420
commissioned to build Angkor
Wat not just as a sanctuary of

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.790
peace and healing, but as a
landing zone for the sky beings

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.620
who taught him, referred to as
"the glowing ones."

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.250
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The way it is
described, it says that no real

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.920
tools were actually used, but
just magical water.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.080
He was able to pour this
magical water onto stone, and

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.750
after a while, it would harden
into place.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.920
Magical water?
Come on!

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.500
There is no such thing as
magical water.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.120
So my question is: what type of
technology was used?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.750
Preah was able to build this
magnificent city with ease.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.080
That's what the ancient texts
are saying.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.460
&gt;&gt; JASON MARTELL: Angkor Wat was
more than likely built by the

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.920
hands of human beings, but the
architectural plan of

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.710
sophistication to lay out that
type of complex could not have

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.380
been engineered by human beings
alone at that time.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 6,000 miles
northwest of Angkor Wat, a

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.750
15th-century French girl also
reportedly received a divine

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:53.620
inspiration-- not to build, but
to lead men in war.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:59.790
Orléans, France.
In 1429, the city was besieged

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.420
by the English during the
Hundred Years War.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.540
The survival of the French
military and government

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.330
appeared doomed.
Then, 17-year-old Joan of Arc

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.170
traveled to Château-Chinon,
where she persuaded the local

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.920
leaders that the Saints Michael,
Catherine and Margaret had

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:26.040
visited her and told her that
her presence in Orléans would

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.120
inspire the French army to
break the siege.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.080
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: The Joan of Arc story
is a fabulous tale of a vision

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.880
really affecting history in a
practical and concrete way.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.250
France was in bad trouble.
This sensitive soul and very

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.920
young girl has the vision of
saints that come to her and

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.210
tell her to lead an army and
free a city.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:53.210
She does so.
She also has some prophecy from

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.580
these visitations that she is
able to end the siege of a

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.960
major city and make major
contributions to history-- all

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.750
because these saints came to
her in a vision.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.710
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Joan served
primarily as a military

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:13.000
figurehead, she also designed
new artillery tactics and

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.170
repeatedly outsmarted the more
experienced English commanders.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:23.670
But did her mysterious visions
actually come from heaven?

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.040
Or might the French teenager
have received, as ancient

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.750
astronaut theorists suggest, a
type of advanced

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.960
extraterrestrial knowledge?
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: If this is, in fact,

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.500
what was happening, then it
would lead one to conclude that

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.170
the hidden directorate decided
that the way the world would

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:48.170
turn out if this battle had not
been won in favor of the French

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.210
would have been an extremely
negative outcome for humanity.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:58.420
So Joan of Arc was then
contacted by a luminous

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.790
extraterrestrial being that
could have imparted that

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.540
information to Joan of Arc to
give her the confidence that

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:10.750
ultimately led her military
campaign to victory.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If extraterrestrial
beings have inspired and

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.420
affected human events, then is
it really, as some suggest, to

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.120
help improve humanity?
Or could there be another,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.920
perhaps darker and more
sinister, agenda?

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Hissarlik.
Northwestern Turkey.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:52.620
More than 3,000 years ago, this
was the walled city of Troy.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.880
According to Greek mythology,
Troy was the site of a horrific

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.670
war between the Trojans and the
Achaeans that was manipulated

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.960
by the gods.
&gt;&gt; RICHARD RADER: Thousands upon

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.620
thousands of people died, and
the city of Troy is totally

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.330
destroyed.
It's hard to imagine when you

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:21.210
read stories like this, of gods
asking people to go to war, do

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.170
things they wouldn't want to
do... it's hard to imagine that

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:31.330
they want what's best for us.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: In my opinion,

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.000
extraterrestrials are just
like humans, so, of course,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.500
extraterrestrials also would
take sides.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.670
They would take sides with
certain people and make enemies

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.080
with other people.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But when bad things

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.000
happen to good people, does it
suggest that alien visitors are

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.380
capable of having evil intent?
Or does it simply suggest the

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.670
presence of bad aliens, as well
as good ones?

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.830
&gt;&gt; RADER: You look back through
these stories-- some of which

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.620
have to do with actual
historical events that led to

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.620
blood, guts, destruction-- and
you say to yourselves, "Maybe

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.620
they don't want what's best
for us.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.120
Maybe their values and concerns
have absolutely nothing to do

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.670
with ours."
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: Just like there

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.960
are good people and bad people
here on Earth, there is good

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.080
and bad extraterrestrials
out there.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.580
Not everything is hunky-dory
out there.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.330
Good and evil permeates the
entire universe.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.120
Yin and yang.
There's a balance.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.830
&gt;&gt; REV. MICHAEL CARTER: I'm not
sure it's always that cut

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.330
and dry.
In the Book of Exodus, some

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.920
translations say an angel
killed all the firstborn

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.170
Egyptians.
Some say that "the Lord"-- and I

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.120
put that in quotations-- uh,
slaughtered the firstborn

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.120
Egyptian, uh, sons.
Hard to reconcile that, at

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.710
least in my perspective, that a
benevolent, loving God would

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:07.210
have angels to slaughter
innocents, to slaughter kids.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Half a world away
from the Mediterranean, across

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.790
the Atlantic, another massacre
of innocents was said to have

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:26.080
been directed by the gods.
Tenochtitlán, Mexico.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.210
500 years ago, this was the
capital of the Aztec Empire.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:39.000
During the 15th century AD, the
high priest Tlacaelel claims to

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.080
have received a command from the
gods in the form of a dream.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.330
His people were to perform
human sacrifices.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.330
&gt;&gt; PHILIP COPPENS: The Aztecs
are like so many other

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.710
civilizations on this planet.
For them, dreams were the

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.670
primary means of communication
with the other world.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.250
So interpreting the dreams was
the central thing which the high

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.790
priests had to do.
Now, the question is, why did he

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.330
do this?
Is this just something

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.960
Tlacaelel invented, or is it
really the fact that he had a

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.920
dream whereby this new and
brutal regime somehow had to be

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:26.880
imposed upon his people?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if, as ancient

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.830
astronaut theorists maintain,
there are malevolent gods-- or

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.620
evil extraterrestrials-- does
that suggest we have something

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.460
to fear?
Or might the evil be found not

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.210
in the message, but with the
messenger?

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.670
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The possibility
that some messages that were

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:52.920
sent by extraterrestrials
have been received and

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:59.460
misinterpreted is... is fairly
large, because our ancestors

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.830
thought that these messages were
sent by godlike beings, by

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:09.920
divine creatures, which they
never were.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.120
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Now, there's quite
a bit of evidence, even

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.460
contemporary, of people
committing murders or about

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.330
to commit murders who believe
that either God spoke to them

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.420
or something else, and we
actually find in many cases

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.830
that this is not the case,
that this is delusion.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.290
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the Bible's
Book of Genesis, God instructs

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:37.080
Abraham to kill his only son,
Isaac.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.540
But was this command really
given by God, or might Abraham

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.500
have received multiple messages
from more than one being?

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.040
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Might it actually
be, in origin, a sort of

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.830
conversation whereby Abraham
and Isaac are not subjected to

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.250
one deity but to more than one
deity giving them contradictory

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.000
messages, whereby one being
might be saying, "Kill your

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.790
son," and the other being might
be saying, "Don't kill your

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.830
son"?
Are we in fact maybe confronted

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:15.170
with two warring civilizations
or two warring tribes?

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.040
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: And I really do
think that the gods, the

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.170
extraterrestrials, knew 100%
what they were doing.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.250
Just like when we arrive on a
different planet and we

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:32.330
achieve instant godlike status,
we'll use that to our advantage.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.080
We're not gonna say to them,
"Oh, no, no, no, we're like

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.790
you."
We'll say, "Yes.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.960
You obey us or else."
And that is exactly what

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.960
happened here on Earth 10,000
years ago.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For ancient
astronaut theorists, one fact

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:54.290
is certain: after contact is
established, the fate of the

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:59.880
human messenger is not always a
pleasant one.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.710
After her capture by the
English army, Joan of Arc

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.880
burned at the stake as a
heretic.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.580
Saint Paul, who converted to
Christianity after a divine

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.290
apparition, was later executed
by the Romans.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.620
And Moses led his people
through the desert for 40

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.830
years, but could not enter the
Promised Land himself.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.880
&gt;&gt; DYE: Anytime God choose a
particular person to do a

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.420
particular job, you're always
gonna have opposition.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.540
Moses had opposition, you know,
with Pharaoh.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.080
And Paul, of course, was stoned.
Those outside entities, those

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.830
forces that came against them,
that was the burden, so to

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:43.880
speak.
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: Some people who

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.920
might have received conceivable
messages by extraterrestrials

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.040
are at first fearful that they
might have to upend their

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.920
lives, or even worse, be called
crazy.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But could the fear
of ridicule or death on the

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.540
part of human messengers
explain why there are not more

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.290
alien messages that get
transmitted?

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.790
Or might many of those who have
experienced extraterrestrial

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.960
contacts have closed their eyes
or shut their ears, simply

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.080
because the truth may be too
incredible to bear?

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:35.210
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Billions of people
around the world consider holy

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:41.330
books like the Bible and the
Koran to be the word of God.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.080
Hundreds of millions of Hindus
view the Mahabharata as a guide

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.710
to spiritual enlightenment
handed down by the god, Lord

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:57.500
Krishna himself.
Each of these holy books

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.620
contains religious principles
in the form of philosophies,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:06.040
parables and moral codes.
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: Messages from beyond

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.750
our ordinary knowledge seem to
come in a variety of forms: a

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.620
visitation, a dream, sometimes
an object, a tablet, a golden

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.290
plate, a book.
And so it helps.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.830
A book is an ordinary object we
are familiar with.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.290
And yet, if it's seen as
divinely inspired, we can take

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:27.000
it as more than an ordinary
book.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.830
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: The great
majority of mankind today

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.580
regards the Bible, the Torah
and the Koran as the word of

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.620
God.
But is it possible that these

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:45.580
books were nothing else but
guiding books of how we should

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.830
conduct our lives and that these
moral codes were, in fact, given

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:57.710
to us by extraterrestrials whom
our ancestors thought were gods?

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.960
&gt;&gt; CREMO: I don't think the
Mahabharata is a work of

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.460
fiction.
It's an actual history.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:14.290
And the history given in the
Mahabharata includes not only

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:20.670
actions of human beings on
Earth, it also includes actions

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:25.710
of extraterrestrials on other
planets and on this Earth, in

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:30.000
interaction with human beings
here.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cultures all over
the world believe deities and

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.420
other nonhuman entities
frequently communicated through

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.500
intermediaries known as
prophets.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.960
In the Koran, it's written that
God has sent over 100,000

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:53.580
prophets throughout history.
Many Native American cultures

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.670
believed gods spoke to them
through shamans, much like the

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.170
oracles of ancient Greece.
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: An oracle is a

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.880
person, but a person in some
divine state, an altered state

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.120
of some kind, who is able to
hear the voices of the gods and

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.330
then translate it into
accessible human language.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But could the same
phenomenon apply to

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.170
Judeo-Christian religious texts?
Might biblical stories of

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:26.210
angels and miracles actually be
misinterpretations of ancient

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:30.790
alien contact or inspiration?
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: The visitations or

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:36.790
apparitions come to give some
gift-- to open the mind, to lead

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.750
to a new perception, to lead to
a new possibility-- either a

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:45.460
new artistic take on something
or a new plan for humanity.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.540
Often, we're trapped in some
kind of thinking that needs to

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.040
break beyond its known limits,
but we're caught.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.670
We are unable to see, to get a
transcendent perspective.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.420
And that is what the visitation
makes possible.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If that is true,
there might be additional

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.460
evidence of alien contact by
examining breakthroughs in the

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:13.000
fields of astronomy,
archaeology and physics.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.250
Or perhaps what is arguably the
most universal of all

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:23.580
languages: mathematics.
Cambridge University, England.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:29.120
February 1913.
Mathematics professor Godfrey H.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.250
Hardy receives a letter
containing complex mathematical

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:38.540
theorems and formulas from
26-year-old Srinivasa Ramanujan

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.960
of India.
The distinguished scholar is

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.080
stunned by what he reads.
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: Hardy looks at

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.380
these theorems and says, "My
God, we've never seen anything

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.540
like this.
This is mathematics of the

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.750
highest order.
It's so convoluted and complex

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.790
that nobody could've come up
with this by their imagination;

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.210
there has to be something here."
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: An acknowledged

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:08.040
genius and mathematical prodigy
since childhood, Ramanujan was

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.500
devoutly religious, and often
claimed his breakthroughs were

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.080
communicated to him in his
dreams by the Hindu goddess

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.960
Namagiri.
In the decades since, his

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.170
theorems have proved to be
invaluable to those working in

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.960
cutting-edge fields like string
theory.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.540
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: All of the science
that we need to eventually be

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.170
able to create portals, star
gate travel, hyperdimensional

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:41.790
access mechanisms, levitation,
teleportation-- it all needs a

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.830
mathematical foundation.
And the closest that we have

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.880
right now is the Ramaianen
equations that we've been able

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.170
to decipher so far, which came
to him directly from this

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.380
goddess, who appeared to him in
dreams.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could Ramanujan
have been telepathically

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:09.000
receiving important information
that might enable humans to

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.880
build a portal or star gate to
other dimensions or alien

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.460
worlds?
If so, why?

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.040
What is the ultimate purpose of
what some believe to be alien

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:36.380
communications?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: October 2010.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.500
For nearly 30 years after their
alleged encounter with an

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.000
unidentified aircraft in
England's Rendelsham Forest,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.500
retired military airmen James
Penniston and John Burroughs

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.880
rarely spoke to each other
about the incident.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.250
Yet both men remained haunted
by their experience.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.580
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: That was a
life-changing event that

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.500
happened out there.
You know, the problem with

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.710
life-changing events, they
affect you for your life.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.830
&gt;&gt; BURROUGHS: I want to know
what it was.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.210
I think there's people out there
in our government that have

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.250
a better idea and they could
tell us what went on, what

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.670
happened to us, but I don't know
how to tell you for sure wh-what

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.170
it was and where it came from.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Shortly after his

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:27.420
reported encounter, James
Penniston had felt compelled to

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.830
write down the long and complex
numerical sequence of ones and

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.500
zeros he claimed he saw
when he touched the spacecraft.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.040
But were they really just
random numbers?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.120
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: I was getting
this-- not from memory-- but

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.420
this mental picture of these
codes written out, this

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:54.080
binary-type code.
So, I tried to suppress it, but

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.620
I just had this urge to put
these down.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.330
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: We now realize that
the best way of communicating

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:06.580
with an ancient civilization is
the binary code.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:11.710
If we know this, then obviously
anybody else in the universe

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.420
will know this, as well.
And when we know that our

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.920
ancestors, either on their own
or with some help from

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.120
strangers, knew this as well,
then we realize that really the

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.120
binary code is the best, if not
the only means, of alien

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.000
communication.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For three decades,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.710
Penniston kept the mysterious
numerical sequence hidden

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.170
between the covers of his Air
Force notebook.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.790
There they remained...
unexamined and undeciphered.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.000
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: I was scared to
death.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.620
I was sitting there going,
"Okay, there's something

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.040
wrong with you, Jim.
You're not right.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.830
You're not thinking straight.
This stuff is so bizarre.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.710
You can't tell anybody this.
They'll take your gun away from

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.830
you, they'll kick you out."
All those things were in

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.960
jeopardy.
That's what I was thinking

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.380
about at that moment.
That if I start telling anybody

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.790
exactly what I was thinking,
that would be the end of it.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.830
&gt;&gt; YOUNG: The "refusal of the
call" is probably an

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.670
experience all thoughtful
people have-- that is, there is

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.920
some project, some task, some
mission.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.250
But we waver, we doubt
ourselves, and don't

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.750
immediately respond to our
destiny.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:33.580
This is not a good thing.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After eventually

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.290
leaving the Air Force and
returning to the United

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:42.290
States...
Penniston found he was being

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:47.710
haunted by persistent dreams,
both about his experience in

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.790
the forest, and the meaning of
the mysterious numerical

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.750
message he received.
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: What do they

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.250
mean?
I don't know.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.080
I've never had them analyzed or
anything like that.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.120
I mean, we were out there doing
our jobs with a situation that

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:11.750
we'd never handled before.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In October 2010,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:16.330
Penniston entrusted his six
handwritten pages of ones and

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:21.500
zeros to a computer programmer.
He hoped the apparently random

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.080
series of numbers could be
translated into something

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.380
resembling a readable message.
&gt;&gt; CISKE: Could someone write

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.880
out six pages of binary?
Well, probably not.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.000
Um, they would need some help,
or they would have to be some

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.580
kind of savant or
super-calculator.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.330
I started transcribing it into
my computer to see what I might

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.790
find.
I thought, "It's not gonna come

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.120
out to anything."
And then something that

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.460
appeared to be a real message
regarding aliens emerged.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.540
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To his
astonishment, after plugging

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.580
the numbers into a computer, a
fragmentary sentence emerged.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:03.670
It stated:
"EXPLORATION OF HUMANITY

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.670
CONTINUOUS FOR PLANETARY
ADVANCE."

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.670
Another portion of the message
revealed what appeared to be

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:17.080
navigational coordinates.
Could this now decoded series

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.210
of numbers actually be the
evidence the human race has

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:28.620
been searching for?
Proof that we are not alone?

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.540
&gt;&gt; CISKE: "Exploration of
humanity."

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.460
Is that for good or for evil?
"Planetary advancement," is

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.120
that advancing the human race,
as many have theorized, or is

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.420
that the advancement of some
armada coming to conquer Earth?

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As for the
navigational coordinates,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:51.380
amazingly, they point to the
geographic location of a

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:56.580
mysterious sunken island known
in Celtic legend as Hy Brasil.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.790
It was said to be the home of a
civilization thousands of years

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.250
ahead of its time.
It is also occasionally

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.380
referred to as, "the other
Atlantis."

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.250
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: Hy Brasil was
believed to be a mysterious

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:15.040
land in which the people living
there had a high degree of

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:21.170
civilization.
They used sound technology and

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.710
vibrational healing technology.
They were highly ethical,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:28.330
highly moral people, and they
considered everyone over in

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.120
Europe to be barbarians, and
they did not want to mix with

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.710
them at all.
They enjoyed the isolation and

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.580
the seclusion.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if the strange

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.710
binary message in Penniston's
notebook lists the coordinates

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:47.500
of Hy Brasil, what does it mean?
&gt;&gt; WILCOCK: They may be ancient

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.750
astronauts, and the Rendelsham
Forest incident could've been

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.710
them coming back, finding a
person who was ready to receive

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.710
the message, who had the right
tuning to receive the message...

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.920
to let us know that the people
we call the Hy Brazilians are

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.790
still out there and they want
us to be ready to accept in the

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:10.620
future some sort of open
congress and communication

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.790
between our world and theirs.
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: There's certain

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.500
incidents going out there where
I know where you don't remember

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.670
and I don't remember.
But there's certain things

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.750
together we don't remember.
&gt;&gt; BURROUGHS: Right, well, even

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.000
Ed said that he remembers me
pulling my weapon, and we all

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.500
blacked out.
And I don't remember that.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:33.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In December 2010,
James Penniston along with John

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.790
Burroughs plan to return to
Rendlesham Forest-- and to the

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:42.040
exact same site where they
claim to have encountered a

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.080
mysterious craft 30 years
earlier.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.040
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: We're both
compelled to go back.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.830
Being in that area will cause
us to have total recall of what

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:53.830
happened in December of 1980.
&gt;&gt; BURROUGHS: I can't explain

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.290
it, just like I couldn't
explain it the first time, but

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.420
I think we're gonna have a
better understanding what we

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.670
need to do from there.
&gt;&gt; PENNISTON: Could there be

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.210
more?
Um... yeah.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:09.000
There could be more.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If Penniston and

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.380
Burroughs do return to the
English forest where they claim

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.170
to have had a close encounter,
what will they find there?

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:21.620
More clues?
Even more messages?

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.710
And what of the mysterious
binary code found in

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.920
Penniston's notebook?
Does the phrase: "EXPLORATION

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.380
OF HUMANITY CONTINUOUS FOR
PLANETARY ADVANCE" and the

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.080
strange geographic coordinates
that point to a lost island

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.620
really provide evidence that we
are being visited-- and perhaps

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.120
studied-- by visitors from
another world?

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.040
Could this event really be the
latest in a long line of alien

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.120
encounters that stretches back
to antiquity?

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.960
To the time of the gods?
If so, are they helping us?

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:06.000
Or are they preparing us to
help them?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.380
