00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.080
Hey, you know Pablo Escobar, the drug lord.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.650
Yeah, I’m at his old house right now here

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.880
in rural Colombia.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.280
And I’m looking for some hippos.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.699
But wait, no no no, hippos aren’t supposed to be here.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.040
They’re not supposed to be here.
Hippos exist here, not in Colombia.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.239
Pablo Escobar was one of the most infamous
and most successful drug lords in history.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.580
The guy had an entire empire of cocaine production
and trafficking throughout the world.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.340
“One of the world’s most wanted men, drug
trafficker Pablo Escobar is also accused of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.480
murder and terrorism.”
And with all of his drug money, he wanted

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.800
to build a private zoo.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.899
He imported giraffes and exotic animals from

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.800
all over the world,
including four hippos.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020
When Pablo Escobar was shot and killed in
the early '90’s,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.770
the government came in and reclaimed
this estate.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.070
And they took all the animals and distributed
them out to other zoos,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.620
except for the hippopotamuses.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.720
They didn’t touch the hippos.
They kind of just let them go free into the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.800
swamp.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.480
These hippos are now a ticking time bomb.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.170
Today there are 50 of these hippos.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.000
They proliferated very quickly
and they are now a big problem for the Colombian

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.610
government
and a threat to these locals.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.520
To understand why this is such a big deal,
you have to understand hippos.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.820
Hippos are huge mammals native to the continent
of Africa and they’re pretty aggressive.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.720
Some call hippos the most ferocious mammals
on the planet.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.540
But wait, aren’t hippos cute, cuddly animals?

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.760
There’s that one scene in “Fantasia”
where the hippos are dancing ballet with the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.319
crocodiles
and it’s the crocodiles that seem scary,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.460
not the hippos.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.400
Well, the reality is actually the exact opposite.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.860
Hippos routinely kill crocodiles.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.980
More people are killed by hippos in Africa

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.700
every year than any other wild animal.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.379
Escobar’s estate has since been turned into

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.280
a theme park
where you can kind of wander around and look

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.600
at different animals.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200
And the hippopotamuses then became a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.939
part of the spectacle.
It’s actually a pretty cool park,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.520
if I were staying here a few days, I would
totally hang out here.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.820
The audio track that’s playing that’s explaining
these hippopotamuses,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.909
frames them as this positive

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.800
experiment in conservation.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.760
That they’re able to live in a natural environment

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.260
and thrive.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.459
But I’m going to go talk to a biologist

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.340
who actually has a very different take.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.109
So the problem here is that the park can’t
actually contain the hippos.

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.469
They’ve actually started wandering and settling
down in rivers and ponds hundreds of miles

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:55.969
away.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.030
Coming up to another group here,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.760
it’s just three of them that hang out in
this other pond.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.920
So David and his team are tasked with figuring
out a solution to this problem

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.569
of how to stop these hippos from moving around
and what to do with the population as it grows.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.680
But this is really hard stuff, mainly because
no one’s ever had to do this before.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.780
Here’s why this is a big problem.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.340
What you’re looking at here is what David

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.840
calls:

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.960
Yes, this is hippo heaven.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.250
In Africa, there’s usually droughts that
stave off the proliferation of the hippos.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.480
Here there aren’t droughts.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.371
Without a natural predator or any sort of

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.840
competition, they’re sexually active earlier on in their lives,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.980
they eat more, they are just living their best lives.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.900
Colombia is one of the most biodiverse places
on Earth

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.530
and a growing invasive species population
means a disruption to that diversity.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.060
Invasive species are a top cause for a loss
in biodiversity

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.250
and biologists have already started to notice
that the hippos’ presence is reshaping these

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.240
ecosystems.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.220
But it’s not just a threat to the ecosystems.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.660
Sometimes the hippos will come into town.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.540
As the hippo population spreads, they’re

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.080
coming in contact with humans more and more often.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.700
And David worries the locals here aren’t
aware just how dangerous these animals can be.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.880
So far no one has gotten hurt in one of these encounters,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.420
but with the hippo population growing so quickly,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.160
it won’t be long before an accident happens.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.900
So David and his team have come up with a
few strategies to tackle this problem.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.000
First, they tried to physically contain them
with fences and rock walls.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.120
Okay, so fences don’t work.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.440
Next, they tried to castrate the males, stop

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.740
them from reproducing.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.920
But tranquilizing and castrating a hippo is dangerous, time-consuming, and expensive.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.810
One solution is what you do to any big, dangerous
invasive species

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.340
when they start to take over an ecosystem that
they’re not native to.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.500
You exterminate them.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.920
This didn’t go well.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.680
The hunting team went out, killed one of the
hippos and then they posted this photo,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.640
which sparked a national outcry.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.330
People did not like the idea of these hippos

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.860
being hunted and killed.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.020
The best solution, and the
one David is really pushing for, is to just

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.760
move these hippos away.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.660
But until that happens, Pablo Escobar’s

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.050
old estate will keep selling tickets to people
who want to see the hippos.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.580
David and his team will continue to struggle
to contain the situation

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.990
and the hippos, the real winners in all of
this, will continue to bask in the reality

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.700
that they truly do live in hippo heaven.
