00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.940
threat from Isis snipers was very real

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.320
only three months earlier this video was
recorded during a similar firefight was

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.460

for that I had fun center from the luck
i don't have a higher the semester deal

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.060
but they're mazeed and agile and the way
through multiple anyway but we are short

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.490
on supplies and weapons when you say
sure what you mean . er morning you left

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.000
earlier era at the hearing will actually
happen

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.560
real to me if you make it in front of
these and the house when I said this

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.680
number one they're saying but now i'm
going to use the tank fire at the

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:31.050
position with this like the one to help
me somebody in your head decision that

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.980
will get a while Obama water lines now
you lose your land together rushing off

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.290
the other hand side will also let
everybody know that it to find out how

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.340
Iraq went from mission accomplished to
the Islamic state we spoke to ryan

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.340
crocker one of the most decorated
diplomats in US history

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.570
he worked alongside General David
Petraeus during the worst years of the

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.070
war was appointed by president george w
bush to try to turn things around

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:06.090
no one would deny that Saddam was a
brutal dictator killed hundreds of

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:12.750
thousands of people in unimaginable way
is is life in Iraq 44 min Iraqis now

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.750
worse than it was then

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:25.450
iraq today exceeded my worst nightmares
I think all one has to do is is look at

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:32.380
the cash accounts as many as died in
Saddam's prisms or at the hands of his

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:40.060
desk loves far more or dying each day in
Iraq now as bad as things were under

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:46.030
Saddam they were never they were never
this bad invasion of iraq was supposed

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.960
to lead to a democratic and pluralistic
state in the Middle East a shining

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.800
example to its neighbors in a country
that pose no threat to the United States

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.800
when it actually achieved was the exact
opposite in your view is the u.s. more

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.240
likely to face a terrorist attack from
the rocky soil today and it was under

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.080
Saddam Hussein i never saw a terrorist
threat from Iran now there is the

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.490
greatest of those threats now comes from
Isis we were able to take huge areas of

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:21.160
sunni-dominated Iraq with astonishing
ease they had much greater number the

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.870
u.s. trained and supplied Iraqi army
crumble decisis advanced often leaving

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:31.660
huge amounts of weapons and vehicles
behind as they fled when we pulled out

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.960
and when the Iraqi politics increasingly
became denominated in sectarian terms

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.260
that was a very fertile ground for
Islamic state since the invasion of Iraq

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.950
the problems they have increasingly
become a conflict between Sunni and

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.230
Shiite the two main sect of Islam this
has been exacerbated by Iraq's mixed

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.280
population and its geographical position
between the two competing regional

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.680
powers Sunni Saudi Arabia and she Iran
and it shouldn't have been too hard to

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.400
see that this highly tenacious al-qaeda
element would feed on an environment in

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:16.150
which sectarian policies from Baghdad
would lead to a highly disaffected

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:23.200
Sunnis community and a great recruiting
ground on the one hand and a demoralized

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.339
population

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:29.470
that would not resist them on the other
today following almost 13 years of war

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.509
Iraq is effectively divided into three
separate state divided along sectarian

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:40.540
or ethnic lines sunni-shiite and cut
eighty percent of Anbar province is

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.709
currently under Isis control the only
way into the few areas that have yet to

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:49.689
fall across a narrow and temporary
bridge this small bridge is now the only

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:53.529
way in and out of my profits explosions
chaos with everyone trying to get

00:10:53.529 --> 00:11:01.059
supplies in cheer vegetables for gas and
this entire family they look at look at

persuaded to join us forces in the fight
against Al Qaeda this was one of the

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:38.649
most successful efforts of the entire
war and these men were supposed to be

00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:43.420

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.380
paid salaries from bank

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.580
over a year and they said America is not
giving them anything like the equipment

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.260
weapons that they need like the Anbar
tried the Peshmerga have to defend

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.070
themselves with whatever they can get
their hands on often constructing war

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:07.830
machines more ordinary parts and vehicle
is bomb-proof trucks and Humvees stolen

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.700

government who were supplied by the

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:20.250
American nearby village which is control
is still hear the planes about

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:30.440

IC positions how I'm how they died so

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.160

Sun well this is all good news for the

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.730
fight against Isis it could be bad news
for the future of Iraq State freshman

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.530
girl fight under their own flag not the
flag of iraq so any success they have

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.620
further destabilize the region are you
fighting to defeat Isis now for Iraq are

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.140
you fighting to defeat Isis and then
have a free independent Kurdistan well I

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.690
think he said horace ryouiki I'm guns
anak I've been an hour picking much Lori

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.520
and where to start but you like you are
doubles four year was working he said

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.430
then we issue number our misery Barzani
the Chancellor of the Kurdistan Region

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.630
Security Council agreed

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.880
400 years they've tried to make this
country where it doesn't because it is

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.860
built on the wrong foundations and is it
now time to admit or accept the Rockies

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.860
now three-time wasn't admitting it or
not this is the reality

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:54.580
Iraq has been divided practically if you
look shells are controlling the shower

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.530
areas Isis is controlling most of the
city areas and cursor control in the

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:05.530
credit areas it is a failed state and if
everybody wants to create their own

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:13.660
force that is our enforcement of
dividing the country so this is dustin

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:21.370
dashing that's him and this is one so
just to the bottom of this small hill is

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:33.070
a village and that's connected devices
barely two kilometers away several SUVs

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.950
it'll pick up driving around they're
saying they're all Isis there's no

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:41.860
science civilian how many 52 there do
you know you have any idea why somebody

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.490
would do something invited to supplement

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.750
so for the time being this is any border
between Curtis time and a central

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.750
Atlantic State

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:02.120
everyone's getting ready for their night
shift and 7pm to 7am is apparently

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.130
almost like what I'm gonna get attack

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:09.080

yeah

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:52.559
Iraqi Kurdistan has become a sanctuary
for many of the minorities whose lives

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:57.989
are in danger like this family of your
cds a small religious sect who Isis had

00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:04.320
attempted to exterminate so they walked
eight days through the mountains and

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:11.190
fled Isis but i think it's three elderly
women to younger women one young man and

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:16.590

it does include actually not you don't
know in my heart the managed to escape

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:27.200
prices they have their lives but what
lives that the problems in Iraq today

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.059
can be traced back to several decisions
made at the start of the campaign days

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:36.289
after president bush announced the end
of combat operations he installed l paul

00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:40.039
bremer former diplomat who had never
served in the Middle East to lead the

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:44.659
coalition provisional authority within
weeks he announced the disbanding of the

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:49.729
Iraqi military and a process called the
modification the Baathist was too damn

00:25:49.729 --> 00:25:51.440
Hussein's political party

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.219
nearly everyone who worked for the Iraqi
government had to be a member there for

00:25:55.219 --> 00:25:58.579
most of the capable experienced people
running rocks government or military

00:25:58.579 --> 00:26:04.519
were purged 500,000 active duty members
of the security forces were suddenly

00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:11.269
fired the de-baathification campaign
fueled the initial anti-coalition

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:16.489
insurgency in those years wouldn't take
a great stretch of imagination to think

00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:22.219
that an officer dismissed for no good
reason except suspicions about his

00:26:22.219 --> 00:26:27.600
loyalty is going to say I know where I'm
going and and wind up coming

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.580
the opposing count desperate for iraqi
prime minister who could stem the

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.110
violence you have settled on Nouri
al-maliki almost unknown member of one

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.460
of Iraq main sheer opposition groups had
been living in exile for over 23 years

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.770
this would have a huge effect on US
policy which was supposed to be creating

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.820
a government to represent all Iraqis
irrespective of their creed or ethnicity

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:57.299
Prime Minister Nouri al-maliki who had
come of age in a clandestine religious

00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:01.980
party that was relentlessly pursued
nearly exterminated by Saddam Hussein

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.270
why is this important as
commander-in-chief when he looked at

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.490
senior field positions in his armed
forces he cared about one thing only

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:17.370
loyalty the Maliki government used their
newfound power not to unite the country

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.140
but to take revenge on the Sunni
minority who had ruled Iraq for decades

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:28.830
there was a generalized view that if you
are Sunni you were going to have a very

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.059
very hard time trying to live in Iraq in
the Mallik years

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.260
sectarian violence spiraled out of
control entire areas were purged of

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.120
Shiites Sunnis thousands of Iraqis were
killed every month for the country look

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.210
to be collapsing exhausted by the
bloodshed when Rocky's turned out to

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.950
vote in $MONTH 2010 they voted for the
non-sectarian candidate Seattle aoi

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.920
though he won more votes than anyone
else

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.570
he didn't have enough to form a majority
despite his awful record and his

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:11.480
second-place finish Nouri al-maliki was
allowed another term in office to find

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.790
out what effect this had we spoke to ali
Gary for my advisor 25 u.s. ambassadors

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:22.610
he was the longest continuously serving
American in Iraq we were I believe this

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:28.100
close to strategic victory or at least
avoiding strategic defeat the Obama

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.790
White House chose to ignore the
elections results are normal market

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.960
became mr. for a second term and drove
the country over the cliff

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:43.750
I believe the major events in Iraq i'm
not sure how well known that is in the

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.170
US and yet you're making it sound like
that was one of the biggest mistakes of

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.940
the entire wall so bushes original sin
was invading in 2003 and Obama's

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.660
original sin was not respecting the
Iraqi election results or the

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:01.000
constitutional prices in two thousand
and without any shadow of a doubt we

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.960
spoke to a Christian family who had fled
their home in Mosul about what life was

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.960
like under the Maliki government lucky
magician Malik is our support for Jason

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.090

house or I'm didn't know what a dream

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.250
one of the captured Isis fighters who we
interviewed said the same thing about

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:39.340
life under the Maliki government and can
explain why you joined an innocent

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:47.350
headline in for once I don't start a job

understand that for many Iraqis and if

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.420
you're a Christian or Sunni record life
under the Maliki government could be

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:09.190
very bad i don't understand then joining
a group who are them beheading people

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.419

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.210
we met other refugees who have been
lucky to escape Isis with their lives

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.490
they had fled not from Iraq all the way
from Syria a journey of over 400 miles

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:10.840
they could comfort and nice done that we

this incredible standing is just on this

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:42.500
one Street we've got easy families who
fled gases at the end of the road here

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.299
there are Christians millionaires a
cache family from kobani in Syria got

00:31:47.299 --> 00:31:51.559
the system tiny tiny humans only people
with lives with it was destroyed

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:59.240
evidence of another group having success
against Isis the Shiite militias who

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.070
played a major role in insurgency
killing many US troops and then in the

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:09.590
sectarian war killing many Sunnis they
maintain close ties to Iran and

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.970
sometimes even commanded by major
general Qasim sulemani the leader of the

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:19.100
Iranian could force in charge of all
foreign military operations since these

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.240
militias so closely linked to share that
government in Baghdad they're also

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.940
indirectly supplied by the US the most
organized parties happen to be the sheer

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.950
Islamist parties had been created or
subsidized by the Iranians since the

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.880
nineteen seventies and they took
advantage of that investment the

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.740
dividends paid off quite well

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:45.080
Iraq is more polarized the number and
Baghdad is falling under an Iranian

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.710
orbit which is furthering the
polarization of the society which is

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:53.840
strengthening Isis and radical Leticia
groups like the Iraqi militias

00:32:54.509 --> 00:33:00.570
we were able to meet up with one of the
most notorious Shiite militias the body

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.279
organization as they were preparing to
retake the city of Tikrit from Isis we

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:08.279
were taken on a tour of towns that had
recently recaptured

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:19.510
so these are all Americans supplied
either directly or indirectly Humvees

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:25.809
and wraps and we didn't just see us
supplied weapon we also saw Iranian

00:33:25.809 --> 00:33:30.940
weapons on display it was clear with the
fighters loyalty late got like what

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.350
problem

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:37.510
there we met with the leader of the

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:53.200
lovable it like that while the leaders
of these militias were confident in

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.549
their ability to be Isis the captured
fighters we spoke to were not shaken by

00:33:57.549 --> 00:34:04.029
the threat right now there are many
different groups attacking Isis saying

00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:12.849
they will defeat Isis on a mind heart
and astronomy outer attach it here and

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:19.089

Iraq idlebury the nineteen seventies was
a radical militant cheers longest we

00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:02.109
defected to Iran i'm already fought on
the Iranian side during the iran-iraq

00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:07.089
war is political party has various
allegiances are Tehran in fact he was

videotape kissing the hand of the
iranian supreme leader will happen to

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:15.190
repeatedly vows to destroy America and
Israel and its allies State Department

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.450
in it in the cable said that they are
married to use to kill people using it

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:24.010
electric drill on this goal to think
that's true i can't comment on

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.690
classified documents or information but
i can tell you is I heard from a wide

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:33.880
variety of Iraqi sources that indeed the
butter coronary had a preference for

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:41.290
using power drills to kill their victims
is areas now become known as the the

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.400
killings are because anyone is still
here we assume to be Isis or a nice is

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.050
supported and the civilians who fled
over 80,000 fled so far who are Sunni

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.950
afraid to come back because they say
that these guys just assume there is

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.950
because they're sitting and will will
kill him

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:03.570
the arguments that is being made by
Washington is that we are not

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.540
cooperating directly with the militias
that where we are doing is we are

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.070
backing the Iraqi government but in
reality what's happening is the Iraqi

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:17.460
government is fully penetrated by these
Iranian sponsored groups and many of

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.450
them are now in charge of the security
services there on the front lines of

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.810
these militias they're receiving
American weapons are receiving American

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:29.609
tanks have american air support the
American diplomatic cover so in this

00:36:29.609 --> 00:36:34.410
case we are backing the Iranian
commanded Shia militias to defeat Isis

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:39.030
but the Iraqi security forces in the
iranian-backed militias are guilty of

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:43.800
the same atrocities and war crimes that
Isis is known for their beheading

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.320
individuals they are torturing and
evidence of this images every day and

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.650
yet they are receiving millions of
dollars of advanced military equipment

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:57.990
from united states what you seem to be
saying is that not only should we stop

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:03.089
financing this and acting an Air Force
for these people but we should almost

00:37:03.089 --> 00:37:07.470
treat them as a as a very dangerous
enemy they are a critical mass of the

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.980
government in Baghdad is a strategic
threat to American interests into a

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.839
light interest if you are leveraging one
radical militant Islamist group to

00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:18.960
defeat another radical militant Islamist
group that we're going to still end up

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.589
with is a radical militant Islamist
group we are creating monsters and these

00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:25.200
monsters will come back to haunt us

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.410
how did it all happen

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:34.920
oj shall even having a party but you're
just not hammer you're just not gonna

how long it costs the Odeon

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:04.180
the Shiite militias are a sign of Iran's
dominance in Iraq today I don't have a

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:11.440
very same with view of the Islamic
Republic but they're there they are

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.310
powerful and they are not irrational
they can be dealt with

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:18.850
we have dealt with them after all you
don't make peace with your friends who

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.850
make it with your enemies have if pieces
to be made

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.330
Iran's influence goes beyond Iraq to
Beirut Damascus and sinai in Yemen all

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:33.760
of which has started its local rival the
US allies Saudi Arabia raising sectarian

international coalition including the US

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.820
Britain and France stepped up their body
campaign against Isis in the aftermath

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.260
of the attacks in Paris one of the
United States oldest rivals is using the

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.100

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:49.130
Isis promise attacks against anyone who
joined the coalition against them and

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.240

up to the United if i say so defeated
then it's no it's a very big if but what

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:17.540
happens next

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:23.480
there are things worse than Isis in
occupation of large swathes of Iraqi

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.500
territory

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:31.579
what is worse would be the ignition of a
major unstoppable sectarian denominated

00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:36.290
war we are going to hear a lot in the
u.s. is is let them so out there so

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:40.640
Google let them kill each other and and
you're wise always ask that has to go

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.200
into be why it might be nice if
cold-blooded to think that all just kill

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.579
each other

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:52.310
well they want and whoever emerges on
top the most determined the most extreme

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:58.880
the most ruthless will then turn it
cites to something really tempting that

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.740
would be us

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:06.540
two reports out of cars that have been
three attacks and ongoing situation

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:15.030
later i think it is a question of when
not if there is an al-qaeda or Isis

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.300
launch terrorist attack on American soil

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.190
you just have to look at the thousands
of foreign fighters who carry Western

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:28.560
passports with a capability that
al-qaeda pretty 911 could only have

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.430
dreamed of

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:33.210
there are a lot of passionate intensity
'he's out there in the Middle East right

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:38.430
now they will prevail we will not like
the outcome

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.930
yeah

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.060
yeah
