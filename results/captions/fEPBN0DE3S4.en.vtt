00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.430
nearly every seaside village has its
stories of mysterious shipwrecks and

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.360
ghost ships legends that have been
passed down from one generation to the

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.869
next
most are easily dismissed as tall tales

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.970
that grow taller by the year but there
are also some otherworldly sightings

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.260
that defy rational explanation and leave
sailors wondering whether they've

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.310
entered the realm of the supernatural
join us for go ships

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.790
July 17th 1996 it's a warm summer's
night on Long Island people are outside

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.190
for a stroll or sailing peacefully along
the shoreline TWA flight 800 takes off

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.660
from New York's John F Kennedy Airport
loaned for Paris at 8:30 p.m. in the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.080
dark sky two and a half miles above the
earth the giant 747 explodes in a fiery

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.940
flash
all 230 people aboard die

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.140
the official conclusion of the National
Transportation Safety Board is that a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.690
spark in the fuel system caused the
explosion but Thomas Stalcup an

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.940
independent investigator disagrees
Stalcup has learned that eyewitnesses

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.990
reported a bright streak shooting up
from the water towards the jumbo jet

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.830
102 people saw this thing go up 96 said
it came from the surface Stalcup and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.560
others acquire 30 minutes of radar data
from the NTSB investigation and make a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.350
startling discovery here's the debris
field right here and you can see that

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.070
all the debris is falling in this
general area and directly below the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.159
debris field you'll see this is the
closest ship to the crash and it headed

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.390
in a south southeast direction
approximately 30 knots and this ship

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.940
according to the FBI has not been
identified this ship of unknown origin

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.540
appearing as a radar blip may be the
source of the mysterious streak of light

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.550
there are reports from multiple
eyewitnesses that a ship was directly

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.770
below a flight hunter when it exploded
these eye witnesses saw what looked like

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.600
a light on the horizon after the crash
however that light went out according to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.470
one eyewitness in the official report
the unidentified ship has no relation to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.290
the real and known disaster of flight
800

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.099
and the questions raised by Stahl cups
mystery she may never be answered they

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.920
remain riddles added to a centuries-old
collection of inexplicable seafaring and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.159
meekness

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.580
there's a whole realm of ghostly
folklore at sea starting with

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.580
forerunners which are ghostly
predictions of disaster and there's a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.819
rich tradition of those founded on the
very fear of all those unpredictable

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.849
horrible things that happen at sea since
man first took to the Seas the open

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.819
ocean has been as mysterious and alien
as outer space sailors who have thought

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.209
themselves mightier than the seas have
paid a terrible price

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.860
after Columbus discovers that you
sailing vessels begin to criss cross the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.950
vast oceans in search of new lands and
good riches

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.090
Mariners seeking the silk and spices of
the Far East sail around the southern

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.100
tip of Africa the Cape of Good Hope

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.060
often battered by severe storms and
navigating the Cape is a most

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.700
treacherous undertaking here legend says
he's born the story of the most famous

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.950
of all ghost ships the Flying Dutchman
her story begins in 1680 when a Dutch

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.840
captain named Philip van der Decken
swears of curse against God that he'll

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.009
succeed in rounding the Cape if he has
to keep trying until Judgment Day

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.680
the ship and her crew never returned
home

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.420
but they are seen again not as flesh and
bone Norwood in canvas but as a spectral

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.860
vision a seagoing ghost
sailors returning home and teller seeing

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.500
the flying dutchman under cursed cou
often before experiencing a disaster of

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.990
their own they have passed down the tale
that no soul aboard the Dutchman can

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.919
rest unless another sailor takes its
place

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.919
what fate awaits Souls lost at sea this
amazing photograph provides an eerie

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.679
glimpse at the possibility of something
beyond our normal view of the world

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:16.069
in 1924 two seaman James Courtney and
Michael Meehan died in a tragic accident

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:23.119
aboard the tanker SS Watertown following
their burial at sea their faces appear

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:28.099
in the roiling water alongside the ship
the captain grabs his camera and

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:34.759
captures their images are these ghostly
specters the last attempt of The

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.699
Departed to communicate a farewell to
their shipmates what looks like their

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.999
faces are clearly visible in this 1924
photograph

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:50.589
are there other worlds are there fourth
dimensions I'm not afraid to say I don't

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.369
know people disappear
they've been disappearing for hundreds

00:05:54.369 --> 00:06:00.069
of years and these ships show up and I
think it's an incredible mystery we

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.829
continue a 19th century ghost ship
the teaser still appears to this day in

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:11.389
Mahone Bay Nova Scotia
I kept saying oh I just can't believe

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.259
this we got to make sure other people
see this but there it was in living

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:21.259
color investigators of mysterious events
have found that 80% are miss

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:27.319
identification hoaxes or mistakes that
leaves 1 out of every 5 in the realm of

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.629
the unexplained mysteries mysteries
we'll be right back here on the History

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:42.439
Channel we now return to ghost chips on
history's mysteries in 1813 the United

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:48.379
States is at war with Great Britain
to help fight the powerful British Navy

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.809
the US government grants American
civilian vessels the authority to attack

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:59.260
British ships these ships are called
privateers

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.630
the government license or letter makes
these sailors in effect pilots

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.070
so you get these very dramatic chases
that last hours sometimes days of one

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.580
vessel trying to sail another finally
they draw near enough within cannon

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.210
range and the privateer usually only
fires a few shots across the battle of

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.480
the enemy vessel and that's usually in
most privateering battles it's a

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.290
remarkably bloodless form of warfare
usually you're attacking merchant ships

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.110
I don't have a lot of guns don't have
huge crews and they'll very quickly

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:33.710
surrender a very successful privateer is
the - a fast schooner prowling the Maine

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.110
coast
from the minute was launched it was a

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.270
very lucky ship I believe they had seven
voyages and actually 15 bounties

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.830
collected and so obviously on more than
one tour they would they would be able

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.759
to get more than one ship the crewmen
wanted to be on there for the money but

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:56.550
also for the prestige it was a lucky
ship the dashes third captain is the

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.750
recently married John Porter while the
crew prepares the ship

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.270
Porter is bidding a lingering farewell
to his wife Lois the ship was ready

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.690
everybody was ready the captain wasn't
there he was with his new bride well

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:15.150
everybody's you know right fine no he
could understand lovey dovey but come on

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.740
we've got we've got business to do part
of their business was to accept a

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.860
challenge from a new privateer the
champlain to see which boat was faster

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.599
finally captain Porter boards the dash

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.440
living up to her name the - speeds so
far ahead that the Champlain's lookout

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.039
can barely spot her on the horizon then
a furious storm picks up fearing the

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:51.010
weather the Champlain turns back the -
does not back on shore the captain's

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.339
wife senses trouble
Lois and her family are in Portland and

00:08:55.339 --> 00:09:00.649
you know it's a stormy stormy evening a
couple days after the the - is left but

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:04.819
there's a big wind that shakes the house
and there's a big crash in one of the

00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:10.490
unoccupied parlors and then one Lois
goes into this parlor and from one of

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.839
the fireplaces a tile has fallen off and
it's a tile with Scripture written on it

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:21.220
and so she reaches down and in her heart
she she says the - is lost

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:28.820
the - never returns but over the years
tales are told by Maine natives of the -

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.280
reappearing out of the fog on windless
days stopping lobstermen dead in their

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.200
tracks with its sudden appearance
the people who have seen her say the

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.170
crew on deck looks like they are looking
into the fog trying to find out where

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:51.080
they are and and how best to get home
the - makes her most famous ghostly

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.000
return during World War two before a
pair of adulterous lovers

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.949
at one particular afternoon when the fog
was thick of the three in the bed alarms

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:06.089
went off like that that something had
breached the security of the harbor and

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:09.600
they sprang into action some of them
began to fire and one of those shells

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.149
landed right on the island where these
two by having their afternoon tryst well

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:18.990
you can imagine it scared the bejesus
out of them and they wondered what is

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:24.449
going on here they said they saw coming
out of the fog this ship and here I mean

00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:30.089
there wasn't a bit of wind stirring
there was no air whatsoever and they

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:34.820
could hear
the sales luffing as she was sort of

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:41.510
coming about and as as she came about
they could see on the stern the name -

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:47.630
Freeport from a port further down the
coast sailing out of New York

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:53.840
the teaser takes advantage of the war of
1812 and becomes a privateer she heads

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.480
north of the coast
nova scotia was a british colony at that

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.839
time so we were sort of the nearest
british possession and had a very rich

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:05.589
sea trade which of course attracted the
attention of American privateer vessels

00:11:05.589 --> 00:11:10.750
like teaser the teaser captures several
ships right outside of Nova Scotia's

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:16.480
Halifax harbor expressing a flair for
the dramatic the teasers Captain William

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.480
Dobson with his single ship declares a
blockade of Halifax the British merchant

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:30.760
men and warships accept the challenge
July 1st 1813 the teaser is surrounded

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.339
by British ships including a 74 gun
warship at this point

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:40.420
captain Dobson gives orders for the
defence of his ship to his brash first

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.180
lieutenant Frederick Johnson
there's crazy folklore about Hamlet says

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.089
suggested that he fought with a
hangman's noose around his neck the

00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:53.500
newspaper reports use words like he had
the disposition of the devil he was I

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:59.440
was sort of not widely liked at a
terrible temper reports vary about what

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.839
happens next but all fingers point to
Johnson some say he carries hot coals

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.709
from the ship's galley
others say he uses a flintlock pistol

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.449
the result is the same
Johnson goes to the powder room and

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:19.740
deliberately ignites a fire while his
fellow sailors are still on board a

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.730
teaser erupted in a colossal explosion
her whole powder magazine grew up all at

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.839
once and it was just a spectacular
explosion to rip the whole deck of

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:32.860
teaser up and sent her mainmast crashing
into the water there were about 40 men

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.180
aboard teaser only seven on the survived
the explosion it's quite literally a

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.050
very explosive issue and a very
traumatic one during the war of 1812 and

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.430
one that has spawned generation after
generations of sightings of this ghost

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:51.610
ship the teaser made a most convincing
appearance to Jill and Paul Flynn two

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:57.240
residents of Mahone Bay Nova Scotia in
1970

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.620
when all of a sudden we saw this
schooner out there and we talked about

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:09.420
it and it was in the form of a schooner
on fire burning and we then you know we

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.320
looked at each other and said no boy
that must be the teaser with her deck of

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.720
flame her cruel wailing the teaser
seemingly caught in an eddy of time a

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.170
current too strong to escape quickly
vanished

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.230
I kept saying oh I just can't believe
this we got to make sure other people

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.209
see this but there it was and living
coming I'll tell ya it was in the shape

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:36.220
of a ship and it was burning I don't
have an explanation all I know as I saw

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:44.019
what I saw as quickly as she appeared
she vanished the Flynn's still walk

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:49.209
along the shore of Mahone Bay with an I
turned out to see but have not seen the

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:58.120
ghost ship teaser again when we return a
boarding party finds the Mary Celeste

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:05.320
sailing aimlessly in the Atlantic
without a living soul so they had 39

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:11.380
minutes of light to get the ghost ship
ready to sail during the war of 1812 the

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:17.290
US Navy had just 17 warships but
commissioned more than 150 private

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:22.480
vessels to attack the British when they
seized the ship these privateers were

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.459
allowed to keep whatever Luke was on
board history's mysteries we'll be right

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:33.459
back here on the History Channel
we now return to ghost ships on

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:37.290
history's mysteries

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.519
despite technological advances in the
safety and reliability of transatlantic

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:45.939
steamship travel throughout the 19th
century

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:52.319
all mastered seven ships remain the most
popular way of traversing the oceans

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.470
and regardless of the experience of
their captains these large ships

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:02.350
continue to be lost in turbulent and
unpredictable storms

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.730
when a ship doesn't reach port its
owners and relatives of the crew and

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.830
passengers know almost certainly that
the unyielding forces of nature have

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.730
gained the upper hand

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:20.749
but when a ship is found without any
sign of the crew or even the slightest

00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:24.230
hint of their fate
human nature is unable to let the

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:33.869
mystery rest
such a ship is the Mary Celeste May 1861

00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:39.149
the Amazon the original name of the Mary
Celeste is launched from Spencer's

00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:44.720
Island Nova Scotia on that very first
trip her captain dies

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.339
Stanley Spicer's grandfather Earl Spicer
is part of the crew on the cargo ship I

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:54.239
can remember him telling this at the
first sight they saw was the pride of

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:57.869
this young captain running down to see
what they had in the boat wanted return

00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:06.259
she knew that her young husband was hid
the Amazon couldn't shake her bad luck

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:11.999
and while later the ship went over to
England and sailing in them in the

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:17.699
English Channel and it ran into a ship
in sanctum so one thing after another

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:23.910
there was tragedy all through its
existence

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:29.700
the ship changes hands several times one
owner perhaps seeking to change the look

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:35.610
of the ship changes her name from Amazon
to Mary Celeste the odds and tradition

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.840
are against it

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.699
in the Western world we call ship sheep
because they really have a personified

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:46.720
identity and for you to go mucking a
boat with the a day that ship you know a

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.459
lot of mariners think that's a very bad
idea

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:57.339
Thursday morning November 7th 1872
Captain Benjamin Briggs his wife Sarah

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:02.290
their two-year-old daughter Sofia and a
crew of seven set sail from New York

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.209
Harbor bound for Genoa Italy

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.650
their cargo is 1700 barrels of
industrial alcohol November is never a

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:19.110
good time to be sailing on the Atlantic
November 1872 turns out to be a

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:24.900
particularly bad time the reason we knew
the weather was bad was that ships were

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.600
arriving in the Port of New York in
November reported heavy seas gale force

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.090
winds it was a tough time in November
that year despite the inclement weather

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:41.180
things are shipshape for the first few
weeks of the journey

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:48.440
the logbook itself shows that everything
was fine up until November 24th and the

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.750
Mary Celeste is not alone on the wide
Atlantic Seas eight days after she

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.170
leaves New York
another double blasted Brigantine the de

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:02.840
Gracia also built in Nova Scotia leaves
the harbor bound for Europe like the

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:08.690
Mary Celeste
she carries ten people on the afternoon

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:14.840
of December 4th 1872 the lookout on the
Dei Gratia spies something in the

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.960
distance

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.490
they look at her with the spyglass kind
of see no one on board they're probably

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:26.140
very curious at that point they get
close enough to hail her but no one

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:32.140
responds captain David Morehouse of the
Dei Gratia sends his first mate Oliver de

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.540
veau and two others to inspect the
mysterious ship it probably had a very

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.340
eerie feeling you know you kind of
worried this vessel and here is me after

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.980
cabin my skylight is open that the cabin
door is open everything is wet not a

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:54.250
sign the ladies de veau returns to the
Dei Gratia and asks Captain Morehouse for

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.530
permission to sail the Mary Celeste 600
miles to Gibraltar and their claim the

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.519
salvage rights Morehouse says yes to Deveau .

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:10.339
He takes two men over to the Mary
Celeste and boards her at 4:00 in the

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:17.359
afternoon sundown is 4:39 so they had 39
minutes of light to get the ghost ship

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:23.450
ready to sail that's a gutsy guy. Deveau 
succeeds in sailing the Mary Celeste

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:29.299
safely into Gibraltar the authorities
are immediately suspicious convinced

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:35.080
there has been foul play there is a
hearing generating 66 pages of testimony

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:42.499
the case makes headlines around the
world they don't believe the story

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:48.289
that's told by the people in the Dei Gratia. Clearly things don't add up the

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:54.259
ship has food water working sails a
working pump even a sewing machine and a

00:19:54.259 --> 00:20:00.259
melodeon a 19th century version of a
portable piano. The cargo except for a

00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:05.450
few broken barrels is secured in the
hole they've left behind tobacco oil

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:11.650
skins raincoats and the captain's log
what's missing are the sextant the

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:17.610
lifeboat and every human aboard the Mary
Celeste

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.899
Captain Briggs his wife two-year-old
daughter and the seven crewmen vanished

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:30.679
where did they go
a sword belonging to Captain Briggs is

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:36.230
found on the ship it looks like it might
be stained with blood some speculated

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.730
that perhaps pirates came aboard and
kidnapped the crew others thought an

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.019
arrangement between the captains of the
Mary Celeste and the Dei Gratia had

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:50.830
somehow gone sour which sparked a fight
the cabins were wet with salt water

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:56.210
perhaps there was a waterspout that
watched the people overboard without

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.799
proof of any wrongdoing on the part of
the crew of the de gracia the court

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:06.679
reluctantly grants a salvage award the
court in Gibraltar believed that they

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:11.330
were pirates and that they didn't want
them to profit so they came up with a

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.210
compromise they only awarded them a
little over eight thousand dollars on an

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:22.850
$80,000 ship and cargo over the years
the focus for a true solution to the

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:28.420
mysterious disappearance of all aboard
the Mary Celeste centers on the cargo

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:33.040
she had a cargo of industrial alcohol
which has very potent fumes and had had

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.000
a patch of rough weather and one of her
hatches had been pulled open probably to

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.870
vent the cargo and that may have sort of
created a sort of a very ominous

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.800
whooshing noise and a and a smell like
the ship was about to explode

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.400
and Mary Celeste's crew probably did a
temporary evacuation to let their ship

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:55.060
vent, fearing an explosion. The crew unrolled
the main peak halyard, which would give

00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.400
them a line of at 300 feet long and
three inches in circumference and they

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.930
hooked the small boat onto them they
were towing along behind and it could be

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:11.050
that a gale came up at that point and
simply blew the ship away and it's it's

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.120
a kind of a chilling thought to think of
ten people in a small boat watching

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.160
their brig just sail away into the ocean
their chances of survival are nil at

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.710
that point it's estimated based on the
last location of the Mary Celeste in the

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.600
law dated November 25th and her location
when the Dei Gratia found her on December

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:38.559
4th that she sailed some three hundred
and seventy eight miles alone,

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:44.120
a ghostly presence on the open sea.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.390
and as much as the simplest solution
makes sense

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:53.900
other tantalizing evidence suggests
another fate for the Mary Celeste the

00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:03.200
first mates wife claims that on the
night of November 25th she had a dream

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:10.990
that said that her husband had been
murdered at sea

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:18.050
and she woke up screaming in the middle
of the night and she has no explanation

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:24.950
but believes very much that there was
immunity now interestingly his sea-chest

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:30.320
her husband sea-chest was found in it
was a letter he had started to his wife

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:40.610
on November 25th and had just abruptly
quit oh I think we will never know what

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:46.270
happened we can always keep guessing and
other people will be coming up with

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:54.740
probably more stories and more ideas but
as some writer said since you cannot

00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.820
subpoena the dead it is impossible to
ever know

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.669
when we continue a five masted schooner
finds its final resting place in the

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:15.220
graveyard of the Atlantic so from the
very beginning it's got this appearance

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:23.679
this ghostly appearance. Elsewhere in the
world in 1872, in Denver German immigrant

00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:28.299
Adolph Coors purchased a local bottling
company the beginning of his brewing

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:33.520
empire. In Washington, former slave
Frederick Douglass ran for Vice President

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.010
on the ticket of the Equal Rights Party
and in the American West Yellowstone was

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.179
established as the world's first
national park to search any time in

00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:47.220
history use the world timeline at
History Channel.com

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:54.100
We now return to Ghost Ships on
History's Mysteries

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.780
A combination of nature's forces results
in difficult sailing conditions and

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:04.299
struggles sometimes vicious winds and
powerful currents off the curving coast

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:07.450
of North Carolina
the warm waters of the Gulf Stream

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.890
flowing north collide with the cold
waters of the North Atlantic creating

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.600
potentially deadly seas perhaps the most
dangerous area is found among the

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.919
shifting sands just off Cape Hatteras in
an area called diamond shores it became

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:29.409
widely known as a graveyard of the
Atlantic one ship stands out among the

00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:33.880
more than 2,000 that have ended their
useful lives along the perilous coasts

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.840
the Carroll A. Deering. Hardly a year
passes that you don't see a story and

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:47.130
some of the newspapers around here about
the Ghost Ship of the Diamond Shoals

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:54.070
January 31st 1921: The rugged
coastline is nearly empty except for the

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:59.440
life-saving stations. Officials know the
history of lives lost along this stretch

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.659
of sea and establish remote outposts
staffed with brave men prepared to risk

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:10.000
their lives to save others
just after sunup at 6:30 a.m.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.740
one station spies a ship.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:22.390
Surfman C. P. Brady is stationed at
Hatteras Inlet and notes a schooner all

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:29.120
sails set stranded on the Diamond.
Four different life-saving crews attempt

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.740
to reach the ship through the tumultuous
waters

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.910
and they can't get closer than a quarter
mile to the ship and because it's still

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:41.080
shrouded and mist they can see that it
is a large screener they can see it has

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.750
five masts, but they can't identify the
name. The ship is discovered and there it

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.950
is just kind of sitting out there. So
from the very beginning it's got this

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:57.370
appearance this ghostly appearance. And
they saw no sign of life there had been

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.470
no indication of any kind of distress
signal so they had to go back to shore

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:07.120
and add to wait I think four days before
they could go out there and actually

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.429
identify the vessel when they do return
they learn that the ship is to Carroll A.

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:17.710
Deering but it's what they don't find
that is mystifying unexplainable and

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:23.550
ominous
there is not a soul on board the ship is

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.670
deserted
they seem to have vanished in a hurry

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.970
but the food is in the galley on the
stove on the table

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:35.580
and there's no evidence of what happened
the lifeboat is missing and there is a

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.750
ladder over the side but there is no
sign of the coolie

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:47.130
there are what some might call signs and
importance preceding the Carroll A.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:54.059
Deering entry into the small club of
ghost ships at that time the captain and

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:59.880
part owner of the Deering was William
F. Merritt and his son S.E. Merritt was the

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.900
first mate on board and when they signed
down the crew Merritt stated that he did

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.110
not feel comfortable with the crew he
didn't like them and he did not look

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:14.010
forward to his voyage with them. September 1920 the Deering a cargo ship sets out

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:18.090
from Boston to Buenos Aires Argentina
with a load of coal.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.570
but on their way south they stopped at
Lewes, Delaware

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:28.440
Captain Merritt says he's sick. Both he
and his son, the first mate, disembark. We

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.760
don't know if he really was sick or if
something else was going on but he gets

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:39.270
off the boat and a new captain gets on, a
Captain Wormell. The new captain takes the

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:44.610
ship safely to Buenos Aires and the
cargo is unloaded. Returning home empty

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.679
as ships are not always able to arrange
a return cargo they stop first in Rio de

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:55.380
Janeiro Brazil later reports state that
captain normal feels the same way about

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.419
the crew as did its previous captain

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.650
he shares these misgivings with fellow
sea captains in Rio and later in

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:08.840
Barbados but continues on

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:14.810
working their way up the Carolina coast
they pass light ship number 80 off Cape

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:20.330
Lookout the light ships are essentially
floating lighthouses a crew member hails

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:27.530
the light ship it is January 20th the
crew member mentioned that the Deering

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:34.040
had lost her anchors in a recent Gale
and would the master contact the Coast

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.330
Guard the master of the light ship
signal back that he could not do so

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.320
because his radio was was not
functioning properly but he would do

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.080
what he could to get the message out the
late ship master makes one crucial

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.610
observation about the sealers aboard the
Deering he commented that the crew that

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:58.130
he observed on deck seemed to lack
discipline seemed disorganized and were

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:04.280
most certainly not of Scandinavian
extraction. His exact words were "small

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.950
brown men of color" It's revealed later
during the inquiry that the original

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:15.870
crewmen were all from Scandinavia
the next time the Carroll A. Deering is

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:20.940
seen is through a spyglass on the
morning of the 31st of January she is

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:27.930
sitting amidst the sea and spray stuck
atop Diamond Shoals four days later a

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:34.500
captain of a salvage tug is the first to
order he finds no bodies no notes no

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:41.460
sign of anything except a hasty exit if
a body washed up people would have

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.790
figured out him word would have gotten
out that bodies washed up and people

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.940
would have figured out that they would
have probably have come from the Carroll

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.880
Deering but nobody's ever turned up
anywhere because of the mysterious

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.110
disappearance of the captain and crew
and the persistence of Captain Wormell's

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:03.620
daughter Lulu an investigation is
launched by the US State Department

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:09.680
A letter is written to all ports with an
American representative: "Reporting the

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.870
loss of the American schooner Carroll A.
Deering under circumstances which are at

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:20.300
least suspicious the department is
desirous of obtaining any information

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.740
possible regarding the present
whereabouts of any member of the crew of

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:31.150
either vessel in order to determine
whether or not there has been foul play".

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:37.080
No trace of the captain or crew turns up
most people still feel the fate of the

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:44.030
doomed crew was sealed not by some
supernatural cause but by man

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:49.920
I think what happened was that something
went wrong on the vessel whether it was

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.550
evening piracy illness I'm inclined to
think all of a sudden they're heading

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.870
for Diamond Shoals and they figured "We
better get out of here" The ships boats

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.820
were gone and I had been part of that
crew I probably would have won to get

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.630
him one of those boats in a hurry and
get away from there well they bet the

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:16.320
Gulfstream going offshore they've got
the southwest wind and stormy that time

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:23.610
going offshore and it seems to me that
it's entirely possible that they might

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.809
just have drifted to sea.

00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:32.520
Despite years of searching and sifting
through the meager clues left behind no

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.220
one is able to solve the perplexing saga
of the missing crew the State Department

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.740
drops the case for lack of evidence
sometimes the bodies of those lost at

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:51.179
sea wash ashore sometimes they become
part of the Seas themselves the reasons

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:55.140
for the disappearance of the captain and
the crew that left the Carroll Deering a

00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:01.660
ghost ship sailing alone to her demise
on Diamond Shoals remain unanswered

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:07.810
there are all these stories of seagulls
being on the rigging and the masts the

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:12.820
racket that the seagulls were making is
just an awful coffin II of bird noises

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:20.230
but that perhaps the birds and their
sorrowful cries were the spirits of the

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:26.590
sailors and the missing crew. When we
return, the trading vessel Joyita

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.890
sets out on a 40-hour trip in 1955 and
turns up six weeks later still afloat

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:39.010
but the entire crew is missing. A hundred
years after the event, people will still

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:46.300
be asking the question what ever did
really happen to the jory to the largest

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:52.120
schooner in history was the seven
mastered 400 foot Thomas W Lawson built

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:58.330
in 1902 in Massachusetts just five years
later she was destroyed in a storm most

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:03.310
of her crew members were killed
history's mysteries we'll be right back

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.750
here on the History Channel

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:13.570
the Tokelau Islands part of New Zealand
are administered from Apia Samoa about

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:20.140
270 miles away like many islands in the
region their economy is based on simple

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:25.429
natural resources coconuts and bananas
the oil of the coconut made from the

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.360
coconuts copra is a sought-after
commodity

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:36.500
in March 1955 a 69 foot fishing vessel
called the Joey toe sails into the small

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.840
harbour city of Apia Samoa this
one-of-a-kind boat has an interesting

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:47.930
history she was commissioned in 1931 by
a Hollywood director and may have been

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:53.120
the site of a starlets murder she was
also used by the US Navy during World

00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:00.770
War two she was chartered in 1952 by a
seventh generation sea captain an

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.180
Englishman named Thomas Henry Miller
called dusty by his friends

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.500
Miller plans to use the joie de for
commercial tuna fishing in the South

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.140
Pacific

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:17.210
Terry Dunleavy remembers the first time
he saw the Joyita and its captain in

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:23.870
1954: And we met Dusty Miller and he
took us out fishing for a day on Joyita

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.940
and I thought what a wonderful little
ship it was. He was now on the threshold

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:34.640
of achieving something and making some
money and doing the things that he liked

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.730
doing; fishing and going to
going to sea. The life of a fisherman at

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.320
the mercy of the tides the weather and
the vagaries of an uncertain catch is

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.710
not easy
Miller wanders around the South Pacific

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:54.690
for three years, but both he and his boat
are having problems.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.380
It was obviously in deteriorating condition
no one was really doing any

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.329
maintenance, it didn't go to sea at all
during that time. So it was a shadow of

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:08.640
its former self. Despite her condition
the Joyita and Miller are chartered by

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.349
the E. A. Coxon company to undertake a
trading trip from Apia, Samoa

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:19.280
to the Tokelau islands. There are staples
to deliver and raw materials to pick up.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.380
Ten Tokelau Islanders also come aboard
as passengers. I have a very vivid

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.119
memory we knew that this charter had been arranged and the ship was due to sail on

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:35.750
a Sunday at noon it was still there when
I went to bed and I thought "Uh-oh,

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:41.390
something must be wrong" But when I woke
up in the morning it had gone.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:48.820
The Joyita's cargo includes forty-four 150-pound bags of flour, fifteen 70-pound bags of sugar,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:56.380
eleven 56-pound bags of rice, empty metal drums and lumber.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.020
It was a small boat, basically a fishing boat, should
have carried 10 people at most and had

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.520
25 and was carrying a lot of cargo as
well and the reason for that was just

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.380
that there was no regular service. If
people wanted to travel they had to go on whatever boat happened to be going.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.520
The trip should take just under 41 hours

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.740
Lloyd Webber is in the radio shack and
receives a message from the Tokelaus

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.230
that the Joyita had not arrived as
scheduled:

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:27.130
"No, no sign there Sir" That's when we
alerted Laucala Bay  "I think we've got a

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:34.960
missing vessel" and they were in the air
next-day. Giant Sunderland flying boats

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.910
take to the air in a massive air rescue
search it covers nearly half a million

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:43.380
square miles of ocean

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.549
I actually managed to get aboard one of
the Sunderland's and fly with them on

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:52.720
the search before I saw it a couple of
times but they turned out to be

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.990
Whitecaps
after nine days of searching and

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:04.310
tallying 163 hours of flying time the
hunt is called off the joy eat is given

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.110
up for lost along with all 25 people
aboard

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:14.390
nobody was found and I mean there comes
a time in any situation like that where

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.860
you say well look we've we've looked
everywhere where the ship is supposed to

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:25.640
be it must have gone down then on
November 10th five and a half weeks

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:32.210
after she left Apia the joie de is found
600 miles southwest of her destination

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:37.670
in the waters off the northern Fijian
Islands she's half submerged her

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:43.970
portside completely underwater the cargo
is mostly missing there's no sign of her

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:49.300
25 passengers the fresh food and water
for the passengers is still on board

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.820
the captain who found her said he didn't
see any logbooks charts messages nor any

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:01.310
indication of the fate of those on board
to me the CAD no mystery though it was

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:05.210
simply the fact that they set sail from
a pier they sail north all that day all

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.420
that night and the next day and then
disaster strikes and we have no

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.780
transcript we have no record we know
nothing about what they did what they

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.650
said during that time and that's that's
quite a large mystery to my face

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:23.499
the Jowita is thoroughly examined and
photographed they find four mattresses

00:39:23.499 --> 00:39:29.980
thrown over the engines the radio is
tuned to the distress frequency 2182

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:36.130
and yet no distress signal was ever
heard she is pumped dry and towed to

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:43.509
Suva Fiji a commission is appointed to
conduct an official inquiry they choose

00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:48.519
to separate the casualty of the ship
from the casualty of the passengers they

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:52.529
report in detail the problems on the
ship throughout its fateful journey

00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:57.339
including a deteriorating engine
fractured pipes that cause a leakage

00:39:57.339 --> 00:40:02.829
rate of two thousand gallons of water in
our broken pumps and a broken radio

00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:08.769
antenna but in the matter of the
casualty of all passengers after nearly

00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:13.599
two months and three hundred pages of
testimony the official inquiry states

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:19.059
they must regard the fate of the
passengers and crew as inexplicable on

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:24.779
the evidence submitted at the inquiry
there are no answers only more questions

00:40:24.779 --> 00:40:30.880
the biggest one being why did they leave
the ship

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.840
must have been terrifying for them the
Sun would have set on that night

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.190
something like 620 and we know that the
boat was taking on water quite a

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.780
considerable rate but everything
happened during the night I'm myself

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.580
convinced that they left the ship
voluntarily hastily men in poor order

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.350
because they thought it was going to get
sighs others maintain that dusty Miller

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:57.520
who had once bragged to the appia harbor
master that the joie de was unsinkable

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:03.480
would have never left his ship
my first thing is that something

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.950
obviously happened to dusty miller
because he would have known that the

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:12.210
ship would never sink and and he would
have never have left it because he would

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.270
have more than anybody else would have
known that they'll be out looking for us

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.810
they'll send our airplanes and send our
chips the best thing you can do is stay

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:24.420
with the ship the crew may have believed
an SOS was sent out the radio was found

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.310
to have been sent to the proper
frequency the distress message they

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:33.359
thought they had sent or wish to have
sent would have said we're 35 miles

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:37.440
south of the token Islands we are
abandoning ship place in help had they

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.760
done that a Sunderland would have flown
up from Fiji the next morning and in all

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.859
probability rescue
not a single trace of the passengers has

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:53.910
ever surfaced what could possibly have
lured Miller and the other 24 passengers

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.440
away from what was perhaps their best
chance of survival even with no engines

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.099
and no power

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:05.369
theories range from waterspouts to
Japanese fishermen fearful of

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:10.750
competition to Russian submarines to
UFOs

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:16.830
some claim that dusty Miller was a
communist working for the Soviet Union

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.190
I guess you could say that the jointer
is the South Pacific

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:27.450
Marisa list unless someone comes forward
the truth of the Jowita and the fate of

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:33.180
her 25 Souls will remain a mystery of
the sea another ghost ship with a

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:39.869
missing crew lost forever to the world
forty-five years later I still ask

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:45.800
myself what what happened we don't know

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:51.990
in 1998 Prince Edward spotted an old
schooner bearing an uncanny resemblance

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:57.450
to a famous British ghost ship that had
been sunk in 1878 and Edwards

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:02.580
great-grandfather King George had a
similar experience he was a 16 year old

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.950
naval cadet when he wrote this ominous
entry in his logbook at 4:00 a.m. the

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:13.050
flying dutchman crossed our bounds the
future King of England was sure he had

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:21.300
spotted the most famous ghost ship of
