00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.880
See the difference — that's the motto of
China's global news network CGTN.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.580
But seeing the difference comes
with a catch.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.720
CGTN is an arm of China Central Television

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.920
which claims to be
the world's largest television network.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.820
And it's at the forefront of a
sophisticated global campaign.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.040
Beijing is training up foreign journalists buying up space in overseas media and expanding

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.300
its own networks on an unprecedented
scale in an effort to disrupt what it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780
perceives to be Western hegemony over
global media.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.960
I'm Sean Mantesso and this is China Watch.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.579
In this episode we delve into Beijing's expanding global

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.590
media presence and how China is
weaponising the free press to advance

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
its aims and ideology across Australia
and the world.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.180
… paid a rare visit to state media facilities
in Beijing including CCTV.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.420
she offered words of encouragement to aspiring Chinese journalists …

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.920
I see that your team is an international team.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.000
I hope you can report developments on the Chinese

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.142
economy and society objectively and
comprehensively.

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:48.540
Tell true stories of China, publicise Chinese culture

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.180
and build a friendly bridge with locals.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.060
True stories of China — those are the words
Chinese President Xi Jinping used in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.120
this 2016 visit to China Central
Television in Beijing.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.060
His tour coincided with an ambitious rebranding of China's new global face,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.600
CCTV's international arm CGTN.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.960
It's a multi-language international news
channel.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.500
It claims to reach more than 140 million homes across 100 countries

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.680
including 30 million in the United States.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.140
Chinese media offices are all over the world — they are the most expensive

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.140
network of media organisations in the world

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.480
So they employ thousands of non-Chinese English-speaking native journalists,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.220
editors, media managers, PR personnel
etc

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.380
With bureaus in Nairobi, Washington, DC and London

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.110
CGTN is fast becoming the key pillar in a decade-long expansion of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.600
China's foreign media. And in a sign of
CGTN's growing reach, its billboards even

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.840
started springing up across Australia
last September.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.340
As Western media outlets grapple with falling revenues and job
losses

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.640
CGTN received more than 6,000 applications for the first 90 jobs at its London Bureau last year.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.440
But experts warn you could be getting more than you bargained for

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.840
when signing up to work for Chinese state-run media.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
I will always say if many of them are
living collaborators.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.380
The practical reasons … because the pay is really good or for many other reasons.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.960
China's media say they provide an
alternative voice from a Chinese

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.530
perspective but in the same year as
president Xi's visit to CCTV

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.600
headquarters he made it clear what a
voice from a Chinese perspective would be.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.980
He told journalists all the work by the party's media must reflect the party's will,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.260
safeguard the party's authority and safeguard the party's unity.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.880
They must love the party, protect the party

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.240
and closely align themselves with the
party leadership in thought, politics and action.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.700
And a central tenet of Beijing's media strategy

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.520
has been the repudiation of Western journalistic values.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.420
A leaked 2013 government directive shed
light on how Beijing perceives Western media.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.449
Known as 'document nine' it openly
attacked Western journalistic values

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.190
saying the West's idea of journalism
undermines our country's principle that

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.480
the media should be infused with the
spirit of the party.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.680
A Free Press, in the Western sense of the word,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.760
is one of the one of the ideological threats they see to their system.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.160
If you're able to crowd out other stories now you're not competing as well

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.120
Now there's less potentially negative journalism about China.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.300
And a quick look at some of CGTN's content reveals the active way in

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.660
which the network is pushing back against what it perceives as Western media bias.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.920
Last year while reporting the Chinese Communist Party's annual dialogue

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.340
with the world, the China editor of a
mainstream Western media outlet

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.280
went about the venue of the event complaining

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.660
that she couldn't get anyone to have a dialogue with.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.820
Since when have journalists had the
power to talk to whomever they want,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.020
wherever and whenever they want?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.260
Talking about brainwash, I think the many of the practitioners

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.680
are brainwashed by this Western values of  journalism.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.480
China rejects, categorically, the Western
political model.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.080
And the country is rising fast.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.560
The Western media … Western medi …Western … Western Western …

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.160
That has been the fallacy of the Western media when it comes to reporting on China.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.120
Not lying, but never telling the whole truth,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.160
But in a sign of just how audacious
China's merging of state with media has become,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.940
Beijing has, at times, asked its
journalists to go beyond their brief as

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.740
reporters and act as intelligence
gatherers.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.900
So I don't think it's their primary function by any means,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.860
but it but it is something that comes up where your

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.640
main client is not the audience that
you're producing your show for —

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.700
your main client might well be via the Chinese state.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.160
This was the case for one Canadian
Xinhua reporter.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.900
Mark Bourrie claims he was asked to report on a visit

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.960
to Ottawa by the Dalai Lama in 2012,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.120
but not for broadcasts.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.660
Instead the information was
to be fed directly back to Beijing

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.920
In a sign China is willing to actively
recruit its journalists, even foreign,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.340
to act on behalf of the state.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.120
Mr Bourrie resigned immediately.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.060
But CGTN and Xinhua form only a part of China's audacious global media push.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.120
Also relaying Beijing message to the world is China Radio International.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.360
Thanks for tuning in.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.000
You're listening to China Radio
International.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:01.760
Like its television partnerCGTN, CRI is being weaponised and deployed across the globe on a staggering scale.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.780
A 2015 Reuters investigation revealed there were

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.520
at least 33 radio stations across 14
countries that are part of a global

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.870
radio web structured in a way that
obscures its majority shareholder,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.820
state-run China Radio International

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.280
In Australia Chinese language radio is
being bought up by CRI or CRI-affiliated

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:29.780
companies across nearly every major city.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.199
They have effectively monopolised the

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.420
Chinese language airwaves.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.399
If you're looking for an alternative voice you

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.360
either have to go on the internet or
maybe a couple of hours a day of SBS

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.490
broadcasting, but really there aren't too
many alternatives available if you're

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.700
just turning on the radio.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.020
And beyond the airwaves China has embarked on a mass campaign

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.420
to buy up space in print media 
the world over.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.260
Newspapers adorned with full-page spreads and glowing assessments of China's President

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.840
can be found from Sri Lanka to Poland to the US and, yes, even here in Australia.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.280
In 2014 President Xi said that he would
create a new type of mainstream media,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.540
one that is powerful, influential and
credible.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.920
But could China's foreign media push,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.120
while astonishing in scale, be more
a lame duck in execution?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.860
Unlike other successful state-sponsored non-western media giants like Russia Today and Al Jazeera,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.540
China's foray into global media
has been unable to draw much

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.960
journalistic clout and questions remain
over how many people are actually tuning in.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.820
CGTN's 73 million Facebook
followers may appear robust.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.460
It's actually more than Al Jazeera and the
BBC combined. But two-thirds of the

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.980
network's traffic is thought to come
from China.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.320
CGTN America's YouTube videos often
attract less than 100 viewers,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.080
a paltry sum compared to overseas rivals.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.920
So it's it's kind of caught between these two goals.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.800
It wants to be the BBC, but at the
same time it wants to please the Party bosses,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.020
and what pleases the party bosses
isn't necessarily the kind of thing that

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.220
is going to get you and me tuning into
to be entertained.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.280
Literally the very first few minutes of CGTN's life were a series of dot points of Xi Jinping …

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.110
you know, with these kind of
sphinx-like quotes about 'China must

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.800
understand the world and the world must
understand China' — these meaningless

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.880
phrases from the leader and not the kind
of thing that are you know would really

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.740
make you want to turn into a TV station.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.700
President Xi Jinping earlier sent his congratulations …

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.040
President Xi said the relationship between China and the world is changing …

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.560
China needs to better understand …

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.000
Xinhua and CGTN, unlike Russia Today or Al Jazeera, have not yet created a palatable

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.480
international brand. The scale and, at
times, covert nature of China's push has

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.200
no doubt rattled security pundits across
the Western world.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.700
It has developed a more robust and sophisticated media strategy,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.120
but its broadcasters appear hamstrung by the requirements of toeing the party line

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.780
which hinder its ability to produce widely appealing content.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.420
It's not about how you want to influence people,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:32.280
it's about what kind of
value system we have as Chinese that's

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.700
convincing, that's shareable with the
rest of the world.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.060
That may be the real kicker.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.020
Beijing is yet to shake off global perceptions that it's an authoritarian state

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.460
without a message of
hope or change to sell the world.
