00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm on an island near the North Pole and
I'm here to find out who owns the Arctic.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.100
As the ice melts more and more in this region,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.540
you can see just how dramatic the ice has been shrinking.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.060
One of these countries has shown that they're willing to fight for it.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.220
Russia's making a new push into the Arctic.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.700
This is the Wild West.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.260
Investment opportunities opening up
in sort of an unusual area: the Russian Arctic.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.520
The Arctic region has strategic
and economic importance.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.480
The pace of melting is only getting faster.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.480
Russia projecting its power.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.720
Use diplomacy to avoid further conflict
in the High North.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.120
So, I'm not allowed to

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.120
take my camera down into the mine. So
I've been given this explosion-proof

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.040
super fortified camera. In case it
explodes, it won't cause a death fire for

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.400
the entire community.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.160
This coal mine is owned by the Russian government,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.800
it's in a town with Russian flags,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.320
and the bust of a Russian Communist revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.920
But, this isn't Russia.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.440
It's Barentsburg, on the island of
Svalbard near the North Pole.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.440
It's a place that exists for strategic reasons, not for making money.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.560
In fact it loses money. Has for decades.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
Russia funds this place because for them, it means influence in this region.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.720
A frozen ocean, that is melting more and more every year due to the changing climate.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.320
This is what the Arctic Ocean looked like in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.320
September 1984. Fast-forward thirty two
years and this is what it looks like:

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.480
September 2016.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.400
Most of the world sees
this as a looming disaster, but for the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.600
Arctic nations this change means an
opportunity:

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.680
Access to a brand new ocean.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.680
Here's what geologists think oil and gas
resources might look like in the Arctic.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.600
The US Geological Survey estimates that
the region holds 30 percent of the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.520
world's undiscovered natural gas and 13%
of its oil.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.320
These resources are still remote and
costly to access but they're more

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.320
accessible every year and suddenly this
desolate region is very interesting to the world.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.080
New shipping routes are also
opening up and this ocean, that was once frozen,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.440
is now navigable for longer
periods every summer, cutting weeks off

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.280
the trips between Asian and Western
markets.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.360
The topic of borders in the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.160
Arctic region is a little bit complex
and it's an issue that's still open

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.680
for discussion and negotiation. Currently
the border lines in the Arctic Ocean

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.200
look like this.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.200
Every country gets their
default maritime borders that are

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.600
200 nautical miles off their coast. The rest
of the water that doesn't fall within

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.840
these exclusive economic zones, is up for
grabs to anyone who can prove

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.080
that it belongs to them. And that has a lot to do
with a continental shelf.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.480
A continental shelf is a part of a country's landmass.
It's just covered with ocean.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.360
The continental shelf continues until it
drops off into the deeper parts of the ocean.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.360
Since the ice has been melting,
countries have been sending out

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.240
submarines to gather data on the
continental shelf. They put together a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.560
scientific case and submit it to a UN
committee. This committee reviews it and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.680
decides whether or not the country's
claim is scientifically valid.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.720
Extending from our coastlines, lying beneath the
sea, is an extension of our country

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760
called the continental shelf. It
determines the new borders of our

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.240
country. Knowing where the edge of the
continental shelf lies, adds millions of

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.240
square kilometers to our country and
makes the resources on the seafloor and

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.480
beneath the seabed, Canada's.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.080
So far Norway
and Iceland are the only two nations

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.680
whose continental shelf claims have been
submitted and approved by the UN, but

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.320
others have submitted claims that are
waiting for approval.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.120
Look at Russia's claims versus that of Greenland,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.760
the large Arctic island that actually belongs to Denmark.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.960
The claims overlap significantly.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.520
Canada is in the process

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.000
of gathering data and is expected to
submit a claim that will also have some overlap here.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.560
The UN committee that evaluates these

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.200
claims is made up of scientists, not
diplomats. Their sole job is to say

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.760
whether or not the claim is
scientifically valid.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.560
It's then up to the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.520
countries to negotiate how to work out
who gets what.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.240
Russia has shown its interest in having
a claim that extends all the way to the North Pole.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.200
In 2007 Russia went so far as to plant

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.880
its flag on the seafloor under the North
Pole.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.560
And if push comes to shove, Russia

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.080
likely won't concede its North Pole
claim to the tiny nation of Denmark,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.080
whose claims overlap with theirs. Russia
is easily the biggest player in the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.200
Arctic neighborhood. Half of the Arctic
is flanked by Russian coast and they

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.440
easily wield the most influence and they
have the most to gain from global

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.880
warming and the ice melting. And so they're refortifying and renovating a lot of

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.280
their strategic outposts here in the
Arctic.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.920
50 airfields by 2020,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.440
putting special forces. They're training, holding
military exercises in the Arctic.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.840
In recent years Russia has been reopening,
fortifying, and building new military

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.400
bases in the Arctic region. They've been
publicizing their military exercises,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600
which include reindeer, huskies, and
soldiers in uniforms that look like

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.320
they belong in a Star Wars film.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.760
Russia is sending us important signals, that in the Arctic,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.800
they will project their own
power and capabilities and I don't see a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.160
sufficient response from the US and NATO,
to recognize that increased military position.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.160
One of those outposts is the
town of Barentsburg, which is right

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.320
behind me, here on the island of Svalbard.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.880
Barentsburg isn't a military facility,
like all those other dots on the map, but

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.520
it serves a similar purpose. And to
understand why Russia wants a town on

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.000
this island, you have to understand
Svalbard. It's unlike any other piece of

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.320
land on earth and not only because it's
the northernmost inhabited part of the planet.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.960
The Svalbard treaty, signed in
1920, says that any country who has

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.880
signed the treaty can have its people on
Svalbard and exploit the land for

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.880
commercial or economic purposes. The land
technically belongs to Norway, but 45

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.880
countries have signed the treaty and so
45 countries have economic claim to this land.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.400
The one rule is that no nation,
including Norway, is allowed to have

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.680
military assets on Svalbard.
So Russia set up a coal mine up here, not

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.840
to make money. Russia pays for these coal

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.540
miners to be here to sink economic
roots into this land. If there's ever

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.560
dispute about boundaries or if oil is
someday found off the shores of Svalbard,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.200
Russia will be at the table where those
discussions are happening and

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.220
Barentsburg will be their bargaining
chip.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.180
It's their claim to this land.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.220
What's most fascinating to me, is that
this strategy plays out with people.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.040
The people living here in Barentsburg are
effectively placeholders for a Russian

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.800
strategy for the Arctic. And yet when
you talk to them that's not really on their mind.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.080
They're not thinking about geopolitics,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.540
they're not thinking about
the changing landscape of the Arctic, and

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.160
what that means for Russian policy.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.260
For Russia, coal has been their main economic activity,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.660
it's what they've been doing
here for years, but coal is in decline

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.840
and their operation is slowly losing
people and interest and so they're

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.820
realizing they have to pivot to a
different economic activity, that is more

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.780
sustainable for the future. And for them
the answer is tourism.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.220
On Svalbard, it's kind of clear: the coal mining era,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.060
is something which is, you know, disappearing.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.700
It's a bust.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.820
Tourism, science, nature protection is its future.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.220
You can see Russia's renewed
interest in this island taking place

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.100
when you walk around the town of
Barentsburg.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.560
The consulate is undergoing

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.360
some renovation right now. They're like
gutting the whole thing and renovating

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.540
after years of neglect. It's a small
village of a few hundred people and it

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.500
has an entire consulate. This consulate
serves more as a statement than a

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.900
functional asset for the Russian
government.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.700
All these renovations suggest

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.320
that they expect this ghost town to
become a major tourist destination, but

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.420
making money isn't the motivation here.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.060
Of course it's impossible that

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.460
Barentsburg one day will support itself
without any funding from the government.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.660
It's impossible.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.980
The pivot to tourism isn't just about keeping deep

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.060
economic roots in Barentsburg. It also
serves a purpose of turning Barentsburg

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.180
into a spectacle, for people to see just
how much Russian identity is tied to the Arctic.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.080
Newly refurbished buildings, new
Arctic theme bars, museums that tell the

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.840
story of Russian presence in the Arctic.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.100
These aren't military bases or airfields,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.000
but this sort of projection of culture
and identity goes a long way in creating

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.920
association with a place, in exerting
influence.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.880
It's called soft power.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.660
Funding all of this on a faraway island that
belongs to Norway, is the epitome of soft power.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.880
And it's a perfect complement to
Russia's surge in hard power in the Arctic.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.600
Remember all those dots?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.420
The most long-range air patrols with bear bombers since the Cold War,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.940
forty five thousand troops, 
three thousand four hundred military vehicles,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.980
forty one ships,
fifteen submarines, and a hundred and ten aircraft.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.320
What do you think Russia's trying to achieve in the Arctic with that massive military buildup?

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.060
I don't know.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.100
I believe, however, that we are going 
to have to figure it out.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.080
But up until now Russia has been playing by the rules

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.000
on the maritime borders front.
Following all the UN protocol and making

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.420
claims in a very orderly fashion, but
they've also shown some provocative

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.640
behavior in protecting their influence
in the region.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.560
On the one hand for Russia

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.580
to benefit economically from the Arctic,
it has to be a stable cooperative environment.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.360
The best thing you can do to
spook off companies and economic investment,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.120
is to think that the region could be prone to conflict.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.580
But we have to remember that this is the government
that annexed Crimea a few years ago.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.320
It's a government that's not afraid to
project power in its neighborhood.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.360
They're showing us both tracks, sort of
this dual policy of wanting to be open

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.340
for business, but be able to growl a
little bit and show its muscular teeth

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.140
for its military and those two,
eventually they're a little incompatible.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.760
This region is changing fast.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.420
The treaties and norms that have kept it

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.500
in order for years are becoming
incompatible with the physical realities.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:32.020
As the ice melts, the region will become
more valuable. New borders will be drawn,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.300
and new opportunities to project power will emerge.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.160
We can only hope that Russia continues to 
play by the rules.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.580
My favorite part about being in the Arctic while I was making this story,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.420
was going on these late night hikes.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.940
A lot of the footage in this video was shot after midnight,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.640
when the sun would kind of just hover around the horizon.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.900
The light would be beautiful for hours at a time.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.440
And it was just such a crazy experience to watch the sun never set.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.200
Anyway, thanks for watching the second episode of Borders, I published the first episode

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.620
last week. And I'm going to continue to publish these every week, on Tuesdays.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.240
I also want to say a big thank you to lululemon, who is a sponsor of Borders.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.620
They sent me these ABC pants, which are

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.640
these sturdy pants are used for both active hiking, as well as just kind of lounging around.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.740
They're super comfortable.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.160
Thank you lululemon for sending me these ABC pants,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.040
but more importantly thanks for supporting Borders, and for making this whole thing happen.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.160
If you want to check out these ABC pants, I'm going to leave a link here,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.140
where you can go over to the lulu shop online, and check them out for yourself.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.460
That's it, stay tuned: one week from now, I'm releasing the next episode of Borders.
