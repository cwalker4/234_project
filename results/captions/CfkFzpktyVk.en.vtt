00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.560
Jaqen H'ghar is probably the most confusing
Game of Thrones character.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.930
Like, first he’s in a cage, then he’s
a soldier, and he kills people for Arya, then

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.410
gives her a coin, and changes his face, and
goes away.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.800
Then three seasons later, in Braavos, there's
this old guy who’s actually Jaqen, but he

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.410
says he’s not Jaqen , then he dies, then
he's still alive, then he's like you are now

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.050
no one . In the books, things are different
again – Jaqen isn't at the House of Black

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.859
and White in Braavos, but he does turn up
at the Citadel at Oldtown, disguised as an

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:31.859
“alchemist”.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.629
And there’re all these theories, all these
connections Jaqen and the Faceless Men have

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.239
with Euron Greyjoy, dragons and Valyria.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.940
Some people even think that Jaqen may be Syrio
Forel.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.600
So let’s work this stuff out – what’s
going on with Jaqen H'ghar?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.280
In Book and Season 2, Arya joins a group of
Night’s Watch recruits led by Yoren.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.079
Most of them are prisoners from the dungeons
of King’s Landing, and three of these are

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.469
considered so dangerous that they’re kept
chained up “in the back of a wagon” – there’s

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.130
Biter, a monstrous man with pointed teeth,
Rorge, a brute with no nose, and then there’s

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.380
Jaqen H’ghar , a “handsome” , “smiling”,
“polite” man who says he’s from the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.680
city of Lorath . Jaqen is nice to Arya, asks
her for beer, tells her she could make a friend

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.729
. Later, when the group is attacked, Jaqen,
Rorge and Biter’s wagon catches fire, and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.899
Arya saves them from the flames by bringing
an axe to break their chains.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.820
When Arya is taken to Harrenhal, Jaqen turns
up again – apparently having joined under

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.490
the Lannisters as a mercenary . Jaqen tells
Arya that since she saved him and Rorge and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.771
Biter from the fire, the “Red God” is
owed three lives – so Jaqen offers to kill

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:45.549
three people for her . Once this death debt
is paid, Jaqen says his time is done.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.829
He magically changes his face into another
man’s, taking on a whole new identity . The

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.820
name Jaqen, the face, his manner of speech,
the whole personality, is revealed to be “a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.020
lie” – the truth is that this person is
an assassin of the Faceless Men.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.460
The Faceless Men are a “secretive society
of assassins” – you pay them, and they’ll

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.500
kill someone for you.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.120
They’re said to be very “expensive”
, but very effective . When Arya joins the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.680
Faceless Men at their base at the House of
Black and White, in Braavos, we learn that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.730
the Faceless Men aren’t just assassins,
they’re also priests who worship death . They

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.769
believe that every different religion has
some figure that represents death, and so

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.680
they call death the Many-Faced God.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.400
When Jaqen was talking about the Red God before,
he was talking about the Lord of Light as

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.610
a face of the Many-Faced God – one of many
aspects of death.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.120
The Faceless often speak of death as a gift,
a mercy, a release from the suffering of life,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.819
so the assassinations they carry out seem
sacred to them.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.920
As assassins, Faceless Men are trained to
use deception, perception, poisons and–

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440
sticks to kill their targets.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.830
They use human faces to magically disguise
themselves as other people.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.909
And they’re trained to give up their identities
– their “hopes and dreams”, “loves

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.690
and hates”, everything that makes them who
they are.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.060
To become a Faceless Man, you must become
“no one” . Which makes things confusing

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.260
– it means that when we talk about Jaqen
H’ghar, we’re actually talking about a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.940
Faceless Man who happens to wear “Jaqen”’s
face, but apparently any Faceless Man can

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.050
wear that face – there’s this stuff in
the show where a Man who appears to be Jaqen

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.939
drinks poison and dies, and “the waif”
wears Jaqen’s face, and another Man turns

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.709
up as Jaqen later – so the Faceless Men
seem interchangeable, almost like a hive mind,

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.520
any of them can be any one because they’re
all “no one” – so it’s probably best

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.220
to think of Jaqen as just an extension of
the Faceless Men, a servant of the Many-Faced

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.630
God.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.400
But what’s he actually up to?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.090
Jaqen makes a big effort to recruit Arya to
the Faceless Men.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.230
He turns up just when she’s feeling weak
and afraid , and shows her that killing can

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.340
make her feel strong and brave . By letting
her pick three of her enemies to kill, Jaqen

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.860
gives her a taste of the power of being a
Faceless assassin – never mind that a real

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.420
Faceless assassin doesn’t get to pick their
own targets . He shows off by changing his

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.630
face in front of her, and that’s when he
tells her to come with him to Braavos to learn

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.920
the same magic , as though the House of Black
and White was more Hogwarts than death cult.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.220
He fails to mention all the downsides of being
with the Faceless – living in a dark stone

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.520
temple, scrubbing corpses, daily beatings,
and, y’know, completely giving up your identity

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.220
to become “no one”.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.380
Jaqen’s like some slimy army recruiter,
he manipulates Arya into joining the Faceless

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.260
Men, and some fans believe this was his mission
all along, maybe that the manipulation begins

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.850
with Syrio Forel.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.510
Syrio Forel is the Braavosi swordsman who
trains Arya in King’s Landing, and he teaches

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.230
her many of the same things that Jaqen and
the Faceless Men teach.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.410
How to be sneaky . How to stand very still
. To see things as they truly are . And that

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.400
violence can make her feel strong.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.530
Syrio’s training is like the perfect introduction
to her later training with the Faceless Men,

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.980
like, a How To Be A Badass 101, before the
more Advanced Badassery at the House of Black

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.140
and White.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.760
In the show, Syrio tells Arya “There is
only one god.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.260
And his name is death” , which lines up
with what Jaqen says later – “There is

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.260
only one god.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.850
A girl knows his name” . So the theory here
is that the reason for these connections and

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.090
similarities between Syrio and Jaqen is that
Syrio is Jaqen, another false face of a Faceless

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.170
Man who came to King’s Landing specifically
to train Arya and recruit her as a Faceless

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.320
assassin.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.470
Which could maybe be possible – the last
time we see Syrio, it looks like he’s about

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.240
to be killed by Meryn Trant, but maybe he
actually escapes, and somehow ends up in the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.610
black cells with the face of Jaqen H’ghar,
in time to be recruited to the Night’s Watch

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.660
in the group with Arya.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.700
But why would Syrio-slash-Jaqen deliberately
get himself locked up in the black cells,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.620
and in that cage – that almost got him killed.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.270
Surely he could have found another way to
stick with Arya.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.820
And if it wasn’t deliberate, and he got
locked up by mistake, it’s a pretty crazy

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.320
coincidence that he just happened to be recruited
into the same group Arya was travelling with.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.530
So either way, this doesn’t make much sense.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.670
And what about Syrio himself, like, did the
Faceless Men seriously secretly kill and replace

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.370
the First Sword of Braavos just so they could
train a random Westerosi nine-year old?

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.440
Is Arya really such an amazing potential assassin
to be worth all this hassle?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.100
And how would the Faceless Men even know about
her, do they have spies at Winterfell?

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.550
The more you think about it, the less sense
it makes for Syrio to be Jaqen.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.370
The more likely explanation is that the reason
why that Syrio’s training fits well with

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.410
Jaqen’s is cause this is a story, and it
needs to fit, it needs to have a flow to it.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.440
Arya’s arc explores themes of violence and
loss of identity, so naturally she meets mentors

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.410
who gradually guide her down that path.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.330
Not every character has a secret identity
– but some of them do.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.230
“the alchemist” is a mysterious character
we see in Feast, at Oldtown.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.470
He makes a deal with a guy named Pate – a
novice at the Citadel, where maesters are

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.470
trained.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.270
“the alchemist” gives Pate a gold piece
in return for a certain key, a key said to

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.330
be able to unlock every door in the Citadel.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.480
We’re told almost nothing about “the alchemist”,
but we do get a description of his face – a

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.720
description that happens to perfectly match
the new face that Jaqen wears after he leaves

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.860
Harrenhal – full cheeks, a hooked nose,
a scar on the right cheek, and curly black

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.280
hair . This “alchemist” is another a false
identity of the Faceless Men, probably the

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.500
same Man as Jaqen.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.950
So in Feast, this “alchemist” gets his
key, and then he appears to kill Pate.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.440
But later, when Sam arrives in Oldtown, he
meets Pate alive and well – but there are

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.700
some weird things about him . The clues suggest
that this Pate is actually “the alchemist”

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.400
in disguise, who is probably actually Jaqen
in disguise, who is actually a Faceless Man

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
in disguise.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.470
And now this babushka assassin is bunking
with Sam Tarly in Oldtown, holding a key said

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.900
to be able to unlock every door in the Citadel.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.500
But why?

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.670
What do the Faceless Men want in the Citadel?

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.610
We’re given one clue.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:22.720
In Dance, Tyrion mentions a book, a “fragmentary,
anonymous, blood-soaked tome” called Blood

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.470
and Fire or The Death of Dragons, “the only
surviving copy of which [is] supposedly hidden

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.263
away in a locked vault beneath the Citadel”
. When Pate gives “the alchemist” the

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:37.630
key, he specifically wonders if “the alchemist”
might want a book locked down in the vaults

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.330
of the Citadel . So the clues suggest that
the Faceless Man wants this book.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.670
But what have the Faceless Men got to do with
dragons?

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.770
In Feast, “the kindly man” tells Arya
how the Faceless Men began.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.130
His story goes back thousands of years, to
the Valyrian Freehold, the empire of the original

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.000
“dragonlords”, who ruled most of the known
world through the power of their dragons and

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.040
their slaves.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.570
“the kindly man” tells of the slaves who
worked in the mines beneath volcanic mountains

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.680
called the Fourteen Flames.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.340
These mines were so hot and the work so hard
that slaves would pray for “an end to [their]

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.390
pain” , and the first Faceless Man was someone
who gave them that gift, who killed the slaves

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.260
who suffered the most . Arya says they should
have killed the slave masters, not the slaves,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.420
and “the kindly man” says “He would
bring the gift to them as well … but that

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.300
is a tale for another day” . So “the kindly
man” is suggesting that the Faceless Men

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.570
brought the gift of death to the slave masters
of Valyria, and some readers believe this

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.870
refers to the Doom of Valyria, the massive
fiery catastrophe that suddenly destroyed

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.670
the Empire four hundred years ago . The Doom
is mysterious, no one really knows what caused

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.690
it, but maybe the Faceless Men were behind
it, killing all the slave masters, their slaves,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:02.340
and the entire empire in one huge terrible
sacrament to the Many-Faced God of death.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.470
There’s no strong evidence for this, but
it totally could fit and it could maybe explain

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.840
why the Faceless Men now want this book about
dragons, because of course, there were survivors

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.270
of the Doom – the Targaryen family and their
dragons escaped Valyria and went on to conquer

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.570
Westeros, ruling the Seven Kingdoms for centuries
until their overthrow by Robert, eventually

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.860
leaving Daenerys the last of the dragonlords.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.740
And she’s rising as a queen, conquering
cities across Slaver’s Bay, and unlike the

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.110
Targaryens of the last hundred or so years,
Dany has dragons.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.920
Given their history with Valyria, the Faceless
Men are probably not too keen for a new dragon

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.760
queen with “the blood of old Valyria”
, so maybe they want to stop her, maybe they

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.300
want to kill her dragons, and maybe that’s
why Jaqen is stealing a book called The Death

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.580
of Dragons.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.710
There are a lot of maybes here, and there
are problems with the idea – for one thing,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:03.000
Dany is ending slavery in the cities she captures,
and it seems like slavery is kinda the main

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.380
problem the Faceless Men had with Valyria.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.290
Also, if the Faceless are so against Valyrians,
and Targaryens, you’d think they would have

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.120
moved against them sometime in the last three
hundred years of Targaryen rule in Westeros?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.720
Maybe they did, somehow.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.070
At this point, we just don’t know, but this
history with Valyria seems important either

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.070
way.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.410
Another big thing is that in Book 3, we hear
that Balon Greyjoy, father of Theon and Asha,

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.450
has died, fallen from a bridge at Pyke during
a storm.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.880
In the show, we see Balon’s brother Euron
is the one to kill him, attacking him, and

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.580
pushing him off the bridge – but in the
books, it’s different.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.970
In a sample chapter of Winds, Euron admits
to killing Balon, but says he didn’t do

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.690
the deed himself , so who did?

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:54.060
Well, earlier in Book 3, “the ghost of High
Heart” has a “dream” “of a man without

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.470
a face, waiting on a bridge that [sways] and
[swings].

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:03.230
On his shoulder perche[s] a drowned crow with
seaweed hanging from his wings” . The “drowned

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.560
crow” sounds like Euron “Crow’s Eye”,
and the “man without a face” sounds like

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.190
a Faceless Man.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.550
So it sounds like Euron hired a Faceless Man
to kill Balon.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.020
Maybe Jaqen was the one to do it, after Harrenhal.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.829
But there’s another complication, because,
remember, “The Faceless Men are expensive”

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:25.110
, and George Martin says that the cost of
hiring a Faceless assassin depends on how

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.170
important and hard to kill the target is . So
if Euron hired a Faceless Man to kill King

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.160
Balon Greyjoy, it must have cost a lot, what
could he have paid them?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.540
Well, in Feast, Euron says that he once had
a dragon egg, but he couldn’t make it hatch,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.380
so he “threw it in the sea”.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.210
If Euron did have a dragon egg, would he really
be stupid enough to throw away something so

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:53.870
valuable ? Maybe he actually used it as payment
for a Faceless assassin to kill Balon.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.850
And maybe the Faceless have plans for this
egg.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.900
Because dragon eggs seem to be powerful magical
fiery objects.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.240
They were involved in the mysterious Tragedy
of Summerhall, where a fire got out of control

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.720
and killed a bunch of Targaryens forty years
ago . Fans speculate they may have been involved

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.020
in other fiery catastrophes, like the destruction
of Hardhome , and maybe the Doom of Valyria.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.530
We don’t know how this would work, and there’s
no strong evidence, but the point is that

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:28.040
there definitely are connections between the
Faceless Men and Valyria, and dragons, and

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:34.630
Euron, especially when you look at the most
recent sample chapter of Winds, the Forsaken.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.370
In this chapter, which was a reading by George
Martin transcribed by fans, we learn that

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:45.850
Euron Greyjoy is even more evil than he seemed,
in the books he was always creepy and cruel

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:51.470
and manipulative, but in this chapter, we
see an even darker side to the Crow’s Eye.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.090
Euron has imprisoned his brother Aeron, along
with a bunch of other priests from different

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:02.160
religions on his ship, and he’s torturing
them, physically and psychologically in horrifically

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.580
creative ways involving fire and dismemberment
and talk of past childhood abuse, and Euron

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.160
drugs Aeron and he has these nightmares of
dragons and krakens and skulls and dead gods,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.300
and we learn Euron’s planning something,
some kind of sacrifice, he’s using the blood

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:24.570
of priests and warlocks and pregnant women,
on the eve of a naval battle , to cause something

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.560
terrible , there’s imagery of a boiling
bloody sea , of a monstrous Cthulu-like Euron,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:35.240
we’re told that “blood is power”, and
that “These are the last days, when the

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.720
world shall be broken and remade.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:45.790
A new god shall be born from the graves and
charnel pits” . So this is vague but terrifying

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.380
and it could possibly connect to the Faceless
Men, who are after all, a literal death-cult,

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.050
killing and blood is kind of their jam, and
there some real connections here, like the

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:01.580
use of priests from all different religions
is kinda like the Many-Faced God, and also

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.160
this is all happening just off the coast near
Oldtown, which is where the Faceless “alchemist”

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160
is.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.280
We already know the Faceless Men worked for
Euron to kill Balon.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.490
So maybe they’re also conspiring with him
to create this great sacrifice, this terrible

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:22.920
orgy of death and blood which, may, like the
Doom of Valyria, have cataclysmic consequences.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:29.120
There could be dragon eggs involved, The Death
of Dragons may be related, or maybe the Faceless

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.720
Men have nothing to do with it.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.320
We can’t say for sure.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.570
But here’s what we do know.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.070
Jaqen H’ghar is the false identity of a
Faceless Man.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.570
He somehow ended up in the black cells of
King’s Landing, and then met Arya and led

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.380
her to join the Faceless Men.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.790
It’s possible that he was working with Arya
all along as Syrio Forel, but that doesn’t

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.790
seem likely.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.430
We do know “the alchemist”, now Pate,
is a Faceless Man, probably the same one as

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:01.630
Jaqen, and he seems to be planning to steal
a book about dragons from the Citadel.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:06.020
We know the Faceless Men have bad blood with
Valyria, which might explain their interest

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.900
in The Death of Dragons.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:13.350
And it seems likely, that a Faceless Man killed
Balon Greyjoy for Euron, which may have involved

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:18.150
a dragon egg that may relate back to the Doom.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:24.190
Lastly we know that Euron’s planning a terrible
sacrifice, which could also somehow relate

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:29.870
to Jaqen, the Faceless Men, and their Many-Faced
God.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.529
So that probably raised more questions than
it answered, but that’s kind of the fun

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:38.620

think Jaqen H’ghar and the Faceless are
