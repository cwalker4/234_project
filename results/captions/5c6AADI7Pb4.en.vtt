00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.190
Last year, a hacker recorded over 40 calls

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.320
to the Secret Service
and the FBI in one day,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.630
without anyone finding out.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.440
I think most people in here would agree
that that was a bad idea.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.280
People on Twitter
and the news talked about it,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.758
and some people even accused him
of being a fraud of a government agent.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:41.430
Some people called him a moron.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.332
My friends call me Bryan.

00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:46.240
(Laughter)

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.330
The point is not
that sensational headline,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.680
albeit it is kind of sensational.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.490
It's why I did what I did
and for why I'm here.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.670
Wiretapping the Secret Service
can be easy and fun.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.418
If you haven't figured out
that that is satire,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.249
then we need to have
a whole other discussion.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.270
This was the front-page
article on Valleywag.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.210
It made it to KOMO
and a variety of different places.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.440
The reason all of this came up

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.160
was because of this.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.560
What you see on the right

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.395
is a common map search
for a local business -

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.370
an auto-glass repair category.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.840
On the left - same search,
same city in Orange County -

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.850
auto-glass repair.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.160
There are fake businesses
in these listings,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.240
and they look just like the real ones.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.833
There isn't a person in this room

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.172
who'd probably be able
to make an educated guess

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.070
as to which one is which.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.873
On the left, there are six fake businesses
in the Google listings,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.165
and on Whitepages, anyone care ...?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.880
Ten out of ten - they're all fake.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.830
They're all controlled by one person.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.730
This one person found a way to manipulate
the variety of local business systems,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.560
like Yelp, and Angie's List, and Bing,
and especially Google Maps,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.240
which is the target.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.135
They have the most traffic,
they generate the most business -

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.232
if you're on Google, you're set.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.870
So what happens?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.080
They bumped off
the original ten placeholders,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.570
and they no longer get the phone calls
they rightly deserve.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.130
This is a scam.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.130
This has been going on
since directories even started.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.440
Before the internet, there were
actually people in Yellow Pages

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.810
doing the same thing
with alphabetical listings.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.316
They would all name their businesses
"AAA," "AA," "AAAA,"

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:58.720
to get at the front of the category.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810
People have always found
a way to game the system.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.448
Problem is now,
no one knows it's happening,

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:08.630
and it's happening in every city,
in every country,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.050
every category that services
businesses and consumers,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.175
and there are over 50 major categories
that this is just epidemically bad.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.530
Another problem that's actually
come to light recently is -

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.080
What you might be familiar with
in a typical Google search

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.430
is at the top, thereâ€™s a Google AdWords.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.430
These are the advertising results
that people in businesses have paid for.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.590
And what you see here,
and it's a little blurry, my apologies,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.010
it says, "$15 locksmith service.
24 hours a day, 20 minute response time."

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.700
I don't know a single locksmith

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.397
in this country

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:47.509
that will drive to you
and service you for $15

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.127
for any type of -

00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:52.510
They wouldn't even give you
a handshake for $15.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.756
It's not worth the gas,
it's not worth the labor.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:57.650
This is bait and switch.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.240
It's a very common thing
in fraud textbooks.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.608
It's a price they have
absolutely no intention of fulfilling,

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:11.690
and they will charge you through the nose
because you can't afford not to pay them,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.935
or they've already done the service,
and then they use intimidation.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.375
You're locked out of your car.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:17.994
It's 11 o'clock at night.

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.410
You're in a bad neighborhood.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.995
They show up because you clicked
on an ad that said "$15 service,"

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:25.770
and now it's 350,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.340
and they make you go to the ATM
and pull money out.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.560
What if it's your grandmother?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.899
Your wife? Your sister?

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.400
This happens and it's been in the media,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.655
but no one picks it up

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:43.030
because this problem is so complex,
and big, and multijurisdictional,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.370
the FBI and the Secret Service
don't want to touch it,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.433
the attorneys general;

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.584
there are so many different pieces,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.946
and we have to start
at the original root of the problem.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.252
This man ran a business
called the Serbian Crown;

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:57.773
this is in Wired magazine.

00:04:57.773 --> 00:05:00.180
Hackers who didn't like him

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.828
turned his business hours
for the weekend to nothing.

00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:08.600
They just deleted
his availability on the weekends,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.129
and it single-handedly killed his business
in less than a month.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.283
He had to shut his doors.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.055
He was open for two decades or more -
I think even longer.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.750
So I approached Google.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.800
I told them all of the different methods
that these guys are using -

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.320
the exploits, the ways
that they beat the ranking systems -

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.199
and I was pleasantly surprised
by them doing absolutely nothing.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.500
So I started creating some funny listings
to maybe get some social following,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.800
and this one was my personal favorite:

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.810
the Snowden Super Secret Hiding Place
on the White House lawn.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.790
(Laughter)

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.616
You can see why they chose that
for the main website image.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.536
So I walked into
the Secret Service office

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.376
after recording phone calls.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I didn't have a lawyer with me.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.290
I had no idea what was going to happen
other than I kind of needed to be there

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.840
because if I got caught,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.577
I think it arguably would have been
a first-class vacation to Guantanamo Bay,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.341
and although I was in the Marines,

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:30.517
I don't want to be reunited
with them there.

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.810
(Laughter)

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.520
And orange isn't exactly my color.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.550
(Laughter)

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.520
What I did was very simple.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.439
I created a very identical
Secret Service listing

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.880
with a different phone number,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.467
and as you can see, this one at the top
has three reviews, 202 area code,

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:54.210
this one has a 425 area code,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.900
same address, more pictures.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.295
I deleted their reviews
in less than five minutes,

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.850
and I added reviews of my own
that were fake.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.207
Took less than 20 minutes,
beginning to end.

00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:08.080
The positions switched

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.110
because mine suddenly
had more "hidden points,"

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.430
which then meant anybody
who looked for the Secret Service,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.738
anywhere in the country
for this specific one,

00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:17.730
got mine,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.655
and that phone number forwarded to them,

00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:22.600
and I could record both sides
of the conversation

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.780
without ever touching their systems.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.013
It's not even technically hacking.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.590
It's just

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.230
stupid, really.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.010
(Laughter)

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.516
You seem to think it's a bad idea.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.770
Where were you?

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.250
This was me waiting.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.070
(Laughter)

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.221
Might never use a phone again,
so might as well take a selfie.

00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.570
(Laughter)

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.648
While I was sitting
in the Secret Service office,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.480
waiting for the guys to show up,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.312
they walked out,
they all rolled their eyes.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.381
They all thought I was crazy

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.660
because I'd just literally
called them and said,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.000
"Hi, I might have just recorded
a bunch of calls to you guys

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.246
trying to prove something.

00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:13.711
Can I come in and show you?"

00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:16.339
"Oh yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah, come on in."

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.770
It sounded crazy.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.240
So I'm standing there with the agents
in the Secret Service office

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.568
right after I took those initial photos,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.840
and the agent goes,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.150
"Look, I don't believe you.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.120
This isn't really happening."

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.179
I said, "Okay. Do me a favor,
and I'll prove this right now.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.039
Call the Secret Service office
in Washington, D.C.,

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.526
and I'll prove it."

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.430
Pulls his phone out,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.826
says his name -

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.455
He knew the guy on the other end.

00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:54.430
Maybe they were roommates at the academy,
if they even go to an academy.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.403
I don't really know.

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.225
(Laughter)

00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:58.820
Who does know, I mean, really?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.110
(Laughter)

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.410
They hang up after about five minutes,
and I open my laptop.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.180
I push play, and it played back
the conversation I'd just heard,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.867
because he was standing next to me,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.488
and the full audio
of the guy we didn't hear.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.512
And their eyes suddenly stopped rolling.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.500
And it got very quiet.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.798
And they handed me a statement saying,
"These are your Miranda rights.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.320
You are not under arrest
but we need to search you,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.630
and we would like you to accompany us
to the guest suite -

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.010
(Laughter)

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.774
this luxurious, closet-sized suite
with no windows,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.080
in which you'll be staying
an undetermined amount of time.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.690
You're not under arrest,
but we really don't want you to leave."

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.390
(Laughter)

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.059
Obviously, I was there of my own accord.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.540
Obviously, I was there
because this was the right thing to do,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.734
because there was
something bigger at stake,

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:00.800
because there are people being affected,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.690
and so I took a risk.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.570
I took a risk of never
seeing my kids again.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.815
I took a risk of a misunderstanding.

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:13.040
There have been people jailed
for far less, who are completely innocent.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.840
I didn't have any criminal intent.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.240
I walked in immediately and went like,
"Ha ha ha, I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.500
And here you go.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.070
This is a problem, fix it."

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.739
They couldn't ever
bring a case against me saying,

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:28.290
"He was going to sell this."

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.421
The first people I called was them!

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.770
While in the room,
they called Google and said,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.480
"Okay, he's been telling you,"

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.680
and they go, "Oh,
but we didn't believe him,"

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.650
and then ...

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.043
I don't know whatever they were saying,
I wasn't monitoring that call.

00:10:46.043 --> 00:10:49.020
(Laughter)

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.920
What ended up happening was they said,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.969
"Delete the listings.
He needs to delete the listings,"

00:10:55.969 --> 00:10:58.000
and then the Secret Service said,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.660
"Google, shut it off
until you guys fix the problem,"

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.480
and they said, "Okay, got it."

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.817
So they hung up,
and he walks in and goes,

00:11:04.817 --> 00:11:08.660
"You're a hero for bringing
this to our attention

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.610
not knowing what the results
would be against you.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.860
This is a national security problem.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.310
There were phone calls that had sensitive

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.540
or potentially investigation-compromising
information on them."

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.070
I stopped listening -
I didn't want to hear anymore.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.442
I didn't want to be like, "Oh man,
like, President Nixon,"

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.310
and, "He totally did something stupid."

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.100
(Laughter)

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.190
"I'm going to end up in a bag in a river!
Why did I do this?"

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.300
(Laughter)

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.257
So they said fix it.

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:41.538
Six weeks, Google shut off
phone verifications for new businesses.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.340
They shut off a lot of the little methods

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.036
that I required to be able
to do this kind of thing.

00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:51.040
I thought it was fixed.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.856
Six weeks later, they turned it back on
with not a single change made.

00:11:54.856 --> 00:11:57.133
They had just paused.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.500
The news had died down.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.795
The Secret Service
had closed the investigation

00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:03.668
because when the Secret Service
tells you to do something,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.952
I think they're pretty
used to people doing it.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.490
I mean, it's not like,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.969
"Please put your hands up,
if you don't mind,"

00:12:11.969 --> 00:12:16.327
and, "Would you mind not shooting
at the president, today?"

00:12:16.327 --> 00:12:19.010
Like, they don't make requests,
they make demands

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.490
because it's a very clear,
black-and-white thing for them.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.220
The reason I know it's still broken

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.570
is because I built this
with no one's permission

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.190
on Northwest University's
campus last week.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.702
The cell phone for that number -

00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:36.900
it's in my dressing room.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.300
Postcard verification is required
to establish new business addresses.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.960
I obviously don't get mail
at the university.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.460
I didn't go.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.616
This was built yesterday.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.630
It's a snowboarding shop
in the Oval Office

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.802
called Edwards Snow Den.

00:12:57.802 --> 00:13:00.760
(Laughter)

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.053
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.470
Yeah, they didn't fix the thing.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.483
Google lied to the Secret Service.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.960
They said they would fix it,
then turn it back on.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.432
They just waited
for the media to die down.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.630
What we can do now.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.068
I'm the authority on this subject.

00:13:25.068 --> 00:13:27.160
The largest tech publisher in the country

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.855
let me write a book
that's coming out in August.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.562
That book is designed
to raise awareness

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.120
for all of the businesses
and all of the consumers -

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.580
all of the victims of this horrible scam

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.750
that people don't even know is happening.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.300
All you know is your American dream
of owning your own home

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.840
is slowly being taken from you,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.680
but you don't even see the guy
who's taking your money.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.750
You just got less calls last month.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.729
You can't pay for your kid's braces.

00:13:57.729 --> 00:13:59.629
Suddenly, you can't make your mortgage.

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:03.083
I've talked to well over
20 different people

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:06.310
whose families all live
with their in-laws.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.611
They lost their business;
they lost their bond;

00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:11.518
they lost their insurance;
they lost their work truck.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.712
Whether it's a locksmith
or a carpet cleaner,

00:14:13.712 --> 00:14:15.840
these are hardworking Americans.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.816
These are small business owners.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.750
They're complaining to Google,
and Google's going, "Nah, it's not us."

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.990
They don't have a chat support line.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.915
Their forums are just empty of admins.

00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:33.910
There's nothing really going on
on Google's end,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.103
and the worst thing is -

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.550
Remember those advertisements
I was showing you?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.221
The scammers pay Google
for those ads by a click -

00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.601
every time they click.

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:53.630
So when you click for that $15 service,
the scammer pays Google 25 bucks.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.590
Doesn't make sense.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.965
If they were originally
going to charge 15,

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:05.770
how can they spend more on the ad
than what they were going to bring in?

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.202
Because they were never intending on that.

00:15:08.202 --> 00:15:09.840
Google knows they're doing this

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.649
because they just fought a lawsuit

00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:18.250
and got it dismissed under a law
that's not designed for doing this.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.776
They're hiding behind
their army of lawyers

00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:22.600
and their motto of "Don't be evil,"

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.000
and they're cashing the check

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.304
of the guys who are robbing
from the consumers and their clients.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.384
I don't know a clearer way to say it.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.077
They're happy to cash the check.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.527
They don't want to fix the problem
because they're making a lot of money.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.300
There are hundreds of thousands of these
fake businesses across the country.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.520
For example, you can fit, in one category,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.750
three to five auto-glass shops
in a city of 100,000 people or more.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:56.260
There are over 299 cities of over 100,000
population in the United States

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.130
as of the 2013 census.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560
How I know that

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.320
is because I used to be working
with these kinds of scammers.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.720
I have detailed files

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.550
from all of the different things
that they've done.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.220
They pay for bulk reviews

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.851
written by professional
authors and writers -

00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:16.300
20,000 bought at a time.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.710
They are so good at gaming the system

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.020
that you are so ill-equipped
to even notice

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.720
because you're in a hurry.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.140
You're not looking for a plumber

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.910
because you might have
something wrong next week.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.180
Your basement's full of water
and everyone's going to drown.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.530
Call the plumber now;

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.710
you don't need to price check,
and they're counting on it.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.306
Stop using Google for this product.

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:44.442
Now, don't get me wrong;
I love Google.

00:16:44.442 --> 00:16:46.180
I use their Gmail service,

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:52.630
I love the way they invest -
clean energy, SpaceX, self-driving cars -

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.220
they are a great company.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.610
This one piece is a cancer.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.028
It's a blight, it's a shame,

00:17:00.028 --> 00:17:04.130
and the way this stops is them going,
"Okay, we're going to fix it.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.371
Let's see what we can do
and make this right.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.523
Somebody's making money
and somebody's covering something up."

00:17:09.523 --> 00:17:12.839
And until that day comes to light,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.020
I'm pretty good at being loud,
and I'm pretty good at being obnoxious,

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.800
and I'm pretty good at getting away
with some really, really obnoxious stuff.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.670
If you want to go
and look those businesses up,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.040
they're live on Google Maps,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.638
prominently displayed
for the whole world to see.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.807
So if you're in the Oval Office
and you need a snowboarding shop,

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.170
I might know a guy.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.188
(Laughter)

00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:41.180
Thank you.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.160
(Applause)
