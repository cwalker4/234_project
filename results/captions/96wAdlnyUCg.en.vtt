00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.520
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we continue our look at
today's vote and where the U.K. goes from

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.250
here with Sir Peter Westmacott.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.420
He had a 40-year career in the British Diplomatic
Service and he served as his country's ambassador

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.180
to the United States.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.070
Sir Peter Westmacott, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.870
So, what does today's Parliament vote, rejecting
this latest plan, what does it mean for the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.460
prospects of Britain leaving the E.U.?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.820
Is it now more likely or less likely?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.390
PETER WESTMACOTT, Former British Ambassador
to the United States: Well, we are now in

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.020
a state of some political meltdown, as your
correspondent was just explaining.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.730
I think at the moment it means that it is
less likely that we leave on the 29th of March,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.469
as scheduled, because of today's vote, which
was resoundingly against Theresa May's package,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.350
but also because, tomorrow, parliamentarians
are very likely to vote heavily against the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.339
idea of leaving with no deal.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.450
So, if you haven't got Theresa May's deal,
and you haven't got no deal, then what have

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.450
you got?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.839
Answer, on the third day, on Thursday, there
will be a vote about whether to ask for an

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.020
extension of the 29th of March deadline from
the European Commission.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.070
And at the moment, that is what is most likely
to happen in the near future.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.710
So I think leaving on the 29th of March is
feeling a little less likely than it was before

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.710
tonight's vote.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.590
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying parliamentarians
tomorrow likely to say, OK, we need some kind

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969
of deal if we're going the leave, the question
is, what does it look like?

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.000
PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, it's not even as clear
as that, I'm afraid, Judy.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.740
What the parliamentarians will like say is,
we don't like the idea of what is crashing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.300
out with no deal, because it would be chaotic
in a whole lot of different ways.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.009
And neither the European Union nor the United
Kingdom is ready for that.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.469
But what they're not saying is what they would
like, and that's part of the prime minister's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.549
frustration.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.299
She rushed off to Strasbourg over the weekend
to try and put a few improvements to her package,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.399
but, unfortunately, without checking first
with her own law officer, the attorney general,

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.280
thought that the package would do the trick.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.500
And he then opined this morning, saying it
doesn't give the legal guarantees that she

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.229
had hoped for.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.580
And so result was the Parliament said, this
isn't good enough.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.920
So we're a bit stuck in that sense.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.940
The most likely thing, therefore, is extending
the timetable, if the European side will agree.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.750
And a lot of the signs today -- this evening
-- since the vote, are that the European Commission

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.450
and the European member states are not giving
this away for nothing, that they will have

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.280
their own views as to how long the extension
might be.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.100
And there may be some conditions that are
not to the liking of the United Kingdom.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.230
So you could still end up crashing out, but
it feels to me it is not so likely that it

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.420
will happen on the 29th of March because there
is likely to be a vote for an extension, if

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.720
the Europeans agree to it, on Thursday.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.840
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Westmacott, why has this
been so messy and so difficult?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.100
What's at the core of what's going on here?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.440
PETER WESTMACOTT: The core of it, Judy, is
that it was always going to be very, very

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.460
difficult.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.440
You can decide if you have got a box of eggs
in front of you whether you want to scramble

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.340
them, fry them, poach them or whatever it
is.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.820
But once you have scrambled them, unscrambling
eggs is really difficult and a hard thing

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.820
to do.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.050
And many of us, of course, said that at the
time.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.620
But fast-forward to the results of the referendum.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.780
But one of the problems is that Theresa May
decided that, in order to get herself a fresh

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.580
mandate and a bigger majority, she would hold
a general election, when she didn't need to,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.420
18 months or so ago.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.160
And she lost her majority with it.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.330
And so now she's totally dependent on getting
any business done in the House of Commons

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.950
on 10 votes from Northern Irish members of
Parliament.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.810
And, frankly, it's clear that if the law officer
this morning, if the attorney general had

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.160
said it was OK legally, probably, those 10
Democratic Unionist Party M.P.s would have

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.630
said, we can live with it, and probably enough
of the Conservative Brexiteers would have

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.140
gone along with it as well.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.690
So she is somewhat held hostage by these 10
votes in Northern Ireland because of the fact

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.820
that she lost her majority earlier on.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.530
So that's made the government's position politically
extremely fragile all the way through.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.550
Added to that, I think the Conservative Party,
never mind the majority, or the lack of, has

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.190
had real difficulty working out amongst themselves
what sort of Brexit they want.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.410
They have been riven in two, indecisive, unable
to sort things out.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.410
And so there's been a great deal of muddle
over the last 2.5 years, to the frustration,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.530
I have to say, of a lot of the British people.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.090
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that any one person's
fault, or is it just the fault of the system?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.560
PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, you can point the
finger of blame on lots of people.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.130
You can point the finger of blame, if you
wish to, at David Cameron for having called

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.310
the referendum in the first place, thinking
that he'd be able to win it if it happened.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.200
You can point the finger of blame, if you
want to, to the prime minister, because she

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.040
is the head of the government which has conducted
these negotiations, to no avail, over the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.870
last 2.5, three years.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.870
Or you can point the finger of blame to some
very hard-line Brexiteers, who promised a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.670
certain number of things at the time of the
referendum and afterwards which turned out

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.680
to be neither true nor deliverable.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.320
And they have hung in there, making the prime
minister's life really extremely difficult.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.630
So -- and you can probably think of a whole
lot of other people who you can blame for

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.630
it.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.630
Some people would say the commission are being
intransigent.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.150
I don't actually buy that, because it was
the British people who asked to leave.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
And we're the ones who brought this upon ourselves.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.970
And we asked for this Irish backstop, which
is the proximate cause of the defeat of the

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.220
prime minister's package.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.020
And then we ask for it to be changed.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.080
So I think it's a little harsh to say that
the people in Brussels have been inflexible.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.470
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very quickly, finally,
why should the rest of the world pay close

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.270
attention to this, the United States, the
rest of the global economy?

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.030
PETER WESTMACOTT: I think it matters to the
United States for two principal reasons.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.639
One is that the United Kingdom is a very business-friendly
economy, which is the obvious port of entry,

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.830
especially for English-speaking peoples, to
the European single market.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.480
And we have had lots of inward investment
from companies building in the U.K., investing

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.639
in the U.K. to get access to the E.U.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.960
And if that is taken away by the terms of
the Brexit deal and -- or no deal, that will

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960
be a problem.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.810
Secondly, I think the United Kingdom in the
European Union is a force, if you like, for

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.740
the anglophone world.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.430
It has been a means of trying to ensure that
some of America's points of view, policies,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.710
preferences are transmitted to the European
Union.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.760
And I think that could be lost when we leave,
how we leave.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.680
And, thirdly, I think the European Union itself
is weakened.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.300
Of course, I would say this, wouldn't I?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.200
but I hear it from my French and German and
other friends.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.930
If the U.K. is no longer there, and the only
two big powers in the European Union are France

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.090
and Germany, who often find it difficult to
agree on things, then I think the European

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.090
Union is weaker.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.850
And the people who are rubbing their hands
are the people who are in the Kremlin.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.440
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are watching it all
very closely.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.770
Peter Westmacott, we thank you.
