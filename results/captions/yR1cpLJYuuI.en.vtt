00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:04.359
- [Announcer] Yellow Productions presents:

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:07.267
- The Top Five Worst Hotels
on The Las Vegas Strip.

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:09.097
I'm Chris, this is Yellow Productions.

00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:10.290
I do travel guides that are fun,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.828
informative, and entertaining.

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:13.171
And in this video, I'm
gonna be tellin' you

00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.747
some of the worst places
to stay on this road,

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.179
the Las Vegas Strip.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.336
Las Vegas is a very
interesting place because

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.029
there's some really great hotels,

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.060
but there's also some really awful hotels.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.846
And those are the ones
I'll be showing you here.

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:28.184
This is part of my series on Las Vegas.

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.103
I've got a whole bunch of
other videos on Las Vegas,

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:31.912
including, where you can go to see

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:33.460
the best free shows in Vegas.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.977
I've also got videos on what hotels

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:37.783
are actually good to stay at,

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.940
so you can check those out
in the description below.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.221
And we're gonna begin
with the fifth worst hotel

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.621
on the Las Vegas Strip.

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.978
This prestigious location
goes to the Excalibur Hotel.

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:52.037
The Excalibur Hotel can be found for

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.454
$27 a night on November 27th.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:58.053
I used the same date
for all of these hotels.

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:01.739
On Trip Advisor the
Excalibur gets 3.5 stars,

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.322
with 3,588 reviews.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:07.802
And the biggest problem
with the Excalibur Hotel,

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.919
it's big, solace, and it's dated.

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:13.229
It has over 4,500 rooms.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.245
The hotel was built a long time ago.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.563
Really doesn't look like it's
been remodeled in a long time.

00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:22.378
Many reviewers on Trip Advisor
cited long lines to check in.

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:25.607
45, 50 minute waits seem
to be pretty typical

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.483
for people checking into the Excalibur.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.435
Looking at the check in
area in the lobby here,

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.546
you can see the line,

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:34.139
not too short right now and
they've got some rope set up.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.848
It can get very much longer.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:38.275
The common areas of the
hotel, they're dark,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.481
they're musty, they smell of smoke.

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:43.858
One reviewer on Trip Advisor
said that "Oh my gosh,

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:46.819
"our entire floor smelled
of mariajuana every time

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.809
"we came back and left our room".

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.571
Taking a walk down the
guest room floor hallways.

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.575
When I did it there was a couple big bags

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:56.374
of trash that just
appeared to be left there,

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:58.456
pretty picturesque, and
these hallways are not

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.126
all that refreshing either.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.918
Also, some of these rooms
can have pretty bad views.

00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:04.614
If you've got like a third floor room,

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:06.143
and you look to the inside,

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:08.358
this is probably not what you expect

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:10.602
when you get a room on
the Las Vegas Strip.

00:02:10.602 --> 00:02:13.416
Another reviewer on Trip
Advisor says "If the management

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.019
"has half a brain they
will tear this place down

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.242
"and build another hotel and
casino they could be proud of.

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:20.932
"But this ain't it".

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.816
The fourth worst cheap hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip,

00:02:23.816 --> 00:02:25.562
is the Hooters Hotel.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.715
This hotel can be found for $28 a night.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:29.861
Three stars.

00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:32.361
3,646 reviews on Trip Advisor.

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:36.605
A reviewer on Trip Advisor
said "The starting advertised

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:40.871
"room price of $36 became
almost $60 at checkout

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:44.571
"because they asked to
pay an additional $27

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.362
"per night as a resort fee".

00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:48.428
That's something to keep
in mind for a lot of these

00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:50.552
cheap hotels, the Excalibur included.

00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:53.010
They'll often charge
resort fees that make that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.220
cheap room rate actually double.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.612
Another reviewer said "The
pictures online looked way better

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.814
"than the room actually looks,

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.956
"I wouldn't recommend
this hotel to anyone.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:04.968
"The only good thing about this place was

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:07.065
"the access to The Strip is one block off

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:09.241
and the ease of getting a taxi."

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.553
They also said "And oh, by
the way, the whole place

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:13.555
"smelled like sewage".

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:16.265
Another reviewer on Trip
Advisor says "The whole hotel

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:18.897
"is in desperate need of renovation.

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:22.132
"The bathtub was disgusting,
there was dust everywhere,

00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:24.087
the caulking had mold around it.

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:26.253
"Once I complained about
the smell in the room

00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:28.790
"a staff person came and
sprayed this awful spray

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.259
"that made the room smell even worse.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.197
"The bed was the worst, and
it had a sink in the bed

00:03:35.197 --> 00:03:38.393
"as if the bed frame
was broken on one side."

00:03:38.393 --> 00:03:41.378
Another reviewer says
"The only glimmer of hope

00:03:41.378 --> 00:03:45.069
"for this hotel was the food
and the hospitality staff

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.253
"inside of the actual restaurant.

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:50.006
"The service inside the
Hooters restaurant was great

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:52.792
"and very fast, so only
visit the Hooter Hotel if

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.626
"what you want to do is
eat in the restaurant.

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:57.126
"Skip the actual hotel rooms."

00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:01.119
The third worst cheap hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.470
is the Travel Lodge Center Strip.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.009
The Travel Lodge Center
Strip, and the next

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.684
two hotels in this video,
they are really bad.

00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:11.200
This hotel, not quite as
cheap as the previous two,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.894
for November 27th it's $67 a night.

00:04:14.894 --> 00:04:17.015
Travel Lodge Center
Strip on Trip Advisor has

00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:19.598
three stars with 1,079 reviews.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.945
One reviewer on Trip Advisor
says "If you're interested

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:26.248
"in location in the heart of Las Vegas,

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:27.570
"this is perfect.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.756
"If you care about feeling
safe, a clean room,

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:33.390
"and nice surroundings, get outta here.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.538
"This isn't it."

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.789
The next reviewer said "Our room was old,

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.400
"and the windows looked like someone had

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.231
"to pry them open in the past.

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:42.141
"I did not feel safe in this hotel.

00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:44.618
"The room had a musty smell to it.

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:48.928
"Think poo, plus
detergent, mixed together.

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:50.568
"The bathroom was dirty.

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:53.960
"Overall, this was the worst
hotel I've ever stayed in.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.579
"I much rather pay extra
to stay somewhere else.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:00.457
"Definitely my first and last visit."

00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:03.213
Another reviewer said
"reaching my room door,

00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:05.820
"the door was hard to
open and it had clearly

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.468
"been forced open previously.

00:05:08.468 --> 00:05:11.228
"The security latch on the
door was snapped in half

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:12.733
"and had to be replaced.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.163
"There was damage to the
wall where the door handle

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:18.367
"had impacted it, even
though a strike plate

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:19.930
"had been put in place."

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.546
Another reviewer on Trip
Advisor says "This place

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:23.670
"is a total dump.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.047
"The room was musty and
moldy, you could see outside

00:05:27.047 --> 00:05:29.050
"from around the air conditioning.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.794
"The air conditioning sounded
like a jet plane taking off.

00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:36.006
"And this place with all of
it's flaws it's not cheap."

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:38.139
And also they talked
about the door and said

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.726
"You had to slam the
front door to lock it."

00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:42.949
Another reviewer agreed
the air conditioning was

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.743
extremely loud and they
also comment and said

00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:49.284
"The corners of the hotels
inner courtyard were used as

00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:51.952
"urinals by pedestrians of The Strip

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.692
"crossing the hotel entrance."

00:05:53.692 --> 00:05:56.805
The second worst cheap hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip,

00:05:56.805 --> 00:05:58.376
it's another Travel Lodge.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:01.040
This is the Travel Lodge Las Vegas.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.847
It's located right next to
the Circus Circus hotel.

00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:07.483
You can get the Travel Lodge
Las Vegas for $37 a night.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:09.708
On Trip Advisor the Travel Lodge Las Vegas

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:12.125
has 3 stars with 537 reviews.

00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:15.776
The first reviewer where
I'm gonna pick from

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.074
sums it all up, and they
say "I chose this hotel

00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:21.083
"because of the location,
it did have that.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.440
"It had nothing else."

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.072
Another reviewer on Trip
Advisor says "The room was

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:28.645
"an extremely poor pair and smelled like

00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:32.812
"some type of overwhelming
floral scented carpet deodorizer,

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:37.099
"like you use to cover
up pet urine or smoke.

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:38.355
"It was bad.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:40.985
"It burned my nose, it was so strong.

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:43.035
"And on the last morning,
I woke up with bites,

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.207
"and there were bugs walking around.

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:49.282
"This was literally the worst
hotel I have ever stayed in."

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:52.843
Another reviewer says "Our
stay at this place was terrible

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:55.866
"The furniture was broken,
the mattresses were so hard

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:59.245
"I couldn't sleep, the bathroom
was hot, it was very small."

00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:02.014
Another reviewer on Trip
Advisor says "You get what

00:07:02.014 --> 00:07:04.522
"you pay for, so don't be expecting much.

00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:07.242
"There was a pair of fake eyelashes stuck

00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:09.785
"on the wall in the bathroom,
from someone before us.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.109
"The beds were cheap and awful.

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:13.705
"The shower took forever
to drain; therefore,

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.874
making you stand in inches of
water while trying to shower.

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:17.707
"The outside stairs
coming from downstairs to

00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:21.374
"the second floor smelled
like human urine."

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:25.713
Some reviews said this hotel has nothing.

00:07:25.713 --> 00:07:29.326
But one thing it did have, a
free laundromat in the lobby

00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:30.793
from 8 a.m to 8 p.m.

00:07:30.793 --> 00:07:34.465
And boy, what a depressing lobby it is.

00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:36.390
And now ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.236
the time you've all been waiting for,

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:41.799
the worst cheap hotel
on the Las Vegas Strip.

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:43.964
It's part of the Circus Circus,

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:48.951
but in particular, it's the
Cirus Circus Manor Motor Lodge.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.773
The Cirus Circus Manor
Motor Lodge rooms can be had

00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:53.356
for $19.80 a night.

00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:58.102
On Trip Advisor this portion
of the Circus Circus gets

00:07:58.102 --> 00:08:02.082
two and a half stars with 291 reviews.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.004
The only one of these
hotels on the strip that

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:06.716
gets less than three stars.

00:08:06.716 --> 00:08:10.155
The Manor Motor Lodge are
these three story buildings

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:14.178
behind the main buildings
of the Circus Circus hotel.

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:17.079
These buildings are awful.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.140
To check in for them, you have to check in

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.421
at the main Circus Circus check in,

00:08:21.421 --> 00:08:22.893
in the main building.

00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:25.360
And then, you follow these signs that say

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.185
"Manor rooms this way."

00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:29.586
You cross this really long bridge.

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.558
I feel like it takes about
10 minutes to walk from

00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:35.095
the check in area over
to these Manor rooms.

00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:36.834
You'll know you're there because it gets

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:38.373
really really depressing.

00:08:38.373 --> 00:08:40.762
Here I'm pointing at that
bridge I just walked across.

00:08:40.762 --> 00:08:43.844
The big pink thing is the Adventure Dome,

00:08:43.844 --> 00:08:45.477
and I'm standing on the third floor

00:08:45.477 --> 00:08:46.944
of one of the Manor rooms.

00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:49.035
So, let's go ahead and walk on in.

00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:51.914
The first thing I noticed
when I opened this door

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:55.164
was an amazing smell of smoke and must.

00:08:56.262 --> 00:09:00.063
And the whole hotel, really
just has a wet smell to it.

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:02.347
And I think I found the
source of that wet smell.

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:05.861
It appears the ice machine
had sprung a big leak,

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:09.488
and the entire ground
floor by the ice machines

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:11.571
and the vending machines was wet.

00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.049
They don't seem to take out
the trash in this building.

00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:16.509
There are big piles of trash everywhere.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:18.485
They push the bed linens
around in these big

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:21.014
orange carts that look
more suitable to hold

00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:23.490
trash than clean bed linens.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.001
And then on the wall, there's
these wires sticking out.

00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:28.160
There was clearly
something here electronic,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.761
they just removed, pulled
it out, and it's okay,

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:31.893
just leave it like that.

00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:32.927
What's the big deal?

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:34.665
You're only paying $19 a night.

00:09:34.665 --> 00:09:36.863
A reviewer on Trip Advisor
said "This is the worst

00:09:36.863 --> 00:09:38.218
"hotel I've stayed in.

00:09:38.218 --> 00:09:39.935
"The room stinks like smoke,

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:41.898
"the whole building is old and run down.

00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:43.910
"I had to go buy some disinfectant wipes

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.659
"just to use the toilet."

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:48.845
Another reviewer said "We
had stayed here years ago,

00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:51.306
"and figured it would be
a nice stop for the night.

00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:52.213
"We were wrong.

00:09:52.213 --> 00:09:54.444
"The place is filthy,
the carpet is disgusting,

00:09:54.444 --> 00:09:57.180
"the windows, the doors, are dirty filthy.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.377
"I hated to have to touch the door."

00:09:59.377 --> 00:10:02.136
And another reviewer
said "Thin walls, bugs,

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:04.010
"far away from The Strip and it's

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.082
just a step above a homeless shelter."

00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:08.050
Thanks for watching!

00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:13.236
This one, some things in Las Vegas

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:14.501
from my Las Vegas series.

00:10:14.501 --> 00:10:15.922
Free shows you might wanna watch.

00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:17.957
This one right over here, it's some hotels

00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:20.130
that I'd actually consider staying at

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.142
if you're coming to Vegas.

00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:22.943
