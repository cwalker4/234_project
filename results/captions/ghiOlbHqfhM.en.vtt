Hi, welcome, w    hat's your name, please? Noel Noel James. How old you Noel, if I may ask?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.880
52

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.140
What do you do, Noel?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.940
I invigilate in schools

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.700
What is that?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.360
So when the kids are doing exams in schools and you sort of look after them, you know

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.100
Make sure they don't cheat and stuff. Yeah, if you'd have taken any other points or a level Simon you'd know that

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.400
Are you with anyone today? Unfortunately, my girlfriend couldn't make it because she doesn't exist

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.200
Well look good luck, thank you very much

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.969
Okay in Blackpool

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.439
My name is Noel my full name is in fact, Noel Wind James. That's right. I don't pronounce the in fact

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.440
I'm glad you laughing

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.340
Because I've had a terrible day. You've cheered me up. You know, I was woken up at 4 a.m. This morning the phone rang

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.899
Who's ringing me at this time? I'll pick the phone up at you down the line. Achoo. There's a cold caller at that time

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.119
But as you can see there's in time I brought my instrument with me tonight I do hope you enjoy this next tune

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.119
Thank you very much

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.949
Well, this is sorry I just bring the guitar to keep it in shape this II

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.570
Don't know if you've seen one of these before, this is an Old Welsh instrument, it's got a Welsh name that's right

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.570
It's called a bug

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.829
and

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.409
I am gonna play a tune for you ladies and gentlemen. Oh, this is not an original tune. This is a cover

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.520
He's good, isn't he, we like Noel

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.679
And some of you may recognize it. 
Here we go

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.359
it's a famous film from the 70s, it's the Elephant Man

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.360
Well, you are up for some music ladies and gentlemen. 
Yesss

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.489
Any wool

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.169
This is it Lola got free bag full

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
Hello hello

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.530
You look happy

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.089
I'm quite delighted at what's your name? It's my name is Delhi. So Delhi search upon that that's amazing

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.098
Malawi in name of Malawi. Yes, so I'm from allowed, but I live in Manchester

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.529
Why have you come on Britain's Got? I've come to make the people laugh. I am a comedian. I

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.420
Would love the winner of Britain's Got Talent this year to be a comedian. Oh, no pressure no pressure

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.229
Who you here with? So I'm here just alone

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.799
I my brother no, no he wanted to come he's a doctor and he was like either I should save lives or come with you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.220
Well, your parents disappointed that one of you is a comedian

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.459
One of you was a doctor they were absolutely horrified because I was studying computer programming so I had a future

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120
Okay, excellent

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.728
Well, I'm at that age now all my friends are getting married and married people forget how horrible it is being single

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.180
They love to call me and complain about their company problems. Always get you're so lucky being single I get home

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.739
My wife just starts nagging nag nag nag like I have to nag myself. I

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.180
Get Holden like what time do I call this?

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.410
Why don't I ever do the dishes

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.980
Sometimes I think I don't appreciate myself

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.199
I haven't always been a comedian. I did some weird jobs. I used to clean houses and I'll admit I was tempted to steal

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.649
I didn't steal because the Bible says thou shalt not steal. But nowhere does it say thou shalt not swap?

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.559
I took a stereo left a Walkman took a plasma screen left an etch-a-sketch

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.150
As I mentioned I am from Africa I moved here ten years ago and immediately I moved here

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.759
I heard a lot of British people talking about the financial

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.459
Crisis the recession. I'm from Africa. What are you maniacs talking about?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.109
You call that a crisis if that's a crisis. Where's UNICEF?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Where is Bono

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.389
I've not seen one save the UK Concert

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.519
You can tell me it's a financial crisis when their planes flying over Birmingham tossing fish and chips out the window

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.940
It will be a financial crisis when there are ads on television saying this chap has to walk five miles a day

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.619
To get a bottle of wkd blue

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.930
And 100% you have got a financial crisis when India starts opening call centers here

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.979
Can you imagine some poor guy Mumbai calls back ends up talking to a Brahmi

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.490
Thank you so much

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.159
The shit

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.009
I

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:53.518
Just want to say you're bloody hilarious

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.049
Thank you

00:07:56.049 --> 00:08:01.169
Self-deprecating funny relevance, I mean laughs after laughs after laughs it just kept on coming

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:05.009
And I really want you to win the entire serie

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:16.470
I think you have a golden future. Oh, thank you so much. I'm shocked and delighted
So am I

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.760
My face is hurting from laughing. I'm so pleased that Amanda pressed the golden buzzer for you

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.659
You are brilliant, and I cannot wait to hear more from you. Well done

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.820
You should be a comedy superstar all the jokes were really original and

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.950
You are incredibly likeable. I couldn't fault it well done

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:53.219
No need do I think you're an undiscovered all-star I could see you owning your own show

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.510
What you did was so funny and naughty

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:04.289
Unique this is why we make shows like this to find people like you

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.770
Hello

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.259
What is your name. 
My name's Jack Jack Jack

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.885
Carroll and how old are you? 14, 14 years

00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:28.439
and tell me a little bit more about you

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.080
I'm a professional gymnast

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.460
My name is Jack. I am 14 team and today I'm gonna be doing a bit of stand-up comedy

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.600
So proposing since since I was born

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.370
Yeah, basically

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.290
Still got it

00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:00.589
What go where it's impossible for him to move around without some kind of aid either a wheelchair or a walking frame?

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.289
That seems to be the least of his worries

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.859
His big worries are whether his jokes make people laugh or not

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:13.909
I used my cerebral palsy in my act because in comedy a lot of times your

00:10:14.189 --> 00:10:17.539
Weaknesses are your strengths? It's like the elephant in the room

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:20.239
And then when you mention it, they go

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:24.709
And they can relax and enjoy the rest of the funny jokes

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:30.169
He wants to make people laugh and he wants to make something of his life and the unreal apparently

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.620
I'm not looking to help people in need because I'm a horrible selfish individual

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:44.689
but if people do find some comfort or some inspiration from what I do, then brilliant, bonus

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.029
I'm never gonna be user involved right, but that's soft it

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.589
But maybe I can focus on EastEnders which is umm...

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.259
bring joy to the world

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.920
 

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.229
Well,  best of luck. 
Alright Cheers

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.479
Don't worry I know what you're thinking Harry Potter in a nasty Quidditch accident

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.649
Do you know I can't stand sorry. sorry, let me reenphasize. Do you know what?  I can't stand

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:29.888
Look on the bright side. I've never had to queue at Disneyland

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:43.240
Now just I'm just gonna throw a disclaimer out there if I do get too energetic please stop me I want to keep my benefit

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.200
Otherwise, how would I hate the Jacuzzi?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.260
I'm joking. I'm joking. It's a pool. I

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040
I was there I was at the

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.019
Cinema, seeing the new James Bond film the other day and then it got me thinking, you know

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:09.989
Maybe I would have liked to have had a go, you know being James Bond, but obviously I'm a bit inhibited. Ah

00:12:10.839 --> 00:12:13.258
Mr. Bond, I've been expecting you

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.709
No lift

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.709
But this isn't the first Britain's Got Talent event

00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:32.049
I've been to I was actually a

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:37.899
Live tour in Manchester funnily enough two years ago and the staff they couldn't be more helpful

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.039
Moving people out the way getting us to our seat and then when we finally got there the view was just fantastic

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.980
And we sat down and my sister

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:53.649
She tapped me on the shoulder, turn around and I'll never forget this as long as I live. She said

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.940
Jack

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.389
We are so lucky you're disabled

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:04.389
We can not take you anywhere

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:35.789
Right, Jack, yeah, I am gonna have to go to David first of all Jack you are a comedy genius

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:44.420
I wasn't as funny as you. I'm not even as funny as you, now as you are at 14 years old. It was incredible every joke was a  winner

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.840
You make me laugh before the act even started and...

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.220
I know I've got a funny face. 
No, you do...

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.220
Jack the thing that is great is that

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:05.119
Nobody feels sorry for you, yourself deprecating. You're hilarious

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:08.059
And I think, we've got huge future

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:21.720
Well, I'm gonna tell you Jack you've got one of the most refreshing attitudes you made fun, you know of what you've gone through

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.980
And you made it funny which is really really difficult. You've just got an

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.820
incredible personality

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.020
And I am really happy that I met you

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.420

Fantastic comments from the judges 
Four yeses. Yes. An standing ovation from the crowd

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.560

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.880
A great day.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.760

She makes it clear dodo dodo dododoo

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:17.209
Pray women, why do you always come to the club, with a friend that doesn't look as cute as you?

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.620
Yes, and guys just as you're about to get the cute ones number the friend comes along and messes it up completely

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.140
Yes, let me set the scene Alicia. 
Hi, you're kind of cute.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.420

If I'm not getting the man no one's getting a man

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.839
Total Recall predator commando action films. I love them. Favorite action hero; Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.920
Yes

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.000
Cuz Schwarzenegger is always asking quest ions, huh?

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080
What the hell is going on?

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.180
What did I do wrong?

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.740
And he's always trying to explain his drama to other people that don't care

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.000
some men just try to kill me

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.860
I think it was spies or something Harry from work. He was the boss

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.140
Blood on my shoulder

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.700
Get down

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.480
I really like him. I do like him, he's funny

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.880
Yes

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.139
I don't know what to say that really moved me only Ant &amp; Dec. Thank you so much

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.720
He is good. He's very good

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
Congratulations

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.680
Thank you

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.260
There's no one out there that I can think of right now who is like that

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.820
See you in the studio

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.780
Well done

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.260
Go celebrate
Thanks a lot

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.580
Hello! What is your name?

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:44.140
Hello, my name is Lee and for obvious reasons, I'm also known as The Lost Voice guy

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.520
Okay, and how long have you lost your voice?

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.550
I just knew you were going to ask something that I hadn't thought about beforehand

00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.079
So, please excuse the awkward silence while I type out my answer

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:10.489
I've been speechless for 37 years. 
Wow, tell me why you decide to enter the show this year

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.769
I think I entered Britain's Got Talent for the same reason everyone does

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.880
to meet Ant &amp; Dec

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.600
yeahhh

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.520
This was all going so well up until that point 
The stage Lee is yours

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.170
Hello ladies and gentlemen

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:44.300
As you may be able to tell I'm a struggling stand-up comedian who also struggles to stand up

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.440
To be honest, I'm not sure how good I am

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.649
I'll leave that for you to decide

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:59.629
But just so you know if you don't laugh at the disabled guy you are going to hell

00:22:07.999 --> 00:22:12.639
Well, I realized I'd never be able to talk again I was speechless

00:22:15.589 --> 00:22:18.519
I have lived in Newcastle all my life

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:23.679
Yes, but for some reason I still haven't picked up the accent.

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:32.019
I can see that some of you are trying to figure out where you know me from

00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:39.669
Maybe it would help if I started saying phrases such as the next train to arrive on Back..  is the 1252..

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:54.878
And from my time at the post office, please go to cashier number eight

00:22:59.869 --> 00:23:02.019
I got the train here today,

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:06.998
I always like to sit in those seats for disabled people.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:13.778
I was about halfway here when another disabled person got on and asked me to move.

00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:22.239
I didn't realize I'd be playing disabled Top Trumps when I got on or I would have dress more special

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.169
Needless to say I didn't give up my seat

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:30.398
Who cares if he was both blind and deaf ?

00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:33.219
I was there first

00:23:33.469 --> 00:23:38.169
It was very awkward. He couldn't see that I was still there and

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.089
I couldn't tell him I wasn't moving because I can't speak

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:54.858
Before I leave you I have one more thing to say

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.830
I hate that we have so many

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.389
politically correct words to describe disabled people now

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:05.269
It's all special needs

00:24:05.639 --> 00:24:07.200
special schools

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
special olympics,

00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:12.169
I don't know. What is so special about me

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:19.608
That is why it always alarms me when I hear about special forces going to war

00:24:21.389 --> 00:24:23.389
You've been a fantastic audience

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.820
Goodbye

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.960
Bloody brilliant!
