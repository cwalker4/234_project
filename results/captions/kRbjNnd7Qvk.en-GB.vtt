00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.240
At 42 million...

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.160
The art world, where paintings
change hands for fortunes.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.520
Sold. Thank you very much.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.400
But for every known masterpiece

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.240
there may be another still waiting
to be discovered.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.840
This is it.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.040
International art dealer Philip
Mould and I

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.760
have teamed up to hunt for
lost works by great artists.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.480
We use old-fashioned detective work
and state-of-the-art science

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.880
to get to the truth.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.160
Science can enable us to see beyond
the human eye.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.200
Da-da! Oh, wow!

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Every case is packed with surprise
and intrigue.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.880
Is it or isn't it a Freud, then?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.400
But not every painting is quite what
it seems.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.240
It's a journey that can end in
joy...

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.120
This is definitely by
Paul Delaroche.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.360
..or bitter disappointment.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.960
I can't cope with this
roller-coaster.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.040
What a nightmare!

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200
In this episode we're on the trail
of two pictures believed to be by

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.800
one of the world's most
sought-after artists -

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200
Paul Gauguin.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.360
We could be dealing with something
of extraordinary significance as

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.440
artworks by this most innovative, if
controversial, 19th-century artist,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.600
they should be worth hundreds of
thousands of pounds.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.000
But the authenticity of both
pictures has been thrown into doubt.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.520
They no longer believed it was a
Gauguin,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.320
almost as sweet and as short as
that.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.080
Can we find new evidence to show
that these enchanting pictures

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.640
deserve a second chance?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.720
It's like it's coming into focus.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a journey that takes us to
Brittany and Bilbao and back to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.320
the uncertainty and danger of
the Second World War.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.400
It makes me shiver,
it really does.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.200
At stake, two significant prizes -
a rare still life...

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.600
..and what may be the very first
study for a Gauguin masterpiece,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.040
one of the most expensive paintings
ever sold.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.800
There are collectors out there who
would really want this.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.760
Two chances of redemption, but is
either picture the real deal?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.800
I'm really nervous.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.960
London, home to some of the world's
greatest art collections.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.960
For art detectives on the hunt for a
lost masterpiece, there is no better

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.200
training than getting up close
and personal with the greats.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.360
And if there were a world ranking of
artists,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.600
one name would be near the top.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.920
So here is Gauguin.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.680
And when I think of Gauguin, this is
exactly what comes to mind.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.800
Gauguin is one of those artists
that gets the blood boiling for

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.960
collectors and curators across
the world.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.280
Gauguin. Tahitian Gauguin, from
1896.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.040
I shall bring the hammer down at
Â£7,300,000.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.240
Born in Paris in 1848, Paul Gauguin
worked as a stockbroker,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.680
just painting in his spare time.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800
Yet, by the early 1880s,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.240
his work was being exhibited
alongside the Impressionists.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.640
He would eventually abandon his
family

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.080
to pursue the life of a
bohemian artist.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.560
Self-centred and impulsive,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.160
a hedonist who sunk to the depths
of depravity.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.640
Famed for his bold experimentation
with colour,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.720
Gauguin is best remembered for his
scenes of native life in Tahiti,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.560
which he first visited in 1891.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.280
He died, penniless and
disease-ridden,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.600
in his tropical paradise in 1903.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.640
Even though he struggled for money
throughout his artistic career,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.480
one of Gauguin's Tahitian paintings,
back in 2015,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.320
sold for what is thought to be
200 million,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.760
making it one of the most expensive
paintings ever sold.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.000
And frankly one can see why.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.120
Demand for Gauguin's work has never
been higher

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
and we have been contacted

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.280
by two viewers who each think
they're in possession

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.520
of something special.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.360
I've always wanted a Gauguin on
Fake Or Fortune?,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120
but it's always the way,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.680
you wait ages for one and then two
come along at the same time.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.280
I'm following up the first of
our leads

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.680
about a possible Gauguin
discovery

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.960
in suburban Manchester.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.400
It might be a far cry from Tahiti,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.880
but the picture I've received via
e-mail

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.800
has enough promise to brighten

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.360
the morning of any art dealer.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.040
So I've arranged to meet the owner
of this tantalising little sketch,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.160
NHS nutritionist Steffi Price.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.320
Hello. How very nice to meet you.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.800
Thank you for having us.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.120
So this is the picture I wanted you
to have a look at.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.440
Here it is.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.640
This has got impact.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.600
There's a feeling of power here.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.320
It's lovely, isn't it?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.800
VOICEOVER: On first glance,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.600
Steffi's picture appears to be a
sketch in pencil and charcoal of

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.960
a Tahitian woman, perhaps a relic

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.680
from the artist's time in
the Pacific...

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.640
If it's genuine, that is.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.400
So what's the story here,
where did it come from?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.560
So it came from my grandfather,
who was called Alfred Scharf.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.840
He was an art historian and
an art dealer as well.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.600
He originally came from Germany
in the early '30s.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.640
So is this him? Yes, this is a photo
of him, which I love,

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.120
I think that sums him up.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.560
Steffi's grandfather,
Dr Alfred Scharf,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.920
was born in 1900 and worked as
a curator in Berlin.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.080
When his Jewish origins brought him
to the attention of the Nazi regime,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.080
he fled to Britain in 1933
with his wife and daughter,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.160
where he continued his career as
an art historian.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.320
He is every inch the connoisseur,
isn't he?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.440
He is, isn't he? The light falling
on both of them like that.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.720
A bookish connoisseur in the 1940s
with a good eye.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.080
You might expect a drawing like
this therefore...

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.480
To be genuine. ..to have a good
chance of being authentic.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.200
Yes. So where, as far as you know,
did he get the drawing from?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.960
I don't know. I'm assuming he got it
at auction in London,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.160
I think that's most likely.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.720
Right, so it says here, written by
your grandmother,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.640
"bought by Dr Scharf..." -

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.720
your grandfather, Alfred -
"..June 10th 1948."

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.240
So that's pretty definite.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.480
That sounds like a sale, doesn't it?
I think so.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.600
Have you tried to authenticate it
yourself?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.880
I took this to one of the leading
auction houses in London,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.080
who were
initially very excited about it.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.920
But then they showed it to one of
their experts,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.360
who felt it could be a forgery.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.040
Yes, so when a leading auction house
says...

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.360
it's probably a fake and return
it to you,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.960
that's normally the end of the road.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.720
I know, but I suppose that's why we
have approached you because I'm not

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.200
convinced that is the truth either.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.640
If we could prove this is by
Gauguin,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.720
it would be a serious drawing.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.160
There's no doubt about it,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
there are collectors out there who
would really want this.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.080
They would fight to own it.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.200
I can see this being worth up to
Â£200,000.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.120
Oh, goodness! It's a lot more than
I thought.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.720
But...

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.680
We've got a struggle.
If we could prove it,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.600
what would you do,
would you sell it?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.560
I might do. It would be nice to be
able to pay off the mortgage.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.520
It appears that we could be dealing
with something of extraordinary

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.320
significance, a drawing by
Paul Gauguin,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.680
one of the towering figures of
late 19th-century French art,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.120
and not only that, but from an
extremely pivotal, important moment

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.160
in his life, 1891, 1892,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.600
when he went out to Tahiti to
find new inspiration,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.240
new artistic ideas.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.720
While he was in Tahiti, Gauguin

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.000
filled many sketchbooks with
drawings.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.600
He called these studies of
indigenous life his "secrets",

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.840
but they provided the building
blocks for his most ambitious

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.800
oil paintings,
such as When Will You Marry?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.760
The portrait of two native women
sold privately

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.560
for over 200 million.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.960
If Steffi's simple drawing came
from one of these sketchbooks,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.080
could it be one of Gauguin's very
first preparatory works for

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.680
this landmark painting?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.360
While Philip takes Steffi's sketch
back to London for further research,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.640
I'm on my way to Cambridgeshire to
follow up our second lead about

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.840
a possible still life by
Paul Gauguin.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.680
I've arranged to meet architect
James Snell to find out more.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.560
Hello. Hello.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.640
Welcome. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.120
I've come to see your painting.
Well... Yes, I hope so.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.160
So here we are.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:57.000
Still life with...six peaches or
oranges, I can't quite tell.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.080
It used to be Six Oranges, but
then, later on,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.120
we believed it might have been
called Six Peaches.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.200
The bowl behind, this is a table
here...

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.000
Lovely warm colours, aren't they?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.880
Yes, super.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.880
And, now, this is intriguing.
"Au Seigner Roy",

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.640
or "Hoi", as they would say in
French.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.560
And then, what's this, PG? PG.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.760
We hope for Paul Gauguin?
We do indeed.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.080
How did this painting come into
your family?

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.920
It was given to my parents by
Dick Rykens,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.440
who lived further down the
lane from my parents' house.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.880
Dick was a close friend of the
family

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.760
and I have a picture here, you can
see him standing

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.160
in front of the house
down the lane that he

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.920
was just doing up.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.200
There he is, there is Dick,
there is my mother and my father,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.560
and he had inherited it from his
father, Sir Paul Rykens.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.160
Sir Paul Rykens was a Dutch
businessman

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.360
who in 1930 had presided
over the merger

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.920
of two companies to create
the multinational giant Unilever.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.440
As the founding chairman of
the firm,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.520
he could afford to shop for
the finest art.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.280
Someone like Sir Paul Rykens, one
assumes, would only have bought

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.880
from the very top,
most reputable dealers.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.840
I would have thought so, yes.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.600
And there is a sticker on the back.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.680
OK. So what have we got here?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.200
Huink and...

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.760
Oh, my gosh. Huink and Scherjon,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.160
which sold the painting to Sir Paul
Rykens in 1936, I think it was.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.400
So it's there, "Paul Gauguin,
Orange."

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.520
Orange. And it's complete as well.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.240
Once you'd inherited this picture,
what did you do with it?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.880
We took it to a London auction house
to see whether they would be able to

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.720
sell it for us

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.720
and, indeed, they got very excited
and wrote us a letter.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.200
And the letter, this was back in
2011...

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.720
..explaining that they would want to
put it as their centrepiece

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.800
of their auction for the June
auction.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.920
Oh, my goodness, "I am writing to
confirm that we would be honoured

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.240
"to present Gauguin's Six
Peches..." - so Six Peaches.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.080
"It is a beautiful example of the
artist's work and its appearance on

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.880
"the market is likely to be greeted
with much enthusiasm.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.600
"We recommend an auction estimate of
Â£200,000-300,000."

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.800
They loved this painting.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.240
Yes, it's amazing, isn't it?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.320
So why are we here? What went wrong?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.000
Well, four weeks before the auction,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.920
I got a call telling me that they
were pulling it because they no

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.960
longer believed it was a Gauguin -

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.120
almost as sweet and as short
as that.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.040
The auction house revealed that they
had consulted with a Gauguin expert,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.440
who told them she did not
recognise the hand of the artist

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.320
in James's painting.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.160
And how did you feel about that?
Well, a bit of a blow,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.040
especially after the initial
enthusiasm was so great.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.640
I mean, it's a sucker punch,
isn't it?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.600
It is, yes. When you get a letter
like this,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.240
where they are falling over
themselves

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.320
to sell your picture and then they
say, "Oh, sorry." Yes.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.320
Goodness. So it's been a bit of a
roller-coaster with your picture?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.520
Yes, yes, it has.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.680
Back in London, I've been doing some
research into Steffi's sketch of

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.440
the Tahitian woman and I've made a
perplexing discovery

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.480
in a book about Gauguin's art.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.200
I've been trying to work out why
the auction house wouldn't

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.880
accept it and it seems reasonably
straightforward.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.960
Steffi's drawing appears to be
almost exactly replicated in a book

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.320
published in 1958, ten years after
Steffi's grandfather bought it.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.640
It shows the same image,
but around it

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.160
are other drawings, doodles,
sketches.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.960
So is Steffi's sketch just a copy of
the central figure in the book,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.960
as the auction house seem to be
suggesting?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.960
Or is it the original image,
drawn by Gauguin himself?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.280
And if that's the case, what
happened to the rest of it?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.520
We've got to explain why it's
smaller.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.680
Could it be that it's been folded
over behind?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.280
Could there have been some
jiggery-pokery in the past

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.120
that we might be able to prove?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.440
There are two exhibition labels on
the back that will need further

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.960
scrutiny, but I'm eager to get to
the sketch itself.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.520
Let's see if I can actually get it
out by removing

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.840
the tape along the edges.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.680
Can't really get to grips with the
drawing until you take it out from

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.920
behind its glass.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.280
Ah, now, that's interesting.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.560
Looks as though it is drawn in
something like charcoal or pencil,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.560
but a mechanical copy it is not.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.880
But it's also much clearer now that
there's a sense of this being part

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.120
something larger, something bigger.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.920
And, actually, when you hold up to
the light,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.680
what's also become very evident is
that it has had quite a brutal past

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.040
as well.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.920
There's a great big tear mark,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.000
as though someone has taken a bite
out of it -

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.640
but then replaced the paper.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.160
I think that's pretty clear.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.440
This drawing has been cut down.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.480
And the reason that the auction
house did not accept it

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.360
is because this drawing is published
in a book in 1958.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.960
Steffi's grandfather bought it ten
years earlier

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.560
and it was a different shape.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.200
It was smaller,
how do you explain that?

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.000
Two pictures attributed to
Paul Gauguin,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.200
both rejected by auction houses.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.640
Can we find any new evidence to show
that they deserve a second hearing?

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.680
It's a tall order. Gauguin's work
has frequently been forged,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.840
particularly in the years after
his death

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.520
as his reputation began to grow.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.120
We've recruited Professor
Anthea Callen,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.640
one of the world's leading experts
in 19th-century French art,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.360
to assist with our research.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.680
She has been trawling through
archives and inventories

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.200
of Gauguin's work in search of
fresh leads.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.360
Anthea, we've got two pictures
up here.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.760
Can we start by talking about the
oil first of all?

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.200
What have you found out about that?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.360
The still life,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.120
we do in fact have a reproduction of
it in the 1964 catalogue raisonne.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.560
So the authorised list of
Gauguin's works.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.600
The problem for us is that right
from the start this catalogue was

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.920
considered problematic.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.200
There are known to be works that
are fake.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.640
Certainly inauthentic.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.720
There are characteristics about this
picture that seem to sort of scream

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.400
Gauguin, particularly the strong
circumference lines

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.000
for those pieces of fruit,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.320
but there are other bits that
worry me.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.800
James has had this painting
scientifically examined

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.840
and he knows that the
pigments are from the right period

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.520
for Gauguin, so that much we do
know.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.160
Yeah, and that's what is so
reassuring about this painting

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.720
when you look into it.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.600
It bears all the scars and
the bruises of its age.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.960
It definitely feels old.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.040
What's also really interesting about
this work is that it actually has

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.560
a dedication,
not just a signature, the PG.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.720
It also has "Au Seigner Roy".

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.600
When I saw that name on James's
painting, I did a bit of research

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.640
and I thought that was rather
encouraging because

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.120
Seigner Roy is Louis Roy,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.360
who was a friend of Gauguin,
a fellow artist.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.880
Here we have him.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.720
This is supposed to be a portrait of
Louis Roy by Gauguin

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.040
from 1889,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.040
when they were in fact exhibiting
together in a show in Paris.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.920
He certainly collected Gauguin
paintings,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.480
including six that he then sold on
to the dealer Ambroise Vollard

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.080
in 1904.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.240
Well, the provenance for the oil
painting is pretty strong, actually.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.680
If we turn the picture around, have
a look at the back,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.920
there's a label on there which
appears to relate to a sale in 1936,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.640
when, as far as James
understands it,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.240
the painting was sold to none other
than the founder of Unilever,
Sir Paul Rykens.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.680
Well, 1936.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.240
I think we can take it back even a
bit further

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.920
because we have discovered a sale
catalogue of 1930 in Paris

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.080
where James's
painting is reproduced.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.280
That's unquestionably our picture -

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.560
it's one and the same -
and what a gift.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.240
I mean, the idea of it being
photographed in a sale in 1930,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.520
how often does that happen?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.720
So that's real progress for our
oil painting.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.040
Let's look at the sketch.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.240
I mean, look at that, doesn't it
have cracking presence?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.960
Isn't it beautiful?

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.000
But look at the back!

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440
Two exhibition labels on the back of
the picture provide a title for

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.960
the sketch, "Femme accroupie",
or Crouching Woman,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.160
and a number of tantalising leads.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.240
Paul Gauguin, exhibition of works
at...the Leicester Galleries.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.800
Very well-known galleries of the
period

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.800
in Leicester Square in London.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.160
The man who bought this picture was
Lord Ivor Churchill,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.680
a very wealthy man, a cousin of
Winston Churchill.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.400
And Steffi says her grandfather
bought it from Lord Ivor Churchill.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.200
And what have we here?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.120
Look at that, not one but
there appears now two exhibitions.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.000
Kunsthalle, Basel, in Switzerland,
in 1928!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.400
Is it too good to be true? It is, of
course, possible to fake labels,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.200
just as it's possible to fake art.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.080
But you've got to keep in mind that
this drawing was turned down by

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.720
the auction house.
Effectively, they say it's a fake.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.960
Do they know something that we
don't?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.480
Steffi, who got it from her
grandfather,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.960
says that her grandfather was
a dealer.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.640
Perhaps he was taken in.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.480
The more we find out about him,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.920
the closer we might get to
an answer.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.360
I want to know if Steffi's
grandfather

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.440
was the kind of man who knew
a genuine Gauguin when he saw one

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.040
and my research has led us to the
Imperial War Museum in London.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.640
It's clear that Dr Alfred Scharf
was a highly respected art historian

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.800
with an impressive track record in
discovering lost masterpieces,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.280
such as this 15th-century
Dutch triptych.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.800
But the esteem in which Dr Scharf
was held

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.360
is most strikingly revealed

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.680
in a sinister wartime document that
curator Simon Offard

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.880
has found for us.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.840
When the Germans were preparing to
invade Great Britain,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.440
the SS general drew up this list.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.520
It's called the
Sonderfahndungsliste,

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.240
which literally means
special wanted list.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:51.040
It's a list of 2,820 people that
the Nazis wanted taken into

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.400
custody as soon as the UK was
invaded.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.880
Now, a lot of people on this list
were there because they were famous

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.040
politicians, so Churchill, Eden,
Attlee, Chamberlain,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.560
and included authors,
writers, poets,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.000
people like HG Wells
and JB Priestley.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.160
I can see where this is going now.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.360
And included, in this list,
page 191...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.560
..Dr Alfred Scharf.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.920
His name, date of birth.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.680
He's down as an assistant and
living in London.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.040
It's horrible. I find it really
upsetting, actually.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.040
I mean, I had no idea a list like
that existed.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.480
I mean, it's a hit list, basically,
isn't it?

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.320
I'm quite shocked to see his name
there.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.840
I had no idea he would've been seen
as a threat in that way.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:50.600
We know Hitler, Himmler and Goering
all had huge art collections,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.520
which were stolen, taken from
individuals.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.280
Your grandfather's knowledge of
hidden works of art

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.560
could have proved useful.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.040
It makes me shiver,
it really does.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.040
The Nazis did not like the fact
that they'd lost him.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.600
They wanted to get him.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.240
Alfred Scharf is really a man I can
identify with.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.280
I mean, he hunted down pictures
for a living.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.400
He really cared about attribution

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.040
and, in a curious sort of way,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.480
the fact that the Nazis wanted him
is a tribute to his status.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.200
And I am beginning to feel that
this is so much more than

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.880
just about Gauguin.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.640
It's about restoring the reputation

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.240
of a man who has effectively
been accused of buying a fake.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.160
This is about Alfred, it's also
about Steffi and her family.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.920
We want to put the record straight.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.120
While Philip continues his research
into Steffi's sketch,

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.400
I've been digging deeper into
the origins

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.040
of the still life owned by
James Snell.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.240
When it was listed as a genuine work
in the 1964 catalogue of Gauguin's

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.480
pictures, it was described as being
painted in 1889,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.840
when Gauguin was in Brittany.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.040
A time when he and many others were
trying to find their own style.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.200
I've been doing some research
and it's clear, not just from this
article,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.480
but from quite a few others, that
paintings from this period that were

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.800
once thought to be by Gauguin are
no longer believed to be so.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.280
And the difficulty with
authenticating Gauguin is that he,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.600
as he developed as an artist,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600
appropriated styles from
other artists,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.280
the Impressionists in particular,
Cezanne, he greatly admired.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.320
And then, the artists that admired
Gauguin, in turn, copied him.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.120
And so, you know,
it's all pretty confused.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.560
I want to find out more about the
work Gauguin was doing in the late

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.160
1880s, so owner James and I

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.920
are following in his footsteps to
Brittany.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.440
Gauguin was drawn to this wild and
primitive part of northern France

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.840
and settled in Pont-Aven in 1886,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.320
quickly establishing himself in
the town's small colony of artists.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.640
It was here that Gauguin developed
a more bold and distinctive style,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.080
thanks in part to his friendship
with fellow artist Emile Bernard.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.000
I'm keen to know whether James's
painting fits the pattern of

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.720
Gauguin's work from this period,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.000
so we've arranged to meet
Lionel Jacques

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.680
in the Museum of Fine Arts
in Quimper.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.640
Lionel, when Gauguin came to
Pont-Aven,

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.640
it was already an established
artist colony,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.600
but he did meet someone who turned
out to be rather important,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.240
who was a young artist called
Emile Bernard.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.880
Yes. He was only 18 at the time.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.800
How important was he in relation to
Gauguin

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.320
and their influence upon
each other?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.520
So Emile Bernard met Gauguin for
the first time in 1886 in Pont-Aven,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.600
but the important moment is two
years later,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.840
when both painters
come back to Pont-Aven

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.280
and Emile Bernard will bring a new
technique called cloisonnism.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.520
It is this way of painting large
surfaces of one colour,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.720
surrounded by a dark line.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.320
A bit like stained-glass.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.080
Stained-glass windows.
Exactly. Blocks of colour.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.560
This technique of cloisonnism,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.040
with its bold lines and flat blocks
of colour,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.600
is much in evidence in the museum,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.720
which holds work by many artists who
adopted the style.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.960
And it seems to be echoed in
James's painting.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.360
It is the perspective that I've...

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.240
It's almost troubled me,
of the painting,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.960
because it doesn't look very real.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.160
The fruit is flat and the fruit is
sat right on the edge of the table,

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.520
which realistically might not really
have been like that.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.800
But it is because it made this
slightly strange composition,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.640
which I think is quite interesting.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.080
James's painting has all the
qualities of the cloisonnism style

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.520
Gauguin adopted in Brittany.
But like all new ideas,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.480
it was quick to catch on and
much imitated.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.640
In 1889, when James's picture may
have been painted,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.960
Gauguin was living in the little
seaside hamlet of Le Pouldu.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.880
He was here for 17 months,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.560
staying with two other artists in
a cramped hotel.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.280
The interior has been recreated for
visitors keen to experience the life

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.760
of a late 19th-century artist.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.280
And my research into this bohemian
group has thrown up some concerns

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.600
I want to share with James.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.480
James, I wanted to bring you here
because I think this is where we can

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.640
really feel what it was like for
Gauguin and his fellow painters when

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.560
they all got together here in
Brittany,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.400
and they were painting and exploring
and finding new ideas.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.520
And if you think about it,
when they were in here,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.760
when the weather was inclement,
like it is today,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.920
they would come indoors and paint
still lives.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.600
Yeah. I mean, basically it means
that it is going to be something

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.120
that was very similar in their work,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.880
if they were painting the same scene
with the same light and indeed

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.760
cross-fertilisation of ideas.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.200
Exactly. Which is why I wanted to
show you this.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.920
This is a painting by Gauguin and
we've done a little sort of

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.920
approximation of it with the onions

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.280
and the apples and the ceramic
vessel there.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.640
So that is by Gauguin.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.800
And that is by de Haan,
Meijer de Haan,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.560
the Dutch artist who was here and a
great friend of Gauguin's.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.280
Of the same...
Of exactly the same...

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.160
Yeah. The bread, the onions.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.080
Wow. Just painted from a different
angle, differently.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.360
Very slightly different.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.520
With a number of artists painting
the exact same subject

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.960
in a very similar style,
telling them apart

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.840
can be fraught with difficulty.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.760
How can we be sure a picture is by
Gauguin and not by one of his

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.360
followers, such as the painter
Charles Laval?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.480
I've been doing a bit of research
into the artists who came here

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.440
and gathered around Gauguin,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.480
trying to follow in the wake of
the master,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.400
and some troubling things have
emerged.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.640
So take an artist called
Charles Laval, for example,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.640
he ended up travelling with Gauguin
to Martinique at one stage.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.920
The catalogue raisonne,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.080
the authorised list of Gauguin's
works that was produced in 1964,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.960
24 of the works in there which
were attributed to Gauguin

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.080
have emerged to be by Charles Laval.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.160
You've got a chap called
Emile Bernard,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.800
a great admirer of Gauguin's.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800
To his horror, he found out by going
to an auction that one of his own

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.440
works had been passed off as
a Gauguin and someone had stuck

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.120
a Gauguin signature on the bottom
of it.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.880
And then there was a number of
paintings by his mates here

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.520
at Le Pouldu and also at Pont-Aven

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.360
and then, later on, their
paintings got thoroughly mixed up.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.080
Who these days has heard of Emile
Bernard, Charles Laval?

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.360
Very few people.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.800
Well, compared to Gauguin.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.200
Compared to Gauguin - his name,
he is a global phenomenon.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.320
Yeah. It's a rather intriguing
situation, though,

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.800
that these fellow artists of Gauguin
have ended up producing fakes.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.360
Yeah. Either because people have
later on taken their pictures and

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.920
put Gauguin on the bottom.
To raise its value.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.920
To raise the value. Or, perhaps,

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.920
and there are some question marks
only over one or two of them,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.760
that they put Gauguin on there
themselves.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.440
Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.960
Yeah.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.040
We shall see. So this great
fraternity of artists

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.920
may have actually led to something
slightly darker.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.320
Yes. I can see that.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.840
Our visit to Brittany might have
helped us understand the way James's

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.680
painting looks, but it has thrown up
new doubts

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.360
about just who painted it.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.840
I am slightly confused.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.000
The fact that paintings are...one
day they can be authenticated to be

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
by a particular artist
and the next day not.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.800
That's what I find most frustrating.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.760
I'm still remaining incredibly
open-minded

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.360
about the future of our painting.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.960
We haven't allowed ourselves

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.280
the luxury to think that it could be
anything but the painting

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.160
we have at the moment.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.960
Back in London, I have been doing
further research on

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.400
our other Gauguin contender,
Steffi's sketch.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.440
One of the labels on the back of the
picture shows that it was exhibited

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.840
and sold in 1931 at the
Leicester Galleries in London.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.400
Founded in 1902 by
Cecil and Wilfred Phillips,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.280
the Galleries specialised in French
and British art

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.520
until its closure in 1977.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.440
Its archives are still maintained by
Cecil's grandson, Christopher,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.000
and he has agreed to search for any
record of Steffi's sketch in

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.600
the company's ledgers.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.040
Hi, Christopher.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.320
Have you managed to locate the
specific ledger

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.520
that relates to this period of
the Leicester Galleries' activity?

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.760
Yes, I found the ledger and we must
see if it corresponds to the label

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.280
on it. Gosh, they are wonderful,
these books, aren't they?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.280
I mean, they are all on computer
these days.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.000
Here's the...entry.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.880
This is very clear.
It is headed up Paul Gauguin,

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.160
so this is obviously sales
relating to him.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.280
There is a list of the purchasers,
and, casting my eye down,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.960
Lord Sandwich bought one.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.280
Someone called Jameson,
someone called Pollock.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.800
Here we are, Lord Ivor Churchill.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.920
He was busy that day

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.360
because this left-hand column seems
to relate to the pictures he bought.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.840
Three that day, three drawings.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.360
Here we have got "Femme Accroupie" -

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.240
Crouching Woman - that would seem to
describe exactly our drawing.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.360
It's so reassuring to see the sale
of Steffi's sketch recorded in

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.880
the ledger and I'm keen to find
out where the Leicester Galleries

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.440
got the picture from.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.360
Can you tell me anything about
the context of the sale?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.480
Well, this was from the Durrio
Collection of Paul Gauguin

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.440
and here is the catalogue.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.840
You've just mentioned a name
that I think refers to a label on

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.200
the back of our picture -

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.880
Durrio. Well, this is Durrio's
collection of Paul Gauguin.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.320
He was a personal friend of his.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.960
Christopher has managed to find
the original catalogue for the 1931

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.040
Gauguin exhibition at the
Leicester Galleries

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.280
and it contains a fascinating entry
for Crouching Woman.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.800
Here it is. Number 46 -
Femme Accroupie.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.760
Crouching Woman. "Study for the
picture - Nafea Faaipoipo."

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.320
Those few type-written words are
hugely significant.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.880
They declare that Crouching Woman
is actually a preparatory work

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.200
for Nafea Faa Ipoipo,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.240
the Tahitian title of the Paul
Gauguin oil painting better known as

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.680
When Will You Marry?, one of the
most expensive paintings ever sold.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.160
This adds an extra layer of intrigue
to Steffi's sketch because art

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.320
historians have long speculated that
the subject of the picture could be

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.320
a young Tahitian girl
called Teha'amana,

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.440
who at just 13 became Gauguin's
companion

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.400
on his first visit to
the island in 1891.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.720
This kind of sexual exploitation
between Westerners and the islanders

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.440
was, grimly, all too commonplace
at the time.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.200
While Philip is making progress
with Steffi's sketch,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.560
my concerns about James's oil
painting,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.360
the still life, are mounting.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.720
Although scientific tests confirmed
the pigments are consistent with

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.200
the late 19th-century work,
I'm keen to look deeper.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.200
So I've arranged to meet Aviva
Burnstock, head of conservation

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.360
at the Courtauld Institute of Art in
London.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.080
Hi, Aviva. Hello. Good to see you.
And you.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.240
One of the strongest connections
between the picture and Paul Gauguin

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.680
is the painted inscription to the
artist's friend, "Au Seigner Roy".

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.280
But is it all it seems?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.920
I think you can see quite clearly
here that the inscription paint is

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.240
on the very top surface.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.880
You see how brushy it is?

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.440
It is painted right on the very
surface,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.760
the final application of
brownish paint,

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.600
over the top of the final
composition -

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.920
so that is useful to see.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.480
So what does that tell us? Does it
tell us that it was painted when

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.080
the picture was created,
so when the paint was wet?

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.240
Or after it had dried?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.640
Looks like after it has dried, but
it was definitely the final touch.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.960
I can't see any areas where it has
blended into the original paint,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.520
it's just simply put on top.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.280
But it's quite dilute.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.240
Could the inscription have been put
on by someone other than the artist?

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.640
That's quite possible.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.680
And it could be not long after it
was painted or many, many years

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.800
after it was painted. It could.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.400
Under closer scrutiny,

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.920
Aviva can see that the inscription
was applied over cracks in

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.400
the underlying paint,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.080
suggesting that the picture had time
to dry and crack before

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.560
the dedication to Seigner Roy was
applied.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.840
So was the inscription merely added
by Paul Gauguin long after he had

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.040
finished the picture, perhaps as a
more personal touch for a gift?

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.400
Or might it have been added by
someone else

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.480
to make an unknown painting look
like a work by Gauguin?

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.040
To find out, I've asked handwriting
expert Adam Brand to compare the PG

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.280
signature on James's painting with
those on Gauguin's recognised works.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.360
How do they compare?

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.480
So, Adam, as you know, we have got

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.600
some concerns about James's
painting -

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.760
Still Life With Oranges.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.600
What are we seeing here, these are
all authentic Gauguins, are they?

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.080
Yes, yes.
They all look so different.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.440
Yes, I mean, some of these Ps miss
the top,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.440
they don't even look like P
structures.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.920
Some have a rising point at
the middle of the G and then go

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.200
down relatively straight.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.520
You have other Gs, they are just S
shapes, as you can see down here.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.560
So there is tremendous variety in

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.480
the authenticated Paul Gauguin
initials.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.640
So taking our particular PG

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.760
and comparing it to what we know is
an authenticated PG

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.120
on a Gauguin painting,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.000
what have you been able to find out?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.400
There is one thing that you look at,
which is always what is going on in

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.320
terms of the stroke.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.040
And when you compare the stroke,

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.200
there is a noticeable difference.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.360
This, on the left, is the P from
the question signature.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.920
The actual structure
stops in the middle.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.920
It has a sort of moustache
structure.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.480
There is no attempt to swing around
and make that P formation.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.240
And the fact that this is so jagged
around the outlines here,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.000
does that suggest a tentativeness?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.560
Yes, you're not getting the fluency.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.880
You're getting the stops,
the break, the change in pressure.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.000
You're getting, obviously,
changes in pressure here.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.480
But the smoothness is much cleaner
on this particular letter.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.200
And with a faker, you would expect
this signature to be more tentative,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.360
wouldn't you, as opposed to sort
of dashing it off...

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.160
Absolutely. ..if you were the actual
person? Yes, absolutely.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.320
OK. What else have you looked at?

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.520
Now, if we look at the G element of
Paul Gauguin,

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.880
again, there are quite noticable
differences

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.480
because, in the authenticated
Paul Gauguin,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.840
you have this lift at the end,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.480
coming down to a straight line,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.240
not necessarily vertical,
but it has a lift,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.920
a covering stroke and then that
straight quality.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.600
With this question painting,
instead of lifting,

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.920
it goes straight in and it seems to
curve a bit more than

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.160
the known Paul Gauguin paintings -

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.040
and that is why I feel so strongly

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.240
that this is by a different person
to Paul Gauguin.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.360
Even before today, we knew it had
problems.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.640
And now we have Adam, who has looked
at the signature and he clearly

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.400
doesn't think the signature is
genuine.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400
That on its own is not conclusive
evidence.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.280
But nonetheless, we are building
a picture here...

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.040
..of a painting that looks like
it is by

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.880
someone other than Paul Gauguin.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.360
And I know James is going to be so
disappointed.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.240
Doubts about the authenticity of
the still life are mounting up.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.200
We've discovered that James's
painting first came to light

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.920
in 1923, in a sale at

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.240
a famous Parisian auction house,
Hotel Drouot.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.960
The trouble is, only a handful of
Gauguin works from this sale can

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.960
still be traced and they are now
considered highly suspicious.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.680
Anthea Callen, a world-renowned
expert

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.880
in late 19th-century French art,

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.800
has also been examining the painting
in detail.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.280
And we've asked James to come to
the gallery for a crisis meeting.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.520
Hello. Hi, James.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.000
How are you doing?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.880
Nice to see you. Hello.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.880
Just to remind you where
we've got to.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.120
We've had a handwriting analyst
look at it,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.400
who had some doubts about whether or
not this signature was genuine,

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.440
and in particular revealed through
scientific analysis

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.280
that the signature would have been
put on this painting

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.760
after the painting was dry. Right.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.680
One thing we did find out in the
course of researching this painting

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.320
and its provenance is we took it
back as far as 1923

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.880
and a sale of a number
of purported Gauguins there.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.800
What's troubling is that almost all
of them have just disappeared

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.720
without trace

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.720
and the conclusion we have come to
is that many of those were dodgy.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.360
And some, we have found,

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.000
two in particular, on the walls of
prestigious museums,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.080
which we think
are almost certainly fake.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.560
Gosh!

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:33.920
So when the analysis doesn't quite
add up as we would like it,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.960
we then often fall upon
connoisseurship,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.680
that's the eye of someone who has
experience and whom we trust -

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.600
and Anthea is here in this capacity.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.040
Hi, Anthea. Hi, James.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.800
Well, I found the bowl was really
quite convincing

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.000
because, although it's
an irregular-shaped bowl,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.680
it shows Gauguin's interest in
Cezanne,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.400
which I felt was potentially
very positive.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.880
But there are other aspects of it
which are less convincing.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.640
The brushwork is less than
characteristic.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.000
I think there are weaknesses in
the drawing,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.400
which suggest a hand much more

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.840
amateurish than that of Gauguin,
to be honest.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.520
For example, the way that the
brushwork here

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.040
produces this kind of strange
wiggle.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.000
The squiggle? It's almost
like a bit of writing, isn't it?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.920
It is. I mean, there are aspects to
it like that,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.120
and also the overall composition in
the foreground,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.680
that are really quite weak.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.040
So, Anthea, in your opinion,
is it or is it not by Gauguin?

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.320
I don't think it's a work by
Gauguin, no.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.840
I'm very sorry.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.720
Well, we've always known it's an
outside chance.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.320
Yes, yes.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.040
I think, to be honest, that it's
from the circle of Gauguin.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.640
Of the period. Or, indeed,
maybe even a little bit later.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.120
Although the full truth about
James's picture may never be known,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.920
it's possible it was painted by one
of Gauguin's contemporaries,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.200
perhaps as a copy of an original
work,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.120
with the bogus inscription added
later.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.480
We've been very, very realistic
about this all the way through.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.760
But something we felt compelled to
pursue,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.120
because you can't have something
like that ticking away,

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.880
thinking, "Why aren't we doing
anything about this?" Of course.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.320
You just have to know.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.240
We thought it could be
something tremendously important.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.680
If it had been by Gauguin -

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.320
I don't know if I can bear to do
this to you, James -

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.240
if it had been by Gauguin, Philip,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.960
tell us what it might have been
worth.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.520
I mean, these are such cruel,
unthinkable thoughts, aren't they?

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.840
If this could be proved to be
by Gauguin,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.560
we're talking hundreds of thousands,
possibly even low millions.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.200
What's its value now, and what
should I worry about?

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.280
Well, I mean... Look, the value is
as a decorative picture.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.640
But it's a decorative picture with
a bit of history.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.080
Don't be too disappointed.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.320
It's worth high hundreds,
on a good day, low thousands.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.520
Right, OK. Yeah, it's a massive
difference, isn't it?

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.640
Enjoy it. Exactly.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.000
Enjoy it as a part of your
family story,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.840
coming from your mother and from
Dick Rykens,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.360
who was a family friend.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.240
And we've had a heck of a ride
with it.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.320
No, good. Well, thank you very much
indeed.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.400
I've thoroughly enjoyed the whole
process.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.680
Good for you.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.560
Well, this is an unhappy first for
Fake Or Fortune?,

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.720
to have fallen before we get to
the final hurdle,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.240
before we submit the painting to
the recognised world authority,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.920
in this case the Wildenstein
Institute.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.760
But it's pretty clear from all the
work we've done on James's painting

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.560
and from what Anthea had to say,

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.840
that there is almost no chance,
I think,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.120
that they would accept it as
a genuine work.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.720
I genuinely feel very sad for James.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.800
But in the end you've got to fight
the battles that you can win,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.040
and I have been there many times
myself.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.680
And even though initially a lot of
the evidence seemed to stack up,

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.120
gradually, as we looked at it more,
it fell apart.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.600
With James's painting out of
the running,

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.600
we are determined to redouble our
efforts

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.760
to prove that Steffi's sketch is
a genuine work by Paul Gauguin.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.840
I'm taking up the quest to find
further information

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.080
about the provenance.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.200
We know from labels on the back that
it was exhibited in Switzerland in

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.280
1928, when it was listed as being
in the ownership of F Durrio,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.320
said to be a close friend of
Paul Gauguin.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.080
Francisco Durrio, better known
as Paco,

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.200
grew up in Bilbao in northern Spain
and became a respected artist

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.640
with a flair for ceramics and
jewellery.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.360
I've come to the city's Museum of
Fine Arts, which holds an impressive

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.720
collection of his work,

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.800
and I've arranged to meet Dr Javier
Gonzalez De Durana

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.400
to find out more about Durrio's
relationship with Paul Gauguin.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.480
Xavier, how well did Durrio know
Gauguin? Were they close?

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:12.480
They shared a studio room in Paris
for many months before Gauguin

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.400
went to Tahiti for the second trip.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.720
And was Durrio a great admirer of
Gauguin?

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.800
Yes. Gauguin was God to him.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:28.320
Yeah. That's why...as a proof of
the friendship between them,

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.600
that is why Gauguin give as a gift

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.400
an incredible amount of pieces that
Durrio has.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.720
How many artworks did Gauguin give
to Durrio at that time?

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.560
I think 120.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:49.440
Durrio never bought a single work
by Gauguin, he had no money.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.040
In 1893,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.680
Gauguin returned to France after his
first visit to Tahiti and resumed

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.120
work in his Paris studio.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.520
By the summer of 1895, though,
he was preparing to return

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.560
to his tropical paradise and
Javier's research

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.560
reveals that it was at this point
that he presented Durrio with

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.320
the sketchbooks from his first trip,

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.360
perhaps considering them of little
value.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.360
In the years after Gauguin's death,
though,

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.840
museums and collectors began to
realise their true worth.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.880
On the back of our sketch here,

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.280
there is a label that has the name
"F Durrio, Paris. 1928."

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.520
And it appears that it was at
an exhibition in Basel.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.720
In Basel, OK. And I just wondered if
you could shed any light on that.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.240
Yes, we have a catalogue of that
temporary exhibition in Basel.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.560
And if we check the list of
pieces...

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.520
"Kauernde Frau", which means
Crouching Woman.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.760
This is the drawing you have in
your hand.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.720
As provenance trails go,
this one is compelling.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.440
Gauguin gave the sketchbooks to
Paco Durrio,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.200
who in turn lent them to a museum
in Switzerland.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.360
But why did Durrio end up parting
with such a precious gift?

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.520
The answer may lie in the fact that
Durrio was given 100,000 francs by

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.080
the museum as a security deposit
for his sketches,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.200
to be returned when the exhibition
was over.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.800
The problem was, Durrio spent
the money,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.640
so the museum kept the sketches.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.800
Durrio was so poor,
he had so many basic needs,

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.320
that he spent all the money!

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.960
Oh, so Durrio never sold any of
Gauguin's works

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.040
but because he had spent this
guarantee from the art exhibition

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.760
in Basel, of 100,000 francs,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.320
he lost them, effectively.
He lost the lot.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.440
Those pieces,
exactly the same ones,

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.880
were sold in Leicester Galleries to
pay part of the money

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.720
lent, given to Durrio.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.920
How fascinating!

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.720
So that is a direct link between
that label and this label.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.360
It's a close link.
Yeah, this happens because of this.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.560
Because of this.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.680
Although the provenance for Steffi's
sketch seems very promising,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.280
there is still a crucial question
to answer.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.720
How could the Crouching Woman appear
in a full page of sketches in a book

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.640
about Gauguin, published in 1958,

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.600
yet seem to have been cut out of
the same page earlier in the 1940s,

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.200
when Dr Alfred Scharf bought it?

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.320
Anthea Callan thinks she's cracked
this riddle,

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.200
so we are
joining forces back at the gallery.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.720
I found something really
interesting.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.920
You remember in relation to what the
auction house said about our sketch?

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.280
Yes, indeed. They thought it was a
fake or a copy.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.160
But what I found is,
in an archive in Paris,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.440
the original glass plate photograph,
which appeared in the book,

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.280
and here it is.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.800
It's from the archive of
Eugene Droullet in Paris,

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.600
one of the great art
photographers.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:17.120
He died in 1916, so it must date
from before 1916.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.880
This is the crucial piece of
evidence we need.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.160
The photo of the full page from
Gauguin's sketch book that features

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.720
Crouching Woman wasn't taken in 1958

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.080
as the auction house seemed to
believe,

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.360
it was taken at least
42 years earlier,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.440
meaning it could have been cut down
to a much smaller size long before

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.080
Steffi's grandfather bought it in
the 1940s.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.640
That's transformative!
That's what we were looking for.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.360
That puts Steffi's grandfather off
the hook.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.840
And that means that the picture
could have been cut down anywhere,

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.840
then, between 1916, when this
photographer died, and 1948,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.880
when Steffi's grandfather bought it.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.200
I mean, that completely changes
everything.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.480
So, to nail this,

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.520
we now need to be absolutely sure

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.920
that this drawing is one and
the same as

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.840
that that appears in the book

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.640
and I think I have a way of doing
that.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.280
I want to find out whether Steffi's
sketch precisely matches

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.080
the photo of the original sketchbook
page in the 1958 book,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.040
so Fiona and I have arranged to
visit a studio in Mayfair that

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.200
specialises in art photography.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.040
Antony Makinson has taken a photo

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.280
of Steffi's sketch and used imaging
software

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.240
in an attempt to match it exactly
with the original photograph.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.800
So this is Steffi's drawing.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.720
Anthony, have you managed to match
it up to the photograph in the book?

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.080
Yeah, the image in the book is
really, really clear

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.200
and very good quality.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.160
It's the moment of truth.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.760
Will the image of Steffi's sketch
exactly match

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.680
the photo taken before 1916?

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.000
Look at that!

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.440
It's like it's coming into focus.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.160
It matches perfectly.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.800
It does! And look, the lines here

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.240
like this marvellous pair of
buttocks here, comes right in.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.600
So a perfect alignment.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.680
This arm...

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.520
Subtle parts of it are all there...

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.400
..like this little nick coming off
this line here.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.440
That's exactly the same,
look at that!

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.720
I mean, no-one would even think of
copying that.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.800
It's so tiny.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.480
What about this here, this tear?

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.200
The tear is coming down from here,
onto the paper.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.600
Not as visible in the book image,
but it does line up exactly.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.600
That's fantastic! I mean, that's an
absolute dead ringer, isn't it?

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.880
I mean, this is a fingerprint.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.560
I mean, it looks as though it's just
dropped out of the middle

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.320
of that drawing. There's no way
these are not one and the same.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.560
And given we know that this is
a drawing, frankly,

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.840
it's impossible to conceive of
even the most sophisticated forger

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.080
or artist replicating this with
such exactitude.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.120
We've almost removed any doubts
about Steffi's sketch,

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.360
but there's one final reservation we
need to lay to rest.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.560
The fact that it appears to have
been cut down in size has always

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.600
raised suspicion and I'm keen to
find out

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.800
if any other genuine Gauguin works
have been tampered with in this way.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.160
Steffi and I have come to Paris to
visit the Musee Du Quai Branly,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.920
the city's museum of indigenous art,

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.520
which also houses a small collection
of works by Gauguin,

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.600
including pages from his
Tahiti sketchbooks.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.800
So, Steph, I wanted you to
particularly see these two drawings.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.200
They are by Gauguin,
they are 100% authentic.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.760
Oh, wow.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.200
But all of these share something in
common.

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.720
They are sketches done, I think,
from life.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:04.480
These are little bits of information
that he could then use later on

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.520
to work into his pictures.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.520
But I want you to have a look
at this one in particular.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.080
Notice how the figure is placed
on the page.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.000
Do you see how a bit of her elbow is
missing?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.880
Yeah, it looks like it's being
trimmed down that side, doesn't it?

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.720
And this one here is also just
unusually tight,

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.960
unusually small for a sketchbook.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.840
Yeah, it's almost too much in
the corner.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.520
The forensic art historical side of
this, I think,

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:36.880
is extraordinarily important because
we are finding examples of other

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.000
drawings that are unquestionably by
Gauguin that have been trimmed,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.640
that have been cut,

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:50.160
but the really important aspect of
these drawings in relation to yours

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.760
is who owned them,

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.360
the only person apart from Gauguin,
the artist, who owned them,

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.360
from whom this museum in 1936
acquired them.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.680
In this state.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.720
In this state. These two drawings
were owned by the same person...

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.400
..who owned yours. Right, OK.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.880
It's Paco Durrio.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.200
That's brilliant. That's exciting.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.960
Great. I love it.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.160
The story of Steffi's sketch appears
to be complete.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.960
On his first visit to Tahiti,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.200
Paul Gauguin picked up his
sketchbook and drew a likeness of

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.760
one of the native girls that had
captured his imagination.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.120
He gave the sketchbook to
his friend, Paco Durrio,

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.320
who lent it to a museum, only to
forfeit it to pay off a debt.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.320
It was exhibited and offered for
sale in London,

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.640
where it was purchased by
Lord Ivor Churchill.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.600
And finally, in the late 1940s, it
was bought by Dr Alfred Scharf,

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.920
Steffi's grandfather.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.320
It should be an open and shut case.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.400
Behind these metal doors, Steffi,
is the Wildenstein Institute,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.720
a bastion of the French art world.

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.440
They have the power to say
yes or no on all Gauguins.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.400
I'm convinced your drawing is right

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.720
but I don't know what they're going
to say.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.040
We're only going to get
one chance at this.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.680
If they say no, I'm afraid this
drawing is in serious trouble.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.360
I trust what you're saying

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.480
and I think we've got the best
chance we've ever had, so I'm...

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.800
I want to take the risk.
I want to know.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.360
As the committee who rule on Gauguin
works are not due to meet until

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.000
the autumn, they've agreed,
especially for us,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.760
to review a dossier of evidence

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.920
about Steffi's sketch and give
their expert opinion.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.240
Back in London, we're all gathering
to hear their verdict.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.400
It's really worth considering
what's at stake here.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.680
Steffi inherits a drawing by one of
the great late 19th,

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.520
early 20th-century artists,

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.560
or so she thinks,

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.960
only then to be told that it's
a fake, thus pretty well worthless.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.040
Now, at that point, she could've
done anything -

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.160
sold it for nothing,
given it away -

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.840
a bit like one of those lottery
tickets that might be

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.240
a winner, but you're told it's the
wrong numbers

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.280
so you just discard it.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.000
It was so disappointing about
James's painting

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
and everything now rests on
Steffi's sketch.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.880
If it is genuine, it's likely to be
one of the very first sketches that

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.280
Gauguin did for his masterpiece
When Will You Marry?,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.560
one of the most expensive paintings
ever sold.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.800
But I've been disappointed before.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.280
So here we are, Steffi.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.080
This is the day. Are you feeling
a little bit nervous?

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.800
I am, yes, to be honest.
I'm not surprised.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.720
Well, Steffi, if this can be proved
to be a genuine work by Gauguin,

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:03.520
for such an important picture,
we could be talking 200,000,

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.360
possibly in excess of that.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.040
There is clearly an awful lot
riding on this.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.400
The Wildenstein Institute made a
special case for you

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.440
and have sent us a letter,
which you've got.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.120
A letter which I hold in my hand.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.000
Right, go on. Are you ready?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.560
Yeah.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.200
Well, it starts, "The next committee
is still foreseen in the fall,

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.040
"the precise date is still
unknown" -

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.080
so that's the official committee
meeting.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.920
"Of course, by then,

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.960
"the Gauguin committee will gladly
make a statement as to the inclusion

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.160
"of this drawing in the catalogue."

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.080
Really? That's it.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.560
That's it. That is it.
Oh, thank you!

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.120
Wow.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.960
And they go on to say, "On the basis
of this documentation, and of its

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.920
"manner, we have never dreamt of
putting it in doubt for a second."

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.000
Oh, lovely. What a fabulous outcome.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.040
It is, it's thrilling.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.880
It was also about my grandfather.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.000
I really respected who he was and
his judgment,

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.920
and that was so called into
question,

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.560
and it's so lovely to know that he
was right all along.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.200
This totally vindicates his eye.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.800
Wow. That's really something,
isn't it?

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.600
So now that we know that this is
a study

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.240
for one of his most famous
pictures... Oh, yeah!

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.440
..and something that a lot of people
across the world will be very

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.720
interested to see and possibly own,

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.120
what are your plans for it?

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.760
I think I will sell it if I can

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.360
and, you know, I'll do some good
with it.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.240
I'm thrilled for Steffi

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.320
and she's such a lovely person.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.920
And to think that, just a few years
ago, that was turned down.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.640
And it's a reminder, isn't it,

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.680
of the challenges and the risks
within the art world

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.760
and how sometimes so easily the real
thing can get written off?

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.760
If you think you have an
undiscovered painting

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.280
or other precious object,

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:19.160
