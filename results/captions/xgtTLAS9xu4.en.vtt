00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.230
Daniel 9 verse 26 says: And after 62 weeks
shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.580
And the PEOPLE OF THE PRINCE THAT SHALL COME
shall destroy the CITY and the SANCTUARY,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.230
And the END THEREOF shall be with a FLOOD,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.930
And unto the END OF THE WAR desolations are
determined.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.779
In this video I will PROVE to you that THE
PRINCE THAT SHALL COME in Daniel 9

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.939
is either Donald Trump or Mike Pence.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.159
First we absolutely MUST understand the FULL
context of Daniel chapter 9.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.110
It takes place in the first year of Darius,
the son of Ahaseurus,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.619
Who ruled the First Persian Empire from 522
to 486 BC.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:52.980
So Daniel 9 is taking place in Jerusalem around
522 BC,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.930
Which Daniel 2 and 7 tell us is the start
of the SECOND phase of the BEAST.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.400
So about 522 BC Daniel says in verse 2: I, Daniel understood by books the NUMBER OF THE YEARS,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
Whereof the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah
the Prophet,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.930
That he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations
of Jerusalem.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.420
So he is saying right here that 70 years had
passed since the prophecy of Jeremiah.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.060
The 70 year prophecy he is referring to is
explained in the book of Jeremiah

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.560
Chapters 25 and 29.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.370
So before we can understand what Daniel is
talking about in chapter 9

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.600
We have to understand the prophecy of 70 years
in Jeremiah because that is what he is referring to.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.960
Jeremiah 25 verse 1 says: The word that came
to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.840
In the FOURTH YEAR of JEHOIAKIM the son of
JOSIAH, King of Judah.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.300
That was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar,
King of Babylon.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.430
So its telling us that Jeremiah received this
information in the FOURTH year of King Jehoiakim.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.460
Jehoiakim became King in 608 BC.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.690
So his fourth year would have been 605 BC.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.190
This is literally the beginning of the FIRST
HEAD of the BEAST, according to Bible Prophecy:

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.410
The LION of Babylon.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.260
Daniel 1 tells us that it was in the THIRD
year of Jehoiakim

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.780
that Nebuchadnezzar stole items from the Jerusalem
Temple.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.950
So the 1290 years in Daniel 12 started in
the third year of Jehoiakim in 606 BC;

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.920
and that ended in 685 CE when the Dome of
the Rock was set up.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.280
We will go into that later.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.260
But Jeremiah is talking about a prophecy that
he was given in 605 BC:

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.480
Four years after Jehoiakim became King.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.190
That was one year after Nebuchadnezzar invaded
Jerusalem,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.910
and it was the same year that Nebuchadnezzar
officially became the King of ancient Babylon.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.710
It says Jeremiah spoke this prophecy to all
the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:07.810
Josiah became King of Judah in 641 BC, so
his 13th year would have been around 628 BC.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.030
And Jeremiah is saying FROM Josiah's 13th
year until now has been 23 years.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.250
That is confirmation again, that Jeremiah
received this prophecy in 605 BC;

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.680
the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, King of
Babylon.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.800
He says the Lord has sent you all these prophets
and you have not hearkened;

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.270
So he was telling the people of Jerusalem
that they were not listening to the prophecies.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.580
Then in verse 8 he says: Therefore thus says
the Lord of Hosts,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.180
because you have not heard my words I will
send all the families of the King of the North

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.959
and Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.709
and bring them against THIS land AND against
all these nations round about

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.959
and will utterly destroy them.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.489
And in verse 11 the prophecy starts.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.390
It says: These nations shall serve the King
of Babylon 70 years

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.750
And it shall come to pass when 70 years are
accomplished

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.150
that I will punish the King of Babylon and
that nation and the land of the Chaldeans.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.150
So this is very clear.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.030
It says THESE nations; in other words the
nations around Jerusalem.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.800
Verses 1 and 2 are clear that Jeremiah is speaking to the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.319
and in verse 9; the nations round about Jerusalem.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.339
So he is saying that Jerusalem and the nations
around Jerusalem

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.349
will serve the King of Babylon for 70 years

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.749
and when those 70 years are accomplished he
will punish the King of Babylon and that nation

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.449
and the land of the Chaldeans.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.509
But notice he does NOT say that the 70 years
will start in 605 BC!

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.879
This is VERY important!

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.629
He was GIVEN the prophecy in 605 BC

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.090
BUT the prophecy does NOT say that the 70
years will START in 605 BC!

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.270
And we know this prophecy does NOT refer to
the time period beginning in 605 BC

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.599
for several reasons:

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.949
First of all, because more than 70 years later,
in the first year of Darius: 522 BC

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.759
Daniel prayed to the Lord asking about the
70 years of Jeremiah.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.569
So 83 years later Daniel prayed to the Lord
in sackcloth asking forgiveness

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.020
making his confession and saying: we have
sinned.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.400
We didn't listen to the prophets.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.780
But unto us confusion of faces at this day.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.919
In other words, he is saying they are confused
because 70 years have passed,

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.869
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Israel
are FAR OFF

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:44.240
through all the countries which thou hast
driven them.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.189
So they had NOT returned to Jerusalem,

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:53.419
and part of the prophecy in Jeremiah was that
they would RETURN after 70 years.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.490
So he prayed and begged forgiveness because
he thought the Lord has cursed them.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.029
And the reason he thought that was because
the end of the 70 years of Jeremiah

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.119
came and went and the King of Babylon was
NOT punished

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.809
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem had NOT returned.

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:16.500
So he was begging and begging forgiveness
and Gabriel came to him and said to him in verse 22:

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.259
O Daniel I am now come forth to give thee
skill and understanding.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.439
And then he explained the prophecy of the
70 WEEKS starting in verse 24.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:31.550
So its obvious that Jeremiah's prophecy
concerning the punishment of the King of Babylon

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.340
had not been fulfilled in ancient Babylon.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.400
That is clear in Daniel 9.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.190
But when we look at Jeremiah 29, we can see
that there are actually TWO 70 year prophecies.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.100
In Jeremiah 29 verses 10-12 it says: After
70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:55.699
Then shall you CALL UPON ME and PRAY UNTO
ME and I will ANSWER YOU.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:04.100
So the first 70 years of capitivity in Babylon will end, it says, when someone PRAYS and is ANSWERED.

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:09.939
That was Daniel, who prayed in the first year
of Darius, in 522 BC.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:15.499
Jeremiah chapter 29 does not say exactly what
year Jeremiah received that particular prophecy,

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:21.869
but it does say that is was some time after
King Jeconiah was taken captive to Babylon.

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:26.339
King Jeconiah ruled in Judah from 598 to 597
BC.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.289
So sometime after that, Jeremiah received
the prophecy of 70 years in chapter 29

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:39.179
in which he was told that at the end of 70
years they would PRAY and be ANSWERED.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:45.189
The fulfillment of that prophecy in Chapter
29 DID occur 70 years later.

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:51.389
Daniel PRAYED about the prophecy of 70 years
in the first year of Darius in 522 BC,

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:56.879
which was about 75 years after King Jeconiah
was taken captive to Babylon.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.559
And again, Jeremiah says the prophecy was
given to him

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:02.929
SOMETIME AFTER Jeconiah was taken captive.

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:08.349
So, again the Jeremiah 29 prophecy was fulfilled
in Daniels time.

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:13.120
But the 70 year prophecy described in chapter
25 is something different.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.849
Its talking about END TIME Babylon.

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:19.819
We know this because Jeremiah 25 verse 26
says

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:24.789
ALL the Kingdoms of the WORLD will drink the
fury.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:32.779
Verse 29 says: I will call for a sword upon
ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:37.870
And verse 33 says the SLAIN shall be AT THAT
DAY

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.370
FROM ONE END OF THE EARTH TO THE OTHER END
OF THE EARTH.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.430
So, yes, Jeremiah spoke this prophecy in Jerusalem

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.880
and he was directly speaking to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem and the nations around it.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:59.920
But the prophecy itself, in Jeremiah 25, refers
to an event that occurs over the WHOLE EARTH.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.230
This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.200
Because so many Christians are looking at
what is occurring in Jerusalem

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.770
thinking that is when these final events will
occur.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.270
But the prophecy, not only in Jeremiah, but
all throughout the texts

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:18.510
clearly says the final event will occur over
the WHOLE EARTH.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.400
Jesus said ISRAEL covers the WHOLE EARTH.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.760
Revelation 11 says the Two Witnesses will
walk the Great City and lie unburied at the

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.830
end of 1260 days.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:33.210
Revelation 17 tells us the Great City is Babylon
the Great which rules over the WHOLE EARTH.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:39.000
It tells us Babylon the Great sits on the
Beast who Daniel tells us will devour the WHOLE EARTH

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.390
in the end time.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.250
This is very, very important.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.940
Because, although these prophecies may have
originated in Jerusalem,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:53.580
they are very clear that the final events
occur throughout the whole earth.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.870
So when we compare the prophecy of 70 years
in Jeremiah

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.160
with the prophecy in the book of Revelation,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.910
it becomes very clear that the prophecy of
70 years in Jeremiah

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.730
refers to END TIME Babylon the GREAT

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.280
NOT ancient Babylon.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.810
Jeremiah 25:10 says at the end of the 70 years
the BRIDE and BRIDEGROOM will be taken away.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:24.430
Revelation 18:23 says the BRIDE and BRIDEGROOM
will be gone when Babylon the Great FALLS.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.240
Jeremiah 25:10 says this will occur at the
sound of the MILLSTONE.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.851
Revelation 18:21 says that Babylon the GREAT
will be destroyed by a STONE from heaven

00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:35.860
that is like a GREAT MILLSTONE.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.260
That STONE will hit the SEA of Babylon, it
says,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.000
and Jeremiah 51:42 confirms that Babylon will
be COVERED BY THE WAVES

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.670
when this event occurs.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:53.280
Jeremiah 25:15 says they will Drink the WINE
CUP of FURY at this event.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:01.510
Revelation 14:10, 16:19, and 18:3 confirm
that it is END TIME Babylon

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.450
that will DRINK the WINE CUP of WRATH.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:12.530
Jeremiah 25:30 and 50:16 say they will TREAD
THE GRAPES at the end of the 70 years

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.000
And that will occur AT THE HARVEST.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.600
Revelation 14:15 and 18 confirm that the HARVEST
of GRAPES will occur

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.810
when Babylon the GREAT falls; END TIME Babylon.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:30.000
So Jeremiahs prophecy directly correlates
with the prophecy in Revelation

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.010
and also the timeline Jesus gave us in Matthew
24.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.380
We have talked about this before.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:40.260
The 70 years end at the same time the 1260
years end.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.160
There are many things that have to end at
this time.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.920
The return of the chosen to their homeland
is also going to occur

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.500
after the accomplishment of the 70 years.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.470
But remember, Deuteronomy 29 and 30 make it
clear that the inhabitants of Israel

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.850
that are SCATTERED throughout the earth

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:04.690
will NOT return to their homeland until AFTER
the Fire and BRIMSTONE!

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.690
AFTER the WRATH!

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:10.320
In fact, in Deuteronomy 30 verses 3 and 4
say that God will RETURN

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.890
when they return to their homeland!

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:17.630
And not only that, it says some of them will
return to their homeland FROM HEAVEN!!!

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:23.660
So remember, part of the prophecy in Jeremiah
was that they will RETURN after the 70 years.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.840
That is in Jeremiah 29 verse 14.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.320
and remember, Daniel clearly said that the
inhabitants of Jerusalem had NOT returned

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.980
at the end of 70 years from Jeremiahs prophecy.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.000
In Daniel 9 verse 7 he said they were FAR OFF through all the countries where they had been driven.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.910
So again, the prophecies are clear that the
end of Jeremiahs 70 years

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:53.730
occur in the END TIME, which is the END of
Daniels timeline of the Beasts

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.800
and the end of Jesus timeline as well as all
the others.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.630
The prophecy that Jeremiah was given in chapter
25

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.260
does NOT specify when those 70 years START,

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:13.250
but it DOES specify that during the 70 years,
the nations around Jerusalem will SERVE BABYLON.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:19.170
And we know that refers to Babylon the GREAT,
which is in the END TIME.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:24.410
Revelation 17:3 clarifies that Babylon the
Great sits on the Beast

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.380
and Revelation 17:11 clarifies that the Beast
is the 8th King.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:37.490
So the 70 years of Jeremiah must start sometime
after the 8th King rises to power.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:43.370
The riddle in Revelation 17 verses 8-11 is
very clear about who the 8th King is.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.830
We have covered this before.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.290
There are seven Kings.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.290
Five have fallen, one is, and the other is
not yet come,

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.390
and when he comes he must continue a short
space.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.590
He is the 8th and is of the 7.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.080
The five kings that had fallen were:

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.450
Ancient Babylon, Persia, Greece, the Western
Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.550
The one that IS refers to the Holy Roman Empire.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:16.200
It is clear, in the riddle that the ONE THAT
IS refers to the Beast that was, is not, yet IS.

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:19.330
This is clarified in Revelation 13 verses
1-3.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.960
It says the Beast has 7 heads, and one of
the heads was wounded and then healed.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.800
That wound occurred when the 7th Head of the
Beast; the Holy Roman Empire was dismantled

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800
in 1870.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.580
But it was healed when Vatican City was created
in Italy.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:42.480
At that time, the popes became Kings, and
incidentally they are in their 8th King now.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.690
But again, the true 8th King, according to
the prophecy, is the United Nations.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.490
It has to match the riddle in Revelation 17
or it cannot be correct.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:58.800
This 8th King; the United Nations, also appears
to be the King of Fierce Countenance in Daniel 8.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:04.310
But again, Daniel 8 is clear that this King
of Fierce Countencance MUST arise

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:12.320
in the latter end of the FOURTH Kingdom out
of the ancient GREEK EMPIRE!

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.280
That was the Turkish Empire which did not
come to its full potential until 1299 CE

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.880
and came to its end in 1923.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.890
The League of Nations rose in 1920 at the
end of that FOURTH EMPIRE.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:32.900
So remember, each of these four regions of
the Goat corresponded to a MAJOR EMPIRE in history.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.320
So the League of Nations was absolutely the
fulfillment

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.750
of the rise of the King of Fierce Countenance
in Daniel 8.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.830
It says this King will destroy by PEACE.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:49.279
The League of Nations became the United Nations
in 1945 and that was the rise of the 8th King.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.830
So back to the prophecy of Jeremiah.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.990
Babylon cannot stand on its own.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:00.070
The Bible is clear that it SITS on the BEAST.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.779
And the BEAST is the 8th KING.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:09.510
So Babylon the Great cannot exist until the
8th King exists.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.980
That means that the nations around Jerusalem
cannot SERVE the KING OF BABYLON

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.040
until the 8th King arises,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.260
and that 8th King arose in 1945.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.470
Now notice this.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.240
Not only has 70 years been accomplished of
the 8th King as of NOW, 2016,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.820
but 1945 was the end of a very significant
1260 year period.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.790
In Daniel 12 we are told the Abomination will
be set up

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.339
1290 days (or years) after the sacrifice is
taken away.

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:45.250
Daniel 1 tells us the exact year that sacrifice
was taken away.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:51.700
It says in the THIRD YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM the
King of Babylon stole items from the Temple.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.140
That is when the seige occurred.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.840
That was 606 BC.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.640
Exactly 1290 years later, in 685 CE, the Dome
of the Rock was set up in Jerusalem.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.350
Both of these events were perpetrated by the
King of the North.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.919
The Dome of the Rock was set up by the POPE.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:11.949
This is explained in the Daniel 11 video.

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:17.100
Remember, all of this MUST match the timelines
EXACTLY.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:23.769
I cannot believe some of the things Christians
come up with that do NOT match the timeline.

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:29.049
Im sorry, but they truly do NOT know what
they are talking about.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:32.880
I do want them to understand and I am trying
to explain it now.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.529
And I have shown that the Temple is now in
the United States

00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:42.590
And either Donald Trump or Mike Pence is the
Prince that shall come.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.650
But again, we have to cover these other things
because

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:52.269
Jeremiahs 70 years DIRECTLY correlate to the
Daniel 9 prophecy

00:17:52.269 --> 00:17:54.990
and also the prophecy in Revelation.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.919
So back to this timeline here.

00:17:56.919 --> 00:18:03.210
Daniel 11 tells us EXACTLY when the Abomination
was set up and we covered this.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.909
It is probably the deepest and most extensive
study we did.

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:10.960
It took me a whole month to put that video
together

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.840
and it is NOTHING like what the church is
selling you.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.019
They are leading you astray.

00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:19.360
I have proven their doctrines false.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.899
Check out the playlist on that.

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:29.669
The Abomination of Desolation in Daniel 11:31
occurred in 685 CE.

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:35.320
It was set up by the POPE who was the King
of the North at that time.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:42.379
So the sacrifice was taken away by the King
of the North; Nebuchadnezzar, in 606 BC

00:18:42.379 --> 00:18:48.900
and the Abomination of Desolation was set
up by the King of the North; the POPE, in 685 CE.

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:55.230
The Dome of the Rock was built in the same
exact measurements of the church of Holy Sepulchre.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.279
It is NOT Muslim!

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:59.200
It is a ROMAN TEMPLE!!!

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.019
I showed how they finally moved their temple
(which by the way, is the Temple of SATURN),

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:13.440
to the United States BETWEEN the TWO SEAS;
the Atlantic and Pacific OCEANS!!!

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.330
That was the final fulfillment of Daniel 11:45.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:24.460
The Capital building, where our government
sits, is the ROMAN TEMPLE OF SATURN!!!

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:30.330
So please bear with me, the Dome of the Rock
set up in 685 CE

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.230
was an exact fulfillment of BOTH Daniel 11
and Daniel 12.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:44.000
And again, please remember that there was
NO YEAR ZERO, so yes, it was exactly 1290 years.

00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:47.510
But that was the SECOND WATCH on Jesus timeline!

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:53.360
Remember, he said in Luke 12 verses 37 and
38 that there will be THREE WATCHES.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.169
And there were exactly THREE things he told
us to watch for on his timeline

00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:00.960
in Matthew 24, Luke 21, and Mark 13.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.620
First, he said watch for armies surrounding
Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.679
That occurred in 70 CE.

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:16.019
Next, watch for the Abomination that Daniel
talked about, standing where it ought not.

00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:18.019
That occurred in 685 CE.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:20.019
Again, on the second watch.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:24.149
THEN, he said shall be the GREAT TRIBULATION.

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:30.320
In Matthew 24 verses 15-21 it says WHEN you
see the Abomination of Desolation

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.700
spoken of by Daniel (and that refers to Daniel 11 and 12)

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.460
THEN those in JUDEA will FLEE.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.029
That starts the Great Tribulation, which he
explains in verse 29

00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:45.940
is the Tribulation of the DAYS!!!

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.700
There are THREE SPECIFIC TIMES OF TROUBLE
IN THE BIBLE!!!

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.019
The Time, Times, and Half a Time in Daniel
7, 12, and Revelation 12,

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:58.019
The 1260 days in Revelation 11 and 12,

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:01.620
and the 42 months in Revelation 11 and 13.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:10.119
The ONLY time of trouble that is described
as DAYS is the 1260 DAYS!!!

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:17.409
So Jesus was saying that the Great Tribulation
is 1260 Days, and Days can also be YEARS!

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:23.549
So those in Judea FLED after the Abomination
of Desolation was set up where it ought not

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:25.529
(that's Mark 13)

00:21:25.529 --> 00:21:29.259
And that FLEEING started the 1260 years!

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:33.309
We are not given the exact year that they
fled,

00:21:33.309 --> 00:21:35.230
But I found this very interesting:

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.460
Adam Clark published a book in the 1800s.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:48.120
and he wrote that the 1260 years started between
754 and 756 CE and would end in 2016.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.669
Now, I don't know if he was right about
that

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:55.460
but it is interesting because it lines up
with so much of the fulfillments we have seen.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.029
And no I'm not 7th day Adventist, this is
NOT about religion

00:21:59.029 --> 00:22:04.570
I don't belong to any religion, so I hope
we can get past biases,

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.649
and instead of holding onto what the Beast
is telling us,

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:13.659
actually look at what the text says, and the
fulfillments of these prophecies.

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:21.489
If Adam Clark was right about the 1260 years
starting in 754, 755, or 756,

00:22:21.489 --> 00:22:24.489
then there were exactly 70 years

00:22:24.489 --> 00:22:30.360
between the setting up of the Abomination
in 685 and the SIGN of Revelation 12 in 686

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.070
to the start of the 1260 years in 755 and
756.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:42.000
That 1260 year period corresponds to the rise
of the 7th head of the Beast; the Holy Roman Empire.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.669
It started with the donation of land in Italy
to the Pope; the Donation of Pepin.

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:53.119
By the way, the restoration of the Holy Roman
Empire; the creation of Vatican City in 1929

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:58.900
also involved a donation of land in Italy
to the Pope; the Lateran Treaty.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.450
That was the healing of the 7th head of the
Beast

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.840
and they are now in their 8th King from that
restoration.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.580
Also, the official 8th King; the United Nations
is ALSO in THEIR EIGHTH KING!

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.059
The 8th Secretary General, and that will change
in December of 2016

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:19.249
when they elect their 9th King.

00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:25.549
So we are in an EXTREMELY IMPORTANT time right
now, please bear with me, there is more.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:31.669
There were also exactly 1260 years from 685
when the Abomination was set up

00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:38.799
to 1945; the end of World War 2 and the first
year of the 8th King; the United Nations,

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:45.750
and 2015 / 2016 represents the end of 70 years
from the rise of the United Nations.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.129
Revelation 12 confirms this timeline.

00:23:48.129 --> 00:23:53.279
Again, the Bible does not say EXACTLY when
those in Judea FLED

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:56.110
only that it was AFTER the Abomination was
set up

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.559
and AFTER the sign in heaven.

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:03.419
And again, the Abomination on the second watch
occurred in 685

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:05.950
and the SIGN occurred in 686.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:11.659
The War in the Sky, or War in Heaven, and
the Bible calls it, was World War 2;

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:14.440
The World War that was fought in the skies.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.679
That was right after the invention of airplanes.

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:25.159
That war in the sky ended in 1945 EXACTLY
1260 years from the setting up of the Abomination.

00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:30.440
That was BOTH the SALVATION of those who were
in Nazi concentration camps

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.119
and also the DESOLATION of the Nuclear Bomb

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:42.900
and the start of ELAHS Kingdom in Daniel 2:44,
we talked about that in the Revelation 12 video.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.090
That is when Revelation 12 tells us the Annointed
Ones become ACCUSERS.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.590
In 1945 after the HOLOCAUST.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.230
Its talking about the Jews who were persecuted
in Germany.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.309
And by the way, it is NOT coincidence that
Germany was

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:03.910
the exact location of the 7th Head of the
Beast; the Holy Roman Empire.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:09.570
So who was it, really, who persecuted the
Nazi Holocaust victims?

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.489
It was the BEAST!!!

00:25:11.489 --> 00:25:16.480
And by the way, it was not just the Jews who
died in the concentration camps.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.039
There were many people from different religions
and philosophies.

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:27.440
So please, let us NOT forget the atrocities
that happened to ALL of those people.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.559
Lets not segregate each other by religion
or creed anymore.

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:37.720
Remember, the Bible says that it will be a
MULTITUDE of ALL NATIONS

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.369
that will be rescued.

00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:44.080
Its not just one nation or one religion that
is being persecuted.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.010
Now, that is when the Bible says the Dragon
was cast to the Earth;

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:55.109
after the War in the Sky; after the end of
World War 2; after 1945.

00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:56.889
This is EXTREMEMLY IMPORTANT.

00:25:56.889 --> 00:26:00.119
Remember, the Dragon represents many different
things.

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:06.120
Revelation 12 says the Dragon only has a SHORT
TIME after it is cast to earth.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:13.239
Rememember, Revelation 17 said the 8th King
will only rule for a SHORT SPACE.

00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:19.800
The 8th King is the United Nations and the
United Nations came to power in the fall of 1945.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.850
This is important because

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:27.190
the United Nations was the power behind the
creation of Israel three years later.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:32.740
In November of 1947 they voted to partition
Palestine so the Jews from Nazi Germany

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.950
could move back to Jerusalem and the surrounding
areas.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:43.090
But PLEASE you need to understand that Deuteronomy
30 tells us that was NOT GOD

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.340
who returned them to their homeland.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.529
It was the BEAST.

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:51.870
There are many, many Jews around the World
who know the truth about Israel.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:58.509
That country IS the Little Horn and it was
created by the 8th King; the United Nations.

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:02.740
The Eyes and the Mouth of the Little Horn
are explained in Prophecy.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:08.369
Zechariah 4 tells us the EYES are the EYES
of YHWH throughout the WHOLE EARTH.

00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:13.299
Hosea 13 and Revelation 13 are clear that
YHWH is the BEAST.

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:16.429
Which means that YHWH is the 8th King.

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:23.000
The United Nations IS the 8th and of the 7
kings.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.820
The 7th Head was the Holy Roman Empire.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.490
The 7 Heads of the Beast CREATED YHWH.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:35.720
In fact, Deuteronomy 32 tells us they created
the name YHWH at the MOUTH

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.429
which Revelation 13 tells us represents BABYLON.

00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:43.570
So the MOUTH of the Little Horn is BABYLON.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:49.850
Look at number 9 here; the Little Horn MUST
come out of the Four Horns of the Goat.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.010
That is in Daniel 8 verses 8 and 9.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:56.649
Well the King of Fierce Countenance comes
out of the four horns of the Goat too.

00:27:56.649 --> 00:27:58.739
That is in verses 21-25.

00:27:58.739 --> 00:28:03.399
So many people assumed that the Little Horn
must be the King of Fierce Countence.

00:28:03.399 --> 00:28:07.909
It was a fair assumption, however, it does
not actually say that,

00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:12.450
and the way the prophecy played out did NOT
occur that way exactly.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.960
Instead, the King of Fierce Countenance; the
United Nations

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.659
CREATED the Little Horn in 1947;

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:26.690
The country of Israel, which Lamentations
2 verse 3 tells us is the HORN.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.220
It even LOOKS like the Horn on a Beast on
the map!

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.049
Revelation 2 and 3 tells us that SOME of those
who CLAIM to be Jews are NOT really JEWS!

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.730
There are IMPOSTERS in your midst!

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.870
If you are Jewish, know that.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:47.700
It does not say EVERYONE who is Jewish, but
at least SOME of the people claiming to be Jews

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.059
are NOT really Jews!

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:54.600
And some of those imposters most definitely
are in the country of Israel.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:01.200
This Little Horn, it says, will rise out of
the fourth horn, and subdue THREE KINGS.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.620
That is both Daniel 8 verses 8 and 9 AND Daniel
7 verses 8 and 20.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:12.429
It says the Little Horn comes out of the 10
Horns of the Fourth Beast.

00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:16.230
The Fourth Beast was the Roman Empire.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:22.259
We are under the Roman Empire now, that is
what the riddle in Revelation 17 tells us:

00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:25.749
That the 8th King is OF THE SEVEN KINGS.

00:29:25.749 --> 00:29:30.179
Revelation 13 tells us the wounded head of
the Beast will be HEALED.

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:34.129
That is the Beast that WAS, IS NOT, YET IS.

00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:39.610
So the fourth Beast in Daniel 7:7 is the Roman
Empire that we are still under.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:44.909
And the Ten Horns of that Beast represent
Ten Kings or Kingdoms.

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:50.350
There are Ten Kingdoms that the UN has appointed
throughout the world

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:55.139
but also notice that there are EXACTLY TEN
KINGDOMS

00:29:55.139 --> 00:29:58.690
from the START of ancient Babylon until the
present:

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:04.679
Those TEN KINGS are ancient Babylon, Persia,
then the four horns of the Goat:

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:09.899
Assyria (otherwise known as the Seleucid Empire),
Greece (otherwise known as Macedonia),

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:16.629
Egypt (otherwise known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty),
and Turkey (known at that time as Anatolia).

00:30:16.629 --> 00:30:22.189
That is six Kingdoms, followed by the Western
Roman Empire (number 7),

00:30:22.189 --> 00:30:27.210
then the Eastern Roman Empire (number 8),
the Holy Roman Empire (number 9),

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.039
and the United Nations (number 10)!!!

00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:33.340
Remember, Daniel established that Horns are
Kings

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.149
and Kings also represent Kingdoms.

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:42.940
So the Little Horn is not only a Little King;
it is a LITTLE Kingdom or LITTLE COUNTRY.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:48.139
Daniel 8 says the Little Horn comes out of
the Four Kingdoms that Greece was broken into

00:30:48.139 --> 00:30:50.570
at the end of Alexanders empire.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:54.779
But at the Latter END of those four empires

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:58.129
when the transgressors are COME TO THE FULL!

00:30:58.129 --> 00:31:03.619
Again, that was the rise of the 8th King at
the end of the Turkish Empire in 1920;

00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:08.009
the League of Nations which became the United
Nations in 1945.

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:12.239
The King of Fierce Countenance that destroys
by PEACE.

00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:15.479
Then the 8th King created the Little Horn;

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:17.549
the LITTLE COUNTRY of ISRAEL.

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:23.800
So the Little Horn came out of the 8th King,
which rose at the end of the fourth horn of the Goat.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:31.889
and is ALSO the TENTH King considering ALL
the Kingdoms since Babylon!

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:32.889
FULFILLED!!!!

00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:39.710
Daniel 7 verses 7 and 8 tell us the Little
Horn will rise out of the TEN HORNS

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.979
and it will SUBDUE THREE KINGS.

00:31:42.979 --> 00:31:48.419
the THREE KINGS that were subdued were England,
France, and Russia.

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:50.070
At the end of the Turkish Empire,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.580
the nations around Jerusalem were separated
into regions

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.830
that were given to France, Russia, and England.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.200
And the area specifically near Jerusalem was
appointed as INTERNATIONAL TERRITORY.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.110
In fact, it was the League of Nations that
was behind this.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.349
They took over that region and then created
the country of Israel there

00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:11.080
after they became the United Nations.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.919
In other words, the 8th King; the BEAST created
the LITTLE HORN

00:32:14.919 --> 00:32:20.820
which in reality, belongs to the UN, and they
SUBDUED the THREE OTHER KINGS in that region;

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.250
England, France, and Russia!!!

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:31.129
Again, in Daniel 7:8, the EYES of the Little Horn are the CHURCHES of YHWH (Revelation 1, Zechariah 4),

00:32:31.129 --> 00:32:38.800
and the MOUTH is Babylon, as explained in
Deuteronomy 32, Revelation 13, and Daniel 2 and 7.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:46.950
In other words, Israel has the EYES or the
CHURCHES OF YHWH throughout the WHOLE EARTH

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:54.369
which Revelation explains IS BABYLON the GREAT,
which is the MOUTH of the Little Horn!!!

00:32:54.369 --> 00:33:00.000
The Saints, it says, will be given into the hand of the Little Horn for a Time, Times and Half a time.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.019
That is equal to 3.5 years or 42 months.

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:05.559
It is the FINAL TIME OF TROUBLE.

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:14.300
It is the final 3.5 years of extreme tribulation that occur AFTER the MILLSTONE hits the Sea of Babylon.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.239
Babylon the Great sits on the BEAST (Revelation
17)

00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:23.200
and the BEAST devours the WHOLE EARTH (Daniel
7:23)!

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.159
That means END TIME BABYLON sits on the WHOLE
EARTH!!!

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:35.080
It also sits on PEOPLE of all languages (Revelation
17:15)

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.879
That scripture also clarifies that the WATERS
represent PEOPLE.

00:33:40.879 --> 00:33:47.129
This is also very important because in Revelation
11 we are told the WATERS will turn to BLOOD.

00:33:47.129 --> 00:33:53.809
The Waters to Blood represents the people
that were murdered during the Holy Roman Empire.

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:58.490
The Rain is the Rain of Fire and Brimstone
that does not occur during the Testimony

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.639
but immediately AFTER the testimony.

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:04.159
And we have not exited that Tribulation.

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:07.960
The people who think that does not happen
anymore are worshipping the Beast.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.440
I am sorry to say that, but it is the truth.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.940
People are still being murdered and tortured
for their beliefs today.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:21.570
But they are the ones who are NOT worshipping
the Beast.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.659
The Two Witnesses are the Christians and Jews.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.300
They are the Two Candlesticks (Revelation
11:4)

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:33.830
that Zechariah 4 and Revelation 1 tell us
walk the WHOLE EARTH.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.770
They are TWO Candlesticks out of SEVEN Candlesticks.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:42.740
The Christians and Jews make up roughly 2
Billion of the World's population.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:48.560
That is TWO Billion out of a total of roughly
SEVEN Billion people!!!

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.040
They are TWO out of SEVEN!

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.830
That is what the prophecy says!

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.190
Jesus said they are TWO FALSE WITNESSES.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:00.070
This is a deep study, it goes into the deception
of Paul.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.030
We wont cover it here.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.260
It says they ACT as prophets.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.940
Its important to understand, because when
it says

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.220
the Two Witnesses will lie as dung in the
Great City

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:17.300
it is talking about Babylon the Great, which
sits on the Beast, which devours the WHOLE EARTH.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:25.000
Remember, Jeremiah said the SLAIN will lie
as dung on the ground over the WHOLE EARTH

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.140
when Babylon is destroyed at the end of the
70 years!

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.860
You may be saying no no no right now.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:36.790
But please, I am begging you to hear this
and not turn away.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.370
Its not saying ALL the Christians and Jews
worship the Beast.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.330
Hosea 14 is clear its not ALL of them who
worship the Beast.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:51.780
But it is the Christians and Jews who worship
YHWH and Hosea tells us YHWH is the BEAST

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.460
to the TARES.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:36:00.030
Babylon the Great SITS on the Beast which
is BOTH the 8th King; the WORLD GOVERNMENT

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:04.470
AND the False God that they created that many
of the Christians and Jews WORSHIP.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.600
The TRUE God is the Elohiym.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.540
The Bible itself tells us that the Beast is YHWH

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.090
and the religions that worship YHWH are the
ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.620
which cover the pink area on this map.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.730
This tells us WHERE Babylon is.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:36.420
Babylon sits on the Beast and the Beast devours
the WHOLE EARTH (Revelation 17:3, Daniel 7:23).

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:45.100
Babylon sits on 7 mountains, which are literally
the 7 continents. (Revelation 17:9)

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:51.000
Babylon sits on PEOPLE of different nationalities
and languages. (Revelation 17:15)

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:58.280
Now think, if Babylon sits on the Beast AND
Babylon sits on PEOPLE,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.220
Then the PEOPLE that Babylon sits on, are
the PEOPLE OF THE BEAST.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.030
In other words, the PEOPLE who WORSHIP the
BEAST.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:12.450
The Beast is YHWH (Hosea 13, Daniel 7, and
Revelation 13).

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:17.360
That means BABYLON SITS on the PEOPLE who
WORSHIP YHWH:

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.440
The Abrahamic religions in pink here.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:29.680
End-time Babylon is the GREAT CITY which reigns
over the EARTH (Revelation 17:18)

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.880
It is where the Bodies of the Two Witnesses
will lie UNBURIED (Revelation 11:8)

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.630
It is where the slain will lie UNBURIED over
the WHOLE EARTH (Jeremiah25:33).

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:49.700
It is where the power of their LORD (The BEAST)
will be destroyed utterly (Revelation 11:8)

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:53.900
Look at the definition of the word translated
as crucified.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.120
Its not talking about Jesus or Jerusalem there.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:04.530
It is the place that is spiritually called
Egypt and Sodom (Revelation 11:8)

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:10.180
and it is where the STONE from HEAVEN will
HIT THE SEA (Revelation 18:21).

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.940
NOW that you understand this is not some frivolous
joke,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.260
but extremely complex and EXACT fulfillments
of these ancient prophecies,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:27.400
we can step into the Daniel 9 prophecy and
I will prove to you that the Prince that shall come

00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:29.540
is either Donald Trump or Mike Pence.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:35.740
Remember, the Daniel 9 prophecy is directly
associated with the prophecy in Jeremiah.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:41.030
It does not say HOW they are related, only
that they ARE related.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.390
So Daniel is crying to God, saying he is sorry
he did not listen,

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:51.330
the 70 years of Jeremiah had passed and the
King of Babylon was not punished,

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:55.380
and the people had been scattered into other
countries and had not returned.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.820
So THAT was the fulfillment of Jeremiah 29.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.830
It says after 70 years you will PRAY and I
will ANSWER you.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:07.830
So after 70 years, Daniel prayed and Gabriel
answered him.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:13.660
It says in verses 21 and 22: And while I was
speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:19.740
talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now
come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.310
So he is about to give Daniel skill and understanding
of the 70 YEARS PROPHECY

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.390
that Jeremiah spoke about!

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:33.410
So the 70 years that END at the DESTRUCTION
OF BABYLON AND THE BEAST!

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.660
The 70 years that END at the MILLSTONE HITTING
THE SEA!

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:45.740
So this 70 Weeks in Daniel 9 ABSOLUTELY MUST
occur in the END TIME!

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:52.150
He says to Daniel in verse 24: 70 weeks are
determined upon thy people and thy holy city

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:59.000
to finish the transgression, and to make an
END OF SINS, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:03.720
and to bring in everlasting righteousness,
and to seal up the vision and prophecy,

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.440
and to annoint the most holy.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:11.700
Verse 25: Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:17.900
unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks,

00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:23.790
the STREET shall be built again, and the WALL,
even in troublous times.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:30.970
Verse 26: And AFTER threescore and Two weeks
shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself,

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:36.430
and the PEOPLE of the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME
shall destroy the CITY and the SANCTUARY,

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.230
and the END thereof shall be with a FLOOD,

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.170
and unto the end of the WAR desolations are
determined.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:47.190
Verse 27: And he shall confirm the covenant
for one week,

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.280
and in the midst of the week he shall cause
the sacrifice and oblation to cease,

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.830
and for the overspreading of Abominations
he shall make it desolate,

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:59.850
even until the consummation, and that determined
shall be poured out upon the desolate.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.860
So, the first thing to notice is that the
word translated as WEEKS in Daniel 9

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.580
is NOT the same word in Jeremiah.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:13.040
In Jeremiah, the word translated as YEARS
is number 8141.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:20.160
In Daniel 9, the word translated as WEEKS
is number 7620: SHABUWA,

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.970
which means three basic things: It can be
a singular SEVEN, a PERIOD OF SEVEN,

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.170
or the FEAST OF WEEKS, which is the Jewish
Holiday of SHAVUOT

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.210
which occurs once per year in any given location.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:41.300
So Gabriel is giving Daniel a riddle that
is more complex than just 70 years.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.260
This particular prophecy is not about YEARS,
it is about SHABUWA.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:51.400
Yet, still, it DOES RELATE to the 70 years
prophecy in Jeremiah.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:57.490
So first of all, in verse 24, Gabriel is telling
Daniel that the 70 SHABUWA

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.130
are determined upon Daniel's people and
their Holy City, which was Jerusalem.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:10.070
But notice he says the 70 SHABUWA will not
end until the END OF SINS altogether.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.440
That END OF SINS has not occurred yet!!!

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:19.020
Next, in verse 25 he says this will start
at the GOING FORTH

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.920
of the COMMANDMENT TO RESTORE and BUILD JERUSALEM.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:28.800
Again, that COMMANDMENT TO RESTORE occurred
when the 8th King; the Beast;

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.640
the United Nations voted to partition Palestine
in order to RESTORE Israel.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.740
FROM the GOING FORTH of that COMMANDMENT in
1947 until MESSIAH shall be

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.740
7 SHABUWA and threescore and two SHABUWA.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:50.830
That is 7 SHABUWA and 62 SHABUWA. (one score
represents 20, threescore represents 60)

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:58.110
Again, the word SHABUWA means either SEVEN,
PERIOD OF SEVEN, or The Holiday of SHAVUOT.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:02.920
So it says From the going forth of the commandment
to restore and build Jerusalem

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.600
until Messiah shall be SEVEN, SEVEN, and 62
SHAVUOTS.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:14.150
So from November of 1947, when the commandment
went forth to restore Jerusalem,

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:21.080
Until MESSIAH shall be SEVEN, SEVEN, and 62
SHAVUOTS.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.920
Remember, the restoration of the country of
Israel by the UN

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.480
was actually the creation of the Little Horn.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.340
Gabriel does not tell us here, WHO will put
forth the commandment.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.910
But we can see the fulfillment now,

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.310
and it was the BEAST that put forth the commandment
to restore.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:47.070
The Beast devours the Whole Earth, and the
whole world is WORSHIPPING the Beast,

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:53.830
who is a FALSE GOD, therefore, it stands to
reason that they would be given a FALSE MESSIAH

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.440
who confirms a covenant with the BEAST.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.500
The whole WORLD called Barack Obama the MESSIAH.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.690
And everything in the book of Daniel is written
in code.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.050
Nebuchadnezzar was the HEAD of the image and
the LION.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.900
Alexander the Great was the GOAT, and so on.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.920
MESSIAH also may be a code.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.920
Obama, the man the world called MESSIAH was
BORN in 1961

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:28.130
which is SEVEN, SEVEN after the commandment
to restore that went forth in 1947.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:35.150
Remember, it specifically says SEVEN, SEVEN,
and 62 SHAVUOTS.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.810
So it is not talking about YEARS, but SHAVUOTS.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:43.910
The first SHAVUOT after November 1947 occurred
in the summer of 1948.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:51.260
So SEVEN, SEVEN Shavuots ended in 1961, the
year of Obama's birth,

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:57.680
and 62 Shavuots ended in 2009, the year he
became President of the United States.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.890
Remember, Jesus said in John 5:43 that he
came in his fathers name and he was not received

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:10.430
but that another will come in his own name
and the people WILL receive HIM.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:16.180
He implied that there would be another Messiah
in the future meant for the Pharisees.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:23.650
The rise of the World's Messiah is a fulfillment
of Daniel 9 EXACTLY!

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:29.690
Next it says the STREET and the WALL will
be rebuilt during that time period as well.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.420
Now here is where it gets interesting,

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:36.250
because at this point, this fulfillment is
occurring in the United States.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:41.160
This is very significant, because remember,
Jesus said there will be THREE WATCHES

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.620
and we are talking about the THIRD WATCH now.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.760
It is an event that will occur over the WHOLE
EARTH.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.940
And the BEAST that devoured the WHOLE EARTH
is the 8th King,

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:57.870
which is the United Nations, and the United
Nations is headquartered in New York City

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.530
in the United States.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.940
Now WALL STREET is in New York City.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:09.300
In other words, WALL STREET is located in
the SEAT of the BEAST.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:15.170
So in Daniel 9 verse 25, where it says the
STREET and the WALL shall be built again,

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.940
it can also refer to WALL STREET in New York
City.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.470
Remember the stock market crashed in 1929;

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:28.280
the SAME YEAR that the 7th Head of the Beast
was restored!!!

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.340
That was the year that Vatican City was created.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.290
And remember, they were the ones who set up
the TEMPLE OF SATURN

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.830
in the United States; the CAPITAL BUILDING.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:41.140
Now, we have a man that the world called MESSIAH

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.910
taking the position of power in that Roman
Temple in exact accordance

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:49.400
with the timeline Gabriel gave to Daniel.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:55.390
So as the wounded 7th Head of the Beast was
being healed in 1929,

00:46:55.390 --> 00:47:01.500
WALL STREET crashed in the Seat of the Beast;
New York City, in 1929.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.270
That started the Great Depression in all of
the United States.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.620
And this article on Wall Street in Wikipedia
states

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:15.090
that specifically between the years 1946-1947
stocks could not be purchased.

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:20.030
That was exactly the years the Commandment
went forth to restore Jerusalem.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.980
And while Jews were returning to Jerusalem

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.640
New York City reached its peak of Jewish Emigrants.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.880
In 1950, five years after the rise of the
8th King

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.010
there were 2 million Jews in New York City.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:38.740
Today, New York City has the highest population
of Jews in the World,

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.360
second only to Tel Aviv, Israel.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.260
So Jews were relocating to New York City,
the SEAT of the BEAST

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:52.290
while WALL STREET was being REBUILT in the
SEAT of the BEAST.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:59.070
It says the recovery of the Wall Street Crash
of 1929 did not occur until the 60s.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:04.690
And notice this; the SAME month that the man
called Messiah was born,

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.630
they started building the BERLIN WALL in GERMANY!!!

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:12.930
Remember, the Holy Roman Empire was located
in Germany.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:19.690
And again, that occurred the same month that
the man called Messiah was born,

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:25.900
exactly seven, seven Shavuots after the commandment
to restore.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:32.270
And the building of the World Trade Centers
in New York City began in 1966,

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:36.150
which was a major manifestation of the recovery
of WALL STREET.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:40.290
And the Trade Centers are a significant part
of this prophecy, as you will see.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:44.260
So Daniel 9 verse 25 says this man called
Messiah will show up

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:51.210
seven, seven, and 62 Shavuots after the commandment
to restore Jerusalem

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:56.760
and during that time the STREET and the WALL
will be rebuilt.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:02.460
So the man called Messiah showed up in the
United States right on schedule

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:07.120
and WALL STREET was being rebuilt in the SEAT
OF THE BEAST

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.740
while the SEAT of the BEAST was becoming

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:14.630
the second post popular settlement for the
Jews during that time.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:21.180
The SEAT of the BEAST; the Headquarters of
the United Nations in New York City.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:27.600
So when it says in verse 26: And after 62
Shavuots shall Messiah be cut off,

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.920
but not for himself;

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:34.500
and the people of the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME
shall destroy the CITY and the SANCTUARY,

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.280
that could mean a few different things.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:40.280
Obviously, it already appears to be referring
to New York City.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:45.360
But the real confirmation of that is the setting
up of the Idol of Terror

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.870
that occurred exactly according to Daniel
12.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:51.870
We are not going to look at every word, we
have already done that in other videos.

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:54.850
But if you are not familiar with this alternate
translation,

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.910
please check the meanings of these words in
one or more concordances.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:02.300
I have listed links to three different concordances
below this video.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:08.760
We know that the first fulfillment of Daniel
12:11 and 12 occurred in 685 CE

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.120
with the setting up of the Dome of the Rock
by the King of the North; the Roman Empire

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.090
1290 years after the sacrifice was taken away

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.980
by the first King of the north; Nebuchadnezzar,
the King of Babylon.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.630
Notice 1335 years from that Abomination will
end in the year 2020.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:33.140
But there is also another translation of Daniel
12:11 and 12 that is just as valid.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.710
It says: And from the time that the POSTION
shall be taken OATH

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:42.600
and the IDOL of TERROR set up, there shall
be 1290 days.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.960
Blessed is he who LONGS FOR and REACHES FOR
the 1335th day.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:52.340
Now again, the major fulfilment of this scripture
occurred in 685 CE.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.110
But another fulfillment of it occurred in
2012.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:59.360
The man called Messiah took the oath of office

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.720
for the POSTION of the President of the United
States on January 20, 2009.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.650
Exactly 1290 days after that, on August 2,
2012 he signed a steel beam

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:15.740
that was literally SET UP in the ONE WORLD
Trade Center in New York City;

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.340
the SEAT OF THE BEAST.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.020
That IDOL symbolizes the war on TERROR.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.920
So it is LITERALLY the IDOL of TERROR

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.490
that was SET UP EXACTLY 1290 days after the
position was taken oath!!!

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:39.080
And the 1335th day was the day the blessed
were longing for; the Feast of Trumpets 2012.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:46.220
Now, Bible prophecy tells us that there MUST
be a specific heavenly SIGN that occurs

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.420
along with the setting up of the Abomination
of Desolation.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:56.390
That sign occurred in 686 while they were
building the Dome of the Rock

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:02.720
and the EXACT SAME heavenly SIGN occurred
in October 2012

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.420
on the TRUE Biblical FEAST OF TRUMPETS that
year

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:14.560
one month after the setting up of the Idol
of Terror and the 1335th day!!!

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.370
People will try to argue that the Jews did
not observe their Feast of Trumpets

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.920
on the New Moon of October 16, 2012.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.490
But that is not what I said.

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:27.320
I said the TRUE Feast of Trumpets that year
was on October 16th.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:35.960
And mind you, the Jewish calendar DID align
with the TRUE calendar THIS YEAR; in 2016!

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.810
They had to add a 13th month in order to move
their calendar back into alignment.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:46.000
The Bible says nothing about adding a 13th
month every so many years.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.470
The Bible says to calculate the days and months
using the SUN and MOON EACH YEAR!!!

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:57.540
So we were observing the TRUE dates of the
Biblical calendar back in 2012

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:02.670
but the mainstream Jewish calendar did not
catch up until 2016.

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.170
And again, if they had been calculating the
days every year,

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:12.590
then they would NOT have had to add that 13th
month that is not mentioned in the Bible!

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:17.980
Also, it is very possible that the mainstream
Jewish calendar is coming from Israel

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:23.680
which we know is the Little Horn, who the
Bible says will CHANGE THE TIMES!!!

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:29.030
So their date for Trumpets in 2016 was aligned
with the true calendar,

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:36.380
but in 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 it was one
month ahead.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.350
You can watch my video on how the Bible says
to calulate the Feast Days.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.490
We use the same method every year.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:48.710
That Biblical Heavenly SIGN described in Revelation
12

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:53.060
DID occur on the TRUE Feast of Trumpets in
2012

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:59.060
and it was the EXACT same celestial configuration
that occurred in 686

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.260
when they set up the Abomination on the second
watch!!!

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:06.610
Now, notice that this MAJOR event in 2012;

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:11.030
The Idol of Terror; otherwise known as the
Abomination of Desolation;

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.220
that Jesus told us to watch for,

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.180
it occurred in the MIDST OF THE WEEK.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:21.100
Many Bible scholars have believed that the
Abomination will be set up in the midst of the week.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:27.120
And although Daniel 9 does NOT say that, the
fulfillment happened ANYWAY

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.240
as if in attempt to WAKE PEOPLE UP!!!

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.790
Lets read what Daniel 9 actually says in verse
26:

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:37.610
Remember this word translated as WEEKS means
Shavuot

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:43.750
and the word translated as BE CUT OFF can
also mean CUT A COVENANT.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:52.680
So it says: And after 62 Shavuots shall Messiah
be cut off, OR cut a covenant,

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.890
but not for himself.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:59.500
And the PEOPLE of the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME
shall destroy the CITY and the SANCTUARY.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:03.900
this word translated as SANCTUARY also means
HALLOWED THING.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.820
So the people of the prince that shall come
shall destroy the CITY and the HALLOWED THING.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.600
Well the fulfillments of these prophecies
have already established

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.620
that it is referring to New York City and
the One World Trade Center;

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:22.280
The IDOL set up in the Sacred Place in the
SEAT OF THE BEAST.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.120
Then verse 26 goes onto say: And the END thereof
shall be with a FLOOD!

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.570
Well what is the FLOOD?

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:35.060
Revelation 18:21 tells us it is a STONE from
heaven that will HIT the SEA of BABYLON

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:37.340
which we can see is the ATLANTIC OCEAN!!!

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.130
New York would be wiped out by that.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:45.870
Jeremiah 51:42 confirms that Babylon will
be destroyed and covered by the WAVES!

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:51.670
A meteorite the size of a mountain, as Daniel
says, hitting the Atlantic

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:59.000
would cause enormous tidal waves that would
hit New York City as well as other coastal cities.

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.030
So that is the FLOOD.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:06.420
Then it says: And unto the end of the WAR
desolations are determined.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:11.430
So its referencing the millstone that will
destroy Babylon

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:18.310
and the war that will start after that and
last for 3.5 years; the final time of trouble.

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:24.040
And again, Daniel was clear that this prophecy
relates to Jeremiahs prophecy

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.120
which is about the destruction of Babylon
in the end time.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.790
So this fits PRECISELY!!!

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:37.010
Then verse 27 says: And he shall confirm the
covenant with many for one week.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:41.060
Notice this does not say whether MESSIAH will
confirm the covenant

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.850
or whether the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME will
confirm the covenant.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.140
But when we realize what the covenant is,

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:52.660
then it becomes clear that BOTH of them will
definitely confirm the covenant!

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:58.180
We know what the covenant is, because we had
a fulfillment of verse 26 in 2009.

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:03.860
It says: And AFTER the 62 Shavuots shall Messiah
CUT A COVENANT.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:10.600
The 62nd Shavuot from the Commandment to restore
Jerusalem occurred in the summer of 2009.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.780
Just a few months after that, in October of
2009,

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:19.330
it was announced that the man called Messiah
had been awarded the World Wide Peace Prize.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.000
And it was explained that the REASON he won
this PEACE PRIZE

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.420
was because of his PROMOTION of NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:33.600
That specifically refers to the Worldwide
Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear weapons.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.170
This WORLD WIDE TREATY was put forth by the
United Nations; the BEAST!

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:47.560
So this man that the world called MESSIAH
was given a WORLD renowned PRIZE

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:52.300
for PROMOTING the World Wide TREATY of the
BEAST!!!

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:57.170
He physically received the prize in December
of 2009.

00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:01.990
Daniel 9 verse 27 says: And he shall CONFIRM
the COVENANT for one week.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.150
Again this word translated as WEEK can mean
a period of 7 years.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:11.330
So it can be saying that Messiah will confirm
the covenant for one period of 7 years.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:15.010
It says he will confirm the covenant WITH
MANY!

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:19.790
And this is a COVENANT that is being confirmed
with the WHOLE WORLD!

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:24.250
Then verse 27 says: And in the midst of the
week (or 7 years)

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.670
he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation
to cease,

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.040
and for the overspreading of Abominations
he shall make it desolate,

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.960
even until the consummation,

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.560
and that determined shall be poured out upon
the desolate.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:41.680
The word translated as SACRIFICE also means
PASSOVER or THANK OFFERRING

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:48.450
and THANK OFERRING is also referred, elsewhere
in the texts as THANKSGIVING!

00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:50.700
Literally THANKSGIVING !

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:55.900
The word translated as OBLATION also means
TRIBUTE or GIFT.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:01.570
So this is saying: And he shall confirm the
covenant with many for one period of 7 years

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:06.170
and in the midst of the 7 years he shall cause
EITHER:

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.860
The Passover and the Tribute to cease OR:

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:16.890
He will cause the THANKSGIVING and GIFT to
cease!!!

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:17.920
Thanksgiving and Christmas!

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.940
Thanksgiving and Gift!

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.720
Again we don't know which year.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.050
Because its not clear if that refers to the
man called MESSIAH

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:26.410
OR the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.010
We know what the covenant referred to,

00:59:29.010 --> 00:59:33.850
that was confirmed just a few months after
the 62nd Shavuot,

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:37.940
and was the covenant of the BEAST; a WORLD
WIDE COVENANT.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.400
We also know the United States has been confirming
that covenant for many years

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.270
and the next President will no doubt confirm
it as well.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:52.230
So when it says AFTER 62 Shavuots Messiah
will either be cut off or cut a covenant,

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:56.760
and the people of the prince that shall come
will destroy the city and the hallowed thing,

00:59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.450
the fulfillment of that can occur a few different
ways.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:04.730
If it means Messiah will cut a covenant, starting
a 7 year period,

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:09.040
then that 7 year period started when he was
awarded the Peace Prize

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.240
literally SEVEN years ago, as of October through
December 2016!!!

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.750
But if it means that Messiah will be cut off,

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:22.440
then it can be saying that the PRINCE THAT
SHALL COME will confirm the covenant

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.370
after Messiah is cut off

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:31.650
starting a 7 year period that would begin
in 2017 and end in 2024.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:37.550
The interesting thing is that verse 24 says
that 70 Shabuwa are determined

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.410
until the END OF SINS!

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:46.090
Shabuwa can mean BOTH SEVEN or the FEAST OF
SHAVUOT!

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:50.900
So this can say EITHER: Seventy SEVEN are
determined

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.060
OR Seventy SHAVUOTS are determined.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.550
If it is Seventy SHAVUOTS from the Commandment
to restore Jerusalem

01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:04.710
then that would end sometime between November
of 2017 and May of 2018

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:08.800
since the commandment was voted in November
of 1947

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.300
but the State of Israel was not officially
announced until May of 1948.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.790
But if verse 24 is saying that Seventy SEVEN
are determined

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.520
then that would end in 2024,

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.610
which is literally 77 Shavuots from the commandment
to restore Jerusalem.

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:29.470
So, as you can see, there is a real possibility

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:34.490
that the next 7 years may represent the confirming
of the covenant again

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.620
by the PRINCE THAT SHALL COME.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:42.750
That is, the PRINCE that shall come AFTER
the man called MESSIAH!!!

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.970
So this can literally refer to either Donald
Trump

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.840
or Mike Pence, his Vice President!

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.510
These fulfillments are multi-layered.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:56.310
But I hope you can understand now, why this
really may be true.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:02:01.890
The Temple of the 7th Head of the Beast was
built in the United States

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:05.500
which is where the Prince that Shall Come
will be sitting

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:12.290
and the SEAT OF THE 8th KING is in New York
City where the Idol was set up

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:13.770
in the midst of the week!

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:18.900
And again, this prophecy relates to the 70
years of Jeremiah.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:29.900
And those 70 years start sometime after the
rise of the 8th King, which rose in 1945-1946.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.840
So the 70 years that the nations around Jerusalem
have been serving Babylon

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.360
has been accomplished!

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.840
Just recently!

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:44.390
There is SO MUCH MORE to these fulfillments
all pointing to the time we are in RIGHT NOW!

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:49.940
It appears that the rescue along with the
final time of trouble is about to start

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:54.400
and we are told it will last 42 months which
is 3.5 years.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.820
I hope you will look closer at all of this
in the playlist:
