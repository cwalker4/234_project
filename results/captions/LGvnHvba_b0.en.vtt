00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.234

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.941
Westport.

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.811
- Oh yeah, nice place.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.644
- That's very high class.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:46.713
- Almost from Connecticut.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.793
- Yeah.

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:48.785
- Yeah, nice place up there.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:50.730
Westport, bought a house up
there, Johnny, you know, and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.601
it's really nice.

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.901
People are nice,
you know what I mean?

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.167
I got nice neighbors over there, too.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.662
Last weekend I played
tennis with my neighbors,

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.055
you know, Maryann and Biff.

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:00.888
- Maryann and Biff?

00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:02.534
- Yes.

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:03.879
You ought to come up there,
you know what I mean,

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.014
spend a few days, you and I.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:06.100
Relax, they don't bother you.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.933
It's nice.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:07.951
It's a good time, just you and I alone.

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:09.379
Want to bring Ed along too?

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:10.212
- Sure

00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:12.519
- Nah, but I've been
working hard Johnny, and

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.775
I'm trying to relax, you know.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:16.359
I go to Las Vegas next week,
and Resorts after that.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.430
I've got an album coming
out, a movie coming out

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.263
I'm working very hard.

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:20.096
- Yeah.

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:21.094
- My father, he was a workaholic.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:21.927
- Really?

00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:23.285
- Oh yeah. You mention work,
he got drunk, are you kidding?

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:24.651
- I didn't know that.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.967
(audience laughing)

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:29.824
- Well I finally solved my
drinking problem, I joined

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.895
Alcoholics Anonymous, you
know, yeah, I still drink

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:33.232
I use a different name that's all.

00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:35.070
(audience laughing)

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
(audience clapping)

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.087
(audience whistling)

00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:43.985
I tell ya my problem is
that I drink too much,

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:44.818
way too much.

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:46.071
I gave my doctor a urine specimen.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.271
There was an olive in it.

00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.271
(audience laughing)

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:52.919
When I drink, I don't
know what I was doing,

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.823
I was loaded one night
and I went to a gay bar.

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:55.656
It was ridiculous.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.390
There was 15 guys for every guy.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.710
(audience laughing)

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.319
Is this on full?
- Yeah, it's on full.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.202
- Is it on full?

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:03.619
Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:06.165
I'm never lucky in bars.

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.536
I saw a sign over one bar,
it said topless, bottomless,

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.334
I went inside, there was no one there.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:13.334
(audience laughing)

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:15.071
- Life ain't easy.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:16.022
- I mean, nothing works.

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:17.798
I decided to look out for number one and

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:18.974
I stepped in number two.

00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:21.974
(audience laughing)

00:02:25.902 --> 00:02:28.054
And smokin', that's another
one, try to stop smokin'

00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:29.013
that's a beauty, huh?

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:30.670
But with cigarettes, my
wife and I, we made a deal,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.704
my wife and I, we only smoke after sex.

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:34.575
I've got the same pack now since 1975.

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:36.894
(audience laughing)

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:37.758
What bothers me is my wife.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.056
She's up to three packs a day.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:42.056
(audience laughing)

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.526
(audience laughter drowns out speaking)

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:48.359
- Yeah

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.422
- I'll tell you the truth, my wife and I

00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:51.430
we never have sex.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430
We get undressed and we
can't stop laughin', ya know?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.430
(audience laughing)

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.358
But I'll tell you one thing,
when my wife does have sex

00:03:00.358 --> 00:03:01.365
she screams.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.041
Oh, especially when I walk in on her.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.708
Oh, forget 'bout it.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.814
Are you kidding, I know
my wife cheats on me

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.158
every time I come home the parrot says,

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.406
"Quick out the window."

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:15.573
(audience laughing drowns out speaking)

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.159
My house, in my house I can't relax.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.823
I've got a dog he drives me nuts.

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:27.879
I've got a dumb dog.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.270
We call him Egypt, every
room he leaves a pyramid.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.270
(audience laughing)

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.449
My kids, they don't help either.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:39.282
- [Johnny] No good, huh?

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:41.174
- My kids, they're really
smart kids I've got, you know.

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:42.989
The other day I told my kid,
I said, "Someday you'll have

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.869
"children of your own."

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.022
He said, "So will you."

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:48.022
(audience laughing)

00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:55.758
I've got a mean kid, a very
mean kid, he scotch tapes

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:57.390
worms to the sidewalk and
then watches the birds

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.802
get hernias, are you kiddin' me?

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:00.635
- Mean kid!

00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:01.734
- Mean kid.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.502
My daughter, too, she's no bargain either.

00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:05.519
My daughter, are you kiddin'?

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.030
She's been picked up so many
times, she is starting to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.766
grow handles.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.554
(audience clapping)

00:04:12.554 --> 00:04:15.496
Yeah, yeah my daughter, you kiddin'.

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.142
Her graduation book, her
picture is horizontal,

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:18.319
it's ridiculous.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.278
(audience laughing)

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:23.974
My daughter, my daughter,
they call her Federal Express.

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:24.807
- Why's that?

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:25.838
- When she's goes to a guy's apartment,

00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:27.950
she absolutely positively
has to be there overnight.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.950
(audience laughing)

00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:34.317
(audience whistling)

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:35.725
I mean that's the trouble
with kids these days,

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:36.990
they are playing around
so young, very young,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.046
I was talking to my doctor.

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:39.732
You know my doctor, Dr Vinny Boombatz

00:04:39.732 --> 00:04:41.315
You know my doctor?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.295
Well, he told me last week
in his office that he got

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:45.734
six cases of VD.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:47.104
I mean he's alright now, ya know.

00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:50.104
(audience laughing)

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:53.637
Oh, he's a strange doctor.
- A strange doctor.

00:04:53.637 --> 00:04:54.512
- Oh yeah, very, are you kiddin'?

00:04:54.512 --> 00:04:56.326
I asked him if my heart
was strong enough for sex.

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:57.872
He told me not if I join in, ya know?

00:04:57.872 --> 00:05:00.872
(audience laughing)

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:03.853
(mumbling)

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:05.637
But everyone wants love,
love is the answer, John.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.294
And everyone is looking for
love deep, love of a lifetime,

00:05:07.294 --> 00:05:08.198
a deep love, ya know.

00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:09.845
I'm lookin' for a shallow
half hour, ya know.

00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:12.094
(audience laughing)
What I want.

00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:14.326
I start strong but I peter
right out, that's my style.

00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:15.741
(audience laughing)

00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:16.574
- Don't you have luck with women?

00:05:16.574 --> 00:05:17.413
- No, I never have luck with women.

00:05:17.413 --> 00:05:19.045
I'm no ladies man, I know that Johnny.

00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:20.414
I never got girls when I
was a kid in show business

00:05:20.414 --> 00:05:21.342
either, ya know.

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.518
My one girl told me to come
over there was nobody home.

00:05:23.518 --> 00:05:24.813
I went over, there was nobody home.

00:05:24.813 --> 00:05:27.813
(audience laughing)

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.262
And this girl was no bargain either.

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:31.095
She was fat.

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:31.928
- [Johnny] Fat, huh.

00:05:31.928 --> 00:05:32.761
- [Girl] How fat?

00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:34.586
(audience laughing)

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:35.419
- How fat?

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.904
When she wears high
heels, she strikes oil.

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:37.879
Okay, she's fat.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
(audience laughing)

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:45.126
Fat, you kiddin'?
- Fat huh?

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:46.397
- Fat.
- Big girl, huh?

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:48.608
- I met her at the Macy's
parade, she was wearing ropes.

00:05:48.608 --> 00:05:51.262
(audience laughing)

00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:52.446
I mean fat.

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.982
When she was on a Richard
Simmons show jumping

00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:55.654
up and down, my tv fell off the stand.

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:57.101
(audience laughing)

00:05:57.101 --> 00:06:00.662
But I'm talking a fat girl
here, you know what I mean?

00:06:00.662 --> 00:06:01.495
Big girl, you kiddin',

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.800
she was standing alone and a
cop told her to break it up.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.228
(audience laughing)

00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:08.753
I mean fat, Johnny, you kiddin'?

00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:09.624
- You're talking about a large person.

00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:11.160
- I mean this girl was fat and ugly.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.128
Oh she ugly.

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:13.104
How ugly?

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:14.232
I took her to the beach, they asked me

00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:15.216
what I used for bait.

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:18.216
(audience laughing)

00:06:20.384 --> 00:06:21.640
Ugly, chick, you kiddin'.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.128
When I took her home,
my mother put newspapers

00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:23.961
on the floor.

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.232
(audience laughing)

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:27.997
I mean ugly, I gave her a
hickey, I got fur in my mouth.

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:32.164
(audience cheering drowns out speaker)

00:06:34.278 --> 00:06:35.715
Thank you very much.

00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:37.665
(mumbling) I'll tell you that.

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.696
(audience cheering)

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:43.632
♫ And that's how ugly she was

00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:45.080
Follow me here.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.624
If I had the right trio I
could make it, you know that?
