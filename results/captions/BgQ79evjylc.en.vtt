00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.310
What you just saw was groundbreaking director
Alfred Hitchcock discussing the power of the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.659
montage to influence, even change a viewer’s
opinion.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.390
This is known as the Kuleshov effect.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:40.109
Soviet filmmaker Lev Kuleshov showed the following
clip to an audience.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.259
Then he showed them this clip.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:56.379
Finally, this.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:01.509
The audience fervently remarked how the expression
on the man’s face was different in all three

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.759
sequences, one showed hunger, the next sadness
and finally lust, as though they were all

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.000
shot independently.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.840
This was not the case, the only difference
between the three shots is the image spliced

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.280
in between the closeup.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.150
Across all three examples, the closeup shot
itself was the exact same piece of film, the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.739
man’s expression did not change.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.950
Kuleshov used this experiment to demonstrate
how the considered assemblance of completely

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.590
unrelated pieces of film and images, can significantly
alter a viewer’s emotional response.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.239
This simple yet powerful technique has been
used in propaganda, to wage wars, win wars,

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.220
spread tyranny and keep it at bay.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.569
It has been used in humanity’s greatest
films to make audiences laugh, sob and scared

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.569
senseless.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.780
But there is one force in our modern world
that holds the deftest hand, the slimiest

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.379
skill, the most astute ability to rearrange
information, to influence nations, change

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.860
narratives and breed mass contempt.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.389
The media.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:26.159
The ability of the press, TV news and increasingly
digital media to take the truth and warp it

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.550
to align with their ideological agenda is
unrivalled.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.500
Fastidiously straddling the legal boundaries
as they do so.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.560
How you may ask?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.950
I’m sure you’re all too aware of fake
news.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.790
Well, I’m not talking about fake news, I
mean to draw your attention to a far more

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.969
underhanded means of deception utilised by
what you may consider the “genuine” media.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.349
Like most people, you have probably long suspected
that the big six media giants that control

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.579
traditional news or the new generation of
digital media haven’t always reported stories

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.549
to you in the most genuine and factual way.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.060
But it’s likely that you’ve never quite
been able to put your finger on how or why.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.680
This is because the techniques they use to
subvert the truth are crucially subtle.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.160
They are required, even mandated by law, in
certain countries, to be subtle.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.820
So allow me to enlighten you with just a few
of the many masterfully subtle subversions

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.070
big media uses to sabotage the status quo.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.630
The media loves statistics.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.630
Why?

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.610
It’s not because statistics offer absolute,
empirically factual truths in a concise and

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.150
easily digestible format, it’s quite the
opposite.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.770
The media loves statistics because they can
easily be modified to support the narrative

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.110
they wish the current story to tell.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.220
In 2005 the state of Florida introduced the
controversial “Stand Your Ground” law,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.169
permitting people to use lethal force against
an attacker even if it would be possible to

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.260
safely retreat from the situation.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.450
Reuters published the following chart showing
the number of gun deaths in Florida over time.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.720
“Wow” you may remark, gun deaths dropped
drastically following the introduction of

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.900
Stand Your Ground in 2005.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.130
Wrong.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.520
Notice the y-axis has been inverted so that
zero is at the top, ergo as the line-graph

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.229
flows down the chart, the number of gun deaths
increases.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:47.110
This is purposely opposed to the way in which
we have been normalised to expect the progression

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.990
of data to invariably appear on an x/y-axis
chart.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.419
We naturally expect up to mean more, not less.

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.160
We also expect zero to be at the bottom-left
of charts.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.080
So then, at first glance, it would appear
that following the 2005 statute, Florida gun

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.530
deaths dropped to almost zero.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.990
Another trick is truncating the y-axis.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.630
The news loves to use this tactic with crime
statistics to make them sound more rapturously

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.140
apocalyptic.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.519
How many times have you read or heard news
similar to this “murder rates up 100% on

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:28.729
last year”.

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.240
What they often fail to report are the actual
numbers.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.959
What if there was only one murder last year?

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:41.050
If this year there are two murders, that is
indeed an increase of 100%.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.120
But to the dismay of professional fearmongering
frauds, crime rates are usually extremely

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.940
low, to begin with, except in a few rare places
in the world.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.409
Two murders in even a small city of say 200,000
people is not a statistic to give you cause

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.280
to organise a sign-writing party with your
belligerent blue-haired buddies.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.170
So when you’re shown a chart such as this
you would be forgiven for thinking that interest

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.610
rates shot up drastically between 2008 and
2012.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.640
If this were true we would have started donating
our organs to pay our mortgages by now.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.220
Notice how the y-axis is severely truncated
to exacerbate the most minute increments of

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.220
data.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.880
Plot the same data on a chart where the baseline
is set at zero and what we can now observe

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.460
is that interest rates, in fact, stayed staunchly
static.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.680
It’s not always appropriate to start a y-axis
at zero.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.190
Sometimes to demonstrate a huge shift in data
within a far greater range the y-axis must

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.269
be truncated.

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:51.110
But always be aware when you suspect that
it has been done to mislead you.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.060
As it has in an even more devious way in this
chart published by the Ministry of Health

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.280
for New South Wales in 2013.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.050
What’s going on here is more subtle than
simply truncating an axis.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:11.770
43,000 nurses are graphically represented
by just four nurse graphics, yet 28 nurse

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:18.190
graphics are then used to represent 46,000
nurses, a numerical increase of only 3,000

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.190
nurses.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.860
Making the increase in nurses seem astronomically
higher between 2010 and 2011, when in fact

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.229
there was only a 7% increase.

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:33.810
Another way that information is often misleadingly
visualised is through false correlations.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.669
This graph humorously suggests that there
is a positive correlation between ice creams

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.079
sales and murders.

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:45.829
But of course, correlation doesn’t imply
causation.

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:50.780
Just because I usually take tea around the
same time that the pope holds morning mass,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:56.310
it doesn’t mean that I am in any way persuaded
by the supreme pontiff's pious utterings to

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.420
enjoy a delicious pot of steeped tea leaves.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:05.600
Nor does it imply that my tea consumption
is some kind of religious ceremony.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.490
The deception that can be reeked by slapping
arbitrary false correlations on a visual chart

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.300
has been turned into somewhat of a fledgeling
internet meme by some witty individuals.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.019
As can be seen in these frankly brilliant
examples.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:24.899
A lower GDP increases penis size.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:29.510
Using Internet Explorer leads to murder, which
to be fair could seem entirely accurate to

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.880
anyone who has ever used Interment Explorer.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.990
And my favourite, that global warming has
been caused by a decrease in the number of

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.040
pirates.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.070
When the media isn’t distracted with developing
duplicitous graphics then it is usually divulging

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.170
duplicitous discourse.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.069
One method by which journalists fool the general
public is by using very broad assumptions

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:59.350
to slap incendiary labels on individuals whom
they don’t agree with.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:05.629
Take a look at this headline by left-leaning
British newspaper The Guardian.

00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:13.819
This is the story that three YouTube free
speech defenders, Paul Joseph Watson, Mark

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:19.930
Meechan “Count Dankula’ and Carl Benjamin
“Sargon of Akkad” have joined the United

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.519
Kingdom Independence Party “UKIP”, the
party responsible for instigating the series

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:27.209
of events that led to Brexit.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:33.170
Now I can’t speak on behalf of these individuals’
political views, because I don’t know, I

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.540
cannot definitely say whether or not any of
them personally identify with the alt-right,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.670
any more than I could say whether or not Kim
Jong Un believes in pamper days.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.740
Followers of these YouTubers would argue that
they are simply defenders of free speech and

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.310
they all seek to rationally object to the
irrational ideologies of the extreme left

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.270
that is so pervasive throughout contemporary
culture.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.870
Claims that these individuals are linked to
the alt-right are widely unsubstantiated and

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.310
even the most prominent rumours are pathetically
flimsy.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:12.100
But that doesn’t matter, because, sure,
they have impressive support online, but the

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.430
majority of the general public and especially
Guardian readers, have never watched any of

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.089
these three mens’ videos nor is it very
likely they were aware of their existence,

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:24.220
before reading the subject article.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:30.360
So by writing in the headline that they are
“linked to alt-right” the damage has already

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.240
been done.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.360
Most people will instantly conjure mental
images of what we typically associate with

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.220
the alt-right, pointy hood white supremacists,
neo-nazis etc. etc.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.339
Claiming that UKIP has “welcomed” these
supposed white-supremacist hate mongers with

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:51.360
a red carpet seeks to dexterously defame UKIP.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.199
Notice also, how the carefully chosen image
to accompany this headline is a particularly

00:11:56.199 --> 00:12:02.420
smug-looking Mark Meechan, who, and I’m
sorry Mark, is definitely the most typically

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.360
“alt-right” looking of the three men,
based on appearance.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.800
Why does it matter if headlines are misleading?

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.260
Because multiple studies concur that a headline’s
bias hugely affects the way the rest of the

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.559
article is read and interpreted.

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:26.620
Headlines provide us with the setup for the
story we are about to read and no matter if

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.819
that story contains conflicting information
we still view that information through the

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:36.190
lens of the bias that the headline has pre-constructed
for us.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:41.300
Clinical studies have proved that how a news
headline is written positively or negatively

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:48.510
affects our opinion of something or someone
far more than the actual content does, the

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.290
body of the article.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.959
The wording of the headline also dictates
what we remember most from the news story

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:59.759
and how we will report it to our friends.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:04.870
That’s assuming the person ever reads the
article.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:11.240
Researchers found that in 59% of occurrences
online people read only the headline of a

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.490
news story and never click on it to read the
full article.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:24.069
News outlets know this, that’s why headlines
are and always have been designed to be captivating

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.199
and often deceptive.

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:31.920
Slapping unsubstantiated labels on public
figures to skew the views of that individual

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.259
in the eyes of the impressionable general
public, thus undermining the figures’ authority

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:42.819
is one of the most widely used modus operandi
mobilized by the media.

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:48.319
In today’s heavily divided political climate
“alt-right” is a particular favourite

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:54.360
label, because, with that one short compound
word, so much hatefully imagery can be instantaneously

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.730
attached to an individual.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.370
Even the most moderate of social commentators
such as Canadian Clinical Psychologist Dr.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.209
Jordan Peterson has received this treatment.

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:10.559
NBC News happily slapped the alt-right label
on him in this damning piece.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:15.720
So apparently, having a rational, fact-based
approach towards cultural and social issues

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.769
and inspiring people to take responsibility
for their own lives is synonymous with being

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:21.889
a Nazi.

00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:25.630
There are other examples available.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:31.709
Jordan Peterson also famously clashed with
Channel 4 journalist Cathy Newman and it perfectly

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:36.879
illustrated another trick that journalists
do all the time, use manipulative language

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:39.579
to put words in the interviewee's mouth.

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:44.300
In this fascinating interview that has been
watched by over 14 million people, Peterson

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:51.199
carefully and logically deconstructs many
commonly believed fallacies about inequality

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:55.810
in the workplace and general life choices
between the two genders.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.649
To which Cathy Newman simply responds with
“So you’re saying..” then a general

00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:06.899
inflammatory statement that she knows the
viewers will react negatively to if she can

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:10.470
convince them that this is what Peterson actually
meant.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:17.110
Whereas his actual meaning was something entirely
different from what Newman suggests, which

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:23.069
is perfectly clear to anyone with a pair of
ears and a brain in between them.

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:29.370
Why does she repeatedly attempt to draw false
conclusions from Peterson’s rhetoric?

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:36.839
Because she is intellectually outclassed,
and she knows it, she has no rational counter-argument

00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:38.329
to Peterson’s statements.

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:43.980
But she cannot do the valiant thing and admit
that Peterson’s arguments hold some ground

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:51.209
because both herself and the network she represents
have a certain ideological agenda to push,

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:57.170
so she instead attempts to put words in Peterson’s
mouth, seeking to besmirch his moral character.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:02.170
Other linguistic tricks are commonly used
by journalists when interviewing an adversary.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.699
I would love to show you example clips of
the following techniques in use but I’m

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:12.500
sure you can appreciate how increasingly rigorous
copyright laws make it difficult for me to

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.110
do so, however, there are thousands of examples
out there for you to seek out if you wish

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.110
to do so.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.829
I’m sure you will have noticed these in
use on a daily basis anyway.

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:27.770
So, for instance, anchors and presenters,
will often fall back on binary injunctions

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:34.649
such as “Yes or no”, “just answer the
question YES or NO” when the opponent gives

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:39.720
a lengthy answer to a deeply nuanced question
that cannot possibly be answered with a simple

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.860
yes or no, without coming across as a belligerent
fool.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.059
When an opponent uses empirical evidence or
commonly known axioms to support their argument

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:55.110
it is common for the interviewer to come back
with the ignorant response “well that’s

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.459
your opinion”.

00:16:56.459 --> 00:17:01.749
This is commonly used when the interviewer
knows their opponent just made a substantial

00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:05.390
and valid point that they cannot intellectually
retort.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:11.470
So, by instead chalking it up as “their
opinion” it undermines the factual foundations

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.180
of the entire argument that person just laid
down.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.709
When introducing a guest it is common for
a news anchor, talk show host or other journalists

00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:26.600
to preface the interview with something similar
to “John Smith claims he is an avian expert

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.790
but his critics say he molests pigeons, let’s
find out”.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.170
Notice the critical syntax here “but his
critics say”.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.350
Which critics?

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:43.850
It is very rare the critics who supposedly
said that are actually identified.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:50.820
A broad generalisation such as this rarely
attracts calls for substantiation and it doesn’t

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.160
matter anyway, the damage has already been
done.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.700
In the eyes of most people watching, listening
or reading, Mr Smith is now a pigeon molester.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.790
When in fact those “critics” could consist
of no more than the journalist who made that

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:12.030
statement witnessing a homeless man shouting
“bloody pigeon molester” at Mr Smith as

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.679
he innocently walked down the street.

00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:21.149
It is then legally justified for such a conjecture
to exist, even if it does not represent greater

00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:23.570
public opinion.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.900
Subtle phrasing such as “but their critics
say” is necessary in a world with libel

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:35.330
and slander laws, because the journalist themselves
are not making the vilification, some mysterious

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.530
critic is.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:42.669
I’ll let you into a little secret, almost
every time a journalist uses the phrasing

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:49.390
“but his or her critics say” prepended
to a string of particularly incendiary pejoratives.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.801
It is actually a means for the supposedly
“impartial” journalist to out their personal

00:18:54.801 --> 00:19:00.200
views or that of their company’s on the
character in question, without personally

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.360
risking legal defamation.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:09.080
An example can be seen here on torontolife.com
“When U of T professor Jordan Peterson pledged

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.409
never to use gender-neutral pronouns, he sparked
a vicious campus battle.

00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:19.830
The free-speech advocates say he’s combating
the tyranny of political correctness.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:29.490
His critics say he’s a privileged, trans-phobic
bigot who must be stopped”.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:42.620
Also, if a journalist uses the word “allegedly”
before a statement, then it’s usually the

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.950
same damn thing, it’s just another way to
say “their critics say”.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.850
Subtle linguistic tricks such as this that
cunningly transmute opinions into facts are

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.830
especially important and thus often utilised
in British news.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:03.350
In the UK impartiality laws exist under the
Communications Act of 2003 that legally mandates

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:09.700
news in any form to exercise “due impartiality
and due accuracy”.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.220
In 2017 British regulator Ofcom ruled that
Fox News’ Hannity and Tucker Carlson Tonight

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.860
shows had breached these laws.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.870
But since Fox News no longer broadcasts in
the UK they could not be fined.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:30.700
News is the mechanism by which public opinions
are formed and ideologies are built, it is

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:37.360
therefore imperative that when we see wild
claims and incendiary headlines that we choose

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.029
to dig a little deeper, consult other sources
and build one’s own balanced opinion on

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:50.290
the matter instead of blindly copying that
of a single biased journalist.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.279
Especially in a world where we have misleading
headlines such as this “Girls’ school

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.620
still offering ‘something special’ - head”.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.230
Thanks for watching.
