00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
The President: Thank you
very much, Vice President

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:07.073
Pence, for helping --
where's our Vice President --

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.943
great job, great job --
to restore American

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.911
leadership in space.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.313
So important.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.549
Cabinet members, General
Selva, Deputy Secretary

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.652
Shanahan, Acting
Administrator Lightfoot,

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.422
members of Congress,
and the National Space

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.557
Council, thank you
all for being here.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.827
And especially, Mike, as I
said, I want to thank you.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.796
I know how active you've
been and how important

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.030
this is to you.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.998
So we appreciate it.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.533
Thank you very much.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:38.538
We also welcome astronauts
Christina Koch and

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.440
Peggy Whitson.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.341
Christina, thank you.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.076
Peggy, thank
you very much.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.478
Peggy recently returned
from the International

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:50.917
Space Station and has now
spent an incredible 665

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:51.885
days in space.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.986
You'll have to
explain that.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.287
That sounds tough.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.221
(laughter)

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.090
More than any other
American; more than any

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.725
woman ever.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.761
Finally, we're honored
to be joined by Apollo

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.197
astronaut Jack Schmitt.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.767
Exactly 45 years ago,
almost to the minute, Jack

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.470
became one of the last
Americans to land

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.638
on the moon.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.074
Today, we pledge that
he will not be the last.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.444
And I suspect we'll be
finding other places to

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.878
land in addition
to the moon.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:19.779
What do you think, Jack?

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:20.814
Where's Jack?

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.916
What do you think, Jack?

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.584
We'll find some other
places out there?

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.486
There are a couple of
other places, right?

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.253
Mr. Schmitt:
Yes, we should.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.154
Learn from the moon.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.756
The President:
We'll learn.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.090
The directive I'm signing
today will refocus

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.794
America's space program
on human exploration

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.229
and discovery.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.165
It marks an important
step in returning American

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.736
astronauts to the moon for
the first time since 1972

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.639
for long-term
exploration and use.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.143
This time, we will not
only plant our flag and

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.846
leave our footprint,
we will establish a

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.282
foundation for an
eventual mission to Mars.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:00.019
And perhaps, someday,
to many worlds beyond.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.289
This directive will ensure
America's space program

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.227
once again leads and
inspires all of humanity.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:10.864
The pioneer spirit has
always defined America,

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.832
and we're picking that
up in many other fields.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.733
I think you see that.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:14.634
I think it's obvious.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.469
All you have to do is look
at what's happening with

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.239
the markets and all of
the great things that

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.406
are happening.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.308
We're leading in many
different fields again,

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.310
and it'll get more and
more obvious as

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.979
you go along.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.515
After braving the vast
unknown and discovering

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.985
the new world, our
forefathers did not only

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.122
merely sail home -- and,
in some cases,

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.824
never to return.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.893
They stayed, they
explored, they built, they

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:43.196
guided, and through that
pioneering spirit, they

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.832
imagined all of the
possibilities that few

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:46.833
dared to dream.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.404
Today, the same spirit
beckons us to begin new

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.908
journeys of exploration
and discovery, to lift our

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.343
eyes all the way up to the
heavens, and once again

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.747
imagine the possibilities
waiting in those big,

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.918
beautiful stars if
we dare to dream big.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.587
And that's what our
country is doing again:

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.755
We're dreaming big.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:14.027
This is a giant step
toward that inspiring

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.131
future and toward
reclaiming America's proud

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.066
destiny in space.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:23.002
And space has so much
to do with so many other

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:26.773
applications, including
a military application.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.975
So we are the leader and
we're going to stay the

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.344
leader, and we're going
to increase it many-fold

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.314
I'd like to invite Vice
President Pence, if he

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.481
would, to say a few words.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.850
He's been leading this for
me and I appreciate it.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.885
Mr. Vice President.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:43.890
The Vice President:
Mr. President, thank you.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.764
Thank you for your
leadership and thank you

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:56.402
for the honor to be here
today in my capacity as

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.339
chairman of the National
Space Council for what I

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.075
believe is a momentous
occasion in the history of

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.278
American space
exploration.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.313
To all the extraordinary
leaders who are gathered

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:10.216
with us today, to members
of Congress, and the

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:14.153
pioneers of space
exploration who are

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.123
gathered here,
we thank you.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.192
We thank you for all
you've done to serve our

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.760
nation and expand
the horizons of human

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.730
knowledge and advance
American leadership in

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.498
outer space.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.867
Mr. President, in
signing this space policy

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.504
directive, you are
ensuring that America will

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:35.108
lead in space once again.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.311
To guide this new era of
American space leadership,

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.113
President Trump has
relaunched the National

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.714
Space Council.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.383
And at the Council's
inaugural meeting in

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.719
October, we unanimously
approved a recommendation

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.657
to instruct NASA to return
American astronauts to the

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:54.427
moon, and from there to
lay a foundation for a

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.628
mission to Mars.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.864
Today's action by
President Trump makes that

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.234
recommendation official
national policy for the

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.836
United States of America.

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.872
As everyone here knows,
establishing a renewed

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.242
American presence on the
moon is vital to achieve

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.711
our strategic objectives
and the objectives

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.681
outlined by our
National Space Council.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.784
In pursuing these
objectives, Mr. President,

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:20.053
we will, as you said,
enhance our national

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:22.789
security and our capacity
to provide for the common

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.258
defense of the people
of the United States

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.759
of America.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.629
We will also spur
innovation, as the space

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.831
program has always
done, Mr. President.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.701
You've reflected on it
often, and we'll see jobs

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.703
created that we couldn't
even imagine could be

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.471
created today.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.007
We'll also ensure, lastly,
that the rules and values

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.777
of space exploration are
written with American

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.447
leadership and
American values.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:52.351
Mr. President, you've said
that the pioneer spirit

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:55.188
has always
defined America.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.691
And by your action today,
with this clear vision --

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:02.762
returning Americans to the
moon, preparing to lead to

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:07.667
Mars and beyond -- you're
ensuring, Mr. President,

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:12.138
that America will lead in
space in the future and

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.906
for generations to come.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.808
And I thank you for the
honor of being a

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.243
part of this.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.916
The President: This is
very exciting and very

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.519
important for our country.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.756
And it also happens
to mean jobs.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.290
Jobs.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.658
And we love
jobs too, right?

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.495
Congratulations.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:49.342
(The directive is signed.)

00:06:49.342 --> 00:07:04.023
(applause)

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.661
The President: Thank
you, everybody.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.497
Thank you very much.
