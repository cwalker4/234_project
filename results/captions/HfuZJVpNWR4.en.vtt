Reviewer: Queenie Lee

00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:12.459
The term "darknet" was coined in the 70s,

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.714
and it was meant as a way

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.644
to describe networks
isolated from ARPANET.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:21.046
ARPANET eventually
became the commercial internet

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.807
run by the private telecoms
we all use today.

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:28.913
ARPANET was created
by the US Department of Defense,

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:30.771
and it was created to share data

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:33.353
about their projects
in research laboratories,

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:34.738
with the universities.

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:37.461
And for those of you
familiar with networking,

00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:39.535
it was a first packet-switching Network,

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:43.105
which is the foundation
to modern networking.

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.773
Now, we're not talking about
the World Wide Web here.

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:51.283
That didn't show up until 1990,

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:55.974
when Tim Berners-Lee set up
the first web server at CERN.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.059
The internet is a massive
piece of hardware.

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.358
It enables communication instantly,

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:05.468
on a global scale.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:07.625
[He's lying; it's totally
a series of tubes.]

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.035
(Laughter)

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.655
[It's absolutely massive.]

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:18.666
And in fact, there are hundreds
of cables spanning the ocean

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.915
along with ground-
to-satellite communication

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.055
and radio-to-radio communication,

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:27.946
just to make this thing work.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.923
I like to tell people
I circumnavigated the globe once,

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:33.873
and I start with that

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:36.696
because it sounds a lot cooler
than it actually is.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.169
What I did was to set up
a bunch of virtual servers

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.380
around the world, running Netcat.

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.845
And I cloned the left
computer's hard drive

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:49.117
to the right computer

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:51.925
by streaming the data through the tunnel.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:54.965
And it's so awesome
that that works at all.

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.551
But I feel like people
have ruined this for us.

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.386
They've ruined it with spying
and surveillance.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.818
And there's a constant need
to watch everything we do.

00:02:08.418 --> 00:02:10.513
So a lot of us are scared

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:16.264
to read a certain page on the internet
or maybe download a publication

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:19.802
that's a little too leftist
or rightist in content.

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.282
And my hope is,
darknets help solve this problem.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.541
So I'm going to explore
and share a couple with you here today.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:34.250
When it comes to darknets,
there are a couple different types.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.515
Historically, they were meant
to be private file-sharing networks

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:42.155
but these days they're dynamic pages

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:47.219
rich with media content
and pictures and videos,

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.733
so they're already familiar to us.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:52.793
With darknets, some are peer to peer,

00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:54.890
some are centralized,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.985
but most are going
for a decentralized model,

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:01.109
and we're looking for
specific types of philosophy

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.105
when we consider whether or not
our network is a darknet.

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:06.951
We're looking for take-down resistance:

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:09.958
that is the government,
or anyone else for that matter,

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.320
can't just come in, unplug the thing

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.988
and watch it disappear.

00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:16.234
We're looking for anonymity,

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:20.695
so nobody knows who's reading,
uploading, or creating content.

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:23.515
And content-richness,

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:27.642
because if there's nothing
to see or read, or it all sucks,

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:31.027
then really what's the point
of even having a darknet?

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.272
Turns out they're pretty useful.

00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:37.539
And they've been used
for political safe-haven,

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:42.494
journalism, piracy, black markets,

00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:44.972
but most importantly, at least to me,

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:46.224
privacy.

00:03:47.024 --> 00:03:49.731
You've all heard
of the Silk Road, I'm sure.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:53.691
Well, the Silk Road was running
on a network known as "Tor."

00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:59.112
Tor is a node-based,
decentralized anonymity network.

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:02.565
It was initially researched
by the US Naval Research Laboratory,

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:05.855
and has been since handed over to a 501c3

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:07.393
known as the Tor project.

00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:12.050
Around 80% of their budget
still comes from the US government,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.059
and the rest of it from private
donors and even other governments.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:21.825
Tor made its way into the public's hands
because that's the only way it could work.

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:24.135
It would be completely pointless

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.103
if every request the Navy
wanted to make anonymously

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:29.137
came from a Navy controlled network.

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:32.429
So I like to think that they
created Kansas City Shuffle,

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:36.275
where they just dropped this thing
into the public's hands

00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:40.071
and everybody went buck-wild with it.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.689
So while everybody's looking left,
at headlines about the Silk Road,

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.479
and drugs, and guns,
and all the bad stuff,

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.623
the Navy's going right
and blowing shit up.

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.360
Tor works by having relay and exit nodes.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.291
A node is just a computer
running Tor software,

00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:00.624
and a relay node takes a request,

00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:02.676
peels off a layer of encryption

00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:05.304
and hands it off
to the next node in the route,

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.125
still encrypted.

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.453
An exit node takes
a now unencrypted request

00:05:09.453 --> 00:05:12.816
when it reaches through
the end of the route,

00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:17.895
and makes the call to Google.com
or whatever you're trying to access,

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:22.269
and the response comes back
and everything happens in reverse

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:25.836
until the content is displayed
in the Tor browser.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:34.570
Tor is cool because it lets
you browse the normal internet

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.416
along with these things
called "hidden services,"

00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:39.259
unlike other darknet-like software

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.104
where you pretty much just have
what the network provides to people,

00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:46.138
what people can upload and whatnot.

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:49.412
Hidden services are like normal websites;

00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:51.319
they're dynamic in nature,

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.348
but you access them
with a ".onion" address.

00:05:54.348 --> 00:05:59.205
And the .onion address is like
a normal domain but less memorable.

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:03.819
Because it's a bunch of random
characters followed by ".onion."

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.617
So you don't really just say

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:09.928
"Hey, I'm going to go to xyz409.onion,"

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:13.302
you're going to use
a search service and find it.

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:16.662
So, that could be a hurdle to some people.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.790
These sites are really
the darknet side to Tor

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.714
and are often referred
to as "the Deepweb."

00:06:27.304 --> 00:06:29.699
So, we're going to explore Tor,

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.748
and here's the first screen you get
when you launch the Tor browser.

00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:37.588
The Tor browser comes
in "the Tor browser bundle,"

00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:39.749
and it's a nice, neat package.

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.148
And I love that they did this

00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:44.233
because nobody's going
to use this stuff if it's hard.

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.591
This is something familiar.

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:50.092
This is Firefox, but kind of
configured in a way to use Tor.

00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:52.047
This is the first screen you get - green.

00:06:52.047 --> 00:06:54.073
It says we're connected
to the Tor network,

00:06:54.073 --> 00:06:56.679
and if it was red,
you should stop right there

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:00.569
because you're not anonymous,
and you're going to do something stupid.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.749
Trust me, you're going
to do something stupid.

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.012
(Laughter)

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:07.225
This is an example of me
using a service called

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:08.269
"DuckDuckGo."

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.790
A lot of you probably
started to hear about this

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.740
because it's an alternative to Google,
kind of gaining popularity.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.668
And I'm searching for "Tails,"

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:20.920
and Tails is an incognito live system.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.019
So, it runs Tor and is very relevant here.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:28.889
I'm getting to the download page,
and I'm going to download Tails on Tor,

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.818
so nobody knows I'm downloading Tails.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.814
Here's an example
of the Washington Post SecureDrop.

00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:37.454
"SecureDrops" are these things

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:41.311
that news organizations are starting
to add to their websites

00:07:42.181 --> 00:07:45.125
that allow people to connect to Tor,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:46.843
go to an Onion address,

00:07:46.843 --> 00:07:52.219
and deliver some papers
or maybe some intel to journalists.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.855
Here's an example
of a .onion search service.

00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:03.165
You search for a term,
and you get some results back.

00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:05.209
So here I searched for "black market."

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:07.838
And I've clicked on a link.

00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:09.512
I put this in here

00:08:09.512 --> 00:08:14.586
because this is a good example
of things not being taken down on Tor.

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:17.543
Yes, the Silk Road got taken down,

00:08:17.543 --> 00:08:20.588
but it's very rare,
and it was their own fault.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.542
So, here you can spend
Bitcoin on assault weapons.

00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:30.474
And here are some of the ways
that they concealed it.

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:34.377
Here's a social network.

00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:36.756
It's a really boring social network;

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:38.025
don't get excited.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.689
But I put this in here

00:08:39.689 --> 00:08:43.245
because the registration page
is really interesting.

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:44.743
It specifically says:

00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:47.557
"No child porn. No porn. No hate speech,"

00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:49.597
and "No commercial activities."

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:53.041
And this is a great example
of the community that you get on Tor.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:54.662
They want privacy,

00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:58.394
and there's a lot of trying
to keep the thing clean

00:08:58.394 --> 00:09:00.544
and safe for people to use.

00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:05.005
Here's an example of me logging in.
There's a stream.

00:09:06.073 --> 00:09:09.047
And I put this in here
because this is the first question I get

00:09:09.047 --> 00:09:12.001
whenever I talk about
the Deepweb to somebody.

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.561
They say, "Can I buy a hitman?"

00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:15.800
(Laughter)

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.781
And I'm like, "I'm showing you this thing
that makes you anonymous on the internet,

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:21.683
and you ask me about a hitman.

00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:23.734
That's the first thing you ask me."

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:32.034
Here's Aphex Twins announcing
their new album on a hidden service.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.739
Here's an example of something you should
not be doing on Tor, and it's Facebook.

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:41.633
It's because their terms of service
are very antipseudonym.

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:44.527
So it's just inherently a bad idea.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.855
Same with LinkedIn, antipseudonym -

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:50.789
you are who you legally are;

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:55.585
therefore, you should not be using
an anonymization service.

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:59.617
And here's something
that's maybe okay, and that's Twitter.

00:09:59.617 --> 00:10:01.868
I see a lot of people
using Twitter anonymously.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:05.484
I haven't read the terms of service
so I'm not sure if that's okay or not.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.068
Tor is great.

00:10:08.068 --> 00:10:10.513
My experience with Tor
has been very pleasant.

00:10:10.513 --> 00:10:15.072
The network is actually pretty fast,
contrary to popular belief.

00:10:15.893 --> 00:10:17.227
And a lot of people use it.

00:10:17.227 --> 00:10:18.931
Edward Snowden used it

00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.489
to upload documents
to journalists about the NSA files.

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:27.332
And it was used during the Arab Spring,

00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:29.967
in 2011 Iran protests.

00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:33.006
I also looked at Freenet.

00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:37.949
Freenet is a decentralized,
peer-to-peer file sharing network.

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:43.293
It's similar to BitTorrent
but everything's encrypted,

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.717
so it's really hard
to detect Freenet traffic.

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:51.553
And you share your hard-drive space
and some bandwidth with the network,

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:55.784
and it basically stores things
on your hard-drive.

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:56.784
They're encrypted,

00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:00.554
so you're not really held accountable
for what you're serving up to the network,

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:03.525
and you can be serving
some pretty shocking things.

00:11:04.687 --> 00:11:07.213
They have these things called
"Freesites" and "Flogs."

00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:09.643
They are static; they're not dynamic.

00:11:09.643 --> 00:11:12.888
So people have to re-upload the content
over and over and over again.

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:14.896
So things kind of go out of date.

00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:18.404
The last Flog that I saw updated
was in like 2011.

00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:20.572
So we're going to take a look at Freenet.

00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:25.184
Here's the first thing you see
when you first install it,

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:28.714
and I don't like that, because it
is a setup screen, and nobody likes that.

00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:30.549
Nobody likes setup screens.

00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:31.988
Here's another setup screen.

00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:32.895
More setup.

00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:35.326
Now you have to choose
which security mode you want.

00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:38.946
And you're like: "I want high security,
but I have no friends using Freenet."

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:44.327
Here's a browser advisory telling you
not to browse in non-incognito mode.

00:11:44.868 --> 00:11:49.780
Data store size, bandwidth limits,
more setup. It's just setup.

00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.242
And here's the first page that you get to.

00:11:52.242 --> 00:11:53.942
It's confusing already.

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:56.599
And here's an index page;
finally, I'm in an index page.

00:11:56.599 --> 00:12:00.117
And I scroll through this thing,
and I can't find anything that I want.

00:12:00.523 --> 00:12:02.634
So I get another index page.

00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:05.474
I download this one,
and now I have a virus on my computer.

00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:06.609
(Laughter)

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:10.371
Here's an index page
that's just offering me a bunch of porn.

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:12.737
Here's a cleaned up index page;

00:12:12.737 --> 00:12:14.140
ah, finally.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.319
I've found the links I'm looking for.

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.133
Freenet is slow and hard to use.

00:12:19.133 --> 00:12:25.620
I put it in here because it's a good
example of a different type of darknet.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:29.871
It's harder to use and I don't think
it's the right direction.

00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:32.213
But it exists.

00:12:33.813 --> 00:12:36.152
How many of you read
Linux Journal or Boing Boing?

00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:38.763
I see a couple hands.

00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:40.363
You're all extremists.

00:12:40.363 --> 00:12:41.999
(Laughter)

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:45.660
Darknets are very important
and have played an important role

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:52.034
in uprisings, journalism overseas,
and in states of political turmoil.

00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:53.576
They're pretty useful.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.787
They became especially useful
after the Snowden leaks of 2013.

00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:03.415
Specifically, because
of what the files contained.

00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:09.462
That is, according
to the XKeyscore system,

00:13:09.462 --> 00:13:13.165
Linux Journal and Boing Boing
are extremist forums,

00:13:13.165 --> 00:13:15.680
and will make you
a target for surveillance

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.952
if you visit certain links to those sites.

00:13:18.952 --> 00:13:22.389
So it's safe to say - if you're
unfamiliar with XKeyscore,

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:28.033
it's an SA program designed to help
analysts pick targets for surveillance

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:32.867
by searching for keywords
such as emails, emails body content,

00:13:32.867 --> 00:13:36.875
and other types of data collected as part
of its broad data-collection activities.

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.144
So it's safe to say that I do
a lot of reading on Tor.

00:13:40.144 --> 00:13:42.431
And it's because - 
I don't know about you all -

00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.234
I don't want to feel like I've done
something wrong doing research.

00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:51.038
And I just don't want to feel judged
in general while I'm on the internet.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:58.230
So, I hope this got you as excited as I am
about darknets and the deepweb.

00:13:58.764 --> 00:14:02.948
And there's a lot more than this
to learn and explore as well.

00:14:02.948 --> 00:14:05.493
But I'll leave you with this:

00:14:05.493 --> 00:14:10.479
Darknets are an important piece
to surviving a surveillance state.

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:13.426
And the past a year and a half
has made it very clear

00:14:13.426 --> 00:14:16.248
that the entire world is living
in a surveillance state.

00:14:16.248 --> 00:14:17.599
Thank you.

00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:19.572
(Applause)
