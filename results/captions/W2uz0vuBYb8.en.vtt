00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.990
GUEST: I think it's a bodhisattva, it's a
figure of the Buddha, and this is a repose

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.990
position.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.210
It has gilt, but it's worn off.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.800
There's a missing arm.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370
I thought it was so beautiful, I didn't mind
the damage.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.460
I almost didn't have a chance to acquire it,
because I was having 15 people for lunch.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.310
There was a local person who was a colorful
character in Kirkwood, so I really wanted

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.899
to get to his garage sale.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.869
I rushed out and the dealers had been there
for two days before, so I thought everything

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.640
good would be gone, but when I saw this, I
thought it was so beautiful, I just grabbed

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640
it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.940
APPRAISER: May I inquire what you paid for
it?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.540
GUEST: Probably between $75 and $100, which
was a lot for me.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.830
It was about 20 years ago.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.120
APPRAISER: Well, it is interesting that it
was omitted from consideration by the dealers

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120
for two days.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.810
This, in fact, is a gilt bronze figure.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.510
Beautifully seated, Wenshu, bodhisattva of
insight.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.910
Beautiful drapery, there's ribbon work.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.870
Very fine, reticulated hands.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.830
Wonderful rope and jewelry work.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.219
The rolled fly whisk is beautifully cast,
and there is Rubenesque, or a chubby quality

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.850
to the face, which is indicative of the age
and period.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.710
It's a beautiful face of compassion.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.340
Slightly down-tilted.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.670
Looking at the figure, there are some features
of early bodhisattvas.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.130
A truncated, or, for want of a better word,
skinny waist.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.069
The jeweled chest.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.829
The very deep and fine drapery of the robe,
and seated in Royal Ease.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.280
And Royal Ease is really a characteristic
of very early Buddhist art.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.159
The dating would be approximately early 15th
century, or early Ming Dynasty.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.770
The consensus is that it did have a base.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.399
The base that is often associated and cast
with these objects is a post, and then a similar,

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.329
conforming lotus base.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.649
So it's raised, it's revered, it's elevated,
as a Buddha should be.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.920
The quality of this Buddha is so fine, the
age is such a Golden Age of Buddhist art,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.670
that we would not be surprised if the original
base had an inscription, and that it's possible

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.240
that that base may have had an imperial inscription.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.320
GUEST: Oh, really?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.690
APPRAISER: It would be very, very difficult
to prove that it was for the imperial household

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.080
or from an imperial workshop, as there's no
inscription.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.470
I think those who understand Buddhist works
of art from that period would look at this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.470
object and say it's beyond a very wealthy
patron's quality of bronze.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.490
So it's likely that the quality would indicate
that it's an imperial piece.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.760
GUEST: Do you think it's Chinese?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.820
APPRAISER: It is Chinese.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.710
GUEST: Okay, that's what I, that's what I
thought.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.840
APPRAISER: It's of no real consequence that
the gilding is gone.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.090
We would be shocked and suspicious if the
gilding was there.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.280
Yes, you're missing a hand.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.320
Yes, you're missing an arm.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.790
These are old objects.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.150
These are somewhat fragile objects.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.960
Although bronze is hearty, it is brittle.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.960
Objects get dropped.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.030
They're detached.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.330
Any idea what it may be worth in today's market
after what I've said?

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.260
GUEST: To me, it was worth $100 or whatever
I paid, so I didn't really care.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.890
APPRAISER: A very conservative retail price
would be $100,000 to $125,000.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.160
GUEST: (quietly) Really?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.650
Are you really serious?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.060
(laughing) Oh, my goodness.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.100
I can't believe it.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.830
APPRAISER: It's a wonderful object.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.640
GUEST: Well-- my goodness.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.500
(laughing) I can't believe it.
