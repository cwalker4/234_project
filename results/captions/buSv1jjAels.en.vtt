00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.999
GOOD EVENING EVERYONE.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.999
MY NAME IS JOE WONG.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.999
BUT, TO MOST PEOPLE I AM KNOWN
4
00:00:14,000 --&gt; 00:00:13,999

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
[LAUGHTER]
6
00:00:24,000 --&gt; 00:00:23,999
WHO IS ACTUALLY MY MOTHER'S

00:00:24,000 --&gt; 00:00:23,999
MAIDEN NAME.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.999
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SIDE AND I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.999
WANT TO REASSURE EVERYBODY THAT
14
00:00:44,000 --&gt; 00:00:43,999
I AM INVITED HERE TONIGHT.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[LAUGHTER]
16
00:00:52,000 --&gt; 00:00:51,999
I GREW UP IN CHINA, WHO DIDN'T?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.999
MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ARE
19
00:01:03,000 --&gt; 00:01:02,999
TOTALLY RUINED BY MY CHILDHOOD.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.999
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.999
AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM, I HAD

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.999
TO WORK IN A RICE PADDY RIGHT

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.999
NEXT TO A QUARRY WHERE THEY USED

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.999
EXPLOSIVE TO BREAK ROCKS.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.999
AND THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED THAT
27
00:01:27,000 --&gt; 00:01:26,999
LIGHT TRAVELS FASTER THAN SOUND.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.999
WHICH IS ALMOST AS SLOW AS A
30
00:01:34,000 --&gt; 00:01:33,999
FLYING ROCK.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.999
MY DAD WAS A GRUMPY GUY BUT

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.999
OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD TRY TO

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.999
CHEER ME UP WITH JOKES.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.999
BUT HE DOESN'T DO IT RIGHT.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
WHEN I WAS SEVEN 71 DAY HE SAID

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.999
TO ME, HERE SON, WHY IS TOFU

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.999
BETTER THAN CENTRALIZED
39
00:01:56,000 --&gt; 00:01:55,999
SOCIALIST ECONOMY?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.999
SO FIVE MINUTES LATER I SAID,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.999
WHY?
43
00:02:07,000 --&gt; 00:02:06,999
HE SAID BECAUSE I SAID SO.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.999
I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.999
I WAS 24 TO STUDY AT RICE
47
00:02:20,000 --&gt; 00:02:19,999

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.999
[APPLAUSE]
49
00:02:24,000 --&gt; 00:02:23,999
THAT WASN'T A JOKE.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.999
UNTIL NOW.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.999
AND I WAS USED TO SEEING CARS

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.999
WITH A LOT OF BUMPER STICKERS
54
00:02:40,000 --&gt; 00:02:39,999
THAT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO PEEL

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.999
OFF.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.999
ONE OF THEM SAID, IF YOU DON'T
57
00:02:44,000 --&gt; 00:02:43,999
SPEAK ENGLISH, GO HOME.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.999
AND I DIDN'T NOTICE FOR TWO
60
00:02:50,000 --&gt; 00:02:49,999
YEARS.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.999
LIKE MANY OTHER IMMIGRANTS, WE

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.999
WANTED OUR SON TO BECOME THE

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.999
PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.999
TRY TRIED TO MAKE HIM A LINGUAL,

THE PUBLIC WHICH IS REALLY TOUGH

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.999

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.999
SAID TO HIM IN PUBLIC, HEY

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.999
HE WOULD SAY TO ME HEY DAD, WHY

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.999
DO I HAVE TO LEARN TWO

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.999
LANGUAGES?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.999
I SAID SUN, ONCE YOU BECOME THE

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.999
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.999
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SIGN

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.999
WHEN I GRADUATED FROM RICE I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.999
DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNITED

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.999
STATES, BECAUSE IN CHINA I CAN'T

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.999
DO THAT THING THE THING I DO
87
00:04:06,000 --&gt; 00:04:05,999
BEST HERE, BEING ETHNIC.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.999
AND IN ORDER FOR ME TO BECOME A

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.999
U.S. CITIZEN I HAD TO TAKE

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.999
AMERICAN HISTORY LESSONS, WHERE

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.999
THEY ASKED US QUESTIONS LIKE,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.999
WHO IS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
WE ARE LIKE, THE REASON OUR
95
00:04:33,000 --&gt; 00:04:32,999
CONVENIENCE STORE WAS DEVELOPED.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.999
WHAT WAS THE SECOND AMENDMENT?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.999

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.999
WHAT IS ROE VERSUS WADE?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.999
TWO WAYS OF COMING TO THE UNITED
103
00:05:07,000 --&gt; 00:05:06,999

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.999
LATER ON, I READ SO MUCH ABOUT

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.999
AMERICAN HISTORY THAT I STARTED
107
00:05:24,000 --&gt; 00:05:23,999

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.999
IN AMERICA THEY SAY ALL MEN ARE

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.999
CREATED EQUAL BUT AFTER BIRTH,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.999
IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE

PARENTS INCOME OR EDUCATION OR

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.999
I READ IN MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.999
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA EVERY WEEK

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.999
HAS TWO CARDIO DAYS AND TWO

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.999
WEIGHTLIFTING DAYS.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.999
YOU SEE I DON'T HAVE TO EXERCISE

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.999
I LIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS NOW,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.999
WHERE WE HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.999

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.999
I THINK THERE WAS A MOVIE ABOUT

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.999
HIM.
130
00:06:20,000 --&gt; 00:06:19,999
IT IS CALLED KILL BILL.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.999
I AM HONORED TO MEET VICE

TODAY I SEE YOU.
137
00:06:43,000 --&gt; 00:06:42,999

[LAUGHTER]

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.999

ANGELINA JOLIE.

[LAUGHTER]

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.999
SO TO BE HONEST I WAS HONORED TO

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.999
SHOW.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.999
I SHOWED MY WIFE -- MATT THE

WHITE HOUSE BY JOKES ABOUT OBAMA

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
AND THAT IS WHY HE DECIDED NOT

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
TO COME.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.999
TAKE THAT STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.999
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.999
ACCUSED OF BEING TOO SOFT, BUT

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.999
HE WAS CONDUCTING TWO WARS AND

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.999
THEY STILL GAVE HIM THE NOBEL

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.999
PEACE PRIZE.
157
00:07:41,000 --&gt; 00:07:40,999
AND HE ACCEPTED IT.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
[LAUGHTER]
159
00:07:50,000 --&gt; 00:07:49,999
YOU CAN'T BE MORE BAD THAN THAT.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.999
ACTUALLY, I AM THINKING THE ONLY

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.999
WAY YOU CAN BE MORE BAD THAN

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.999
THAT IS IF YOU TAKE THE NOBEL

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.999
PEACE PRIZE MONEY AND GIVE IT TO
165
00:08:07,000 --&gt; 00:08:06,999
THE MILITARY.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[LAUGHTER]
167
00:08:16,000 --&gt; 00:08:15,999

I THINK JOURNALISM IS THE LAST

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.999
REFUGE FOR PUNS.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.999

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.999
BIDEN ELECTED, I FELT THIS POWER

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.999
TRIP.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.999
AND I STARTED TO THINK, MAYBE I

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.999
SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT MYSELF.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.999
I HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.999
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE I

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.999
HAD ALWAYS BEEN A PESSIMISTIC

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.999
GUY.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.999
I FELT THAT LIFE IS KIND OF LIKE

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.999
BEING INTO THE SNOW ON A DARK

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.999
WINTER NIGHT.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.999
YOU PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE
223
00:11:01,000 --&gt; 00:11:00,999
BUT IT IS REALLY HARD TO TELL.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.999
NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.999
HALF BLACK, HALF WHITE.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.999
IT JUST GIVES ME A LOT OF HOPE

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.999
BECAUSE I AM HALF NOT LACK IN
229
00:11:19,000 --&gt; 00:11:18,999
HALF NOT WHITE.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.999
TWO NEGATIVES MAKE A POSITIVE.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.999
YOU MAY BE SAYING HEY, WHAT

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.999
WOULD BE YOUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.999
YOU SEE, I SPENT 10 YEARS IN THE
235
00:11:40,000 --&gt; 00:11:39,999
PAST DECADE.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.999
[LAUGHTER]
237
00:11:45,000 --&gt; 00:11:44,999
U2?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.999
OKAY.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.999
I UNDERSTAND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.999
ARE SUFFERING, SO MY CAMPAIGN
241
00:11:53,000 --&gt; 00:11:52,999
SLOGAN WILL BE, WHO CARES?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.999
IF ELECTED I WILL MAKE SAME-SEX

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.999
MARRIAGE NOT ONLY LEGAL BUT
245
00:12:10,000 --&gt; 00:12:09,999
REQUIRED.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.999
THAT WILL GET ME THE YOUTH VOTE.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.999
YOU SEE I AM MARRIED NOW BUT I
249
00:12:22,000 --&gt; 00:12:21,999
USED TO BE REALLY SCARED ABOUT

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.999
MARRIAGE.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.999
I WAS LIKE WOW, 50% OF ALL

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.999
MARRIAGES END UP LASTING
253
00:12:30,000 --&gt; 00:12:29,999
FOREVER.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.999
AND I WILL ELIMINATE

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.999
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY BY

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.999
REDUCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.999
AMERICAN WORKFORCE.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.999
SO, TO PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO DO

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.999
THE WORK OF ONE, JUST LIKE THE

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.999
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE
262
00:12:54,000 --&gt; 00:12:53,999
PRESIDENT.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.999
[LAUGHTER]
264
00:12:59,000 --&gt; 00:12:58,999
OR THE OLSEN TWINS.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.999
AND DESPITE OUR DISEASE OF

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.999
CANCER, MOST AMERICANS DIE OF

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.999
NATURAL CAUSES, SO IF ELECTED, I

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.999
WILL FIND A CURE FOR NATURAL
270
00:13:15,000 --&gt; 00:13:14,999
CAUSES.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.999
YOU SEEMED TO LIKE THAT ONE.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.999
BUT YOU WON'T BE COVERED BY

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.999
HEALTH INSURANCE THOUGH.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.999
BECAUSE OF PREEXISTING

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.999
CONDITIONS.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.999
AND I HAVE A QUICK SOLUTION FOR

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.999
GLOBAL WARMING.
279
00:13:42,000 --&gt; 00:13:41,999
I WILL SWITCH FROM FAHRENHEIT TO
280
00:13:42,000 --&gt; 00:13:41,999
CELSIUS.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.999
IT WAS 100 DEGREES AND NOW IT IS
283
00:13:52,000 --&gt; 00:13:51,999
40.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.999
AND, I AGREE WITH FOREIGN POLICY

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.999
BECAUSE I AM FROM CHINA AND I
288
00:14:07,000 --&gt; 00:14:06,999
CAN SEE RUSSIA FROM MY BACKYARD.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.999
I BELIEVE THAT UNILATERALISM IS

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.999
TOO EXPENSIVE, AND OPEN DIALOGUE

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
IS TOO SLOW, SO IF ELECTED, I

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.999
WILL GO WITH TEXT MESSAGING.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.999
I WILL TEXT OUR ALLIES JUST TO
295
00:14:32,000 --&gt; 00:14:31,999
SAY HI.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.999
AND TEXT OUR ENEMIES WHEN THEY
298
00:14:39,000 --&gt; 00:14:38,999
ARE DRIVING.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.999
YOU ARE BUILDING A NUCLEAR

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
WEAPON?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.999
BUT YOU WERE DOING IT WRONG, LOL

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.999
I JUST WANT TO THANKED YOU FOR

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.999
