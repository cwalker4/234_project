00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:09.788
So, take a look at these behaviors:

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:11.345
Does Math

00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:13.078
Gets High

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.298
Gets Stressed Out

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.053
And Rocks Out To Music

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:20.446
What's the first that comes to mind?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.846
Does it sound like -

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:23.228
I heard "college," yeah.

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:24.236
(Laughter)

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:26.258
I was thinking more of a teenager.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.130
It does sound like a teenager.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.225
But what if I told you that your skin -

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:33.417
take a look at it,

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.308
that very colorful sheath
covering your body -

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:39.957
that your skin can perform
all of these behaviors.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.632
Now, before I give you the "skinny"
on the teenage-like behavior of skin,

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:52.128
I want to show you how I got to examining
the radical behavior of skin.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:55.909
It started during the economic recession,

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.107
which is where I found myself
in my first job -

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:03.058
an unlikely time for a first job.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:05.549
So how did this happen?

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.555
Well, there was an alarming trend:

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:12.087
There was a rise in skin sensitivity.

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:15.896
And that meant more people
in the dermatologist's office

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:18.511
and more people in the facialist's chair.

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:23.191
And there was a rise in skin conditions
like inflammatory conditions,

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.118
like eczema and psoriasis.

00:01:26.677 --> 00:01:28.538
And we didn't know exactly why,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.537
but a lot of people
in the industry thought

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:33.207
maybe it was the rise in stress;

00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:36.526
maybe it was a lifestyle thing;
maybe it was pollution.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:38.416
But I wanted to know how.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.816
So when I started working
in the skincare industry,

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.079
I asked myself:

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.757
How does something
as globally extreme like the economy,

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:53.326
how does that translate
to something like a skin rash?

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:58.956
You see, I'm a neuroscientist,
and in studying the skin,

00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:02.796
I found that there was just as much
neuroscience in studying the skin

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:05.445
as there was in studying the brain.

00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:08.147
And that was actually surprising to me.

00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:13.838
So I want to show you some stories today
that are going to explain

00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:17.207
how this connection
between the mind and body interact

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:21.078
and hopefully surprise you
with some of the ideas that came about

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:24.209
in understanding the connection
between the brain and the skin.

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:29.786
So I want to share with you first
some examples of the curious ways

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:35.089
in which our minds
are represented on our exterior.

00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:37.649
This is Jack.

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.625
Jack is a veteran pilot.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.528
He has been through it all.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.985
He's been through wind gusts
and locked landing gear.

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:49.433
He can keep his cool
in just about any situation.

00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:53.518
But every time he flies
over a particular canyon,

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:57.708
his forehead breaks out
in herpes blisters,

00:02:57.708 --> 00:03:00.364
every single time
he flies over that canyon.

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:03.919
Naturally, he goes to the doctor,
gets a medicine,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.546
and it treats his symptoms,

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:11.129
but it just keeps coming back
every time he flies over that canyon.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.436
And this is Sophie.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:18.098
Sophie is a senior in high school,
and she's a dancer.

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:22.024
And, of course,
as any senior in high school,

00:03:22.024 --> 00:03:24.829
she's trying to decide
what she's going to do with her life.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.273
"Am I going to go to college?"

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.842
"Will I continue to dance?"

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.227
"Will I dance in college?"

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.277
"What college am I going to go to?"

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.152
So as she battles with her indecision,

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:37.694
she develops a wart
on the bottom of her foot.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:42.019
Of course, like Jack, she goes
to try to get some medical treatment,

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.488
and it does treat the symptoms
here and there,

00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:47.407
but it always comes back.

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:49.077
She can't get rid of this wart.

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:52.545
And in the end, the wart
makes the decision for her.

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:56.437
She can no longer pursue dancing
because of the pain in her foot.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.668
And this is Danny.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.045
Danny is ten years old,

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.856
and he was born with eczema,

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.056
so he was used to the medications,

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:07.402
he was used to the rashes
that came and went,

00:04:07.402 --> 00:04:11.718
but the medications always kept
his skin rashes at bay.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.872
But one day, they stopped working.

00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:18.749
The medicine was no longer good.

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:21.008
The medicine stopped working

00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:25.776
the day his mother
tragically died in a car accident.

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:30.294
Cases like these
are not few and far between.

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.649
In fact, they simply highlight
the interdependence

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:36.385
between our emotional state
and our body state.

00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:41.369
A blush inadvertently
reveals our mind's secrets.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:45.198
Goose bumps warn us
when something is wrong.

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:49.634
And we feel crawling skin
when we're paralyzed with fear.

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:55.518
Our skin has the machinery,
the same machinery as the brain.

00:04:56.932 --> 00:05:00.047
And it's only been a decade or so
of research that shows

00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:04.038
that the skin has the most intricate
and sophisticated systems

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:08.105
that were once under
the sole domain of the brain.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.259
So for instance, the stress axis -

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.220
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis -

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.489
found in our central nervous system
is also found in the skin,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.916
and it's theorized
that this stress pathway

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:31.518
actually evolved in the skin first
to avoid pathogens from entering the skin.

00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:35.556
But stress is more than skin deep.

00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:39.564
You don't have to know
anything about this man

00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:41.873
to know that something happened to him

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:46.675
between the first picture
and the last picture on the right.

00:05:47.845 --> 00:05:52.197
This is a photograph from a series
by photographer Claire Felicie,

00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:54.813
who took picture of Dutch marines

00:05:54.813 --> 00:06:01.164
before, during, and after
deployment to Afghanistan.

00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:06.808
You can see the changes from
the first picture to the last picture,

00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:09.289
and this is only in one year.

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.417
This is not due to the effects
of normal chronological aging.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:21.706
So whether it's war, divorce,
losing your job, any stressful situation,

00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:25.210
this often shows up on our skin first.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:32.138
But we so often dismiss that
as unimportant and superficial.

00:06:33.418 --> 00:06:35.676
And when we miss these cues

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:39.212
that our bodies are desperately
trying to tell us,

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:42.778
it's tantamount to repressing emotion.

00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:47.746
So I want you to close
your eyes for a second

00:06:48.058 --> 00:06:50.905
and imagine that you're blind.

00:06:51.456 --> 00:06:52.508
Okay.

00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:54.148
Now you can open your eyes,

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:56.126
and plug your nose,

00:06:57.787 --> 00:07:00.197
and imagine that you can't smell.

00:07:00.197 --> 00:07:02.787
Okay, I think we can all kind of do that.

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:06.147
Now, sit there with your bottoms
firmly pressed against the chair,

00:07:06.147 --> 00:07:07.849
feet flat on the ground,

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.992
and imagine your can't feel.

00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:13.797
That's pretty tough.

00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:16.996
So what is that?

00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:22.194
Our sense of touch begins in the womb.

00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:25.684
It's nearly impossible to not feel,

00:07:25.684 --> 00:07:27.466
even when you try.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.257
So touch began in the womb;
it's the first sensory system to develop.

00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:40.878
And as psychology has taught us,
Maslow taught us that monkeys,

00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.018
in fact, baby monkeys

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:45.488
preferred mechanical mothers
covered in terry cloth.

00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:50.219
But today we know
that scientific research is showing

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.756
that this particular
mother's touch, this caress,

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:58.048
actually changes
her child's epigenetic programming.

00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:00.502
So that kind of research shows us

00:08:00.502 --> 00:08:02.975
that there has to be
something more to this touch,

00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:05.917
in particular, this gentle touch.

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:08.788
So recently, Swedish neuroscientists

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:12.806
discovered a new set
of nerve fibers in the skin

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:17.806
that respond to only
the most gentle of touches.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.567
To give you a little bit of perspective,

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:26.792
in the body, the nerve impulses
can outrace a Ferrari.

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:31.806
That means they can travel at speeds
faster than 250 miles per hour.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:33.189
That's pretty fast.

00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:38.687
But these touch fibers in the skin,
they're slow, they take their time.

00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:44.007
They travel at a leisurely stroll
of about two miles per hour

00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:45.575
to reach the brain.

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:50.982
And, unlike their quick signals
that reach the somatosensory cortex

00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:56.229
and tell us what we've touched,
the details of what we've touched,

00:08:56.229 --> 00:09:00.089
these slow signals travel
to a different part of the brain

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:02.349
that processes emotions

00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:06.698
and tells us what we feel when we touch.

00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.986
And this part of the brain is called
the posterior insular cortex.

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:16.747
And so we know that this gentle touch

00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:20.077
gives us a sense of who we are,

00:09:20.697 --> 00:09:24.788
and it also gives us a sense
of who we are in the greater world.

00:09:25.588 --> 00:09:28.408
So if you stimulate
another part of the brain

00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:30.427
called the angular gyrus -

00:09:30.947 --> 00:09:34.288
this part of the brain
is also stimulated by gentle touch -

00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:36.454
if you stimulate this in somebody,

00:09:36.454 --> 00:09:41.315
you will trigger an out-of-body
experience in that person.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:44.327
And that means that the gentle touch fiber

00:09:44.327 --> 00:09:49.317
is somehow reflected
in our personal sense of self,

00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:53.477
and our sense of culture
and who we are in the community.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:59.274
And so we wear our culture on our hands.

00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:03.408
And on to my final point -

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.838
and I saved this for last
because I thought it was a cool story.

00:10:09.037 --> 00:10:13.537
So, let me tell you a little bit
about touch and sound.

00:10:14.017 --> 00:10:16.278
The story started about 15 years ago,

00:10:16.278 --> 00:10:21.197
and there was a mixer
for new faculty at Rice University.

00:10:22.285 --> 00:10:24.928
And at Rice University,
there were new faculty,

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:28.598
some of them were from all departments,
and there was a neuroscientist.

00:10:28.598 --> 00:10:33.336
And the neuroscients struck up
a conversation with a philosopher

00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:37.077
about things like
the fallability of science

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:42.109
and the way that the brain 
organizes and orchestrates

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:45.485
all of the flood of sensory information
that goes into the brain

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:47.729
and puts it into a coherent perception.

00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:50.059
You know, simple things like that.

00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:56.717
So it turns out that the philosopher
had suffered a stroke,

00:10:56.996 --> 00:11:02.200
and that had left her
with a strange mixing of her senses.

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:05.146
And at this point,
the neuroscientist said,

00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:08.039
"Yeah, let's look at your brain."

00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:13.498
So in one experiment,
she sat with her hands on the table

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:14.688
and two rings,

00:11:14.688 --> 00:11:17.389
and the rings were dotted with electrodes.

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:21.758
And these electrodes
were transmitting some electrical pulses

00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:24.506
that followed a beep or a tone.

00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:26.747
And she had these
in each of her middle fingers.

00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:28.818
So she had her hands down,

00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:30.633
and she was to hear the tone

00:11:30.633 --> 00:11:33.835
and then feel a little tingle
on either hand.

00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:37.408
And she was to say
which hand she felt the tingle in.

00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:39.687
But here's the rub:

00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:42.687
She kept feeling tingles

00:11:42.687 --> 00:11:46.529
even when they didn't deliver
any electrical shock.

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:52.167
And so, of course, the neuroscientist
was very confused and said,

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:54.578
"We shock; she feels.

00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:57.369
We don't shock; she still feels.

00:11:57.369 --> 00:11:59.015
What is going on?"

00:11:59.297 --> 00:12:03.747
So after a while, and I mean a while,
I think it was over a year,

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.717
he kind of had an idea:

00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:12.287
Could she possibly be reacting to the tone
that came before the shock?

00:12:13.137 --> 00:12:16.708
And so he did another
very scientific experiment.

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:18.857
He simply asked her.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.286
"Do you feel sounds?

00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:26.677
Can you feel and sense sounds?"

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:31.025
And she said, "Oh yeah. All the time.

00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.028
Ever since the stroke."

00:12:33.028 --> 00:12:34.770
(Laughter)

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.258
So, fast forward ten years,

00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:41.208
and Dr. Rowe's research found
that her mixing of senses

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:46.654
was due to the fact that her auditory area
had gone over the somatosensory cortex,

00:12:46.654 --> 00:12:49.076
which was its neighbor in the brain.

00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:52.477
And so her sound
and touch senses were mixed.

00:12:52.858 --> 00:12:57.897
And so that shows us
that, of course, there's brain plasticity,

00:12:57.897 --> 00:13:03.647
but that there's a very deep connection
between sound and touch.

00:13:03.647 --> 00:13:06.776
In fact, some scientists today believe

00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:12.947
that the sense of hearing actually evolved
from the sense of touch.

00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:16.517
Think about the hair cells
in your inner ear.

00:13:17.357 --> 00:13:19.459
So, imagine what it feels like

00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:23.436
to sense so many sounds
in such a loud and busy world.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.449
How did she deal with it?

00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:28.829
Well, she took up the bass guitar.

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:35.807
Because the soft, deep sounds
felt like a massage over her body.

00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:39.408
Not too long ago,

00:13:39.408 --> 00:13:46.407
we thought that the brain function
was hard-wired, localized,

00:13:46.657 --> 00:13:50.496
and that damage to the brain
was pretty much permanent.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.147
We know that's not true today.

00:13:52.147 --> 00:13:57.287
The paradigm shift that occurred
was neuroplasticity in the brain.

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:05.716
And skin is this very thin
and seemingly disposable tissue.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.256
But I want to flip this inside out.

00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:12.308
If the brain has plasticity,
and if the skin is like the brain,

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:15.316
could the skin also have plasticity?

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:18.206
And does that mean
that the skin has untapped potential

00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:20.107
that we are not aware of?

00:14:21.306 --> 00:14:25.701
Could we sense extrasensory
things like infrared through our skin?

00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:29.115
Actually, mouse research
suggests that we can.

00:14:29.398 --> 00:14:35.113
And could we maybe get superhuman hearing
by sending vibrations to our fingertips?

00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:40.277
Forget the Apple watch;
your skin has a clock of its own,

00:14:40.277 --> 00:14:41.976
and it can keep time.

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:46.154
We actually have
an incredible, wearable sensor

00:14:46.154 --> 00:14:48.658
that can tell time,

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:51.487
and it's a shield and a communicator,

00:14:52.678 --> 00:14:54.807
and we don't even know it.

00:14:55.867 --> 00:15:00.491
So, how did these stories end?

00:15:02.957 --> 00:15:05.468
Now, they all came
from different walks of life,

00:15:06.387 --> 00:15:09.758
and they did share one common theme:

00:15:09.758 --> 00:15:14.576
They had one problem that was unresolved.

00:15:14.576 --> 00:15:19.111
So their unresolved emotion
led to something on the skin.

00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:22.846
And fortunately for these people,
who are real people, by the way,

00:15:22.846 --> 00:15:23.879
they're patients,

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:27.698
some of them are patients
of a psychologist in Boston,

00:15:28.587 --> 00:15:31.537
Jack, for example,
went to see a hypnotherapist.

00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:36.909
And in that, he revealed that his friend
had actually died in that canyon.

00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:38.428
But his friend was a pilot,

00:15:38.428 --> 00:15:42.054
and Jack was supposed to be
the one flying that day,

00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:43.747
but he called in sick,

00:15:43.747 --> 00:15:46.478
and instead his friend
flew over that canyon,

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.348
and he died.

00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:51.991
So Jack felt extremely, extremely guilty.

00:15:51.991 --> 00:15:56.455
And it wasn't until he was able
to speak about his feelings in this way

00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:00.212
that his breakouts on his forehead
never came back.

00:16:00.566 --> 00:16:02.757
Sophie also underwent hypnosis

00:16:02.757 --> 00:16:05.648
and revealed that her wart
had been giving voice to something

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:07.737
that she was afraid to do herself,

00:16:07.737 --> 00:16:10.650
which was to say,
"I no longer want to dance."

00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:16.497
And after she understood that,
her wart went away for good.

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:20.668
And Danny went to see
a psychodermatologist,

00:16:20.968 --> 00:16:25.728
and he also had
a different form of therapy,

00:16:25.728 --> 00:16:27.117
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:16:27.117 --> 00:16:31.106
and through this he was able to battle
with the fact that his mother had died

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:32.707
and that made his skin worse,

00:16:32.707 --> 00:16:36.797
and after the therapy,
three weeks later, his lesions healed.

00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:41.368
So conventional medicine did not
treat these people in the right way,

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.737
in a way where
they fully, fully recovered.

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:47.579
Conventional medicine
treated the symptoms for a little bit,

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:49.448
but it did nothing for the long term.

00:16:49.448 --> 00:16:52.997
Now, we can continue
to put out little fires here and there,

00:16:52.997 --> 00:16:56.110
but it's not until
you find the source of the problem

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.458
where you can really
get rid of your issue.

00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:03.136
So, I love the idea
of the hummingbird effect.

00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:07.494
The hummingbird effect
is something where an idea in one place

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:12.148
strikes another idea,
completely unrelated sometimes,

00:17:12.148 --> 00:17:14.236
in a totally different field.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:20.937
And in this case, do ideas
and innovations unfold in this matter,

00:17:20.937 --> 00:17:25.303
and if they do, does the idea
that the skin has a brain of its own

00:17:25.303 --> 00:17:26.689
unfold in this way,

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:29.487
and could that trigger
new discoveries in other areas?

00:17:29.487 --> 00:17:33.398
Especially if we know that the skin
could have untapped potential

00:17:33.398 --> 00:17:35.528
that we know nothing about yet.

00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.806
And so imagine how
understanding these discoveries

00:17:38.806 --> 00:17:41.176
could change technology and medicine.

00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:42.437
Twenty years ago,

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:46.255
Dr. Michael Gershon revealed
that there was a brain in the gut.

00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:48.678
Today, if you go to a grocery store,

00:17:48.678 --> 00:17:52.220
difficult to find a grocery store
without probiotic drinks

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.002
or probiotic supplements.

00:17:54.257 --> 00:18:01.197
And today, I'm telling you
that the skin also has a mind of its own.

00:18:01.862 --> 00:18:06.768
And so, for decades we've known
that the brain controls the body,

00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:11.159
but if we now know that the body
greatly influences the mind,

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:12.637
and we see these in cases

00:18:12.637 --> 00:18:17.947
like the person that develops an actual
clinical depression or anxiety

00:18:17.947 --> 00:18:20.188
due to a very visible disorder,

00:18:20.568 --> 00:18:25.537
or the anorexia patient that gets better
after wearing a tight body suit,

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:29.848
or the power one feels
when they're wearing a white lab coat.

00:18:29.848 --> 00:18:32.454
Embodied cognition is not a new idea,

00:18:32.454 --> 00:18:33.955
but it's finally gaining steam

00:18:33.955 --> 00:18:37.734
in ways that doctors and therapists
can finally implement.

00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:40.773
And so many people
live disembodied nowadays.

00:18:40.773 --> 00:18:46.338
They tell you that they
disconnect themselves from the body.

00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:50.986
But when we mind the body,
we know our sense of self.

00:18:51.618 --> 00:18:54.989
And so, as these ideas unfold,

00:18:54.989 --> 00:18:58.858
it'll take some time
for them to reach an everyday life.

00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:01.247
So I want to leave you with this:

00:19:02.268 --> 00:19:05.137
to listen to your skin.

00:19:07.877 --> 00:19:09.110
Thank you.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.078
(Applause)
