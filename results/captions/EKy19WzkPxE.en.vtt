Reviewer: Mile Živković

00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:21.995
I'm 19 years old.

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:27.783
I'm a camp counselor
to northern Minnesota summer camp,

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.808
and I'm on a hayride.

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.796
It's a beautiful night,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.102
and I'm listening in
to the conversation next to me,

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.775
trying to figure out how to break in,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.053
just keeping kind of to myself,

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:46.382
not sure where it was going,
how I could break in.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.494
And just as we're about to turn
into the girls camp to the boys camp,

00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:53.504
which is where we were headed,

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.674
one of the counselors
turns to me, looks at me

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:58.144
and elbows me in the ribs and says,

00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:00.734
"Hey, Joan, you know what?

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.335
You're boring."

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:03.565
(Laughter)

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:05.934
"Whoa!

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:08.837
Boring? What?"

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.804
It felt like she took a fork,
stabbed it in my gut

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.203
and just spun it around.

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:21.057
Now, most of us have our own versions
of those gut-punch moments.

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:26.475
I'm not sure what it is for you,
but that was a big moment for me.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.775
And that moment and a few other
key life experiences

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:35.354
really sparked my interest
to become a psychologist

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:38.156
and to understand what it was

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:42.550
that really helps someone develop
self-esteem and self-confidence.

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:45.970
Across 35 years of research,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.565
tens of thousands of hours
of counseling other individuals

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:54.805
and teaching and supervising,

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:59.066
there was one element
that I remained captivated by

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.529
and still am to this day,

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.504
and it's unpleasant feelings.

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.241
Unpleasant feelings.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:09.524
More than anything else,

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:12.419
what I found is what holds people back

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.358
is their inability or their challenges
with dealing with unpleasant feelings.

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:22.480
Yet, nobody really teaches us what to do
or how to handle them.

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:27.466
It seems so silly, so silly:

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:30.398
I'm excited about unpleasant feelings.

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:31.368
(Laughter)

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:35.324
Who the heck gets excited
about unpleasant feelings?

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:44.882
If you can experience and move
through eight unpleasant feelings,

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.445
you can pursue anything you want in life.

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:50.548
How?

00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:54.784
One choice, 8 feelings, 90 seconds.

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:57.010
It's a simple formula,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:04.137
and it's one my colleagues and clients
affectionately call the Rosenberg reset.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.020
Now, most of us believe

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.169
that our happiness in life comes
from the big choices that we make.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.530
And it's actually not the big choices.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.759
There's a real misconception there.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:20.031
It's the moment-to-moment choices.

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:24.230
Those big choices
we think help us determine

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.679
the degree of our happiness
from a day-to-day basis,

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.220
or our well-being from a day-to-day basis.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.600
Not true.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.732
It's actually the little choices,
the moment-to-moment ones.

00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:39.331
Ponder the moments
that you have denied your feelings

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.144
as opposed to pay attention to them.

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:44.988
It's those that matter.

00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:47.520
That's what's going to free you up.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.740
So, let's unpack the formula.

00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:54.451
One choice:

00:03:55.541 --> 00:04:00.123
Make the choice
to stay present, fully present.

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:06.084
Be aware of and in touch with
your moment-to-moment experience.

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:10.139
It's about awareness, not avoidance.

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:15.332
Think of a time that you've had
a conversation with somebody.

00:04:15.332 --> 00:04:19.772
Perhaps you've been disappointed
in a conversation with your friend,

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:22.697
or with your partner, or your spouse.

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:26.239
And check in with yourself here.

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:28.250
Be gentle.

00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:32.317
Did you do what most of us do?

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:35.506
Did you run? Did you hide?

00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:37.620
Did you shut down?

00:04:38.963 --> 00:04:43.763
Did you distract in really obvious ways,

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:46.576
like, I don't know, food?

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:49.763
Alcohol or drugs?

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:52.867
Sex? Pornography?

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:55.103
Shopping?

00:04:55.103 --> 00:04:56.627
Social media?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.064
Did you distract or escape
in less obvious ways,

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:06.684
like tightening up,
tightening those muscles,

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:10.414
or holding your breath,

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:12.294
or swallowing hard,

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:15.075
just to try to keep those feelings at bay?

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:20.543
Or did you stay fully present,

00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:24.872
aware of and in touch with
your moment-to-moment experience?

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:28.166
That's the best choice,

00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:31.207
except it's your choice.

00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:33.976
You make that one.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.945
My prescription:

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:37.649
stay present,

00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:40.001
stay fully present.

00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:42.708
You can do this.

00:05:43.162 --> 00:05:46.209
In fact, we can all do this.

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:49.221
It just takes a willingness,

00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:51.800
it takes a formula

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:54.623
and it takes a decision.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.330
Let's go to the second step.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.221
The second step has to do with dealing
with eight unpleasant feelings.

00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:07.236
They're the unpleasant 
feelings of sadness,

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:10.138
shame, helplessness,

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:12.399
anger,

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.021
vulnerability, embarrassment,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.566
disappointment and frustration.

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:22.587
Now,

00:06:23.277 --> 00:06:26.247
most of us like to see
those feelings as bad or negative.

00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:28.790
They're not bad or negative.

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:32.687
They're simply unpleasant
and uncomfortable.

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:35.467
So, going forward,

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:38.546
can we make an agreement
that you're going to shift your language

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:41.187
and it's no longer going to be
bad or negative feelings?

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:45.364
They're simply going to be
unpleasant and uncomfortable.

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.448
It's an important shift.

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.359
Why then do we want to avoid
all those feelings?

00:06:55.688 --> 00:06:59.122
Well, we're afraid that,
if they start, they'll never stop,

00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:03.196
or they'll be too intense
and they will overwhelm us,

00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:07.680
or we will lose control
or we'll go out of control.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.542
Except the key here
is why they're also so important.

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:21.807
Why does it matter so much?

00:07:24.207 --> 00:07:30.646
And it matters because our experience
of feeling capable in the world,

00:07:32.208 --> 00:07:35.507
of experiencing emotional strength,

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.588
is directly tied to our capacity

00:07:39.588 --> 00:07:44.212
to both experience and move through
those unpleasant feelings.

00:07:47.078 --> 00:07:48.758
It it all eight at once?

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:50.292
No, it's not.

00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:52.064
It's one or a few at a time.

00:07:52.064 --> 00:07:55.890
Like, we can feel disappointment
and anger at the same time.

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.650
So, again, if you can experience and move
through those eight unpleasant feelings

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.030
of sadness, shame, helplessness, anger,

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.844
vulnerability, embarrassment,
disappointment and frustration,

00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:18.129
then you will experience 
growing confidence

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:20.299
and emotional strength.

00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.362
And what do I mean by this "move through"?

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.077
Well,

00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:30.088
neuroscientists suggest

00:08:30.088 --> 00:08:33.470
that, when an emotional
feeling gets triggered,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.241
chemicals are released by our brain
that flush through our blood stream

00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.987
and they activate bodily sensations.

00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:46.629
It's sort of a biochemical rush,

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:48.631
and then flush.

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:51.718
Let me translate.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.627
And this is super important.

00:08:55.843 --> 00:08:58.411
What we feel emotionally

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:05.734
is felt in the body first,
as a bodily or physical sensation.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.333
It doesn't feel good.

00:09:09.552 --> 00:09:11.180
Let me repeat that.

00:09:11.512 --> 00:09:14.406
What we feel emotionally

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.715
is experienced in the body first,

00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:21.255
as a bodily or physical sensation.

00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:25.097
That's what we want to distract from!

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:27.154
That's what we want to get away from.

00:09:27.154 --> 00:09:30.063
It's not that we don't want to feel
something emotionally.

00:09:30.063 --> 00:09:32.630
We absolutely do want to feel emotionally!

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.092
We want the whole range of feelings.

00:09:35.092 --> 00:09:40.105
We just don't want the bodily sensations
that let us know what we're feeling.

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:45.715
What unpleasant feelings

00:09:46.334 --> 00:09:49.223
might you be moving away from?

00:09:50.835 --> 00:09:53.320
What might be holding you back?

00:09:57.115 --> 00:10:00.807
Stop and notice where you might
experience it in your body.

00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:04.771
And -

00:10:06.858 --> 00:10:10.291
And if there's a time
where you ever said to yourself,

00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:13.973
"I never want to experience that again,"

00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:15.426
it's probably some of those -

00:10:15.426 --> 00:10:18.376
Those feelings are ones to move towards,

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.739
to start to embrace.

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:25.412
For me, it was involved
with that gut-punch.

00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:28.197
Embarrassment was really difficult.

00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:30.481
So was disappointment,

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:32.996
and so was vulnerability.

00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:36.459
But let's get to the solution.

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:39.408
The solution has to do
with riding the wave.

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:44.503
Remember that biochemical rush
I mentioned a few moments ago?

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:49.226
That biochemical rush
we can think of as a wave,

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:54.208
and, when that wave
gets fired off in the body,

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:57.508
it lasts roughly 60 to 90 seconds,

00:10:59.256 --> 00:11:01.571
which means feelings are temporary.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.527
So, from the time
it gets fired off in the brain

00:11:04.527 --> 00:11:08.016
and it goes through our blood stream
and then dissipates:

00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:10.047
60 to 90 seconds.

00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:13.233
You can handle 60 to 90 seconds, right?

00:11:13.698 --> 00:11:16.694
Heck! That's less than half a song!

00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:18.446
(Laughter)

00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:20.730
All of us can do that.

00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:23.665
And if you think of a beach -

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:27.275
Let me draw a parallel:
If you think of a beach,

00:11:27.607 --> 00:11:31.459
then, as you walk along that shoreline,

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:34.668
what you'll notice is that the waves
can come up to tumultuously,

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:38.069
they can come up moderately,
they can come up mildly.

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:40.996
And, if we're walking 
along that shoreline,

00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:46.020
we'll notice that the waves seem
to just hang and linger for a moment,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.975
before they subside.

00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:51.071
And you know what?
That's also true for our feelings.

00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:56.409
They can come up tumultuously,
moderately, mildly,

00:11:56.409 --> 00:11:59.963
and they seem to linger
or hang for a moment,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.266
and then, they always subside.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.923
That's the beauty of it.

00:12:06.435 --> 00:12:08.704
"Always subside."

00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:13.450
Is it one wave?

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.209
No, it's not. It's more than one wave.

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:19.448
Any time we think about the same memory,

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.118
it's going to fire off
that same approximate wave.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.759
And grief?

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:28.184
Grief is waves of waves,

00:12:29.319 --> 00:12:32.350
the feelings of anger,
and sadness, and disappointment

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.191
kind of all mixed together.

00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:38.100
Anybody who's experienced
a significant loss knows this.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.521
Those waves can come up so tumultuously
and unexpectedly or spontaneously,

00:12:43.521 --> 00:12:46.457
and it's like we're just
kind of left with them,

00:12:46.457 --> 00:12:49.821
and they will always subside.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.920
So, the thing again here for you to do

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.035
is to stay present to the experience,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.583
surf those ninety-second waves,
surf them any way you want,

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.508
and just let them ride out their course.

00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:12.602
In the moment,

00:13:12.602 --> 00:13:16.156
you'll feel centered,
you'll feel calm and you'll feel relief.

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:20.790
Insights will follow.

00:13:21.403 --> 00:13:23.864
And, with consistent practice,

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:28.721
you may even be able to unhook
from old-life stories.

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:35.643
I have been the joyful recipient
of countless stories

00:13:35.643 --> 00:13:39.078
of individuals who have
mended relationships,

00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:43.333
who have engaged
in courageous conversations,

00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:48.785
who have pursued goals
that they wanted to pursue.

00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:54.463
And the most important one I think
is when people come back and tell me

00:13:54.463 --> 00:13:58.600
that they feel so much more
comfortable in their own skin.

00:13:59.925 --> 00:14:01.646
That's the benefit.

00:14:04.504 --> 00:14:09.144
I thought when I was called boring
was a low moment in my life.

00:14:10.023 --> 00:14:14.448
It turns out that moment shifted me,

00:14:15.573 --> 00:14:20.918
and it's enabled me
to shift countless thousands of lives.

00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:26.365
So, the next time you experience
unpleasant feelings,

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:30.158
embrace them, join me in the excitement,

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:37.254
know that they are the path back
to you being more fully you.

00:14:38.784 --> 00:14:40.815
Stay present.

00:14:41.575 --> 00:14:43.055
Stay fully present.

00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:45.120
Experience them.

00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:47.770
Surf those waves.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.701
It won't take years.

00:14:51.527 --> 00:14:54.723
It won't even take a day.

00:14:57.857 --> 00:15:01.925
In fact, it will take just a moment.

00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:06.773
Start right now.

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.257
Thank you.

00:15:08.257 --> 00:15:10.015
(Applause)
