00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
- There was a release of
another, I'm going to say

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.274
shocking document.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:11.210
NARRATOR: As extraordinary
as the notion of Forestalls

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:14.781
assassination may seem,
ancient astronaut theorists

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.551
propose that one of the
Majestic 12 documents

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:21.821
points to the assassination
of an even higher level

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:22.522
government official.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.627
WOMAN: The story is that was
supposed to have been destroyed

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.496
and somebody put
it in a fire place,

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.566
and that another
person pulled it out.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.767
MAN: So what does it say?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.503
Top secret MJ12
Central Intelligence

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:43.443
Agency from director of Central
Intelligence Agency MJ1.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.811
Who was that that?

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:50.850
That was Allen Dulles,
68 of 63 under Kennedy.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.318
OK.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:56.722
You must know Lancer
has made some inquiries

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.725
regarding our activities.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.595
And Lancer during the
Kennedy administration

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:06.566
was the Secret Service
name for the president.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.202
This is the head of the CIA--

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.736
MJ1.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.206
Going against the president's
wishes of finding out more.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.808
WOMAN: Which we cannot allow.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.613
Please submit your views
no later than October.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:28.421
If that was in 63, he was dead
one month later in Dallas.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:29.889
ROBERT M. WOOD: The interest
of the scorched memo

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:33.493
is that if JFK keeps
doing what he's doing,

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.497
that he maybe is a problem.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.633
It identifies a number of
actions that could be taken.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.736
One of which, the
last one, implies

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:48.341
that if Washington does not
respond to what they want done,

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.509
it should be wet.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.245
And that's the language
that the soviet

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.847
started to use
for assassination,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.784
because wet is
associated with blood.

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.788
NARRATOR: If the Majestic 12
documents are indeed authentic,

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.925
are they proof that not only
were members of the United

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.928
States government
aware of and in contact

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:13.533
with extraterrestrial beings,
but also that they would

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.536
go to any length to
keep this information

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.505
hidden from the public.

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.675
Former Washington, DC
attorney Douglas Caddy

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:26.946
was a close friend of E. Howard
Hunt, who he represented when

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.383
Hunt was found to be at the
center of the Watergate scandal

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.652
in 1972.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.288
Hunt was an officer
in the CIA when

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.291
John F. Kennedy was president.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.426
Caddy claims that
he asked Howard Hunt

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.562
about the assassination
one night,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:46.365
and received a shocking answer.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:51.504
DOUGLAS CADDY: The last time
I saw Howard Hunt was in 1975.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.574
He called me and said
he'd like to have dinner.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.842
So dinner was finished-- we
went out to the sidewalk.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.278
And I thought, well this may be
the last time I'll see Howard.

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:01.847
He's going away, and I'm
moving from Washington.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.318
And so out of my own curiosity
I said to Howard, why

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.986
was John Kennedy assassinated?

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.921
RECORDING: Something has
happened in the motorcade.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.724
Stand by please.

00:03:11.757 --> 00:03:13.526
DOUGLAS CADDY: And
he said, John Kennedy

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.429
was assassinated because he was
about to give our most vital

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.998
secret to the Soviet Union.

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.600
And I said our
most vital secret?

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.435
I said, what could that be?

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.404
He leaned forward and
looked me in the eyes

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:27.406
and he said the alien presence.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.476
He shook my hand
and walked away.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.347
NARRATOR: If the stories about
the Majestic 12 are true,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.016
and those involved
with a top secret group

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.418
were ready to take
such drastic measures

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:43.856
to keep its existence hidden,
was it ever discontinued?

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.562
Do you think that MJ12 is
still in existence today?

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.631
Well what I've been
told is that they

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:55.768
have changed the
letters and the numbers

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.037
probably more than once.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.373
So it's the same idea.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.707
It's the same control.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.742
Same files.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.343
Same archives.

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:05.845
Same power.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:09.515
If you look at what has
happened in the last 60 years,

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:13.519
it's really possible that
more decisions have been made

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:15.921
in a side of our
government because

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:20.726
of this subject, ET's and
technology than any of us

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.562
would ever know.
