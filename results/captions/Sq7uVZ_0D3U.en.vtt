00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.320
[Rhonda]: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.770
I'm really excited to be sitting here with
Dr. Dale Bredesen, who is internationally

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.339
recognized for his understanding of the mechanisms
of neurodegenerative disease, particularly

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.490
Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.580
He holds faculty positions at University of
California Los Angeles and the Buck Institute

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.859
for Research on Aging.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.140
In fact, he was the founding president and
CEO of the Buck Institute back in 1998, so

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.759
that's really kind of cool.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.520
And he also is an author of a "New York Times"
best-selling book called "The End of Alzheimer's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.940
Disease," which I'm sure we're going to talk
quite a bit about today.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.420
It's got a really interesting multi-pronged
protocol for preventing and also helping treat

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
mild cognitive dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.039
So thank you so much, Dale, for having me
here at your place.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.309
[Dale]: Thanks very much, Rhonda.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.949
[Rhonda]: So maybe we can start a little bit
by just talking about some of the characteristics

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.689
and pathological distinguishing features of
Alzheimer's disease and maybe what your thoughts

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.900
are on what can cause Alzheimer's disease
or leads to it.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.280
[Dale]: Right, so it's a good point because
cognitive decline, very common, and Alzheimer's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.890
is the most common cause of cognitive decline,
ultimately dementia.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.979
And by definition, this means that you have
amyloid plaques in the brain and phosphorylated

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.509
tau tangles.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.509
So those are the two main pathological hallmarks
of Alzheimer's.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.240
But as you can see, that doesn't tell you
why you got it, it just is something you look

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.340
at the brain, and of course, you can get something
that looks virtually identical without the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.630
amyloid and you can get amyloid without the
cognitive decline.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.970
So, it's a marker but it's an imperfect one.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.150
[Rhonda]: Yeah, that's a really good point
you brought up.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.500
And do you have any thoughts on why there
are some people that do have amyloid plaques

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.960
in their brain that aren't demented and then
some others that just don't seem to handle

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960
it?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.440
[Dale]: Yeah, it's a great point.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.310
So, here's the thing, the whole world is turning
upside down now when it comes to our understanding

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.920
of Alzheimer's.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
It's been over 100 years, of course, going
back to Alois Alzheimer's publications back

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.770
in 1906 and 1907, and there hasn't been a
good understanding of this disease.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.170
And of course, amyloid has been for years
vilified and there's no question, it is a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.170
neurotoxin.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.510
It does have toxic effects.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.370
The surprise has been that this is also a
protectant.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.070
It's actually something that is made by your
brain when you have specific insults.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.650
And for example, Professor Rudy Tanzi and
Professor Robert Moir of Harvard a few years

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.900
ago showed that it is an antimicrobial.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.960
It also, as Professor Ashley Bush showed a
number of years ago, it's actually quite a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.390
good binder of divalent metals like copper
and zinc, and things like that, iron.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.630
And we showed a number of years ago, it is
also a response to a reduction in trophic

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.860
support, so you actually get a change in signaling.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.380
So, there are multiple different insults and
metabolic changes that lead the brain to produce

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.380
this stuff.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.330
And so I think there's been confusion because
it's clear that when you produce it you're

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.450
at this increased risk for having a degenerative
process, but as you indicated, there are many

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.800
people that produce it and they successfully
are protecting themselves, they don't actually

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.430
have the downsizing.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.860
What's often been stated is those who then
have inflammation on top of that seem to be

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.400
the ones that do worse, and that's a very
general idea, but really it is a set of things.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.410
And we identified and published, a number
of years ago, 36 different factors that all

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.900
contribute to this, but they actually break
down into just a couple of categories.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.401
So, any sort of pathogens, anything that's
giving you inflammation, whether you have

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:12.430
it because you have a leaky gut or because
you have P. gingivalis in your brain, or because

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.860
you have Borrelia of Lyme disease, or you've
been exposed to specific fungi, things like

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.780
that, all of these things can engender that
response.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.100
And in fact, we think more and more of amyloid
as being like napalm.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.070
You got the bad guys coming across the border,
so you're now going to put down stuff that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.640
kills the bad guys, the napalm but in so doing
you're now going to reduce your arable soil.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.420
You're now living in a smaller country, and
that's exactly what's going on in the brain,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.140
you are downsizing the overall network.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.790
So, that's what we call type 1 or inflammatory
or hot Alzheimer's.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.440
And I should mention, it turns out ayurvedic
physicians from thousands of years ago who

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.230
recognized dementia that was related to something
that was hot, that was abnormal and ultimately

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.720
inflammatory, as well as that was related
to dryness, which is what we call type 2,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.930
where you have decreased trophic support.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.080
It can be nerve growth factor, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, estradiol, testosterone,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.780
pregnenolone, progesterone, thyroid, vitamin
D, all of these things are critical to support

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.240
of synaptogenesis.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.950
So we think of the signaling as being a ratio
of synaptoblastic activity where you're actually

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.390
sending signals to make and store synapses
(just like you think of osteoblastic activity)

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.810
versus synaptoclastic activity where you're
actively pulling back and you're reorganizing.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.620
And of course, this is going on all the time.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.400
You're actively forgetting the seventh song
that played on the radio on the way to work

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.440
yesterday and you're actively forgetting a
lot but you're remembering the key things,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.410
like where your keys are and where your son
is and all that sort of stuff.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.880
And so, there is a change in that ratio in
Alzheimer's disease because of type 1 with

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.460
inflammation or type 2, which we call atrophic
or cold, because you don't have the support

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.450
for those synapses, so you're literally...it's
a little bit like someone saying, "I've got

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.860
five children and I can only feed four.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.960
I can either watch all five starve slowly
or I can put one in a foster home and feed

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.830
four," and that's basically the downsizing
that's happening when you cannot support the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.210
neural network that you have.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.550
And then we have a type that's actually type
1.5, which is glycotoxic.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.490
And we named it that because it has features
of both type 1, inflammatory, and type 2,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.490
atrophic.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:57.400
So what happens is you develop insulin resistance,
so you now have a change in signaling that

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.971
actually occurs because of this chronic high
insulin.

00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:06.430
So you actually phosphorylate your IRS-1,
as shown very nicely by Professor Ed Goetzl

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.050
over at UCSF.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.810
So you change the ratio of the serine/threonine
phosphorylation to the tyrosine phosphorylation

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.290
and you're literally changing your response
to insulin, so that gives you the type 2 because

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.750
you no longer have insulin as the supportive
trophic factor to the extent it was previously.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.380
But of course, you're also glycating proteins
with...and we measure this, of course, as

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.680
hemoglobin A1C.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.160
But you're glycating many proteins, so you
get now a response to that as well.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.389
So you have an inflammation in an atrophic
and so that's why it's 1.5.

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:46.990
And then type 3 turns out to be completely
different, and that is a response to toxins.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.650
So there is a toxic form, which we call toxic
or vile Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.900
In addition, there are people we called type
4 who have more of a vascular component and

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.790
then type 5, which is more of a traumatic
component, but they're really both related

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.830
to these other ones.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.420
It's really about, do you have inflammation?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.890
Are you fighting something off?

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.650
Do you have trophic support, and are you exposed
to specific toxins?

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:19.900
[Rhonda]: Wow, and so in all of these different
subtypes of Alzheimer's disease they all sort

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.669
of have some of the same distinguishing pathological
features like amyloid beta plaques, tau tangles

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:27.669
between all of them.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:33.990
[Dale]: So they all have amyloid plaques,
they all have, by definition, tau tangles,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.240
but the presentation can be different.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:43.310
Now there are some overlaps, the type 1s and
the type 2s are typically amnestic presentations

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.480
more common with ApoE4, and that's true for
the type 1.5s as well.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.010
The type 3s, the toxic ones are quite different.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.740
They often present with a non-amnestic presentation.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.279
It's executive dysfunction, problems with
calculation, problems with visual perception,

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:06.230
problems with word finding, so-called primary
progressive aphasia, all of these things,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:14.200
they are really bi-parietal presentations
as opposed to bi-temporal presentations, essentially.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.240
So these have often been called cortical presentations,
which have been noted for years by people

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.380
like Professor Mario Mendez, to be typical
in younger presentations of Alzheimer's and

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.440
often in ApoE4 negative individuals.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.450
[Rhonda]: I think I also read one in your
papers where you did this metabolic profiling

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.870
there was a very prominent zinc deficiency
in that.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:43.160
[Dale]: Yes, so for reasons that we don't
entirely understand yet, many of the people

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:52.029
with the type 3, the toxic sub-type have low
serum zinc, high copper-zinc ratios, and low

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.029
triglycerides.

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:59.170
The low triglycerides may turn out to be related
to malabsorption, we don't know for sure yet,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.270
but we don't really understand why the people
often have these low copper-zinc ratios.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.780
[Rhonda]: What does that mean, the copper-zinc
ratio, what is that?

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.270
[Dale]: The high copper-zinc ratio, low zinc.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.270
[Rhonda]: Low zinc, yeah.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.279
[Dale]: Yeah, so as, you know, copper and
zinc actually are competitive, for example,

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.279
in their absorption.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.770
And so, too much of one actually is often
associated with too little of another.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.529
And then typically in our society, as you
know, most of us are deficient in zinc.

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:31.190
There are actually about a billion people
on Earth is the estimate for zinc deficiency.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.100
It's a very common problem because if you
have poor gastric acidity, which is common

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:43.600
as we age, if you're taking PPIs for GERD,
if you're taking something for reflux, you

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.340
won't absorb the zinc very well, if you have
copper piping which most of us do, the copper

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.870
will often compete with the zinc.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.620
And so many people have a little too much
copper and a little bit too little zinc.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.470
And in fact, it was noted over 30 years ago
that people with high copper-zinc ratios tended

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.770
to have dementia more than those with normal
copper-zinc ratios.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.770
[Rhonda]: Wow.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.710
So does this have something to do with it?

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:13.870
I know there's like over 300 to 500 different
enzymes in the body that require zinc.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.540
So does copper then bind to those enzymes
and then sort of mess up the function or is

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.660
that like the theory?

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.790
[Dale]: So, no.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:26.250
The theory is that, as you know, copper is
a generator of free radicals.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.940
You know, copper can act like iron in that
sense.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.230
It has a free electron in the D orbital which
does not occur with zinc.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.080
So in general, as you indicated, in these
various enzymes, and it's hundreds, just as

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.040
you said, it is an important structural component
and it has a very specific architecture with

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.529
the enzymes that it serves, so it is a structural
thing in general.

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:54.080
And copper, to my knowledge, doesn't actually
replace that.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.300
But for example, zinc is important in many
things that are related to cognitive decline,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.700
it's important in diabetes, it's important
in functioning of insulin, it's important,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.570
of course, in the trophic activity of insulin
and, you know, on and on.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.600
It's important in immune responses.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.400
So, it actually has many effects that are
related to cognition.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.660
[Rhonda]: So it may even just be a biomarker
for something underlying going on right in

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.850
the toxic insult type of Alzheimer's disease
you're talking about.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.250
[Dale]: It something to keep in mind when
you see that, and especially if the person

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.140
presents, and these people tend to be very
distinctive, the people who have type 3.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.630
So, they tend to be young, and we see them
in their late 40s, mid 50s very commonly.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.529
We've seen them as late as starting their
first symptoms in the mid-60s, but typically,

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:48.050
their first symptoms are currying in the 40s
and 50s.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:53.779
They are often women, they are often ApoE4
negative although not always.

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:56.660
There are certainly people who are ApoE4 positive
to have this.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.220
As you mentioned, they often have the low
zinc, and then they typically present in a

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.240
non-amnestic way.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.770
Interestingly, unless they are homozygous
for E4, in which case they do present typically

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.029
with an amnestic presentation, but the ones
who are E4 negative typically present with

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:17.660
problems, as I mentioned earlier, executive
dysfunction problems.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.220
And so I always ask people, are you having
trouble organizing things?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.530
We had one person, for example, who was known
for her tremendous organizing capability and

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.370
as she started to get the problem she just
lost it.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.600
She could not organize things that she could
do before, it's a very common complaint.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.400
Or as I said, people will say, "Oh, I can't
calculate a tip anymore, or I can't pay the

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.899
bills anymore," anything that is math-related
or visual perception or word finding, things

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:49.279
like that.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:51.149
[Rhonda]: You mentioned the ApoE4 a few times.

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:56.670
Can you talk a little bit about just for people
listening and watching, you know, what ApoE4

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:03.519
is, and it's a gene, and so why it plays a
major role in Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:10.390
[Dale]: Yeah, so, Apolipoprotein E is a really
fascinating story, and of course, Professor

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:18.000
Robert Mahley discovered this decades ago,
and it has turned out to be the most important

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.540
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.360
Seventy-five million Americans have a single
copy of ApoE4.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.450
And when I say that what I mean by that is,
everybody has two copies of either 2, 3, or

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.540
4, and the most common one is ApoE3.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.310
So it's common for people to be a 3,3 as an
example.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:45.920
However, about a quarter of the population,
so about 75 million Americans have one copy

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.580
of ApoE4, and that's actually the primordial
one.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:56.200
It's the one that was present for about 96%
of hominid evolution.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:03.520
If you look at a chimp for example, it does
not have ApoE4 but the hominids do, and still

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.640
about 25% of the population today.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.240
Then about seven million Americans have two
copies, so they're homozygous for ApoE4.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:20.730
Now, if you have zero copies, so if you're,
for example, a 3,3 your overall lifetime risk

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:28.270
for Alzheimer's is about 9%, so not terribly
common disease but not zero.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:34.480
On the other hand, if you have a single copy
of ApoE4 your lifetime risk is about 30% or

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.660
so.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.779
If you have two copies, if you're homozygous,
your lifetime risk is over 50%, and in some

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:44.290
studies as high as 90%.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:45.670
So most likely you will get it.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.410
And of course, the vast majority of people
don't know.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.290
Now, in the past people said, "Don't check
because there's nothing you can do about it,"

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.340
and that has completely changed.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:02.190
So there is a tremendous amount, and the reality
is Alzheimer's should be a rare disease.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:07.600
It should essentially decrease to a very low
level with the current generation.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.970
If everybody gets checked, we recommend that
everybody 45 or over get a cognoscopy, it's

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.660
a silly term but it's easy to remember.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.579
Everybody knows when you hit 50 you should
get a colonoscopy, and if you hit 45 or over

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:24.370
you should be getting a cognoscopy.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.731
You should be doing some testing and see where
you stand, what are your risk factors, are

00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:37.839
you ApoE4 positive, do you have high homocysteine,
methylation issues, inflammatory issues, nutrient

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:43.959
issues, toxin issues, all these things, because
they can all be addressed, and we can decrease

00:16:43.959 --> 00:16:46.600
the overall global burden of dementia.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.209
[Rhonda]: So there's a variety of biomarkers
that you are suggesting people can go and

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:52.209
get measured?

00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:53.209
[Dale]: Yes.

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:56.140
[Rhonda]: You know, to, this, what did you
call it?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.140
The...

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.140
[Dale]: The cognoscopy.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.140
[Rhonda]: Cognoscopy, yes.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.140
That's a nice term.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.480
So, including the genetic factor, ApoE4, seeing
the ApoE4 and then you have a variety of biomarkers

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.739
that you kind of just mentioned.

00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:16.819
Some of those, I think you also have published
on before, talking about the insulin sensitivity

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:23.019
as well, looking at insulin sensitivity and
glycated hemoglobin.

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:26.650
So maybe we can talk a little bit about some
of those biomarkers and how...so you have

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.019
this wonderful protocol, let's see, the MEND
protocol.

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.580
[Dale]: Right, so it's now called ReCODE,
so MEND was the very first addition, that

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.580
was Metabolic Enhancement for Neurodegeneration.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:44.129
But as we have made 2.0 and 3.0 and we have
made it more sophisticated, as I mentioned

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:48.919
in the book, it's become ReCODE, which is
for reversal of cognitive decline.

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:54.000
And we now have over 3,000 people who are
on this protocol with unprecedented, and we've

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.730
published a number of the results.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.989
We actually have another thing that's just
finishing up that reports another 50 people

00:18:01.989 --> 00:18:04.169
who have shown improvement.

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:05.239
[Rhonda]: Fifty, wow.

00:18:05.239 --> 00:18:09.399
So the publications that I had read you had
shown, I think it was about 10 patients.

00:18:09.399 --> 00:18:11.580
[Dale]: There was 10 and then there were another
10.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.580
[Rhonda]: Another 10.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.580
[Dale]: A different 10, yeah.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.690
[Rhonda]: Right, and you showed that you were
able to basically take a person that had Alzheimer's

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.710
disease, some of them had to leave work because
of their issues, and you put them on a protocol

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.369
and they were not only were able to some of
them return to work but they also seem to

00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:31.129
have brain mass returning and just so it was
really phenomenal.

00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:39.009
So, some of these, some of the very complex
diet/lifestyle intervention that you did here,

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:43.789
maybe we can talk about some of the key ones
starting with like this diet overhaul that...

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:50.609
[Dale]: Yeah, and I should say, you know,
it goes back to one very simple principle.

00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:54.169
We've been trying to treat this disease without
knowing what causes it.

00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:59.690
So I usually tell people it's as if you took
your car into the mechanic because it wasn't

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.690
working well, and the mechanic said, "Oh,
Rhonda, no problem.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.809
This is called car not working syndrome and
your car is going to die."

00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:09.109
And you say, "Well, wait a minute.

00:19:09.109 --> 00:19:12.409
I mean, shouldn't you figure out why, why
something, what went wrong with it?"

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:15.669
And I said, "Well, no, you know, the testing
isn't reimbursed so we're not going to do

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:16.669
that."

00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:19.230
And that's the unfortunate situation we've
been in.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.489
People say, "We don't know what causes it,
there's nothing you do about it.

00:19:23.489 --> 00:19:25.860
There's nothing we can do, and you're going
to die."

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.409
And medicine is changing in the 21st century,
as you know.

00:19:29.409 --> 00:19:34.520
It is becoming less about mono-therapeutics
and more about programmatics.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.840
And at the center of this is to understand
why complex chronic illnesses occur.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.759
When you have something like there's a simple
illness like pneumococcal pneumonia, you find

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:49.799
the pneumococcus, you treat the pneumococcus,
and all the other underlying things, alcohol,

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:54.330
diabetes, anything that could have been contributing
is less important because you've got at the

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.789
pneumococcal pneumonia, that's not the case
with complex chronic illnesses.

00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:03.179
With Alzheimer's there are dozens of things
that can be contributing.

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:06.120
And so what we want to do is address all of
those.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:12.729
Yes, if you have pathogens, many people have,
for example, Borrelia from Lyme disease or

00:20:12.729 --> 00:20:19.350
a Lyme co-infection like Bartonella or Babesia
or Ehrlichia, things like that, then those

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.499
need to be addressed.

00:20:21.499 --> 00:20:26.559
And of course, you need to change the underlying
biochemistry.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:30.080
So as you indicated, there are specific biomarkers.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:37.769
So we want to know you are hsCRP, it's a marker
of inflammation, of course, we want to know

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:40.549
your homocysteine, the marker of methylation.

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:45.100
If you're not methylated appropriately and
your homocysteine is high, then you are at

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.409
increased risk for neurodegeneration.

00:20:47.409 --> 00:20:52.470
And of course, it's been published that you
have a more rapid decline in your cerebral

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.640
grey matter volume and hippocampal volume
if you have a high homocysteine.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.840
[Rhonda]: Is that because of vascular reasons
or what's the homocysteine mean?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.269
[Dale]: Well, the publication did not distinguish.

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:08.859
It just simply followed people over years
and looked at the rapidity of the decline

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:14.950
in volume and could show that not only was
it more...and literally, you could put the

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:22.140
rapidity of it on a graph with homocysteine,
and it fit very nicely.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.659
But then if you improve the homocysteine and
brought it back to normal and they're looking

00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:32.119
at less than seven as being normal not less
than 13, which is often used in the labs.

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:33.119
[Rhonda]: Less than seven?

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:37.000
[Dale]: Seven as being normal, then in fact
what happened was people actually stopped

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.120
their decline and leveled off.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:46.780
So it suggested that this is a causal relationship,
that it is a mediator of cognitive, well,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.799
of change in cerebral volume as well as cognitive
decline.

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.980
[Rhonda]: Independent of other biomarkers?

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.412
[Dale]: Independent of other biomarkers, yes.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:54.559
So we want to know that.

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:58.169
We want to know whether you have glycotoxicity.

00:21:58.169 --> 00:22:01.350
So we want to know what is your fasting insulin.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.299
And again, people will accept it way off the
scale.

00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:12.659
We have an unfortunate situation where classically
we have accepted laboratory values as within

00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:21.039
normal limits, WNL, very arbitrarily as being
within two standard deviations of the mean.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:26.009
That actually makes no sense physiologically,
it just says that there's a distribution there,

00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:29.039
it doesn't say that that's optimal for your
health.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:35.179
So we'd like to know what your fasting insulin
is, and optimally, it would be less than five

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:40.679
or less than five, although again, within
normal limits goes much higher than that.

00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:47.419
We'd like to know your hemoglobin A1C, which
again, is a marker of, essentially over the

00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:50.330
last two months, your serum glucose.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.179
We'd like to know your fasting glucose.

00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:57.580
These three actually give you quite complimentary
pieces of information, all related to this

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.960
type 1.5 that I mentioned, the glycotoxic
type.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.539
And then the atrophic, as you can imagine,
there are lots of things.

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:09.440
We want to know your vitamin D, and again,
we want to see that it's optimal, not sub-optimal

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.749
but within normal limits.

00:23:11.749 --> 00:23:17.779
We want to know your pregnenolone, progesterone,
estradiol, testosterone, free T3.

00:23:17.779 --> 00:23:21.820
And we'd like to know your brain-derived neurotrophic
factor in your NGF.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:27.679
There's no simple way on a clinical lab test
today to get those, so you have to infer them

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:33.360
from other things, you know, what is your
hippocampal volume?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.010
You know, what have you been doing?

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.729
If you change these various things we've been
talking about, you're likely to have a decrease.

00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:41.919
Have you been exercising?

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:45.979
If you're not exercising your BDNF is likely
to be lower.

00:23:45.979 --> 00:23:52.460
So we want to look at all of the trophic support
for your brain because these are critical

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:59.460
things if you're going to make and keep a
large network of synapses, you need to have

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.460
that support.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.460
And then again, that balance changes for many
of us as we age, especially if we are ApoE4

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.610
positive.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:15.249
ApoE4 gives you an advantage in that you have
a hair trigger, essentially, for inflammation.

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:21.849
You are responding...so if you live in a squalid
environment like the Tsimane Indians that

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:30.179
Professor Tuck Finch studied, for example,
or the Agana Tribe that Tuck also has studied,

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:32.999
you are in better shape if you're ApoE4 positive.

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:38.350
But if you're not living in a pro-inflammatory,
in an environment that's parasitic, then in

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:45.470
fact you have this chronic inflammation that,
again, good for when you're fighting things,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:53.500
good for if you step on a nail, good for situations
that should be pro-inflammatory, but in the

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.440
long run counterproductive.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:04.080
So, you know, as you know, this is so-called
antagonistic pleiotropy.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.629
This is something that can help you when you're
young but actually can put you at risk for

00:25:08.629 --> 00:25:10.299
diseases that will shorten your lifespan.

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:15.659
And typically, cerebrovascular disease, of
course, Alzheimer's disease and as you know,

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:19.570
ApoE4 is actually underrepresented in centenarians.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.929
So it has been a short-gevity gene as it were.

00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:29.309
Again, that is changing and can change by
understanding what's actually being driven

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:30.309
by this.

00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:34.359
So we want to know all those markers and those
for the type 2, and then of course, we want

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:36.279
to know the markers for type 3.

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:41.429
So we want to know if there are specific toxins
and especially mycotoxins.

00:25:41.429 --> 00:25:48.559
So the toxins can be metalotoxins like mercury,
relatively common one, they can be organic

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:56.559
toxins like DDE, things like that, they can
be biotoxins like trycothesinson, ochratoxin

00:25:56.559 --> 00:26:05.220
A, aflatoxin, gliotoxin, these are toxins
produced by various molds species like Stachybotrys

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.989
and Aspergillus, and Penicillium, which are
literally fighting us.

00:26:09.989 --> 00:26:12.629
I mean, they're literally saying, "Okay, I'm
fighting back."

00:26:12.629 --> 00:26:19.200
And for example, one of the responses has
been when you have mold growing on treated

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.470
wood, they're recognizing something has changed,
mold that have been treated with fungicide.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:32.129
So these are things where just as we're seeing
increasingly bacteria that are antibiotic-resistant

00:26:32.129 --> 00:26:38.879
as Professor Shoemaker has pointed out, Dr.
Ritchie Shoemaker who's done so much work

00:26:38.879 --> 00:26:45.370
over the years on mold and mycootoxins and
described what he calls CIRS, Chronic Inflammatory

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.940
Response Syndrome.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:54.710
As we've had fungicides, as we've had, you
know, buildings with leaks where we haven't

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.059
recognized the danger from these.

00:26:57.059 --> 00:27:01.139
In fact, we've had more and more of this mold-related
illness.

00:27:01.139 --> 00:27:03.380
So we want to know all those things for the
types 3s.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.940
And of course, we also want to know have you
had a history of head trauma, we want to know

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.809
if you have vascular compromise, all of those
things are critical.

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:12.850
Now, you mentioned the diet.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:18.450
So, yes, we want to start with the basics,
but again, ultimately, it's a program that

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:24.789
is customized to you based on what's actually
causing your cognitive decline or your risk

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:26.679
for cognitive decline.

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:34.039
And so, the nutritional part we call Ketoflex
12/3 and it's for a very simple reason.

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:40.100
So keto, so we want people to be in mild ketosis
because that actually turns out to work better

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:45.700
for cognition, and many people do better with
their cognitive decline, just as Mary Newport

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.119
showed, of course, with using coconut oil
then that may or may not be the best way to

00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:56.299
do it for some people, other people like caprylic
acid, MCT oil, other people are very good

00:27:56.299 --> 00:28:01.629
at generating endogenous ketones, which if
you can do it, it's the best way to do it.

00:28:01.629 --> 00:28:09.139
And so we want to drive you into mild ketosis,
which means a very low carbohydrate, high

00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:15.700
fat, good fats, diet, things like avocados
and nuts and seeds and things like that.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.899
And there is a caveat out for people who are
ApoE4 and a caveat for people have very low

00:28:21.899 --> 00:28:24.149
BMI, so we can talk about that.

00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:29.720
The next piece is flexitarian, so you can
be a meat eater or not.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:37.039
In general, we see meat as a condiment, but
you know, again, as we evolved we tend to

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:40.610
eat relatively small amounts of meat but that's
fine.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.179
If you do, if it's going to be chicken, it
should be pastured chicken, if it's going

00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:47.629
to be beef, it should be grass-fed beef.

00:28:47.629 --> 00:28:51.429
If you're going to have fish, great.

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:54.460
Make sure it's wild caught not farmed fish.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.840
You don't want to have the fish with high
mercury.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:05.960
Those are the large-mouthed, long-lived fish,
tuna, shark, you know, swordfish, things like

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.619
that, you want to stay away from those because
they can contribute to your cognitive decline.

00:29:09.619 --> 00:29:13.389
In fact, one of the people who called me a
couple of years ago was a very successful

00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:19.369
businessman who had early Alzheimer's and
already had PET scan proven, and they told

00:29:19.369 --> 00:29:23.110
him, "Come back in a year because you're not
doing that badly yet, you're still in the

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:28.690
NCI phase," but you could already see the
signature of Alzheimer's on his PET scan.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:34.229
And when I listened to his story I said, you
know, "You've got type 3, and you need to

00:29:34.229 --> 00:29:36.799
find out if you've got exposure to any toxins."

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:37.799
And he said, "No, everything's great."

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:42.830
Well, it turned out that he was eating large
amounts of tuna sushi, and he happened to

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:49.259
be genetically a poor excretor of mercury,
also happen to have some dental amalgams.

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:56.619
So he had extremely high organic mercury from
the seafood, extremely high inorganic mercury

00:29:56.619 --> 00:30:00.690
from the amalgams, and then as well as...so
he had the perfect storm.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:07.580
And his mercury's actually 7 times the 95th
percentile for our country, just massive,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.070
massive mercury exposure, and he's done well
with removing that.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.320
So we want to know those specific ones.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.769
And again, for fish, you want to think about
the smash fish.

00:30:17.769 --> 00:30:24.139
And my wife, who's a family practitioner,
you know, reminds me about this, you know,

00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:30.100
salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and
herring, and she is a real expert on the nutritional

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.879
side and on the integrative medicine side.

00:30:32.879 --> 00:30:38.129
She told me 25 years ago, "Whatever you guys
come up with in the lab, in your test tube..."

00:30:38.129 --> 00:30:44.399
I've spent my whole career looking at what
is driving the molecular signaling that leads

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:45.399
to neurodegeneration.

00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:49.259
She said, "You know, whatever you come up
with, it's going to have something to do with

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:50.760
what you're eating and your exercise."

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.760
And I said, "No, no, no.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.450
It's going to be one domain of one molecule
and we're going to get a drug for that thing

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.469
and it's going to be over..."

00:30:58.469 --> 00:31:02.710
And of course, I should have listened to her
25 years ago, that she was right.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.409
It does have to do with programmatics not
mono-therapeutics.

00:31:07.409 --> 00:31:13.790
So then the 12/3 part of Ketoflex 12/3, a
minimum of 12-hour fasts between when you

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:19.779
finish dinner and when you start breakfast
or brunch or lunch, if you are ApoE4 positive

00:31:19.779 --> 00:31:25.559
you're actually a better fat absorber, as
you know, so you want to make that 14 to 16

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:26.559
hours.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.549
If you're ApoE4 negative, 12 to 14 hours.

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:34.869
And be careful, if you have a very low BMI,
you can lose weight on this Ketoflex 12/3

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:39.859
diet and so you have to liberalize typically
once a week, have some sweet potatoes or something

00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:42.139
that's a little more carbohydrate-related.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.389
And of course, in the book we talk about the
various things that you want to do with this

00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:52.259
diet, but 12 hours, that gives you time for
autophagy, it gives you time essentially at

00:31:52.259 --> 00:31:58.409
night to induce your ketosis, to clean out
your brain, of course, the glymphatic system,

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:05.099
you actually have a change in the architecture
of your brain as you're sleeping, you're actually

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:08.879
essentially sweeping this stuff out, it's
kind of amazing, actually.

00:32:08.879 --> 00:32:15.710
And so, if you're eating with these very small
windows of sleep and very small windows of

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.249
fasting you're actually doing yourself harm
and putting yourself at greater risk.

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:25.009
And then similarly, you want three hours before
bed after you finish your dinner.

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:30.429
You don't want to eat right up until bedtime
because your insulin's high, and again, that's

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:31.429
hurting your cognition.

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:35.799
That's again, giving you the same sort of
insulin resistance problem, storing fat, you're

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:38.210
doing all the things that are not helpful.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.639
So that's the dietary approach.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:42.559
And of course, you want to have organic.

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:45.129
There are toxins in our food, it's unfortunate.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:48.960
We've got a tremendous a life-long exposure
to toxins.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.219
Of course, Bruce Ames, with whom you've trained,
developed the Ames Test, which allows us now

00:32:55.219 --> 00:33:00.760
to look at carcinogens, but nobody has ever
told us, "Well, hey, what about dementogens?"

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.399
You're exposed every day to various dementogens,
things like mercury, things like some of the

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:11.499
organics that are in some of the health and
beauty aids, and things like biotoxins.

00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:16.349
If you're living in a home that has leaks,
you are exposed to dementogens and you need

00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:17.989
to know about that.

00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:19.269
So that's the Ketoflex 12/3.

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:26.549
We want it be...it's a plant-rich diet that
Mark Hyman calls plant-rich as opposed to

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:34.300
plant-based, but either way it is a plant-rich
diet that can use some animal products, it's

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.300
up to you.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.690
You want to be vegetarian, that's fine, you
don't, that's fine too.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:45.120
That minimizes the toxins, you want to have
a high, typically 70% or so calories from

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.519
fat, and you can start out with using things
like MCT oil or coconut oil to get your ketones

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:52.519
up.

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:57.629
We're finding that people who have higher
ketone levels, 1.5 millimolar to 4 millimolar

00:33:57.629 --> 00:34:02.600
more beta-hydroxybutyrate tend to do better
than those who are down lower.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.770
[Rhonda]: ApoE4 positive or negative?

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.840
[Dale]: And ApoE4 positive or negative.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:12.060
Now interestingly, for the ApoE4s what we
typically suggest, and this was actually originally

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.360
suggested by Julie G. who started the website,
apoe4.info.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:22.909
You essentially start with using the MCT oil
to help you get your ketosis, but then switch

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:27.500
after a month or two to more monounsaturates
and polyunsaturates.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.230
Now you can essentially balance, so you have
the best of both worlds.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.820
You follow your LDL particle number, your
LDLP.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:41.630
You want to keep it below 1,000 so you can
adjust how much MCT oil and how much of the

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:47.780
monounsaturates and polyunsaturates so they
have the best heart outcome, the best cardiovascular

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.409
outcome, at the same time have the best cognitive
outcome.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:58.220
Be careful, if don't get your ketones up and
you get your carbs down you're starving your

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.600
brain, and so then people will say, "Oh my
gosh, I just have no energy."

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.790
So you want to use that.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:10.030
You want to basically be changing over to
a more ketone-based metabolism for your brain.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:17.250
And then, as you indicated, you want to go
back more toward the monounsaturates and polyunsaturates

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.410
to make it heart healthy.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:23.510
[Rhonda]: So for this, for the ApoE4 positive
people you do recommend lowering the saturated

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.790
fat intake because of the LDL.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:31.570
[Dale]: After you become insulin sensitive,
so after you want to drive yourself into insulin

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:38.920
sensitivity, so you're able now to convert,
because it takes a few weeks, as you know,

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:44.770
to convert from a largely carbohydrate-based
metabolism to a largely fat-based metabolism.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:50.540
So if you try to do it in a day you may end
up with so-called keto flu, and it takes some

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.630
time and you're now producing, it's a whole
set of things you're producing, it's going

00:35:54.630 --> 00:36:01.550
to be less inflammatory, you're lowering your
reliance on glucose, you're becoming metabolically

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:10.230
flexible, and you're now essentially developing
a use of the ketones and it does takes a few

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.230
weeks.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.950
And it's helpful to do things like exercise
and things at that time to help you convert.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.910
[Rhonda]: And then the fasting, the overnight
fasting of at least 12 hours, or like you

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:24.140
said, if you're ApoE4 positive possibly even
increase that to 14 hours.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.900
That's interesting that you're talking about
why you're sort of transitioning into the

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.370
becoming more ketogenic that you may actually
have to increase your saturated fat intake

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.890
because you have to really...it is kind of
hard to go into ketosis without really just

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.360
having a lot of fat.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.990
And so, it's something I have not experimented
with yet.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:49.370
I found out I had an ApoE4 allele and so I've
definitely become extremely interested in

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:53.100
Alzheimer's disease and what I can do to prevent
it because, as you mentioned, you know, not

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.860
everyone with one ApoE4 gets Alzheimer's disease.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.040
It's a very complex diet-lifestyle interaction,
at least it appears to be.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.330
[Dale]: And no one should, and that's the
key.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:06.540
This should be largely ended with the current
generation.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.330
Everybody should get checked, everybody should
get an optimal personalized program, that

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.570
is the medicine of the 21st century.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:17.710
[Rhonda]: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about
this because, so a colleague of yours, Dr.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:23.360
Eric Verdin at the Buck Institute, I spoke
with him a few months back on a very interesting

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:32.170
paper he had published, I believe was cell
metabolism, where he had given animals a cyclic

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:37.750
ketogenic diet, and there was just, you know,
improvement in health span in general but

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:43.830
what was really, really robust was the improvements
in cognitive function and brain aging and

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:52.660
it was just, you know, hands down like clear
that that diet really helped delay brain aging.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.240
And so, you know, of course, those weren't
ApoE4 positive mice but...

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.400
[Dale]: But this is the exact same thing we're
seeing with people, and especially people

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.230
with early cognitive decline.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:08.000
Now, as you go later and later, it's more
and more difficult, but we have seen people

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.130
even with MoCA scores of zero show improvement.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:17.900
So, yes, I think the work that you quoted
supports that notion, that in fact, having

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.130
ketones is actually quite helpful for cognition.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.130
[Rhonda]: Beneficial.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:25.570
Do you think, and here's a couple of questions
related to that, and that is, you know, is

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.790
that...you know, probably multiple things,
but one, because you're obviously going to

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.470
have improved insulin sensitivity, you're
not going to have high blood glucose levels

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.190
and all the inflammatory processes associated
with that.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:42.420
Also the ketones, as you mentioned, are used
by the brain quite nicely.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.780
And interestingly, it actually spares...are
you familiar with the glucose sparing, what

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.300
happens with the...yeah, so glucose gets spared
to make NADPH, a precursor for glutathione

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.440
so that helps repair damage.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.410
But I'm wondering if people like myself, I
don't really practice a ketogenic diet but

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.880
I also don't...I eat a very healthy diet.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.020
I definitely try to make sure I don't eat
anything refined, no refined carbohydrates

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.550
or processed food or things like that.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:16.700
But the thing is, is that my...so my fasting
insulin's really good and my blood glucose

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.960
and all that's really good.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.470
So, for me going on ketogenic diet, do you
think there would still be more benefit even

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:29.370
though the whole, you know, insulin sensitivity
thing...maybe it would still improve, I'm

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.600
not sure.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.070
[Dale]: Well, I think the only way you're
going to know is to try it.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.070
[Rhonda]: To try it, yeah.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:39.500
[Dale]: And you know, you can even do so all
sorts of online evaluations for your own cognitive

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.500
ability.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:46.640
And I do think that many of us are sub-optimal
in our metabolism, and we know this.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.310
One of the problems, of course, is that there
have been a lot of assumptions made during

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.310
the 20th century.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:59.190
Yes, it's fine to have processed foods, it's
just as good, you know, it's fine to have

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:05.540
more sugar, on and on and on, which just simply
have turned out to be wrong.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:10.960
And it has to do with sleep, it has to do
with exercise, all sorts of things.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:19.850
We were built, as human creatures, to do certain
things well and to do other things we weren't

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.090
built for.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:26.950
If we all were jumping out of a third-story
windows as something to do that would be fun

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.600
that would not go over well for us.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.230
And to some extent, we're doing the same thing
with the way we're living.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:37.960
So, obviously, you've managed to stay fit
and to have a good fasting insulin and all

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.650
these sorts of things.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:48.031
However, a little bit will depend on what
you're actually doing, for example, where

00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:49.610
is your hemoglobin A1C?

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.800
For example, is there some inflammation there
or not?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:59.960
The bottom line is that we were not made as
human organisms to consume the amount of simple

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.650
carbs that we typically are exposed to.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.060
So to some extent, just as we're being exposed
to all these other toxins, of course, sugar

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.500
is one of them.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:14.370
And whether you try to be exposed to it or
not often we are exposed to it from all sorts

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.261
of different foods and things like that.

00:41:16.261 --> 00:41:17.550
[Rhonda]: Going out to eat, you never know.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.400
[Dale]: Going out to eat...there's also the
whole issue of leaky gut.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.160
So many people...and this wasn't even known
as a problem when I was in medical school

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.980
but it's become very clear that it's very
common.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:37.900
It does contribute to chronic inflammatory
conditions like arthritis and like cognitive

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.900
decline.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:46.510
So, I think that having a high-fat diet has
been helpful for many people, but what you

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:51.450
can suggest is, look, if you ever have any
cognitive decline get in as early as possible

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.570
and then consider this.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.801
In your case, of course, as you indicated,
you're interested in prevention because you

00:41:57.801 --> 00:42:03.420
already know that you're ApoE4 positive, so
it might be worth trying it just to see, but

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.190
you know, obviously, you're doing a lot of
other things right currently.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.690
[Rhonda]: And measuring a lot of different...you
know, other cardiovascular-rated biomarkers

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:14.600
is also good so you're going to measure things
like LDL particles, number and size, and triglycerides,

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.170
and all those things as well to make sure
that the changes you're making are actually

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.170
going to be good for you.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.100
I think that's very important.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.030
So the diet and then exercise and the sleep
is really important.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.280
You mentioned the glymphatic system, you know,
there's...to my knowledge, really, is there

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.610
two major ways that amyloid beta plaques are
cleared from the brain, one is the glymphatic

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.610
system?

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.930
[Dale]: Well, of course, there are multiple.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:42.330
There's the ratio of formation to clearance
is critical.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:47.460
And of course, you're going to be forming
more and keeping more if you actually have

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.830
a state of inflammation or of responding to
a pathogen.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:56.880
So actually, you know, there was a really
interesting test developed by Professor Milan

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:03.270
Fiala at UCLA, developed about almost 10 years
ago now.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:08.630
And what he was looking at was taking peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, so you're essentially

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:14.360
taking the blood macrophages, and you're now
simply challenging them.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:21.780
He would give them amyloid, and just look
to see how good are they at phagocytosing,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.890
at eating and getting rid of the amyloid.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:31.010
And the surprise was, all the people who have
Alzheimer's are very poor at eating and getting

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.200
rid of this amyloid.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.250
It was as if they're literally trying to keep
the amyloid around.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.120
Then we realized, yeah, this is a state.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.960
So, as you know, it's become clear that you
change, your cells change states.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.810
You have the metabolic flexibility, you have
burning this, burning that for fuel, one of

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:57.680
the states you change back and forth between
a pro-inflammatory state, essentially an NF-KappaB-mediated

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:05.130
state, and on the other hand, an anti-inflammatory,
a state that is involved more with SIRT1.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:10.080
These two actually have multiple sites of
mutual inhibition.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.360
So you're literally flipping back between
these different states, and the people who

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:20.950
had cognitive decline are poor at getting
rid, they're literally keeping this amyloid

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.950
around.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:29.200
And he looked at their M1 to M2 ratios, essentially
inflammation to resolution, he saw two patterns.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.140
The people who don't eat the amyloid and who
have the cognitive decline either have a pro-inflammatory

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:41.050
state where they have a lot of M1 and very
little M2 or he found that they literally

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:47.910
had an atrophic state, the same thing we saw
as type 2, where they simply could not produce

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.020
enough of this to resolve.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.560
So they literally had very low levels.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.290
And so in fact, getting the right levels,
about two-and-a-half to one, was associated

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:58.910
with the best outcomes.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:05.610
So, you do have this phenomenon, and so yes,
as you know, you've got everything from insulin

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:13.370
degrading enzyme, Neprilysin, macrophage clearance,
glymphatic system, and on and on and on.

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:18.760
There are multiple ways but as long as you're
in that state where you're using multiple

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.960
mechanisms to keep this stuff around, you're
not going to be very good at metabolizing

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960
it.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.680
[Rhonda]: This paper that you are referring
to, I do remember reading a paper that you

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.731
had published a few years ago where you had
taken this, essentially, I guess, you can

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:39.200
use that as a biomarker if the people with
Alzheimer's disease are not clearing amyloid

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:45.950
beta plaques via phagocytosis with their monocytes
effectively, that's sort of kind of a surrogate

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.530
marker for what's going on in the brain potentially,
right?

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.290
[Dale]: Right, and this is Professor Fiala's
test.

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:56.850
[Rhonda]: Right, and you had done a small
study where you had given people some omega-3

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:03.100
supplements along with some antioxidants and
vitamin D, and it improved their phagocytosis

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:09.550
of the amyloid plaques in the periphery, and
also I think their cognition, some individuals

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:13.370
had improved cognition, ApoE4 negative ones,
I remember.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:17.390
[Dale]: Right, and so I was a co-author on
that paper with Professor Fiala.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:23.250
So again, he invented the test and he's now
doing, you know, the small number of things

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.050
that you described there.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.750
What we're doing is a much larger set where
we're doing more of a program but clearly

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.160
that is an important part of it.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.080
And of course, Professor Serhan [SP] from
Harvard has shown that resolution is a critical

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080
part.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.630
You have the inflammatory part but then you
have to have the resolution part.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:48.040
And if you don't have that resolution part,
again, a change in mode, then you're stuck

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.410
with this chronic inflammatory state.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:58.350
And so things like omega-3s and omega-3 derived
maresins and things like that are actually

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:05.540
involved with the resolution, resolvins, named
for that very event.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.500
[Rhonda]: Of resolving inflammation?

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.500
[Dale]: Right.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.390
[Rhonda]: I remember in that paper, and I've
also done some reading on this because I have

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:19.170
a paper that hopefully will be published quite
soon on ApoE4-related Alzheimer's disease

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.330
and particularly with respect to omega-3.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:29.390
So there's some evidence that for whatever
reason, fish, when people that have ApoE4

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:35.240
are given fish or eaten fish they're protected
against Alzheimer's disease, but DHA supplementation,

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.920
it's not the same at least for ApoE-positive
individuals.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.540
And it's kind of been mystery as to why that
is.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:49.780
[Dale]: And by the way, Professor Paul Clayton
from Oxford has discussed this numerous times

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.480
and written about this.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.980
And his argument is that, of course, fish
have much more than just DHA and EPA and things

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:03.240
like that, so they have antioxidants, things
like the secoiridoids and things like this,

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.431
whether you find them in plants or animals
that actually are protective, because you

00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:11.900
have to remember you're looking at something
with multiple sites of desaturation so it's

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.190
very sensitive to oxidation.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:18.710
And so you have to protect that, and you're
absolutely right.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:24.380
Again, this idea that we had in the past that,
you know, fish, hey, it's just as good just

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.720
to get that oil out, it's not just as good.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.650
And although the oil can be helpful, you better
make sure that it's not oxidized, and you

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.050
know, better to get it in its appropriate
setting.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:47.200
[Rhonda]: Very interesting, some interesting
papers had come out from a few labs, one from

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.770
Salem Norman.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:49.950
Norman Salem, sorry.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:57.660
He had shown in animals, if you take animals
and give them a human ApoE 3, 4, 2, and then

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:04.620
feed them DHA orally, there was a transport
defect in DHA across the blood-brain barrier.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:11.830
And so I kind of review this work on a variety
of other papers as well, you know, where there's

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:16.890
a couple of major mechanisms by which DHA
is transported across the brain.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:17.970
Are you familiar with some of those?

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:22.780
One is the through a free fatty acid and the
other one's through an actual transporter

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:28.480
called the Mfsd2a transporter, which is actually
in a phospholipid form, DHA is in a phospholipid

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.480
form.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.310
And so, it appears that there may be different
ways, you know, that DHA gets across the brain,

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:43.030
and one of the ways is potentially not working
quite as well in ApoE4 individuals, at least

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.750
that's my writing theory.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.870
But once the paper's accepted I'll send you
a copy.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.250
So it's super, super interesting.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:53.610
[Dale]: Yeah, and of course, as you know,
I mean, Professor Wurtman from MIT has spent

00:49:53.610 --> 00:50:00.850
years looking at what does it actually take
nutritionally to make synapses?

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:06.400
And his point was you need the DHA and you
need acetylcholine as well.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:12.120
And so again, if you're going to be helping
people to change that balance toward the synaptoblastic

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.740
you want to make sure that they have plenty
of those precursors as well as the appropriate

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.240
signals, reduction of inflammation, all these
other things that are actually part of an

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.580
overall orchestrated event.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:27.700
[Rhonda]: The other interesting thing is that
DHA, and I didn't know this previously until

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.810
I had been digging into the literature, it
also seems to be important for some of the

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.580
glucose transporters on the blood-brain barrier.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.180
And so if you're DHA-deficient those glucose
transporters aren't working as well and you're

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.500
not getting glucose into the brain, which
is another real hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.690
So that's another interesting thing.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:57.100
So, a couple of interesting things I wanted
to ask you about were kind of off-topic but

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.100
not particularly.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.310
You mentioned this type 3 sub-type.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:05.120
Would the herpes virus fall into that?

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.690
[Dale]: So, yeah.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:13.380
So herpes virus could give you type 1 or type
3 depending on what you're actually responding

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.380
to.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:19.660
If it's just a chronic inflammation then it
would be a little bit more like a type 1 with

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.680
chronic inflammatory, but you're right.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.200
You know, again, many groups have said, "Okay,
it's about herpes.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:33.960
Okay, it's about P. gingivalis, it's about
Fusobacterium nucleatum, it's about Candida.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:42.320
And the reality is, all of these are capable
of inducing the signal, this change where

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.640
you're making the amyloid as part of a protectant.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.880
As you know, it's essentially part of your
innate immune system.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.610
So if you're responding in that way it can
be any of those things, it's not just one

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.100
every single time, as far as anyone knows.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:05.420
So, yes, you alluded to the recent work on
herpes and especially, of course, six and

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.920
seven.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.290
And so, yes, not surprisingly.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:15.290
You know, one of the things we see frequently
with the various patients is chronic exposure

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:26.360
and chronic presence of the various herpes
family viruses, CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV, all those

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360
things.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.050
[Rhonda]: The last thing I kinda wanted to
mention just because I wanted you to know

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:35.000
about it in case you weren't aware of it,
there's some really interesting research coming

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.510
out of Finland.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:37.640
Are you familiar with saunas and the protective...

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.640
[Dale]: Of course.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.640
[Rhonda]: Oh, okay.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.260
[Dale]: Yeah, of course, dramatic effects,
and fits very beautifully with everything

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.590
we've been talking about.

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:54.810
And certainly, what happens when you have
a sauna, yes, you may induce some heat shock

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:59.650
protein, great, that's important, and it can
be important in folding of proteins, but what

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.920
also happens, of course, is that you detox.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:11.520
And these people who are doing this repeatedly...you
know, some nice work by Dr. Genuis from Canada

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:16.920
who showed that if you look at composition
of sweat compared to the blood there are certain

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:23.480
toxins that are very high, cadmium being the
big one, over 1,000 times increase in sweat,

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.860
so a good way to get rid of cadmium, but a
good way to get rid of other things as well.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.060
[Rhonda]: Mercury as well, right?

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.460
[Dale]: I think you're right with mercury.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.390
[Rhonda]: Yeah, BPA comes out as well.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:40.160
[Dale]: BPA, especially the hydrophobic toxins,
the non-hydrophilic stuff tends to be very

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.710
good in the sweat, but others as well.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:49.880
And so that's why it is very helpful, and
many of us don't do enough of that sort of

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880
thing.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.070
And as has been pointed out, whether you're
doing it through sweat and exercise or whether

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.810
you're doing it through saunas, whether you're
doing it through other mechanisms, yes, it's

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.810
good to get.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:06.550
And then you want to use a non-emollient soap
immediately thereafter, things like Castile

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:11.650
soap or whatever you like that's non-emollient
and get rid of the stuff so that you don't

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:12.650
get re-penetration.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:17.420
[Rhonda]: Yeah, the other thing is that cardiovascular
effects with the sauna and that may also be

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.050
related to dementia as well.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:23.500
So, is that something that you'd consider
using in your protocol?

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500
[Dale]: Oh, it's part of the protocol.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.500
[Rhonda]: It is part of the protocol?

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.500
[Dale]: Oh, absolutely.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.500
[Rhonda]: Excellent.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.940
[Dale]: Now, we recommend that people...and
especially if someone has type 3, that's even

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.270
more important.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:37.560
But as a general rule, you know, part of this
is, again, as my wife says, resilience, part

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.100
of this is resilience.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:45.210
We're taking people who are sub-optimal in
their metabolism, in their inflammation, in

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:50.531
their toxic status, in their lifestyle status,
in their sleep, in their stress levels, these

00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:52.640
are surprisingly important.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:57.260
One of the first people who came through was
a very intelligent physician.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.950
And as we went through each thing he said
to me, "Well, you know, I don't believe that,

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:03.640
you know, that's not a cure for Alzheimer's,
that's not a cure for Alzheimer's."

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.720
He had well documented early Alzheimer's,
PET scan proven, amyloid PET positive, FTG

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.890
PET positive, hippocampal atrophy, the whole
nine yards.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.820
And as we went through each thing, you know,
he was telling me, "Well, I don't believe

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.820
this."

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.690
I said, "Look, this is not about one thing,
this is about a program that is optimal for

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:22.720
you."

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.790
And actually, he's done extremely well, and
he's now four years into the program and still

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.720
doing very, very well.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:39.600
So, it is about changing signaling within
your synaptobalstic to synaptoclastic ratio,

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.920
providing the right support for that, DHA,
acetylcholine and Vitamin D, and appropriate

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.750
hormones, and BDNF, and all these things,
and making sure that you don't have chronic

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:50.750
exposure.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:56.130
And as you mentioned, sauna is actually a
very powerful way to help reduce overall toxic

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.130
burden.

00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:01.730
It is surprising how much toxic burden most
of us are living with.

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:08.240
[Rhonda]: So talking about the importance
of intervening in multiple ways because there

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.150
are so many different pathways that lead to
inflammation, that can lead to insulin resistance,

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:20.180
that can lead to toxic burden, one of the
really...something that made major headlines

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:25.720
over the past few years is the failed clinical
trials targeting amyloid beta plaques, multiple

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.340
clinical trials, I mean, it's just one after
the other.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:34.750
[Dale]: And actually, we've had a number of
people who have tried to remove their amyloid

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:39.210
with antibodies who've actually gotten worse
with that happening.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:42.450
So you have to go back to, why is there?

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:48.030
And it's tough because yes, it is both part
of the mediator, it's not the cause of Alzheimer's,

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.630
it's a mediator, and I think that's been one
of the problems.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:54.720
People want to say it's the cause, it's a
mediator, and there are many upstream things

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.590
contributing to that.

00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:00.920
So, on the one hand, it's a mediator of the
pathophysiology.

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:06.850
On the other hand, it's also a protectant,
it's a response to things like pathogens.

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.530
And so there's a double-edged sword there.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:13.370
It's fine, I think, in the long run, it'll
be fine to remove the amyloid, but you've

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:16.360
got to remove the cause of it first.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.220
Now, of course, people have just tried to
go earlier, earlier, earlier and can we actually

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.690
see some improvement?

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:25.700
So I think it won't be surprising if you can
get a little improvement early on, but again,

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:31.850
it's a little bit like saying if we fire the
CFO we can all spend a little more for a while.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:37.340
Well, if we're still going to go into the
red, we want to make sure that we're spending

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340
for the right things.

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:44.680
We want to know why your amyloid is there
to begin with, we want to remove all those

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:51.900
things, then remove the amyloid as opposed
to just blindly removing this mediator and

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.310
leaving the various inducers.

00:57:54.310 --> 00:58:00.320
[Rhonda]: Right, and with Alzheimer's disease
it's so...you know, as you've been talking

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:05.360
about for the last hour, there are so many
different things that can lead to it, so many

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.010
causes, so many things in the environment,
in our diet, things that are not present in

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:15.200
our diet, that it's difficult to just find
that one monotherapy and target it.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.850
And things are always much more complex.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:20.450
Like it seems like, well, amyloid plaques
in your brain, of course you want to get rid

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:21.450
of those.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:24.920
They're destroying synapses, and well, as
you mentioned, it has a function, it has a

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.010
really important function.

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.080
And for the longest time, I remember I was
trying to...this was some years ago, I was

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:36.869
trying to understand what the normal function
of amyloid beta, even amyloid precursor protein,

00:58:36.869 --> 00:58:38.490
like what is it doing?

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.020
Why is it in there?

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:43.380
Obviously, we have this whole elaborate system,
we have these enzymes that cleave it in this

00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:48.510
right position, and it forms this 42 amino
acid fragment, I mean, that's all happening

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:49.510
for a reason.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:56.220
It doesn't seem like it would be programmed
into our biology to cause dementia.

00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:02.660
And so I think it really is important to understand
what the normal function is of the amyloid

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660
beta.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.890
And also with the tau, phosphorylated tau,
and tau protein as well, is that something

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:14.840
that you find quite often in the people that
have the amyloid burden and are affected,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.020
they often also have tau tangles in...?

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.400
[Dale]: Oh yeah.

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:23.820
Now, tau imaging is still kind of in its infancy,
so most people, we don't know.

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.450
So, they may have an amyloid-positive scan
but they haven't have a tau scan.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:32.960
However, they are clearly in Alzheimer's,
and as I say, we do know that many of them

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.040
do from cerebral spinal fluid.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.510
So these people that we've reported, I mean,
these people have the low ETI that is associated,

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.880
you know, amyloid tau index, so they have
a low a-beta 42s in the CSF and they have

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.400
the high phospho-tau and total tau in the
CSF, the ones that have been evaluated.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:56.380
So, indirectly from that, we can say they
definitely had tau, they're likely to have

00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380
phospho-tau tangles.

00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:02.240
And again, if you look at what this is doing,
it makes a lot of sense.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:09.140
When you are trying to pull back on a connection
then you need to collapse the superstructure.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.260
And what is the phosphorylation of tau do?

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.360
It allows it to pop off the microtubules so
you have a rapid collapse of the structure.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:23.720
So no surprise when you're in this mode of
you're trying to fight this off, you're trying

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.650
to change, you're trying to pull back on your
structure, you're going to phosphorylate your

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:34.821
tau, pop it off, the microtubules, and you're
going to die back, and that's exactly what

01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:35.821
you see.

01:00:35.821 --> 01:00:42.830
So again, it's not, you know, that the tau
is not the cause of the problem, it is a mediator

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:50.790
based on what's going on genetically with
pathogens, with toxins, with metabolic changes,

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:54.360
with innate immune system, and you know, with
trauma.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.230
So the things that are driving this are the
things that we want to target.

01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:59.700
[Rhonda]: Yeah.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:06.050
What percentage of people would you say is
more common to have your sub-type 1, 1.5,

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:10.010
2, the inflammation and insulin resistance
and the neurotrophic?

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:14.200
Are those the most common would you say types
of Alzheimer's disease?

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.070
[Dale]: And so this is a really good point.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:23.280
So, initially, what we saw was that many people
had this type 1.5, glycotoxicity is so common.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.920
In fact, again, Professor Getzel from UCSF
had a nice paper a few years ago showing that

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:35.830
everyone he evaluated using exosomal analysis
had the signature of insulin resistance in

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:38.470
the nervous system, whether they had it peripherally
or not.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.470
It was really striking.

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.470
[Rhonda]: Exosomal analysis.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:46.700
[Dale]: So this is exosomes that he analyzed,
and specifically, he selected the neural exosomes,

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:51.220
which represented about 10% of the overall
exosomes, and showed that they all had the

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.220
signature.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.550
This was this change in phosphorylation of
IRS-1.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.470
So clearly that's a very common thing.

01:01:56.470 --> 01:02:03.390
But what we're finding is rarely do people
have purely type 1.5, 1 or 2.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:12.320
So, although type 3, this toxin type represented
only about 15% or 20% of all of the methapure

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:20.560
[SP], over 50%, so typically in the 60% to
70% range had at least some suggestion of

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.790
the type 3.

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:28.410
So in fact, most people have some sort of
toxin exposure, pathogen exposure, that sort

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.590
of thing.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:35.620
So what it's turning out is that it's more
about what's your mixture.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.609
Are you predominantly the type 3 with a little
mixture of 1.5?

01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:46.790
And by the way, the easiest to deal with,
type 1 and 1.5, you can improve that, as you

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:47.790
can imagine, with things like resolvants.

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:48.880
[Rhonda]: Inflammation and...

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.950
[Dale]: Inflammation and glycotoxicity.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.950
[Rhonda]: ...insulin sensitivity.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:54.660
[Dale]: You can improve with diet, exercise,
sleep, stress, stuff like that.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.420
Improving the atrophic is a little harder.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.530
You've got to get all the right things, you've
gotta...many people have to go on bio-identical

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:04.869
hormones replacement, you've got to optimize
the support for your brain.

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:09.910
And then the hardest of all is the type 3
because you're having to find out...for example,

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:14.359
some people have very high ERMI scores, that's
EPA Relative Mold Index.

01:03:14.359 --> 01:03:20.130
If you've got mycootoxins being produced and
you're living in them, you need to get out

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.130
of there.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:24.030
Or if you're working in them, you need to
get out of there.

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:26.270
And until you do that you've got this chronic
exposure.

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.470
[Rhonda]: Is there a test people can do to
see if they've got this type of mold in their

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:30.470
house?

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:31.470
[Dale]: Oh yeah.

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.470
There's an easy test.

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:36.000
In fact, you can go on...I think the government
has set up this so-called EPA Relative Mold

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.060
Index, and you want to get a score that's
less than two, again, as Dr. Shoemaker recommended

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.370
years ago.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:46.720
And you can easily get it, go on mycometrics.com.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.640
They literally send you some little cloths
and you can go around and take x.areas that

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.420
you are concerned about, send it in, and they
will actually do by PCR analysis, looking

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:03.400
for evidence of these various species.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.480
And if you've got species that happen to produce
a lot of toxins, it's a concern.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.260
Then you can actually measure the toxins in
urine tests.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:15.140
So you can get an idea, and then again, you
can actually see with your detox...

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.900
[Rhonda]: Is that a consumer product that
you could get?

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.990
[Dale]: Yeah, so you can get.

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:22.250
There are a couple of companies now that do
make urinary mycotoxins tests.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:27.910
[Rhonda]: Okay, and so for people that don't,
let's say, you know, they don't have the toxin

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:33.430
exposure, or they don't think they do, but
they don't if they've done this test, the

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:38.010
things that they can do in their diet and
lifestyle to prevent the Alzheimer's disease

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:42.840
would be the major things to reduce inflammation,
which are a lot of things, diet, lifestyle,

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.370
exercise, sleep, and then again, a lot of
overlap there with improving insulin sensitivity

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:50.090
and fasting glucose levels and all that.

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:55.490
[Dale]: Getting your hemoglobin A1C down,
all those things, getting on a plant-based...and

01:04:55.490 --> 01:05:00.230
by the way, you probably know that Dr. Terry
Wahls has published a lot, and actually has

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:06.990
done a lot of studies now on using a similar
sort of approach for multiple sclerosis, and

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:13.830
has seen excellent results including in herself
with taking this sort of an approach.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:19.790
So, again, looking at the drivers, and looking
at what are we actually responding to, and

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:25.300
are we having more of an auto-immune response,
like with MS,or are we having more of an innate

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:29.490
immune system response with Alzheimer's, these
are critical for dealing with these complex

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.490
chronic diseases.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.650
[Rhonda]: Do you look at markers for gut health,
because you were talking about...

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:36.840
[Dale]: Absolutely, I mean, gut health is
one of the one of most common things.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.410
[Rhonda]: What are the major...inflammatory
markers or the...is there like an actual marker

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:42.940
for gut health that's more direct?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.190
[Dale]: Oh absolutely, oh yeah.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.400
So, there are a couple of ways to go.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.450
There is Genova test, a doctor's data test,
there are different tests, there's like stool

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:56.230
analysis sort of thing, but you can also do
Cyrex, for example.

01:05:56.230 --> 01:06:03.810
So Cyrex array 2, Cyrex has a whole set of
different markers for different antibodies.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:09.910
So, if you have a leaky gut you're often going
to respond to things like LPS coming from

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:11.330
your gut.

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:18.830
Then there's a Cyrex array 3 that looks at
various of the domains of gluten and glyodin

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.200
and so who you can look at that.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.380
And then there are various auto-antibodies,
etc.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.380
So yeah, these are very helpful to know.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.130
[Rhonda]: Can you spell Cyrex?

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.570
[Dale]: Yeah, its C-Y-R-E-X is the company
that developed these.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:30.570
[Rhonda]: Excellent.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:31.570
I haven't have heard of that one.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:37.000
So for the Genova diagnostics, is that the
metabolic metabolism test or is there a gut

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
one?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.400
[Dale]: There's a gut health one specifically,
GI effects.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:46.750
And then, so yes, so Dr. Aristo Vojdani, he's
the one who developed these various assays

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.359
for Cyrex that are now being used by the Cyrex
company, an excellent immunologist.

01:06:50.359 --> 01:06:52.090
[Rhonda]: And that's consumer available as
well?

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.180
[Dale]: And that's available, yeah.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.180
[Rhonda]: Excellent.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.270
I'll definitely check those out.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:59.550
[Dale]: So the reality is, you know, it's
an era in which just like I'm going to take

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:04.700
an Uber, for example, you don't necessarily
have to call the taxi anymore.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:10.460
In this era we can actually get a lot more
data, the quantified self is becoming more

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.760
and more popular and more and more common.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:18.810
And it's something to some extent of the responsibility
for our longevity and for our health is resting

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:19.880
more and more with us.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.960
If you want to learn more about the protocol,
please go take a look at the book, and it's

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.200
called "The End of Alzheimer's" from Random
House.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.940
And the only thing you can do is, is you can
go to the website, drbredesen.com, look at

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.180
it there.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.790
And we are responding too, there are a lot
of comments on the first book that is coming

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:47.160
out now in 26 different languages, a lot of
comments saying, "We want more specifics about

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.820
what URLs do we use?

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.820
Where do we go?"

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.180
So we're actually now putting that in a second
book that will be out next year.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.180
[Rhonda]: Excellent.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.760
Well, thank you so much for this conversation,
Dr. Bredesen, for your wonderful research.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.700
[Dale]: Yeah, thanks very much and then good
luck with your work.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:07:59.711
[Rhonda]: Thank you.
