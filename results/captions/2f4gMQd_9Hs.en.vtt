&gt;&gt; NO MUST BE NICE TO BE BACK IN

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.693 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY NICE TO BE BACK
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:04.530 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:08.201
SINCE THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU,
OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE ELECTED.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I HAVE A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.770 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:15.041
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S DAY ONE
LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO CONGRESS?

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
I HAVE A PHOTO OF YOU BEING
SWORN IN RIGHT THERE.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.046 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES, YES, YES.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.116 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE YOU ARE WITH
THE NOW SPEAKER AGAIN RIGHT

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.983 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.785 align:start position:0%
AND WHO IS THIS YOUNG WOMAN
RIGHT HERE?

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:26.419 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY MOTHER.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.588 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, HOW LOVELY.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.522 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.125 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOUR MOM GOT TO
HOLD THE BIBLE?

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:32.625 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.026 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO NICE.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start position:0%
IT WAS GREAT.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.162 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I UNDERSTAND
SOTOMAYOR WAS A BIT OF AN

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.396 align:start position:0%
INSPIRATION FOR YOU.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.166
&gt;&gt; YES, I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I
WAS GOING TO WEAR BECAUSE I KNEW

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:43.469
MY KNEELS WERE WATCHING, AND I
WANTED THEM TO KIND OF BE ABLE

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:52.311 align:start position:0%
TO INT V AN IMAGE IN THEIR MIND,
AND, SO, I WORE WHITE FOR THE

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.379 align:start position:0%
SUFFRAGETTES.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:58.484 align:start position:0%
AND WHEN SONIA SOTOMAYOR WAS
HAVING HER CONFIRMATION

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:02.355
HEARINGS, THE CONSULTANTS TOLL
HER TO WEAR A NUDE NAIL POLISH

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.726
BECAUSE WEARING A BRIGHT COLOR
WOULD ATTRACT MORE SCRUTINY.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.530
SO SHE WORE BRIGHT RED NAILS.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.765 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND I FIGURED, WHY NOT?

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:18.037 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS ANOTHER GREAT
TRADITION.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.475 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK IT WAS

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:30.082
AFTER YOUR FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE
THERE, YOU INSTAGRAMED THIS.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.585 align:start position:0%
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:36.822
&gt;&gt; SO IT WAS A REALLY BUSY DAY,
AND I GOT HOME SUPER LATE AND I

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:43.529 align:start position:0%
JUST WANTED TO EAT ICE CREAM AND
MAYBE SKIP DINNER.

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:44.964 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND YOU WERE ASKED

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.500 align:start position:0%
ONLINE WHAT FLAVOR ICE CREAM YOU
WERE EATING THERE.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:53.172 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS AMERICOAN DREAM.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
IT WAS.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:00.980 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE YOU GO.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start position:0%
YOU FOUND IT OUT, TOO.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.984 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CHEERS.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.086 align:start position:0%
PLINK!

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:11.757 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WANT TO WARN THE ACEAFFILIATES

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.298
WHO MIGHT BE GOING LONG, YOU GET
ELECTED, YOU GO IN THERE, YOUR

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.768 size:81% position:41%
FIRST DAY IN CONGRESS, THE
GOVERNMENT IS SHUT DOWN.

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.338 align:start position:0%
WHAT THE -- WHAT THE HECK IS
THAT LIKE?

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.641 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, BASICALLY --
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:33.613
-- IT'S, LIKE -- WELL, WHAT I
WILL SAY IS THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.616 align:start position:0%
THINGS WE CAN'T DO AS FRESHMAN
MEMBERS.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.152 align:start position:0%
AROUND 100 NEW MEMBERS OF BOTH
PARTIES THAT ARE COMING TO

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.889
CONGRESS AND WE CAN'T PROPERLY
SET UP OUR DISTRICT OFFICES, WE

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:49.528
CAN'T GET LAPTOPS DELIVERED, WE
CAN'T START DOING THE WORK WE'RE

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.329 align:start position:0%
ELECTED TO DO.

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:51.731 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT TAKES THE GREEN
STUFF.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THOSE WORKERS ARE
FURLOUGHED.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:58.204
SO THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT WE'RE
NOT ABLE TO GET TO WORK AS MUCH

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:02.375
AS WE WANT TO IN THE BEGINNING,
BUT THE BRIGHT SIDE IS IT GIVES

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:07.046 align:start position:0%
US A LOT MORE FREE TIME TO MAKE
TROUBLE.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.582 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:10.783 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.352
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY, IDLE HANDS ARE

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.521
THE DEVIL'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:18.624 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:19.091 align:start position:0%
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:21.327 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.695 size:81% position:41%
AND I SAID WE COULDN'T DO
THIS SO WE HAD TO FIND THE

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.964 align:start position:0%
PERSON RESPONSIBLE.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:29.035
SO CONGRESSWOMAN KATY HILL HAD
CO-WRITTEN A LETTER WITH SUSAN

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:36.976
LEE AND WE SAID WE NEED TO GIVE
IT TO MITCH McCONNELL AND LET

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.044 align:start position:0%
HIM CALL THE VOTE.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
WE KNOW WE HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO
OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.948 size:88% position:44%
IT'S DONALD TRUMP AND MITCH
McCONNELL VERSUS THE REST OF

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
THE WORLD.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:49.121 align:start position:0%
SO WE'RE, LIKE, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND HIM.

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:52.291 align:start position:0%
SO WE WENT TO HIS CAPITOL HILL
OFFICE, HIS SENATE MAJORITY

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.493
LEADER OFFICE, HE WASN'T THERE.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:57.563 align:start position:0%
THEN WE SAID, WELL, LET'S GO
EVERYWHERE HE COULD POSSIBLY BE.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.267
SO WE WENT TO THE CLOAK ROOM,
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE A SNACK

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.635 size:78% position:39%
ROOM FOR THE REPUBLICANS.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:06.505 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WE WENT TO THE SENATE FLOOR, AND

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:10.109 align:start position:0%
SENATOR JEFF MERKLY SUBMITTED
OUR LETTER TO THE FLOOR.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:13.713
SOME OF THE INCUMBENTS SAY THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME THEY REMEMBER

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:17.616
HOUSE MEMBERS GOING TO THE
SENATE FLOOR SINCE ABOUT 1992

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.054
FOR THE ANITA HILL HEARINGS IS
THE LAST TIME SOME RECALL THAT

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.222 align:start position:0%
HAPPENING.

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:26.425 align:start position:0%
WE WENT TO THE CONSTITUENT
OFFICE IN THE RUSSELL BUILDING,

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:27.827 size:84% position:42%
WE TOOK THE TRAIN THEY HAD.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE'S A LITTLE
TRAIN UNDERNEATH THE CAPITOL.

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:32.898 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:40.039
AND THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED THE
HASHTAG #WHERE'S MITCH, BECAUSE

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
WHERE IS HE?

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:44.443 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DID YOU GO TO THE

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:48.614 align:start position:0%
SENATE FLOOR AND YELL OLLIE
OLLIE OXEN FREE?

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:50.516 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY PLAN WHEN I GO
BACK.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:54.253 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU HAVE BEEN
CALLED A MEDIA VIRTUOSO.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:57.757
PEOPLE COMPARED TO THE OTHER
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, CERTAINLY

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.858 align:start position:0%
SOME OF THEM.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:05.331 size:88% position:44%
AS I WAS SAYING, YOU HAD A
LITTLE LESSON TO TEACH OTHER

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.968 align:start position:0%
MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
TO CATCH THEM UP ON SOCIAL

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:09.735 align:start position:0%
MEDIA.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.770 align:start position:0%
WHAT WERE THE LESS SUBPOENAS
LIKE?

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
WAS IT LIKE THE POWER BUTTON IS
THE THING TO --

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.674 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT WERE YOU TEACHING THEM?

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.943 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I GIVE THEM MORE OF MY
GENERAL THEORY AND APPROACH TO

00:06:17.976 --> 00:06:19.144 align:start position:0%
SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:06:19.177 --> 00:06:22.915
I SAID, YOU KNOW, RULE NUMBER
ONE IS TO BE AUTHENTIC, TO BE

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:26.352 align:start position:0%
YOURSELF AND DON'T TRY TO BE
ANYONE THAT YOU'RE NOT.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:32.124 align:start position:0%
SO DON'T TRY TO TALK LIKE A
YOUNG KID IF YOU'RE NOT A YOUNG

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:33.225 align:start position:0%
KID.

00:06:33.258 --> 00:06:36.262 align:start position:0%
DON'T POST A MEME IF YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT A MEME IS, IS

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:41.567
LITERALLY MY ADVICE, AND I SAID
DON'T TALK LIKE THE FOUNDING

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.701 align:start position:0%
FATHERS ON TWITTER.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:46.705 size:88% position:44%
IF YOU'RE A MOM WHO LIKES TO
GARDEN, TALK LIKE THAT, AND

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:47.906 size:88% position:44%
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO.

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.676
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'VE HAD A GOOD
RECORD OF RESPONDING TO PEOPLE

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.746 align:start position:0%
WHO ARE CRITICIZING YOU ON
SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.650 align:start position:0%
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE WHO YOU GO
GIVE THE BUSINESS TO?

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.351 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE NO FREE RIDES.

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:00.519 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:03.756
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SOME PEOPLE MIGHT
BE COMING AFTER YOU FOR THE

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:04.957 align:start position:0%
ATTENTION.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.959
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S AN OVERLAP OF A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:09.328 size:88% position:44%
ONE, IS IT A NOTABLE PERSON?

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.730 size:81% position:41%
USUALLY ARE THEY VERIFIED?

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:15.734
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO
AFTER SOME INNOCENT BYSTANDER

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:16.201 align:start position:0%
HERE.

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.302 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE.

00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:19.738 align:start position:0%
BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE
VERIFIED ON THE PLATFORM, IF YOU

00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:23.209
HAVE A BLUE CHECK, YOU'RE KIND
OF SIGNING UP TO BE PART OF THE

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.410 align:start position:0%
PUBLIC DISCOURSE.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.312 align:start position:0%
IF YOU HAVE A BLUE CHECK, IF
YOU'RE IN MY MENTIONS, IF YOU'RE

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:31.984 align:start position:0%
BEING SASSY IN A WAY THAT I
THINK IS UNJUSTIFIED, AND IF I

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:33.619 align:start position:0%
HAVEN'T EATEN IN TWO TO THREE
HOURS, IT'S LIKE THAT

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:35.221 align:start position:0%
COMBINATION IS --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO THE LESS YOU

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:37.723 align:start position:0%
EAT, THE FIERCER YOU ARE ON
SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:39.692 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OH, FOR SURE, FOR SURE,
EXACTLY.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:44.897 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CUT OFF.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.734 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:52.071 align:start position:0%
A BREAK RIGHT NOW, BUT IF YOU
CAN STICK AROUND, YO I WANT TO T

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.007 align:start position:0%
TO YOU ABOUT YOUR IDEA TO TAX
RICH GUYS LIKE ME.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.244 align:start position:0%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
OCASIO-CORTEZ!

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:01.214 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
