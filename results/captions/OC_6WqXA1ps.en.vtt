00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
Clemson had a pretty good day too
didn't they? And South Carolina didn't lose as

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.519
bad as they were supposed to so it was
a pretty good day all the way around.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:21.480
Let's pray. Lord, we thank you. Father
as a group we now do what your word says

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.240
we come boldly before your throne with
our petitions. Father you know I can do these

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.450
talks by myself, but they sure are better
when you do them. So we just ask you invade

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.750
this time and you own this time and you
redeem this time with your spirit. In Jesus

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.730
name, Amen.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.030
How many of you grew up like I did: not
rich?

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940
I grew up in Antioch, Tennessee a suburb
of Nashville and it was not the poor

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
end of town but it sure wasn't the rich end of
town. Just workin folk, you know what I'm

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
talking about. My dad thought work was a
verb, he didn't think it was management

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.890
theory. So when we went off to college

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.510
while was going through four years of
school we worked 40 to 60 hours a week

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
some of y'all worked when you were in college.
How many of y'all worked when you were in college? You

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.439
know what I'm talking about. And none of you
died from it, the ones that died aren't here

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.070
so...

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.150
These days they call that child abuse,
you ask your kid to work in college you

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.810
know.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.500
Little Jimmy, Little Jimmy needs to study. Little
Jimmy's playing beer pong he needs a job.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.290
So that's how I grew up and so, Sharon
and I, my wife and I we meet, we get

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.100
married, we start off with nothing. How many of y'all started off with nothing?

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.420
You remember we ain't got money honey
but we got love. Good thing too because

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.890
we ain't got any money. We were eating off a
card table, driving in 1902 Pinto. For you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.410
young people that's a car, not a bean. And
we got married, set up our first little

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.580
apartment with two nickels to rub together,
and we'd been married about a month and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.910
my wife remembers that she's a Baptist.
She neglected to tell me this when we

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.590
were dating. Never came up. But apparently
there's a doctrinal thing once your a Baptist

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.100
your always a Baptist or something I
don't know what the deal is, but so she

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.640
gets up on Sunday morning and says we're
going to church and I said we aren't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.930
doing anything I'll be here drinking
beer and watching football and um

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.489
course she cried and I'm like I
don't understand we never talked about

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.370
this before and all the sudden you just,
you know, you're a super Baptist. What's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.070
the deal? But um, so she takes off to
church and and then every

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.940
Sunday she crying go to church and these
little heathen or she'd go to these

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.130
little Baptist churches and they would
pray for her heathen husband and um, so

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.680
then I got into this multi-level thing
that I was in for about 10 years one 3

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.910
month period.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.270
and uh, you know one of those deals where
you make your friends are mad you know

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.770
that deal. and so um anyway so I was
gonna get rich me and one of my beer

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.110
drinking buddies, there's a lot of beer
in the story, but um and so we me and this

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.560
little redneck guy that I was friends
with me, two little rednecks trying to figure

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.670
out how to be how to get rich in
this business and so you know we were

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.580
out there trying to do sales calls and
we couldn't get anything to work and we

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.540
had five questions and we just knew if
we can get these five questions answered

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.440
we could you know be one of those rich
people in an MLM and we'd be having a yacht

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.950
and all this kind of stuff and you know
how they do that stuff and so we went to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.870
one of their pep rally things you know
the big thing in the convention center

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.500
and they have all the guys that are
successful gals are successful get up on

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.530
the stage and tell you how much money
they're making and I'm making $800,000

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.290
a minute or whatever
you know that stuff right.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.380
And they've all got big checks. I never got a
big check like that, I wonder if you can

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.910
get that at the bank or not but you know
they've all got this stuff and so we

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.660
finally at the end of the day the last
guy to come up I kid you not his name

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.440
was Rich.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.270
You can't make this up okay and so he
was the guy we wanted to see cause he

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.440
was the big dog right and then when he
got up there he was even cooler than we

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.150
thought and so he owned us you know I
mean like credibility city and on top of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.950
that his talk

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.180
it was like he had our five questions as
his outline he went right down them

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.060
man we're like this guy he knows everything

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.140
this is the smartest guy on the planet and then he
goes he gets tto he end of his talking he

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.930
goes and there's one more thing, and we went no there's not we got them it's five

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.570
you know and he goes no there's one more
thing if you don't know God, you're going

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.320
to struggle in business. And my buddy and
I went "Say what?!" And he said when you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.250
put on the character of Christ it
changes your character, it causes you to

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.900
want to serve rather than to take, and
you're more worthy of trust you're more

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.480
trustworthy and servants have a tendency
to win in business more than and so if you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.850
don't know God you're going to struggle
in business he does this whole talk

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.690
about God. And my buddy and I are going
I never heard anything like that

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.890
before in my life.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.900
So you know we go back, two little redneck
guys, we go back to the like the Hampton

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.500
Inn or whatever

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.680
wherever we were staying and we get out the
Gideon's Bible and it's Old King James. So

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.830
it's like Shakespeare and Jesus, right?
These and thous and thou and this and

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.550
I'm like there's no possible way these
two guys are gonna figure this out, right.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.550
So we sit there and look at it for a few
minutes and like I have no idea.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.480
We closed it. But I did go home I told my
wife I said we're going to church and

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.800
she said who are you and what have you
done with my husband? And so we visited a

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.040
couple churches and one guys asleep in
one of them and I'm like well if there's a Jesus you

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.210
shouldn't be asleep about it so um you
ought to be like excited. I like going to

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.030
churches like this where we're having fun
y'all know what I'm talking about? I mean

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.850
sometimes you're going these places and
they look like they're weaned on a

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:07.250
pickle you know I mean its life is bad
you know and so anyway this place they

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.100
you know want people raising their hands
like they knew the answer to a question

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.000
or something and you know and one
woman's up there swaying and I'm like I

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.760
told Sharon we were sitting on the back and
tell us if they get out snakes were

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.660
leaving. And uh, so pretty soon you know
we're walking through the backdoor the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.669
place and meet the pastor and his wife
was one of those sweet sweet ladies and

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.690
she just give everybody a hug that was
there and you know week after week

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.080
month after month we kept going and that
woman literally hugged us into the

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.350
kingdom. And we met Jesus there and it
changed the trajectory of my life. It

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.150
changed everything and I started we of course left that whole multi-level thing I told

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.660
you just for three months and so we
started buying and selling real estate

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.140
um I grew up in the real estate business
momma and daddy were in the real estate business

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.710
So I knew the real estate business and I'm
start doing flip this house before

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.240
there's cable TV to tell you how right
and so you know we're buying and selling

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.160
houses and we got rich. By the time I was
26 years old I had four million dollars

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.380
worth of real estate little over a
million dollar net worth and

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.270
twenty-five was my best year in that
business i made $250,000

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.260
cash taxable income that year, that's
twenty thousand dollars a month.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.070
I don't know what neighborhood you grew
up in the neighborhood I grew up and we

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.639
call that rich.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:29.699
And it was fun too. I had that car I always
wanted, you got that car you always wanted

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.669
some day when I make it I'll get that
car you know that one for me it was a

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.270
Jaguar I needed a Jaguar because nobody
in the neighborhood I grew up in could

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.520
spell Jaguar right, and so I got me a
Jaguar man you know I'm riding along

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.590
and within 90 days baby I was a Jaguar right
you know right right

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:55.319
oh man I was having fun and Sharon and I
we went to Hawaii and we liked it so we

00:07:55.319 --> 00:08:02.550
went back. She likes little sparkly things we
got her some. They weren't big enough so

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.199
we got her some more.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.229
It was fun.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:10.349
Sometimes I hear these people say "All
those rich people are miserable."

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.250
Uh-huh.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.409
Now I'm not theologically or
philosophically shallow enough to tell

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:22.180
you money will make you happy.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.580
Money will not make you happy. You get
more money it will, it will make you

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:33.610
more of what you are right now. If you
are miserable and you get money, you will

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:40.870
be lots of miserable. If you're a jerk
and you get money, big jerk. And and it

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.250
will mess with your family too

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.709
to the extent there's crazy in your family, and we all got crazy in our

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:45.670
family right?

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.149
You know, if you don't think you got
crazy in your family, it's you.

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:56.410
Okay. So everybody's got something, right?
And you put a little money on the crazy woohooo crazy

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.950
gets crazy! Y'all know what I'm talking
about? Is this real?

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.579
So your money is not gonna solve
your problems it's going to make them

00:09:03.579 --> 00:09:04.360
bigger.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.410
It's also gonna make your opportunities
bigger if you're a generous person your

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.670
generosity will go into overdrive. You'll
be outrageously generous. To the and you

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.390
get a lot of money we'll call you a
philanthropist. Cool word that means you

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.930
give a lot of it away and you have a
blast doing it. You found the most fun

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.760
you'll ever have with money is when you find
that. So you know it was it was fun

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.140
you guys but I did stupid stuff. How many
of y'all ever done somethin stupid? How many of you

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.010
didn't raise your hand and have a problem
with lying? What do you think this is a rhetorical

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.640
question?

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.839
I mean seriously? I borrowed too much
money, and our bank got sold to another

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:46.089
bank out-of-state. I know that never
happens around here. And a guy looked

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:50.589
down sitting in another state and said
there's a 26 year old kid in Nashville

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:55.360
owes us a million two hundred thousand and he's
flipping houses, we need to limit this

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.959
relationship. Which is banker talk for
ruin his life. And they called our notes.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.970
We weren't late, but they were 90 day notes so
they had the option of doing that. They

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:14.380
just said we don't want to play anymore and I
went, "What?!" That started a crash that took

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.630
took two and a half years to unfold and we
lost everything we owned. We were sued,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:28.610
we were, we were sued so many times. And
they were all right I mean I made

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.750
$250,000 one year, the next year my taxable
income was 6,000. I spent the whole year

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.110
selling stuff trying to pay my bills and
trying to honor those things that I

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.760
signed and I couldn't do it. Cause
stupid will catch you and tackle you and

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.040
I had signed up for stupid on steroids.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:52.310
I've done I mean I got a PhD in D.U.M.B. y'all.
I mean. We were sued so much that the

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.970
little guy with the Sheriff's Department that
brings those little pink lawsuit papers we're

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.550
like on a first-name basis with the old
boy.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.620
Sharon's making him cookies, you know
come on Harold. I mean, it's not his fault

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.660
bless his heart, what a job you know

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:17.180
oh man and-and-and. We had a brand-new baby
and a toddler, and our marriage is hanging

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.320
on by a thread.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.600
Y'all I was so scared I didn't know what to
do. I remember standing in the shower with it so

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.220
hot in my face I could just barely stand
there and I would just stand there and cry.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.490
I was so scared.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.100
28 years old I got babies, my poor wife.
She thought she married Sir Galahad

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.510
turns out it was Goober.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.760
I mean I had missed it up y'all, I drove  NASCAR
into the wall engines up in the stands I

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.960
mean it's it was a blow-up. I mean we
didn't get a divorce I mean number one

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.410
cause of divorce in North America today
money fights and money problems y'all know

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.750
you have a good money fight but if your a
hillbilly and you have a good money fight

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.410
it's real fight. I mean we didn't get a
divorce shall we held on to each other

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.960
but sometimes it's to get a better
grip

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.680
you know what I'm saying and I mean
she's from the hills of East Tennessee

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:12.060
frying pan throwing there is an Olympic
event. You know it's like man and finally

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:19.530
we hit bottom and we were bankrupt. I was
doing one of these new shows the other

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.980
day I do these Fox and Friends and
Good Morning America stuff and one of

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.270
those news anchors is like "You know this
is a cool story you start with nothing

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.880
you become a millionaire you lost
everything know your multi-millionaire

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.770
how did you bounce back?" I went dude
when you fall that far you really don't

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:42.750
bounce. It was more of a splat. I said I'd
like to tell you bounce back but I didn't

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.400
I set around whined and blamed everybody
else. You ever do something stupid and blame everybody

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.150
somebody else?

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.870
Yeah. Turns out McDonalds does serve hot
coffee, you know. It's like,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:13:02.140
man. We live in a, we live in a culture of victims don't we it's unbelievable and so victims of

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.580
our own stupidity all of us it's
unbelievable. And so man I sat around

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:14.440
whined. But, I tell you this: you know I met
God as I told you on the way up but I

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:22.660
got to know him on the way down. And you
I mean we were ground into powder

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.960
there was nothing left. We had a
I surrender all moment and it wasn't about

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.190
this Baptist altar call baby I mean we
surrendered. White flag.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.790
You're in charge.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:41.140
What do you want us to do? Because I
didn't know how to be a husband. I didn't

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.820
know how to be a dad.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.490
I didn't know how to handle money,
obviously. I had a degree in finance,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.630
but I got to thinking about it who was it
taught me to borrow money this was my

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.630
finance professor in college who was
broke.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:04.060
Know what's wrong with that picture? It's like
a shop teacher with missing fingers. So

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.980
you know I mean so we get this thing out
and it turns out my Heavenly Father even

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.880
in spite of my stupidity is crazy about
me. Even in spite of my black heart

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:22.420
he's crazy about me. Even in spite of my
darkness and the worst Dave that there

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:28.209
is he knows him, he still loves him. He's
crazy about me.

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:34.990
And he's got a plan and it's not to bring me
harm. But to bring me hope. And so I dove in

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.050
here hard. And I'm like okay how do you be
married?

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.320
Submit yourselves one to another. Oh no I
gotta dry dishes.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.670
Now don't spare the rod, my kid's like
"What's that Dad?" Come here baby I'll show

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:57.430
you. 2,500 scriptures on how to handle
money and possessions. And I started

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.730
reading people like Ron Blue and Larry
Burkett and Howard Dayton who were the

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.630
first guys in the Christian space in the
modern era to talk about what the Bible

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.890
says about money and I was amazed and I
started living Sharon and I started living

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.250
by those principles and they started
working. Now I won't tell you it was

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.070
instant, it was not instant. If you're
looking for instant if you want

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.280
get-rich-quick, God is not in the microwave
business he's a crockpot guy.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.380
It's gonna take t-i-m-e time, time. But
man when you start living your life this

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:32.020
way this is a compass it shows you which
ways North and you're not lost anymore. I

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.020
don't always like what it says but it's
usually because i'm wrong, hello.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:43.780
I don't know if I agree with what, with
God? [laughing] Yeah right. I had a spiritual

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.450
moment when I realized God was smarter
than me you know.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:52.000
Ok i'm probably going to do it this way
because it's working. All these years

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.750
later it does work and not only did
Sharon and I get back on our feet

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:01.240
gradually and slowly and start building
wealth again, because you know we live in

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:07.540
a cause-and-effect world what you plant
you will harvest you will reap what you

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.620
sow, right? So if you plant stupid you
will get a crop of desperate.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.760
I've done it and you know if you plant corn

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.230
don't be looking for beans to come up.
Don't be shocked by, cause what you put

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.590
into your life is what you're going to
get out. God is real clear, it's all

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.620
through Scripture, it's a cause-effect
the whole thing you know the cause

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.339
effect the theorem of cause and effect
was you know a Christian physicist

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:34.570
that discovered the Christian worldview
and so you start to understand that

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.160
that's how the universe works and our
lives are the same way and yet we live

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.310
them randomly. And we go I wonder how that
happened?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.810
Well you know you planted it six months
ago and it grew up and smacked you in

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.960
the back of the head and that's what
happens in our lives isn't it?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.730
This is real. So, we start teaching a
little Sunday School class had about 30

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.570
people in there.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.920
And then we looked up there's about 500
in there. And we took a little book and

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.040
printed it and nobody would buy it and I was selling it out of the trunk of my car in a video

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.459
store, bookstores wouldn't carry it. And
finally some bookstores started carrying

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:10.720
it, and then publishers wanted to publish
it, and then all these you know 12

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.680
million books later here we are, you know.
We start teaching a little class called

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.760
Financial Peace University and with a
bad suit and an overhead projector and now

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.089
all these years later four-and-a-half
million families have gone through it

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.620
and forty thousand churches.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.720
I mean God really knows how to take
lemons and make lemonade, doesn't He? He knows

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.780
how to take something and turn it around.
So if your life's in a mess I'm here to

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.970
tell you I got mess down.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.710
I know what mess looks like and we serve
a God who cleans up messes and seals

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:46.240
broken hearts and touches wounds and and
turns things around. And if you're too

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.590
cool for school you're smart

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:54.400
oh He'll get to you. He'll help you He'll
help you course-correct and knock the hair

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.920
off your head I'll tell you that but He'll
course-correct you. Because He loves you

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.290
He's crazy about you.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.990
So we found that there's five things
that if you do these five things with

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.920
money over a period of time like 10 or
15 years you will build a level of

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.840
wealth one hundred percent of the time.
And now I said a level of wealth I don't

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.080
know what level because I can't predict
car wrecks and cancer, I can't predict

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.920
tragedy and I don't know what your
income will be. But if you're working and

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.180
you do these five things, you will build
a level of wealth one hundred percent of

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.930
the time. And this is not some prosperity
thing and it's not mystical magical when

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.710
I cover these five things, they're all common
sense. But common sense is so rare now

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.710
it's like having a superpower.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.550
So when you plug God's common sense and
it changes everything.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.720
So let's look at the five the first one
is get on a budget. A written plan.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.010
Jesus said for which of you intending to
build a tower does not sit down first

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.970
and count the cost lest to get halfway
up and is unable to finish and all who

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.570
see him begin to mock him and say this
man began to build and was unable to

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:02.890
finish. Another Christian they can't pay
their bills. I added that last part. You

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.000
have to do a budget. On paper. On purpose.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.740
Before the month begins, every month. If
you work for a company called you

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.650
incorporated and you manage money for
you incorporated the way you manage

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.320
money for you now would you fire you,
don't answer that.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.160
And you know we misbehave with money

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.170
the Bible says he who is impulsive exalts
folly, folly is the verb of a fool in

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.950
action

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.080
he who is impulsive is a fool
in action. Been there done that. Arrow

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.250
right here. And fools you don't want to be a
biblical fool. This is not a greeting

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.120
like "Hey fool"

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.070
no this is like an idiot. You don't want to be
that kind of fool. And so we're

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.190
disorganized, we don't have a plan,
nothing's written down, and we have the

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:53.170
unmitigated gall to pray to our Heavenly
Father the maker of Heaven and Earth and

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.310
say Lord I'm misbehaving, I'm horrible,
and I'm incompetent, but send me more

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:07.720
money. To which he looks at us and says, "No." It's in the Bible. Parable of the talents.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:14.500
Master gives three servants an amount of
money to manage. Comes back later, two of them

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.810
managed it well, one of them didn't. The
one that didn't he

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.370
not only didn't give him more, he took
the money away from him who managed

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:27.970
poorly and gave it to the one that had
the most. Who had managed at the best. And

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:33.010
then there's that wealth inequality
scripture. Hahaha. That says right after

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.690
that those who are faithful in the
little things will be given more to

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.460
manage. And so my son who's 15 years old
many years ago decides he wants a

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:49.180
brand-new Corvette when he turns 16. To
which I looked at him and I said I'm a

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.380
loving Heavenly Father, except I'm not
heavenly, I'm a loving father.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.290
No, you cannot have a new Corvette.
Although that sounds like a blessing to

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.160
you my son

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.980
It's 465 horsepower, it has a fiberglass
body, it will go from zero to 60 in 3.1

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.520
seconds, you are incompetent as a driver
I've seen you drive

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.520
you will kill yourself.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.350
And until you prove your competence
we're not even going to talk about

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.150
something that ridiculous.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.080
So right now what you will get is an old
Chevette with a tired gerbil under the

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.110
hood. Because I remember when I was 16 my
first car by the time I got rid of it it

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:38.370
had been hit on all eight sides. Be
faithful in the little things, decide. The

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.550
interesting thing about each one of
these principles is, you can just decide

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.990
today to do them. Had a guy working for me
and he was not doing his process right and I

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.560
sat down and I said this is what you need to do
and he goes well I it's not the way I do

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:58.380
it and I said change. And he said well
I'm not like you and I said change. You

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:06.960
can decide today to be good at this, or
leave. Change. Change. You can decide when

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.090
you go home, you can decide to do a
budget today.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.110
Get out a yellow pad or go free budget
online every dollar com you can decide

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:19.290
today. I'm gonna start managing money
well today. Today. You can decide. Because you're

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.540
going to keep getting what you've been
getting if you keep doing what you've

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.370
been doing, you know this right?

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:28.080
Sowing and reaping. And the second one is
you need to get out of debt. Now we know

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.540
this one. You knew Dave Ramsey was going
to talk about getting out of debt.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:38.100
Because you know the Bible says the
borrower is slave to the lender. It's

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.260
real. Now

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.590
the Bible does not say that debt is a
Salvation issue. You can have a

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.950
MasterCard and go to heaven.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.279
The Bible does not say debt is a sin.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:58.380
I can't find that in there. But I have
studied this for 30-plus years and I

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.870
cannot find a single scripture anywhere
that God used debt to bless his people

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:09.419
or a single scripture anywhere that says
anything positive about debt. It always

00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:10.919
says you're a fool,

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:16.440
it's a curse, you're a slave, and then we
continue to engage in it and in our

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:21.120
intellectual minds we somehow figured
out how we are smarter than God. While

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.100
all through the Bible it basically says
debt is stupid. And those that engage in

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:32.370
stupid things are, well, stupid. And I've
been stupid I told you that so I'm not

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.690
calling you names.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.279
Here's the deal the borrower is slave to
the lender. You don't think this is so?

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:42.090
Think about this: your most powerful
wealth building tool is your income.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.169
Let me show you what slavery looks like.
This week they came out with new data

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:50.700
that shows that the average car payment in
America today according to National Auto

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:59.490
Dealers association is 499 dollars.
That's dangerously close to 500. You take

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.289
500 bucks a month and invest it from age 30 to age 70 in a decent growth stock

00:24:04.289 --> 00:24:10.500
mutual fund, You'll have 5.6 million
dollars. That's what a car payment costs you.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:18.720
So who'd you make rich? General Motors?
Ford? Lexus? I don't know who was it? You

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.309
made somebody rich. It wasn't you. And
you driving along in something you

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:25.860
can't afford scratching your head,
wondering why your kids college fund isn't

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.559
funded. Because we're giving it all to
somebody else. And they have nicer

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:35.309
furniture in their building, have you
noticed? Something's going on here guys.

00:24:35.309 --> 00:24:39.630
You know and some people in here got a student
loan's been around so long you think it's

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.480
a pet.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.480
You got Master card in your life.

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:47.960
I mean it's hard to be a slave if you
don't have a Master so you might as well.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:56.390
We've discovered bondage. And American
distress. And just keeps going and going

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.330
and have done it to y'all, I'm not
picking on anybody

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.730
I'm just saying here's the deal think
about this what if you had no payments?

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.410
Can't even get my head around that.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.540
Well you're always gonna have a car
payment, you ever hear people say that?

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.590
Little man can't get ahead, you're always
going to have a car payment so drive something

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.740
nice, YOLO. Right?

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:29.840
Which by the way is addressed in
Proverbs. Says fool right after that. See

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.299
this is how we talk when we're losing. You know we can't get ahead I sure hope we can elect a

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:41.570
president who will fix my life. Not gonna
happen. Neither one of them got the goods

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:47.780
I'll just tell you. You're in charge of
your life and you and Jesus I can do all

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.890
things through Christ who strengthens me
are the only shot you got it's the only

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.549
one is gonna work and that's what
changes. Don't be listening to these people little

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:58.880
man can't get ahead you talk to these
people you think their spirit animal is Eeyore.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.440
It's unbelievable.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.340
So how do you get out of debt?

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.690
Well you have to decide to not borrow
any more that's first step, isn't it? I have

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:14.630
we had plastic surgery at our house, we had a plastectomy. Decided we're not

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.630
borrowing money anymore.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.630
MasterCard

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.300
Capital One. What's in your wallet? Money.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:35.550
You're weird Dave. You're right, and I'm
not broke anymore either.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.570
I decided I'm not living like this.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.300
I haven't had a credit card in 30 years. You
don't have a credit card?! I don't have

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.510
a credit card. That's my wallet. Got green
President's faces.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.860
And it's got four pieces of, [applause] thank you, it's got
four pieces of plastic in here. Two debit

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.620
cards, one on my business, one on my
personal account, which will do

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.430
everything your stupid credit card will
do. I travel more than any two of you put together

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.500
shut up it works ok. Dave you're not getting 
the airline miles yeah I've met a lot of

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.590
millionaires and none of them said Dave
I made it all on my airline miles, I

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:15.480
haven't heard that one so. So I got four pieces
of plastic in here these two debit cards

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:25.080
my driver's license in my handgun carry
permit. I said that in California about

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.180
got arrested.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.180
It's good to be back in America. Um

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:41.720
They just don't speak Southern over there it's not
good for me. And the third thing once

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.380
you're out of debt then, you need to be
careful to foster high quality

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.030
relationships.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.360
What's that got to do with money?
Everything. There's a huge correlation

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.340
for those that build wealth and who they
hang around with. Because you become

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.910
who you hang around with have you
noticed that? You do! I mean I was in

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:04.309
Boston thursday night doing an event you
know those people all have an accent? You

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:07.970
become who you hang around with you
don't let your kids hang around with

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.280
little juvenile delinquents right?

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.770
If little Johnny down the streets a weed
head you don't let your kid run with

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.990
little Johnny because you know you're
gonna have a weed head in your house

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.679
right?

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:19.309
You know we know this. So you know
they come home with that mouth on them

00:28:19.309 --> 00:28:23.299
and you're going where'd you learn that?
That'll get you knocked into next week in this

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:26.450
house I mean what or do you think
you could do you get away with that? I'll

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:30.110
take you out and make another one looks
just like you you know I mean you know.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.070
It's cause they're hanging out a little
Johnny right you know what happens we're

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.690
the same way y'all. We're the same way. You
talk like the people you hang around

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:44.179
with you, you read the books they talk about,
you know if you don't read and all your

00:28:44.179 --> 00:28:45.440
friends watch The Bachelor

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.090
well here's a clue okay here's what's
going on if this is all you know about is

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:55.250
reality TV that's not a reality probably
we need to change our diet you know and

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.730
you don't read a book and so Charlie
tremendous Jones said five years from

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.010
today you'll be the same person you are
today except for the books you read the

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:06.140
people you meet. I mean don't be deceived
evil company corrupts good habits and

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:06.799
you know this

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:10.429
the studies have shown that over a 10-year
period of time that your income will

00:29:10.429 --> 00:29:14.720
approximate will become within ten to
twenty percent of the average of your 10

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.960
closest friends income. Because you have
the same habits they've got the same diet

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.950
into your self that they've got if you
want to learn scripture hang out with

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.429
people that know scripture and are
memorizing scripture you want to have a

00:29:28.429 --> 00:29:31.820
filthy mouth hang out with people with a
filthy mouth you'll have it you can't

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.679
stop yourself from doing it you will
become who you hang around with and all

00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:39.320
the studies show that we have a
tendency now that's not to say I'm some

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.080
kind of snob and I don't have any
friends aren't rich friends not that at

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.440
all

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.350
I have lots of friends but my closest
hangs are people I want to be like

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:50.549
that's my closest ones now I'll talk to
anybody but like when our daughters were

00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:53.309

00:29:53.309 --> 00:29:55.890

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.340
teaching dad all the boys and youth
group are scared of you good good keeps away

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:33.480
wusses and if I can keep both those away and
then I teach you how to keep them away

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.380
you can pick good. And guess what they
both picked good they both picked good

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.760
they're married studs man

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.200
i got some son-in-law unbelievable
love Jesus love their wife love their

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.010
kids

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:48.659
I mean fight for their family I got man my
sons in law are awesome it was an accident

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:52.559
started praying for my sons-in-law when my
daughters were born and praying still

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:57.360
praying for my son's wife because he hadn't
found her but he'll get around to it and

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.140
you know but the you see what I'm saying
y'all and you become who you hang around

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.620
with and you need to make these choices
very very carefully

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.090
the third thing or the fourth thing is
you need to save and invest. In the house

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:16.740
of the wise are stores of choice food and
oil wise people save money that's what

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.549
this means

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:21.059
oil is a sign of the Holy Spirit in the
Old Testament it was used to anoint kings

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:24.600
and it was used to keep the oil burning
in the Holy of Holies and so it was used

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.809
in the marketplace like we use green
president's faces as a medium of

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:30.809
exchange if you had a carafe of oil you
were ready to do business

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.340
it was a sign of wealth there were two
classes of people poor people and rich

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.950
people most of the people were poor
people

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.960
this is the Mediterranean we're talking
they ate hummus and olives no meat a little

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.150
bit of bread maybe maybe a fish if they
got some meat but that was it

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.870
rich people ate what we eat every day

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:56.480
spices good meat Charleston food scene
you know what I'm saying right cooking

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.100
it up right you know what I'm saying
that that's fine food stores of choice

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.809
food and oil food choice food and oil are
symbols of wealth so let's read that

00:32:05.809 --> 00:32:09.800
again in the house of the wise are
stores of money wise people save money

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.850
why well start with we say for an
emergency right grandma said she said

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:18.200
save for a what rainy day visual aid

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.550
it's gonna rain it's gonna rain

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:26.480
you're gonna have a car wreck you're gonna lose your job

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.620
something's gonna happen you're gonna need some
money

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.350
Dave you need to be positive I'm
positive it's gonna rain something's

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.740
gonna come up this one I don't
understand unexpected pregnancy say what?

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.390
ok but people come up with all kinds of
things that are emergencies right and

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.179
something's gonna happen and then you
need to save an invest so you retire with

00:32:47.179 --> 00:32:47.990
dignity

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.020
you know I'm gonna spend everything i
make and hope the government which is

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.580
well known for its ability to handle
money will take care of me dumb idea

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.570
they can't find I mean that they don't
i'm not even sure some of them have opposable

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:04.130
thumbs up there you know I'm saying it's
just ridiculous and we're counting on

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.300
them and some whacked-out kind of way to
come be that they're not coming there is

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:15.500
no white horse there is no Calvary your
it you and me and Jesus ok you are in

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:22.940
charge of your destiny and that's great
news it's great news and so I'm all worried

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.950
about the election and I'm not worried
about the election because I've made money

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.710
under both parties

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:35.510
turns out it wasn't up to them in either
case I've lost money under both parties

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.030
none of them sent me a check

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:44.570
they all just want money they're
extracting like a tick extracting blood

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.070
all the time that's all they do

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.300
this is the deal so in the house of the
wise are stores of choice food and oil by

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.679
the way the rest of that one says and a
foolish man devours all he has if you

00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:57.679
spend everything you make the Bible just
called you a fool again I've been a fool

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:01.580
call me a fool too and I decided

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.570
to change the last one is this God loves
a cheerful Giver

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.980
he loves a cheerful Giver and this is
all about generosity

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.730
oh yes it's about the tithe the tithe to
your local church you're an evangelical

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:18.060
Christian yes tithe to your local church
absolutely that's a baseline that's a

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.659
starting point but this is all about
cheerfulness it's about your generosity

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:27.990
is not just a transfer of funds
generosity is a spirit where you decide to

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:33.179
be a generous person generous people are
more attractive they smile they are not

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:37.679
grouchy it's not all about them they're
the ones that open the door they're the

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.679
ones when the grocery bag has the bottom
dropped and your groceries are rolling

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.980
all over the parking lot they're the
ones out there helping you pick it up

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.730
these are the people that when they go
out to eat after church they leave a tip

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:56.070
you cheap Christians servers don't want
even waht to work on sunday because of us

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.540
ridiculous

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.580
well us i'm not I leave big tips big tips
because it's a form of generosity when they

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.940
didn't give me good service oh shut up
carrying a tray that weighs more than

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.370
you. Figure it out.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.210
They parked your car in the rain and the heat
shut up give him some money. They park your

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.610
hundred thirty thousand dollar car and
you give them three dollars what are you

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:20.010
a nut that's Ferris Bueller parking the car
there take care of that man I get my

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:24.150
twenty-dollar bill my car still sitting
there when I come out it's amazing besides

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.150
that the guys working his way through
college or something right then and he

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.710
says better than I deserve

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.530
that's his code for I'm getting out of
debt if they say that you gotta give them a

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.690
double tip so I gave him 40 my wife's
like I'm gonna park your car and no

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.290
you're not you're not you're not working
your way out of college

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:45.420
you've already put up with me for 30
years so it's alright generosity is a

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.350
spirit

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.840
it changes everything in your life and
God loves when we are cheerful givers

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:59.100
because we're made over in His image and
he's a giver he gave His only begotten

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.130
Son. He's a giver.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:06.630
We can't call ourselves in His image
until we change our posture in our

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.870
spirit about this but it's awful tough to give
if you're broke

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.550
if you're in debt and you haven't saved
any money and you don't have a plan

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:19.290
and you're not hanging out with other
people who are givers and some change

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:26.280

your life when scripture intersects your

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.000
life

moves from your head and travels 18

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.770

because there's this great plus sign on

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.580
the scope of history and it's the cross
