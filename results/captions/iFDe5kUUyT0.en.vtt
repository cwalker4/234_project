00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.540
You are about to learn one of the
biggest secrets

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.280
in the history of the world. It's a
secret

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.540
that has huge effects for everyone who lives
on this planet.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.000
Most people can feel deep down that
something isn't quite right

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
the world economy, but few know what it is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.860
Gone are the days where a family can
survive on

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.890
just one paycheck, every day it seems things
are more and more

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.500
out of control, yet only one in a million
understand why.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.640
You are about to discover

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.200
the system that is ultimately
responsible for most of the inequality in our

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.710
world today. The powers that be do not

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.470
want you to know about this, as this system
is what has kept them at the top of

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.830
the financial food chain for the last 100
years.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.910
Learning this will change your life
because it will change the choices that you make.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.530
If enough people learn it,  it will change the world...

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.100
because it'll change the system.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.230
For this is the biggest Hidden Secret Of Money.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.820
Never in human history have so many been
plundered by so

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.900
few,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.270
And it's all accomplished through this, The
Biggest Scam

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.710
In the History of Mankind

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.590
They say that money doesn't grow on
trees

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.090
but the truth is that the modern banking
system creates currency far faster than

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.250
trees can grow.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.020
Most people don't have a clue how
currency is created

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.770
economists and bankers make it sound so
complex that people think they can't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.820
understand it.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.380
But I'm going to strip our monetary
system down to its

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.410
essence so you can see the scam behind
the curtain

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.840
and just how it affects you. Every modern
society creates currency in pretty much

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.670
the same way

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.320
but since the US dollar is the majority
of the world's currency

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.280
I'm going to use the United States as
our example. It all starts when some

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.700
politician says 'Vote for me and I'll
make sure the government provides you more

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.200
free stuff than my opponent will'

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.460
But there's no such thing as a free
lunch - so to provide that supposedly free

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.929
stuff the politicians

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.320
vote for the country to spend more than
its income. This is called deficit spending.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.890
To pay for that deficit spending the
Treasury borrows currency by issuing a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.040
bond.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.200
So what's a bond? If you think about it a
bond is really nothing but a glorified

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.709
I.O.U. It's a pretty piece of paper
with numbers printed on it that says

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.840
'Loan me a trillion dollars today and I
promise over a 10-year period

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.959
I'm gonna pay you back that trillion
dollars plus interest.'

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.260
But what you need to understand is that
Treasury bonds

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.000
are our national debt. These glorified
I.O.U.s

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.640
are to be paid back by you and I and our
descendants through future taxation.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.060
Therefore:

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.570
When the government issues a bond it
steals prosperity

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.640
out as the future so that it can spend
it today. The Treasury then holds a bond

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.550
auction

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.989
and the world's largest banks show up and
compete to buy part of our national debt

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.959
and make a profit on by earning interest.
You'll notice that as we move through

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.080
this process

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.670
the big banks are there taking a cut
every step of the way.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.430
This isn't by chance as you'll see
shortly. Then,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.050
through a shell game called Open Market
Operations the banks get to sell some of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.800
those bonds to the Federal Reserve

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.920
at a profit. To pay for the bonds the Federal
Reserve

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.680
opens up its big old checkbook and
writes bad

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.940
bogus counterfeit checks that should
bounce because they're drawn on an account that

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.709
always has a zero balance,  there isn't
one penny

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.799
in there. To quote from the Boston
Federal Reserve: 'When you are I write a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.010
check there must be sufficient funds

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.380
in our account to cover that check, but when
the Federal Reserve writes a check

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.030
there is no bank deposit on which that
check is drawn.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.940
When the Federal Reserve writes a check
it is creating money."

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.769
The Fed then hands those checks to the
banks and at this point currency

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.290
springs into existence.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.570
The banks then take that currency and
buy more bonds at the next Treasury

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.019
auction.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.600
But what is a check? A check is also
an I.O.U.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.440
When you write a check you're making a
note that says "Here's my I.O.U. for

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.060
cash,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.209
all you have to do is go to the bank and
pick it up." Now it's very very important

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.290
that you understand this process

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.989
because we're going to come back later
and show you the devastating effect this

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:20.970
has on you.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.260
The treasury issues I.O.U.s, (bonds).

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.290
The banks then buy those I.O.U.s with
currency. The Federal Reserve

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.730
then writes I.O.U.s (checks) and hands them
to the banks in exchange for the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.990
Treasury's I.O.U.s

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.670
(the bonds). And currency is created. So
what's really happening is the Federal

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.710
Reserve and the Treasury

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.610
are just swapping I.O.U.s, using the
banks as middlemen,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.290
and abracadabra presto currency
magically springs into existence.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.520
This process repeats and repeats over and
over again

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.560
enriching the banks and indebting the
public by raising the national debt.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.690
The end result is that there's a buildup
of bonds at the Federal Reserve

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.220
and currency at the Treasury. This process
is also where

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.880
all paper currency comes from. The
Federal Reserve and the government

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.570
mistakenly call it 'Base Money'

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.700
because they didn't watch Episode 1 of
this series, and they don't know the

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.020
difference between money

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.510
and currency. But I will correctly
refer to it as 'Base Currency' because

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.660
it is not money...

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.540
it is CURRENCY, and as we've learned
there is a big difference:

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.919
Money has to be a store of value
and maintain its purchasing power over

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.400
long periods of time.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.200
We learned in Episode 1 that earlier
in our history our paper currency was

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.330
just a claim check.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.140
It was a representation for real money
of intrinsic value,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.150
the gold and silver that was held on
deposit at the Treasury.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.640
You could walk into any bank and slap
your currency, like say a twenty dollar

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.140
bill

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.510
on the counter, and redeem it for real
moneyÉa twenty dollar gold piece.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.740
But now this base currency that's piling
up back here

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.670
is really nothing but a receipt or a
claim check on an I.O.U.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.900
(that bond), so it's really nothing but a
supply of numbers.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.080
The Treasury then deposits the newly
created currency in the various branches

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.550
of the government,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.700
and the politicians say "Hey thanks for
that!",

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.390
and the government does some deficit
spending on public works,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.780
social programs, and war.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.800
The government employees, contractors and
soldiers then deposit their pay in the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.390
banks.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.330
Now this may come as a shock to you, but when
you deposit your currency with the bank

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.830
you're not

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.860
actually depositing it into an account
to be safely held in trust for you.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.530
Instead, you're actually loaning the bank
your currency,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.610
and within certain legal limits they can do
with it pretty much anything they please.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.330
This includes gambling in the stock
market, and loaning it out...

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.880
at a profit of course.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.190
Now this is where the machine of currency
creation really gets cranking,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.390
because this is where something called
'Fractional Reserve Lending' comes into

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.400
play.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.410
Fractional Reserve Lending is exactly
what it says. The banks are allowed

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.490
to reserve only a fraction of your
deposit and long the rest out.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.940
Although reserve ratios may vary, I'm
going to use a 10 percent reserve ratio

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.759
as our example.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.370
If you deposit $100 dollars in your
account, the bank can legally take ninety

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.100
dollars of it and loan it out without
telling you.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.669
The bank must hold ten dollars of your
deposit in reserve

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.740
just in case you want some of it. These
reserves are called 'Vault Cash'.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.760
But why does your bank account still say
you have one hundred dollars if the bank

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.760
has stolen ninety dollars of it?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.350
Because the bank left I.O.U.s it
created called 'bank credit'

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.620
in its place. Now I know this sounds
crazy,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.550
but here it is in black and white from
the Fed: "Commercial banks create

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.710
checkbook money

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.550
when they grant a loan simply by adding
new deposit dollars in accounts

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.470
on their books in exchange for a
borrower's I.O.U."

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.550
These are nothing but numbers that the
banks type into their computers,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.240
and even though these bank credit I.O.U.
numbers

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.250
are very different from base currency
numbers (because they only exist in

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.010
computers),

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.270
they are still currency. So now there is
one hundred ninety dollars in existence.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.900
Now the reason people take out loans
from the banks is to buy something.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.970
They're going to buy a house or a car or
something like that.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.030
So the borrower takes the ninety dollars that 
the bank loaned to him from your account,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.880
and he pays the seller of item. But
then the seller deposits that currency

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.039
into his account,

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.099
and his bank loans out ninety percent of
that,

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:33.909
and leaves bank credit numbers in its
place. So now there's two hundred and

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.110
seventy-one dollars in existence.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.300
This process repeats and repeats until
under a 10 percent reserve ratio

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.720
an initial deposit of just one hundred
dollars can create up to one thousand

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.360
dollars of bank credit

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.709
all backed by one hundred dollars of vault
cash,

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:54.339
just 10 percent. But as I said reserve
ratios vary wildly...

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:57.500
on some deposits it's 10 percent on
others

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.260
its 3 percent and on some forms of deposits
reserve requirements

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.320
are zero! The result is that the expansion the
currency supply by the banks is

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.410
far greater than even this example would
lead you to believe.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.700
So once again, when currency is deposited
in the banks,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.790
the banks get to lend it out and then it
gets we redeposited and relent,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.360
redeposited and relent, redeposited and
relent

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.750
over and over again creating bank credit
all the way.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.940
This is where the vast majority of our
currency supply comes from.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.050
In fact 92 to 96 percent of

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.029
all currency in existence is created
not by the government,

00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:39.700
but here in the banking system. Now,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.820
massive amounts of currency spewing into
society may at first sound like a fun

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.589
idea...

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:48.490
that is until you remember one of the
most important Hidden Secrets Of Money

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.670
from Episode 1:

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.529
That the prices of everyday goods and
services act as a sponge

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:57.490
on an expanding currency supply. The more
currency we have

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.540
the more prices rise.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.029
This is where inflation comes from. The
true definition of inflation

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:07.970
is an expansion of the currency supply,
rising prices

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.520
are merely the symptom.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.350
So our entire currency supply is nothing
but a couple bucks whipped up in this

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.730
hocus-pocus scam

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.320
where the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve swap glorified I.O.U.s

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.880
and a bunch of numbers that the banks
just type into their computers.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.980
That's itÉthat's our entire currency supply.
It's nothing but a supply of

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.720
numbers.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.830
Some of them printed, most of them typed,

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.930
and there is nothing else. But if you
thought that was crazy,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.550
get ready to enter the twilight zone ofmodern
economics. We work for some of that

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.340
currency supply.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.260
True wealth is your time, but we trade
away moments in our lives

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.550
hour by hour, day by day, and year by year

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.440
for numbers that somebody printed on
pieces of paper or just typed into a

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.450
computer.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.410
Now those numbers represent our blood,
sweat, tears, labor,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:02.110
ideas and talent. We are what gives
the currency its value.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.720
But here comes the really cruel joke...we
work hard,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.770
so that we can save some of that currency, so
that we can pay the tax collector

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.650
(in the United States it's known as the IRS),
they then turn it over to the Treasury,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.850
so that the Treasury can pay the
principal plus interest

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.530
on that bond that the Federal Reserve bought
with a check drawn

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.530
on an account that has nothing in it.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.330
Now let's do a recap on this
section because this is where the

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.380
system begins to rob you and I

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.810
on a massive scale. Much of our taxes are
not used for schools, roads and public

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.820
services,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.210
but to pay interest on bonds that the
Federal Reserve

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.880
bought with a check drawn on an account that
has nothing

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.890
in it. The Federal Reserve is committing
FRAUD.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.490
But here's one of the biggest secrets
of them all:

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:56.040
Before the establishment at the Federal
Reserve there was no need for personal

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.790
income tax. The Federal Reserve was created
in 1913

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.940
and that very same year the Constitution

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.630
was amended to allow income tax. Do you
really think this was just a coincidence?

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.150
Ask yourself how much income tax you've paid

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.870
over your lifetime. Much of it has been
silently siphoned away

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:23.480
into the hands of those who own the
system. Yes this system has owners...

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.089
who they are is an even bigger secret
that we'll get to shortly,

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:31.220
but first we need to understand the
mumbo jumbo of the so-called

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.780
'debt ceiling'. It's all based on a huge
paradox:

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.640
There was interest due on that bond, and
there was interest due on

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.870
every one of those loans that the banks made.
That means

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.020
that there is interest due on every dollar
in existence.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.930
Let me ask you something: If you borrow
the very first dollar into existence and

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.700
that's the only dollar that exists on
the planet,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.920
but you promise to pay it back plus
another dollars worth of interest...

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.580
where you get the second dollar to pay the
interest? The answer is that you have to

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.390
borrow that one into existence

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.200
and promise to pay it back with
interest as well, so now there are two

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.490
dollars in existence

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.480
but you owe fourÉand so on and so on. 
The result is there's never enough

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.959
currency to pay the debt.

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:21.190
There is always more debt in the system

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.589
than there is currency in existence to
pay the debt. Therefore,

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:28.910
the whole system is impossible it is
finite

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:33.050
it will come to an end one day. What
would happen if the government stopped

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.760
borrowing to do deficit spending?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.130
Are the payments on those treasury bonds
going to stop?

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.900
What would happen if the public stopped
borrowing and going deeper into debt?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.910
Are your house and car payments going to
stop?

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.250
No, there is a payment due

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.350
every month on the principal plus the
interest on every dollar in existence

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.350
and those payments do not stop.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.470
If we stop borrowing then no new
currency is created to replace the

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.080
currency that we used to make those
payments.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.030
Whether you're making a payment on a
loan or paying tax to make a payment on

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.760
a bond,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.030
the portion of the payment that goes to
pay off the principal

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.990
extinguishes that portion of the debt.
But the debt also extinguishes the

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.580
currency.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.860
Currency and debt are like matter and
anti-matter.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.610
When they meet they annihilate each
other. If we just pay off the principal

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.110
only

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.740
on all the loans and bonds that exist
the entire currency supply

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.630
just vanishes. So if we don't go deeper
into debt every year

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.230
look what happens: the whole thing goes
into a deflationary collapse under the

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.000
weight of those payments.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.110
Politicians and pundits alike talk about
balancing the budget

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.170
paying down the debt and living within
our means. They don't understand that

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.440
that is deflationary,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.370
it is impossible to do under our current
monetary system without collapsing the

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.570
whole economy.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.080
This is why any talk of a debt ceiling
is not only ridiculous...

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.880
its delusional. The system is designed to
require

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.899
ever-increasing levels of debt just to
continue, and that's why politicians will

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:08.580
always

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.040
kick the can down the road and raise
this so-called

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.220
'debt ceiling' over and over again until
the whole system finally collapses under

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.250
its own weight.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.000
In other words, they don't want it to
collapse on their watch.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.600
The founding fathers of the United
States knew the dangers of central

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.850
banking and fought to free themselves
from this very thing.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.230
The revolutionary war started out as a
tax revolt,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.440
but now we must pay tax just to have a
monetary system.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.000
Having just suffered through the
hyperinflation of the Continental

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.529
Dollar

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:44.330
which was printed into oblivion to
finance the Revolutionary War,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.450
they understood the dangers of fiat
currency and debt based monetary systems.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.830
So to protect future generations from
institutional theft and

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.220
out-of-control government they wrote
into the constitution that only gold and

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.640
silver can be money,

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.750
for the simple fact that you can't print
them. Our current system is not only

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.160
unconstitutional,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.250
but it robs us of the liberty and
prosperity

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.790
our forefathers fought and died for. We
are all

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.029
feeling the effects of ignoring the
Constitution right now.

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:20.100
By forcing more currency into
circulation

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.680
our purchasing power is diluted.
Inflation

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.730
is a slow and insidious stealth tax

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.579
that is simply the result of this in
dept-based monetary system.

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:35.140
This system empowers and benefits those
who create the currency and receive it

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.760
first

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.899
as they get to spend it into circulation
before it has an effect on the economy.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:43.890
They're stealing purchasing power from
you and transferring it to the banks and the

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:44.430
government

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.149
every hour of every day because of this
false monetary system.

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:53.839
And it's not like the people at the top
don't know this. To quote the Federal Reserve

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:58.050
"The decrease in purchasing power
incurred by the holders of money

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.600
due to inflation imparts gains to the
issuers of money."

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.660
This is a fraud, it is a pyramid scheme,
it is a Ponzi scheme,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.329
it's a scam and it's a lie. Our entire
monetary system

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.929
is nothing but a form of legalized theft.
But here's the biggest con job of them all:

00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:20.459
The Federal Reserve is not federal - it
has stockholders.

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:23.770
There is no federal agency that has
stockholders.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.790
What's a stockholder? A stock
represents a percentage of

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.040
ownership in a corporation, so the
stockholders

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.770
are the owners of that corporation.
Therefore the Federal Reserve is a

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.860
private corporation with owners...

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.820
and you can see it for yourself if you
go to the Federal Reserve's website

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.120
and it will say: "The stockholders
receive an annual dividend of

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.260
six-percent." Now we know that the stock
in the Federal Reserve was originally

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.809
issued

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:53.419
to the largest banks in the United
States but because of mergers and

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:54.850
acquisitions through the years

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.230
you can't actually trace who owns the
stock in the Federal Reserve. That's a

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:03.160
very closely guarded secret. My guess
would be that the owners

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.870
are those primary dealers, the banks that
get to make a profit

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.669
by selling part of our national debt-
those bonds, to the Federal Reserve

00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:16.130
who buys them with a check from nothing!
Then WE pay tax to pay the principal

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.400
and the interest on those bonds so that
the Federal Reserve can pay the banks a 6

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.570
percent dividend.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.169
Don't be alarmed if you don't quite
comprehend the deception of this system

00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:30.540
at first glance. Very few people do. It is
purposely complex.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.640
The economist John Maynard Keynes once
wrote:

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.400
"By this means government may secretly
and unobserved

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.470
confiscate the wealth of the people and not
one man in a million will detect the

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.100
theft."

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.150
I believe that presented correctly

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.940
anyone can understand the system,
regardless of how complex it is.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.490
So let's do a recap and break it down
even more...

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.400
The way this system works is that Step 1:

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.540
The government creates glorified I.O.U.s
These bonds increase our national

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:02.919
debt,

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:06.630
and put the public on the hook to pay it
back. Step 2:

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.919
I.O.U.s are swapped to create currency. The
Treasury

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:15.830
sells the bonds to the banks. The banks
then turn around and sell our national

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.380
debt

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.669
at a profit to the Federal Reserve, which
they probably own.

00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:24.470
The Federal Reserve then opens its checkbook
that doesn't have a penny in it

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.040
and buys those I.O.U.s with I.O.U.s it
writes,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.260
checks on a checking account that has a zero
balance.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.290
Then they give those checks to the
banks and currency just springs into

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.460
existence,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.909
and then the whole process repeats. This
results in a build up of bonds at the

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:43.010
Federal Reserve,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.370
and currency at the Treasury...which is
really just a supply of numbers.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.290
The Treasury then deposits the numbers
in the various branches of the

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.140
government and we get to Step 3:

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.000
The government spends the numbers on
promises,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.870
public works, social programs and war.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.450
Then the government employees,
contractors and soldiers deposit their

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.830
pay into the banks

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.510
and we get to Step 4: Where the banks
multiply the numbers by magically

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.720
inventing more

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.530
I.O.U.s through Fractional Reserve
Lending, where they steal a portion of

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.159
everyone's deposit and lend it out.

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:21.600
That currency gets redeposited and then
a portion is stolen again,

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.700
and the process repeats over and over
magnifying the currency supply

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.190
exponentially.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.780
Then we work for some of those numbers
which brings us to Step 5:

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.090
Where our numbers are taxed. We pay taxes
to the IRS

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.220
who then turns our numbers over to the
Treasury, so the Treasury can pay the

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.560
principal plus the interest on bonds
that were purchased by the Federal Reserve

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.490
with a check from nothing. Then we get to
Step 6:

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.650
The Debt Ceiling Delusion. The system is
designed to require

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.960
ever-increasing levels and debt and will
eventually collapse under its own weight

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.570
because politicians

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:04.220
always kick the can down the road, they
don't want it to collapse on their watch.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.419
And finally Step 7: The Secret Owners
Take Their Cut.

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:12.610
The world's largest banks own the Federal
Reserve, those banks make a profit

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.190
selling our national debt top the Fed,

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.000
they make a profit when the Fed pays
them interest on the reserves held at the Fed,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.510
and the Fed pays them a six percent
dividend on their

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.559
ownership of the Fed. This system

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:31.000
is fundamentally evil. It funnels wealth
from the working population

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.860
to the government and the banking sector.
it is the cause of the artificial booms

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.870
and busts of modern economies,

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.200
and it causes great disparity of wealth
between the rich and the working class.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.740
AND - it is only possible because we no
longer use real money,

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.570
we use currency. But worst of all it is a
form of enslavement.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.150
BOND is the root word of BONDAGE.
Whenever a government issues a bond it

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.440
is a promise to make us pay tax in the
future.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.059
Nobody asked you if you wanted to pay
tax today for the prosperity we all

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:04.220
enjoyed in the last century.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.409
Nobody is asking our children if they
want to work hard in the future

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:12.640
to pay for the prosperity we're enjoying
now. George Washington once wrote to

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.159
James Madison:

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:18.040
"No generation has the right to contract
debts greater

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.909
than can be paid off during the course
of its own existence."

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:25.600
By stealing prosperity from tomorrow so
we can spend it today

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.320
we enslave ourselves and future
generations.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.870
Now this all sounds pretty bad but there
is great hope

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.710
for YOU are the greatest threat to this
false monetary system.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.360
This system relies on the public being
ignorant of its workings.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.480
Please share this knowledge with
everyone you know because an informed

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:43.990
public

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.570
that fully understands the system can
build a better future

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.490
for generations to come. And now I leave you
with this quote,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.929
widely attributed to a former Director
of the Bank Of England: "The modern banking system

00:22:56.929 --> 00:22:59.620
manufacturers money out of nothing.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.180
The process is perhaps the most
astounding piece of sleight of hand that

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.200
was ever invented.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.290
Banking was conceived in iniquity

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.760
and born in sin. Bankers own the earth.
Take it away from them,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.830
but leave them the power to create money and
control credit and with the flick of a

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.370
pen

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:21.040
they will create enough money to buy it
back again. If you want to continue as

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.310
the slaves of bankers

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:26.740
and pay the cost of your own slavery, let
them continue to create money,

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:32.140
and to control credit."

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.460
This the Federal Reserve in Washington
DC

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.650
it's located on Constitution Street, and
that is just as much a joke as the New

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.380
York Fed being located on Liberty Street.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.470
Both of them are unconstitutional both
of them limit our Liberty,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.980
and they transfer wealth away from us
every second of every day

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.790
to the Federal Reserve, to the government
and to the banking sector. YOU

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.970
are now among the one in a million that can
detect theft of your prosperity...

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.160
so the big question is, what can you do
about it?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.270
1: Watch this video until you can
describe

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.940
and teach it to others. Those who
understand the system

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.010
can make preparations for its unavoidable
collapse

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.570
and protect themselves. History shows that those
who don't

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.669
will probably wiped out. 2:

00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:25.830
Share this video with everyone,
especially those you care about. All it

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.809
takes is a mouse click or two

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:30.300
to get this message in front of millions.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.350
Post this video on Facebook, Tweet it,
email it to loved ones.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.800
Please share it wherever you can. 
3:

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.490
Join the conversation. The current world
monetary system is based on a three

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:43.810
hundred-year-old design

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.149
meant to enrich a few at the expense
of the many...

00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:51.219
there must be a better way. At
HiddenSecretsOfMoney.com

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:55.379
we've created an open source platform
for the design and development of a new

00:24:55.379 --> 00:24:58.320
world monetary system. We're calling on

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.450
every economist, every student, every
college,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.989
every bright mind and anyone who cares
to join the discussion.

00:25:05.989 --> 00:25:10.649
In educating ourselves and each other we
can prevent the further loss of our

00:25:10.649 --> 00:25:11.309
freedoms

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:15.109
and maybe, just maybe win some of them back.

00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:18.759
...

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:25.759
...

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.110
Stay tuned for Ron Paul...

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.340
ÉJim Rickards, and Steve Forbes

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:41.340
Watch more episodes at 
HiddenSecretsOfMoney.com

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.880
[Ron Paul] I think your Episode 4 is

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.260
very beneficial, very helpful, it's gonna
introduce these ideas to a lot of

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.430
people, and like I've just been talking about,

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.020
we have to change people's minds and the
more they understand it the better,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.650
and I think we're at this point now
where more people in the last

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.590
several years..four or five years have
thought about the Fed than they ever have

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.590
in the previous ninety five years

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:29.090
so I think I an explanation and diagrams
to show it is very helpful

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.630
because quite frankly they're not going
to get it in their grade school they're

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.170
not going to get in their high school

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.320
they're not going to get it in college
unless they're in a very rare

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.280
circumstance to understand

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.710
how this works. [Jim Rickards] You know for years
before I got involved in

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.140
huh really studying gold and some of the things
I write and talk about today I was a

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.980
monetary economist for decades you know
in your video you talk about the primary

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.700
dealers

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.920
I was chief counsel and chief credit officer
for one the largest primary dealers for ten

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.540
years so

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.440
I had an inside seat on the Treasury
market and have the privilege of working

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.630
with several

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.350
former Vice Chairman of the Board of
Governors: Johnson and

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.440
David Mullins going back to the 80's and
90's so I'm very immersed in what you're

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.770
talking about I thought it was

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.770
extremely accurate, extremely clear,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.120
I didn't think you were stretching on any
points it was is really like something

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:20.550
out of a

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.360
PhD course except that it was very easy
to understand, I think it's accessible,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.210
I think I think we're seeing a little
bit of a  revolution in communications in

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.730
the following sense you know as you
point out the Fed was created in 1913

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.100
well in 1913 there was no web there
was no YouTube, no Twitter

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.570
there was really no one to stand up and

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.890
oppose the Fed or call them out if you
will, or really get into a discussion

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.990
that everyday Americans could follow.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.260
That's not true now - with social media
and everything else

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.380
you can reach out to millions and
tens of millions of people and tell them

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.960
what's going onÉI think you've done that,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.660
You've done it successfully I applaud it, I think it's
a great video I

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.270
look forward to seeing it again, I know
millions of people will enjoy it.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.030
[Steve Forbes] Well as we know the

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.580
Federal Reserve believes it can 
create money out of thin air, and

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.430
not realize money is supposed to represent
real products and services

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.140
and what people don't realize is
when the Fed does that

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.700
in effect as Keynes pointed out
it's a form of taxation,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.150
it's a form of confiscation and because
people don't see it

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:27.710
the politicos get away with it, but it
also undermines social trust,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.760
it just is corrosive throughout
society.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.980
We're going to have a lot of turmoil in
the coming years,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.320
but it's going to be the kind of turmoil
that leads to positive things.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.840
So don't despair, get out there and
fight because

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.970
the tide is gonna turn. This is going to
be the statists last stand.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.430
