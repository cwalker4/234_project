00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.340
In the public mind, the First World War is
often seen as narrow-minded or stubborn officers

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.520
sending wave after wave of men to die going
over the top from the trenches.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.070
In reality, the war saw the nations fighting
it undergo the most profound and radical military

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.530
revolution I their histories.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.940
We’ve looked at several of these so far,
and today I’m to look at France.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.640
I’m Indy Neidell; welcome to a Great War
special episode about the evolution of French

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.800
infantry doctrine during the First World War.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.280
To look at that, though, you really have to
go back to France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.260
War in 1871.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.500
French leadership saw the defeat as an intellectual
one.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.969
The Prussian High Command had given its officers
a greater sense of purpose and tactical flexibility,

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.559
and that army overwhelmed a French one that
was not only underprepared, but had no clarity

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.889
of objectives or united leadership.

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:10.630
The Third French Republic completely overhauled
the military, and after 9 years of reforms

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.170
the French War Academy was founded.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.880
Garrison libraries were instituted in 1871
to promote intellectualism and initiative;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.979
there would be 200 by 1914.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.749
Soon, each branch of service had a monthly
magazine.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.670
Officers of all ranks were expected to hold
conferences and write essays.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.459
The mobilization that had been chaotic became
thoroughly planned and the railway networks

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.639
that had been poorly exploited were expanded
and fully integrated.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:44.920
But the French leadership overemphasized what
it saw as its flaws or the enemy’s virtues.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.580
The defensive stance, the passivity, and the
belief in superior equipment of 1870 became anathema.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.660
Even the adoption of the Lebel smokeless rifle
in 1886 that guaranteed accurate and lethal

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:03.439
fire on an individual level did not shake
off the anti-materialism of the new generation

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.439
of graduated officers.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.200
The concept of leadership capable of leading
the troops to victory by superior morale became

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.230
widespread, and the solution to the lethality
of the modern battlefield was simply French

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.260
élan.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.319
Now, the German military did not share this
anti-materialism, having drawn the correct

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.870
lessons from 1870-71.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.950
The British and the Russians had, by 1914,
benefitted from the lessons of the Boer Wars

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.680
the Russo-Japanese War.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.739
France of course took away lessons as well,
particular those of artillery and concealment,

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.489
but the lack of practical experience and centralized
leadership delayed implementation.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.080
By 1914, Germany had a huge advantage over
France in artillery and machine guns, and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.069
also in manpower, having outgrown France enormously
over the past three decades.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.930
To French Commander Joseph Joffre, training
always toward offense was the answer, which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.670
is sort of the opposite of the trench war
that was coming.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.849
“It is not in the excess of cautiousness
that we must search safety; but rather in

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.749
the disposition of our troops in a way that
always guarantee our combat readiness.

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:20.190
The real defense of a marching column lies
in its ability to launch an immediate counter

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.260
attack...”

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.680
While this understanding of modern war is
erroneous, it does contradict the idea that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.939
France entered the war without a doctrine
that was- in its context- coherent.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.719
The first hostilities of 1914 quickly revealed
the flaws of the system.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:43.159
On August 14th for example, near Plaine, repeated
bayonet frontal assaults were shattered by

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.930
German machine guns and artillery, while the
same day, two batteries of 75mm field guns

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.670
disregarded the rules and made a joint action
with the infantry- a fixation barrage with

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.010
outflanking movements- that forced a German
withdrawal.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.180
For the rest of 1914, the French Army was
forced to hugely adapt and evolve.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.469
Over 40% of the commanders of large units
were removed for incompetence or insufficiency

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:18.090
during this time, and already in August, GHQ
issued notes based on battle reports:

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.560
Conquered territory must be manned and defended
with artillery to prevent counter attacks

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.970
The enemy must first be engaged with skirmishers
and artillery before the main assault

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.639
The infantry must wait for artillery support,
do not let the troops needlessly expose themselves

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.199
There were more, and in early September new
instructions were issued about building trenches.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.080
However, even though French leadership had
now realized that firepower kills, assimilating

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.090
this was a work-in-progress and it was tough
to overcome the damage done by prewar military

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.270
education.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.650
General Fayolle wrote in January 1915, “I’m
having a lot of difficulties trying to organize

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.860
the construction of trenches by the troops...
my men are more interested in dying than working.”

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.919
He wrote in December that year, “The truth
is that nobody was prepared for this war of

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.340
positions... we all had the greatest disdain
for fortifications and entrenching works.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.610
Our whole education has to be reworked...

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.970
War cannot be improvised.”

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.610
The Northeastern part of the country was occupied,
and France had lost 60% of its coal and iron

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.940
mines, so 1915 was a year of frantic reforms
aimed at replenishing worn out artillery,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.780
depleted ammunitions stores, and the nation’s
crippled heavy industry.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.840
Still, Joffre launched two major offensives
to draw German divisions away from Russia

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.860
and to experiment with new ways of using artillery.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.490
They really also tried to teach the lessons
of 1914- wounded veterans replaced military

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.630
instructors and dedicated instruction centers
were created.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.099
The offensives were really the swan song-
with a few exceptions- of the old style of

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.379
leadership since the expected breakthroughs
never came.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:07.930
Fayolle again, “Our magnificent infantry
was broken by barbed wires and entrenched

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.930
artillery.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.270
Our soldiers demand new combat methods and
more combat weaponry.”

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.560
But new armament programs, organizational
reforms, and troop instruction took time,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.970
and it was only in late 1915 and 1916 that
the French army was again really innovating.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:31.180
That period saw all sorts of material upgrades,
from the Adrian Helmet to the Chauchat light

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.360
machine gun, grenade launchers, and even the
wheeled field kitchen.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.159
The French leadership devised new doctrines
for methodical battle, with cooperation between

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.919
infantry and artillery, and the primacy of
material over men.

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:52.020
The shackles of 1871 had finally been broken,
and the dramatic increase of firepower at

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.850
the divisional level and enthusiasm for experimentation
would be instrumental in turning the tide

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.900
at the Battle of Verdun.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.870
Local superiority in material, a rolling artillery
barrage, and a thoroughly trained and equipped

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.099
infantry would propel Robert Nivelle from
success at Verdun all the way to Chief of

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.270
Staff, replacing Joffre in December 1916.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:20.370
He began the modernization process that would
ultimately lead to the creation of the modern

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.330
French army, but though the men were trained
to fight within a system, and the branches

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.229
coordinated actions, his strategy was flawed,
as the speed of the infantry was subordinated

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.000
to the artillery, which could only keep up
as preparations allowed.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.069
So when Nivelle attacked on a large front
with unlimited objectives, especially against

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.689
the new German defenses the Hindenburg Line,
it was a catastrophe, made worse by Nivelle’s

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:48.110
refusal to call it off for weeks.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.150
So Nivelle was out and Philippe Petain was
in.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.409
Finally a true convinced modernist who had
been in favor of modern methods since well

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:57.680
before the war.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.040
He implemented a second rearmament program
to give the army Renault FT tanks, infantry

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.520
trucks, more planes, but more importantly,
the logistical means to properly exploit a

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.189
breakthrough of the German elastic defenses
once the critical mass of material required

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:17.490
had been secured.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:23.530
Two conditions were necessary to bring about
a war of movement in the Allies favor; guaranteed

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:30.210
local superiority in both firepower and manpower
and the motorization of the infantry and artillery

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.790
to keep the initiative during exploitation
before German reinforcements could arrive

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.320
by rail.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.380
This methodology worked well in limited offensives
like the Second Battle of Verdun and the Battle

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:48.980
of Malmaison, and really, for the first time
in the war, the French Army was truly playing

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.140
in the same league as its adversary.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.410
They now understood both German defense in
depth and infiltration tactics.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.580
However, the disaster that hit the Italians
at Caporetto and Russia leaving the war forced

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:08.080
the Entente to concede initiative to the Central
Powers, and as 1918 began they prepared for

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.000
the inevitable onslaught.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.730
If they could withstand the storm long enough
for the French armament program and the arriving

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.960
American troops to give them their two conditions,
they could win a war of movement through logistical

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.530
superiority.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.110
Germany relied increasingly on shock troops.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.890
Petain and Ferdinand Foch thought this indicated
a lack of confidence in the regular infantry,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.450
whether or not true.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:40.190
French High Command debated something similar,
but decided instead to further the integration

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.610
of different branches into a coherent, interarm
fighting force and the French Modern Infantry

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.610
was born.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.660
Still, the first half of 1918 would see the
army reel under German attacks; I mean, it’s

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.920
difficult to unlearn three years of offensive
trench warfare, but you could see- the 4th

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.900
army of General Gouraud, that diligently applied
Petain’s directives, held its ground, and

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.760
by the summer, the troops embraced battle
proven concepts.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.940
Let’s see...

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.600
Mangin’s counter attack at Matz June 11th,
for example, supported by masses of tanks

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.360
and planes, just lay waste to the German advance.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.240
Massive motorization and extensive and well-maintained
roads allowed France strategic deployment

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.030
that Germany just could not keep up with.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:31.240
In fact, German Quartermaster General Erich
Ludendorff claimed, “The Entente victory

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.630
of 1918 is the triumph of French trucks over
the German railway”.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:43.760
By August 1918, after four years of bloody
war, the French Army was the most modern fighting

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.840
force in the world, with a highly motorized
infantry, supported by 2,300 tanks, 3,800

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.170
planes, and over 10,000 artillery pieces.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:59.360
1914 had been completely reversed and the
victories of 1918 were performed by Allied

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.200
troops sharing a cohesive training and a logistical organization.
