00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.380
You know the word, "entrepreneur" is being
used so loosely nowadays that it's almost

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.830
lost its meaning, of what it really means
to be an entrepreneur.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.180
You see, over my career, I've had the opportunity
to model entrepreneurs, that their behavior

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.370
produces the results I want, but I've also
seen a lot of entrepreneurs that I watch very

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.700
closely, and their behavior didn't produce
the results that I really wanted.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.110
Now, they may have actually been a lot more
fun than "them," but I want results.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.270
I don't want to just have fun and be broke.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.699
I want to be a real entrepreneur.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.289
So today's episode, I want to talk to you
about 10 shades of wannabe entrepreneurs,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.969
and I highly, listen to me, I highly recommend
avoiding any of their behavior, because it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.179
doesn't produce long-term results.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.699
So let's get right into it.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.109
#1 One Night Stand - I call them the One Night
Stand entrepreneur.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.109
Let me explain to you what I mean by the One
Night Stand entrepreneur.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.719
If you're ever at a bar or at a restaurant
or at a party, and somebody says, "I closed

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.489
them and I did this, and guess what?

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.221
I was able to push them to do this, this,
this, and I upsold them, and I made 60% more

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.340
commission than I would have."

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.590
And they brag about it, right?

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.530
And a month later, the client cancels the
policy or the real estate transaction or whatever

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.570
it is.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.490
Now why is that?

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.899
It's because that's a one-night stand entrepreneur.

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.079
That person is not expecting to keep doing
business with this person.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.119
I had a conversation with a commercial real
estate agent recently and I told him, "I want

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.920
you to understand something here when you
do business with me.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.020
I am a very good referral source.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.439
You do business with me, I'll make you money
for the rest of your career, because I'm going

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.899
to keep doing business and I know the right
people for you.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.909
If you don't fight for me, and you try to
negotiate an additional $5,000, $6,000, $7,000

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.520
and you don't deliver for me, I hope you understand,
this will be the last that we'll ever do business

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.500
together.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.289
And this was the last time he and I will ever
do business together, this one commercial

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.289
real estate agent.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.289
Why is that?

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.420
Because he's a one-night-stand entrepreneur.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.830
He looks at a customer one time, they do business,
and then boom, wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.340
So, eventually, when you're doing business,
you've got to realize, your customers have

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.340
a pulse.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.260
Your customers want to be treated right.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100
They don't want to go to sleep with you, you
get what you want, you leave, they wake up

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.800
in the morning and you're no longer there.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
Nothing.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
They call.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.410
Nothing ever happens, no follow up ever happens.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.880
They're being left behind.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.730
As a business person, you have customers,
you have employees, you have staff, you have

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.930
sales, you have vendors, you have partners,
none of them want to be treated as a one night

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.930
stand.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.500
Unless, if both, is a mutual agreement, that
I'm okay with this, and you're okay with this.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.620
That's totally fine.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.220
But if it isn't, don't expect more business
coming back from them.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.080
There are a lot of people that treat their
business that way.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.200
I highly, highly recommend that you not do
duplicate any of their habits on what they're

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200
doing in business.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.290
#2: Let me talk about the second one.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.420
The second one I call the over under.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.451
What the over under entrepreneur -- there
was a guy I would watch, when I was coming

00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:10.250
up in business, I would watching him and think,
"This guy talks so good from stage.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.560
Man, he is like every time I talk to him,
I feel like there is no way in the world I

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.260
can compete with this guy."

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.900
But he was amazing at over promising and he
was fascinating behind closed doors at under

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900
delivering.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900
Over promise and under deliver.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.820
You could never get this guy to deliver.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.880
He would always talk a big game, and never
deliver.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.040
You know what happened to his credibility?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.250
Everybody eventually finds out about everyone's
reputation.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.820
You have a reputation, just so you know that.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.210
You watching this, you have your own reputation
that your friends and peers that are doing

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.050
business with you, they have a reputation
about you.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.410
People have an opinion about you.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.620
You, you watching this, they have an opinion
about how you do business.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.720
People have an opinion about this guy.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.730
So eventually, when I was a rookie, he could
fool me.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.350
But six months later, 12 months later, I already
knew who he was.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.280
He was an "over under."

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.940
He talked a big game, never delivered.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.180
And so there are people that over promise.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.180
Now watch this.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.210
This is kind of contradictory, but stay with
me here.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.860
There are those that over promise.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.140
What do I mean they over promise?

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.540
Let me explain to you what I mean by over
promise.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.820
In sports, there are coaches that say, there
are players that say, no one, no one, wins

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.299
at Chicago.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.710
Michael Jordan, no one beats us in home, in
the playoffs.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.940
No one does.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.940
Mike.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.940
No one does.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.580
Over promise, boom!

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.341
Put so much pressure on himself as a leader.

00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:35.080
Takes the pressure of his teammates but puts
it on himself.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.850
But you better believe behind closed doors
in the locker room, he puts pressure on everybody.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.790
Publicly, he takes it from everybody else,
so they can perform, and then when it is game

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.260
time, he wants to compete and crush the competitor
that is going against him, because he over

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.550
promises, and he over delivers.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.070
Now that's a hero.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.070
That's a hero.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.340
That's somebody that becomes a hero, a legend.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.490
Somebody that's always going to be talked
about.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.490
Not the over promise under deliver.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.350
Do not duplicate their habits.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.420
Eventually everyone talks about the fact that
you don't deliver.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.160
You simply talk a big game.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160
#3: is the Lazypreneur.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.850
Let me tell you about the lazypreneur.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.590
the lazypreneur to me are very fascinating
because typically, someone has a job.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.680
They work 9-5, they work 8-5, they work 8-6,
whatever the hours are.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.840
Then they become an entrepreneur and the first
day they come to work early, second day, third

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.490
day, fourth day, and then all of a sudden,
a week later, two weeks later, a month later,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.950
three months later, they're coming at 9:30,
then 10:00, then 10:15, then 10:30, then 11:00,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.860
then 11:30, then noon, then they leave early,
6:00, 5:00, 4:00, 3:00, and they wonder why

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.820
their business isn't working and them boom,
they're out of business.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.230
And they say, "you know, this business thing
doesn't work and it this and that," no, no,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.230
no.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.230
It's not that business doesn't work.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.830
Listen, business is a mathematical formula.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.180
Business works very easy.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.230
X + Y = 10.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.040
You've got to find the best combination of
X + Y that equals 10.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.160
It can be 9, 1, 8, 2, 5, 5, 6, 4, 0, 10 -- it
doesn't matter.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.370
7, 3, there are many ways to get the answer
10.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.500
Capitalism works.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.070
There is a formula for it.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.880
But it doesn't favor lazypreneurs.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.710
So if you really are thinking about becoming
an entrepreneur, and you don't want to be

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.280
the term that everyone's using loosely, that
no one considers this person an entrepreneur,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.389
you really want to be known as an entrepreneur,
you've got to realize that you're going to

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.490
be working long hours, for many, many years.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.590
This morning I did a Snapchat.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.590
I came out here.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.430
I've been in business for how many years?

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.860
2001, 2002, right?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.970
And today's 2016, so 14 years, 15 years.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.880
I worked out this morning.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.090
At 4:30 I go to the gym.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.090
Last night we slept early.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.190
My family's in town, my sister so I was with
them until late, and I put my son down because

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.190
he didn't want to go.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.440
He wanted to spend some time with daddy at
11:00, 11:30.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.570
Then I go to bed, at 12:00 I went to sleep.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.770
At 4:00, 4:30, I go to the gym, I work out.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.380
I come to the office.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.940
I open the office here at 6:30 and I get to
work.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.560
Now I'm doing this in my 14th, 15th year.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.650
I can simply say, I've made it already.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.210
I don't have to do this crap.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.680
But I'm an entrepreneur.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.760
And an entrepreneur is not just about the
money you make, and the cars you drive.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.960
And you've got the success and accolades and
nobody else.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.630
No, if you're a real entrepreneur, you create
value, so that other people that are doing

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.630
the same as well.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.870
You pass it down and they're growing as well.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.970
Lazypreneurs - listen.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.210
If you're not a hard-working person, stick
to having a job.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.020
If you are extremely hard-working and you
want to be in a startup type of environment,

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.370
then you can consider becoming an entrepreneur.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.610
But my challenge to you is, do not replicate
and duplicate lazypreneurs.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.590
They have a very, very difficult time in business.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.730
#4: The Get Rich Quick.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.870
You see, I had a friend of mine, many, many
years ago.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.870
He would always call me.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.740
Pat, I found something, we're going to become
millionaires in three months!

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.740
I'm telling you!

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.540
We're going to become millionaires in three
months.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.889
We're going to make $600,000 in the third
month."

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.110
And I'm sitting there talking to this guy.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.360
After the second time, third time, he would
keep telling me this, I'm like, you know what,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.720
I'm just, this is just starting to get very,
very annoying.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720
He would keep talking.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.800
I said, "Do you realize that no one believes
you?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.660
Become a millionaire in six months?"

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.060
If anybody tells you you can become a millionaire
in six months, they're full of it.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.060
They're full of it.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.120
It's like saying, "Hey, guess what, honey?"

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
"What's that?"

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.320
"Man, I found a way that we can have sex and
have a baby in a week.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320
It's awesome!

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.479
We've got to go out there and have sex and
have a baby in a week."

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.250
No, it doesn't work that way.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.979
It takes nine months.

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:30.229
It takes 40 weeks, sometimes a little sooner,
sometimes a little later.

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:33.019
But it's 40 weeks is what you've got to do.

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:38.320
Listen, in the world of business, it takes
a little bit of work.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.529
And some of these guys that are get rich quick
scheme types of sales people, they give the

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:45.930
word "entrepreneur" bad rap.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.680
This thing takes work.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.990
There's a reason why most people don't want
to be entrepreneurs.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.269
There's a reason why most people don't make
it.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:53.800
There is work that takes place.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.610
There's patience that takes place.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.730
There's a requirement for you to constantly
improve yourself.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.199
There's a requirement for you to stay somewhat
paranoid.

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:04.029
There's a requirement for you to constantly
want to get better, adapt, be willing to adapt

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:05.470
with the marketplace.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.730
Everybody wants to put you out of business.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.240
Your competitors don't want you to make it.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.889
Do you think your competitors want you to
make it?

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:11.009
They don't want you to make it.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.800
They do not want you to make it.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.600
So, when you see everyone here that I'm talking
about, you're probably thinking about somebody.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.570
The person who's the get rich quick here,
don't replicate them.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.570
Do not replicate them.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.790
They're probably the shallowest of shallowest
people in the world of business because they

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.569
give entrepreneurs a bad rap.

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.249
They're not entrepreneurs.

00:09:30.249 --> 00:09:36.529
They're get rich quick preneuers, that they
like to call themselves entrepreneurs, but

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:40.079
I highly recommend avoiding them as much as
possible.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.670
Five is the babypreneur.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.660
Let me tell you about the babypreneur.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:51.360
I'll get people that will say things like
this to me, "Oh my gosh Pat, you know, I drove

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.089
two hours and I had the presentation full
put together for three weeks.

00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:59.910
And this is the best product for them.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.540
And I drove two hours.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.649
And they said no.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:03.649
And I was crushed.

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:08.579
And on the drive home, I went to the bar and
I had a drink and it was so difficult."

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:09.920
And they're just.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.449
. . And I said, "Wait a minute.

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:13.009
Can I ask you a question?"

00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:14.009
Yes.

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:15.629
"What did you think it was going to be, being
an entrepreneur.

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:16.860
Tell me.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.100
What did you think it was going to be being
an entrepreneur?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.100
I'm really curious.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.709
Like what did you think this was?

00:10:21.709 --> 00:10:24.809
Did you think this being an entrepreneur was
like this?

00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:28.990
Uhm, I have this product to sell, and it cost
$50,000.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.279
No problem.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.889
Can I have two of them?"Did you think that's
entrepreneurship?

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:37.130
I'd like you to partner up with me and we
can go change the world together.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.420
Oh, let's do it!

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.959
I don't need to know anything.

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:46.170
Like did you think oh, you're a competitor,
you shouldn't put me out of business, because

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.649
I'm trying to to win for my friends and family.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:54.459
Oh, I'm so sorry, we are so apologetic about
putting you out of business.

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:56.490
Let us retreat the lawsuit."

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.819
That's not the world of business.

00:10:58.819 --> 00:11:07.040
In the world of business, you've got to roll
these sleeves up, put them up, and get ready.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.529
And sometimes you might get hit in the back,
when you're not even catching it.

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:11.839
You can't be a babypreneur.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.220
You're going to drive yourself insane.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.589
Get your skin thicker, and be prepared.

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:17.760
It's going to hurt sometimes.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.079
Sometimes you're going to get jumped, and
sometimes someone's going to catch you, but

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:25.449
then eventually, you kind of are watching,
you're looking, you're getting, you're seeing,

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:26.449
and then you have a team.

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:27.449
Then you have back up.

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:30.629
Then when you have backup and it's getting
thicker, then people no longer want to fight

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:31.629
you.

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:32.870
And they just say, "you know what?

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.749
Let's just not pick a fight with that guy
right now.

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:36.200
They're a little bit crazy.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.470
Let's set them aside."

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.720
But that part takes a little bit to build
your own gang.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.319
It takes a little bit to build your own gang,
your own squad.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.509
So don't be a babypreneur.

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:48.089
You're going to get hurt, it's going to sting,
you're gonna want to cry every other second

00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.949
for the first two, three, four, five years,
sometimes seven years.

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:52.459
But here's what I could tell you.

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:56.790
Eventually, you're going to get tougher and
eventually, if you really are working hard,

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.339
you're eventually going to win.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:02.500
For some it takes two years, some it takes
five years, some it takes 10 years, some it

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.500
takes 20 years.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.040
But you're eventually going to win if you
stick to it.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.110
#6: The Know It All.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.180
the know it all is a guy that I'll talk to
people and they'll say, oh yeah, so I've read

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.699
"Think and Grow Rich" and I've read, "How
to Win Friends and Influence People" and Rich

00:12:15.699 --> 00:12:16.699
Dad, Poor Dad.

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:17.860
Oh yeah, I've read all these books.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.679
They've read 14 books.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:23.689
You recommend them a new book, there's no
way in the world they're going to read the

00:12:23.689 --> 00:12:24.689
new book.

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:25.920
Oh, it's like every single one of them.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.579
You recommend another book, oh, it's probably
like every single one of them.

00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:29.579
I've read it already.

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:31.339
I kind of know what they're going to talk
about.

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:33.929
I kind of know what they're going to talk
about.

00:12:33.929 --> 00:12:34.959
I went to school, I have a degree.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.399
I already took a business degree, I know.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:40.189
. . you see, I read all this stuff already
in school because in school, they talk about

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:41.189
business.

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:44.379
I mean, you stand this much of a chance of
competing alongside other people unless you

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:46.630
snap out of it and realize that you don't
know it all.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.850
Listen, every day - I was having this conversation
last night with my sister and I said, "Look,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.449
every day, I want to get better, because I
know today there is somebody out there that's

00:12:58.449 --> 00:13:03.100
watching every single video that we're doing,
and finding out every single thing that we're

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.220
doing with PHP that wants to put us out of
business.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.490
Every single day.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.059
And I as the CEO, I must get better.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:10.490
I must improve.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.389
I must be reading these books and feed my
mind regularly to figure out a way for this

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:15.389
guy to get better.

00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:16.389
Why?

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:17.389
Because I don't know it all.

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:18.639
I don't know it all.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.670
Literally, you guys watch my YouTube videos
on Valuetainment and I believe we have the

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.980
#1 channel on entrepreneurship, but I can
tell you one thing here, just so you know.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.179
Me, as the host, I don't know it all.

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:31.850
I could be 93 years old, and still not know
it all.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.920
I can talk about my mistakes.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.189
Everything I'm talking to you about are the
mistakes I've made in business.

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:40.440
Everything I'm talking to you about, I'm talking
about my mistakes in business.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.639
I'm not talking because I'm superior to you.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.569
But I don't know it all.

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:49.161
And sometimes I talk to some people and it's
like, wait a minute, you're not even, why

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.180
do you walk like you know every single thing.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.279
And you've been -- you should be ahead.

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:55.491
Like, bring yourself down a little bit.

00:13:55.491 --> 00:13:57.439
You don't know it all.

00:13:57.439 --> 00:14:02.959
And so when you see the ones that don't know
it all, that act like they know it all, unfortunately,

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:07.329
they're typically going to hit a wall because
very few people like to be in business with

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:08.569
people who know it all.

00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:09.870
Very few people do.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.870
Eventually.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.529
And very few people ever constantly keep growing.

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:17.350
They always hit a plateau, and generally if
you hit a plateau, eventually that plateau

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.459
gets lower and lower and lower and your business
keeps getting smaller until you realize, you

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.759
don't know it all.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:24.170
So don't replicate know it alls.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.189
Act like you don't know it all and keep learning
and improving.

00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:28.689
You're going to see a lot more growth for
yourself.

00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:29.689
#7 is the partypreneur.

00:14:29.689 --> 00:14:31.220
Let me tell you about the partypreneur.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.720
Here's a party-preneur.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.439
Look, there a lot of fun.

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:50.850
They're by far, the funnest group that are
extremely.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.619
. . the partypreneurs can seduce you.

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:56.899
The partypreneurs can be like, man, you know.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:58.199
. . so why do we make money man?

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:00.209
It's to have fun, bro, so we're gonna have
fun!

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:01.910
We've go to do this.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.509
You know, man, all these other guys, that
guy's still working, he's such an idiot.

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:07.619
He's going to miss out on life!

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:09.720
He's going to miss out on life!

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720
Okay.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.999
So what the hell am I going to do at the nightclub.

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:16.889
Believe me, I can tell you right now, most
of you have probably not been to the nightclub

00:15:16.889 --> 00:15:17.889
as much as I have.

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.029
I can guarantee you this.

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:22.559
I would say 98% of you watching this, probably
haven't been to the nightclub as much as I

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:23.559
have.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:25.319
The 2% that have, more power to you.

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:27.589
But I got 98% of you beat.

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:29.649
But I wasn't an entrepreneur.

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:33.489
It was Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday
night, Saturday night, and Sunday night, for

00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:34.489
years.

00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:38.339
Until I realized, 23 years old, and I was
still wanting to party, 22, 23, I'm still

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:39.339
wanted to party.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:43.720
I'm going to Vegas every other weekend, fly,
boom, Burbank, Vegas, come back Sunday night.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.989
Party, party, party, party, party.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:52.309
Partypreneurs go broke, and partypreneurs
are wannabes.

00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:54.259
They're not real business people.

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:59.279
You're making money, just to party, you're
not really making money to build a business.

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:02.260
What is the purpose of building a business?

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.480
Just to make money and party?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.480
There's a lot of other ways to have fun in
business.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.069
So by the way, they -- if you party late,
you don't have energy in the morning.

00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:16.639
If you drink way too much, your brain is fried,
and it's tired in the morning.

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:18.149
It's not that sharp.

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:21.339
Go have six drinks and wake up in the morning
and try to come up with an idea.

00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:22.339
Look what will happen.

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:25.329
Now you may say, "when I drink, I come up
with good ideas."

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:26.829
No, when you drink, you may be loser.

00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:28.150
But you don't come up with sharper ideas.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.179
I want to be sharp.

00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:32.619
I don't want to be distracted with the partyprenuers.

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:33.619
I don't.

00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:36.959
And they are very, listen to me, they're the
most incredible recruiters.

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:39.529
They are the most incredible recruiters.

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:41.829
Most incredible recruiters.

00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:46.139
But very, very rarely do they ever make it
to the highest level in any business.

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:47.139
Very rarely.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:50.660
Because they eventually pick up way too many
habits because when you party, when you're

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.429
a partypreneur, let me give you the negative
effects of being a partypreneur.

00:16:54.429 --> 00:17:00.109
Unfortunately, those who party the most, when
you go here, who's your audience.

00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:03.129
Focused people, or unfocused people?

00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:06.049
Unfocused people -- do you think they improve
your game?

00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:08.179
Do you think they enhance your game?

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:10.909
Do you think that community is going to make
you sharper.

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:11.909
No.

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:14.380
They make you loser.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.120
They make you softer.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.939
They make you more casual.

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:21.579
When you're in an environment where everybody
is competing and everybody's in it and improving,

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.510
whether you like it or not, you're going to
improve.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.649
This is night club life, this is partypreneur
life, these are guys that want to be the greatest,

00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:33.940
they want to compete, they want to leave a
legacy, they want to die one day and the impact

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.389
they made, affects millions on top of millions
of people around the world.

00:17:38.389 --> 00:17:39.730
And history favors them.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.250
You know how favors them?

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.990
They're favored for five, 10, 15 years.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.360
Then eventually, you know what people say,
"Oh my god, he's still partying at 30 years

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360
old?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360
What is this guy doing?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.559
He's a grown man.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:55.340
Why are you partying at 30 years old?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.340
You're no longer 22.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.470
I mean, I get it at 22, 23, but 30, 40?

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.470
There are people partying at 40 years old
still.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.549
Missing the whole aspect of life, simply because
they can't drop their whole partying thing.

00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:07.440
If you've done a little bit, totally fine.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.120
I've kind of done a little bit too much.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120
But I retired.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.320
It's time to put your, you know, retire your
jersey and move on if you are in that space.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320
#: 8, the One-Hit Wonder.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320
Let me tell you about the one-hit wonder.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.660
The one-hit wonder is the guy that is living
in the past.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.190
In America, a lot of people watch this from
196 different countries.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.470
In America we call it the Al Bundy Syndrome.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:32.330
You know, when I was in high school, at the
championship game, I threw how many touchdowns?

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.769
Four touchdowns.

00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:36.240
That's what Al Bundy says, right?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.940
There are people that brag about, "I used
to make money in real estate.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.230
In 1999, I was a big real estate investor.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.700
In 03, I made a lot of money in real estate.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.840
Oh, you know back in 1992.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.389
. . no one cares.

00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:48.840
No one cares that you had one hit.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.570
Oh, you know, in 93 I made $300,000.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.260
Oh, you know in 01, here's what I did and.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.519
. . no one cares.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:56.690
What are you doing today?

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.310
In the world of business what matters is today.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.870
Now, if you've had two, three major victories,
and you're not a one-hit wonder, you're totally

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.870
fine.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.309
But if you're a one-hit wonder, I can you
Vanilla Ice.

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:13.730
I call you Macarena, my gosh, there are so
many we can go through.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:19.090
You do not want to be a one-hit wonder in
the world of entrepreneurship, because credibility

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.090
means you got lucky.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.480
But if you do it over, and over, and over,
and over again, then people say he's an expert

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.090
at what he does.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.820
#9: Number nine is, I love the last one, I
can't wait to get to the last one, but I'm

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.289
going to go to #9 first.

00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:31.289
Here's #9.

00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:33.039
I call them the stingypreneur.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:35.200
You know what's the stingypreneur?

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.529
The stingypreneur doesn't want to invest into
anything.

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:39.399
No, no, I don't need an assistant yet.

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:41.289
No, no, no, I don't need to get this office.

00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:42.419
No, no, no, we don't need.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:45.070
. . no, no, no, stingy, way, way too much.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.870
No, no, no, no, we can't do that yet.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.899
No, no, I can't get this car, no no, way too
stingy.

00:19:49.899 --> 00:19:53.669
What ends up happening when you're way too
stingy?

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:55.220
Growth slows down.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.669
And when your business goes like this.

00:19:57.669 --> 00:20:01.889
Now let me tell you, the stingy and being
frugal is a completely different thing.

00:20:01.889 --> 00:20:04.710
Let me explain, frugal is, let's negotiate.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:09.110
This cost $3,000, can we do it for $2200?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.110
$2400.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.110
That's no problem.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.110
I saved $600.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.110
That's frugal.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:18.490
But if this helps me grow the company to doing
xyz number, I don't need to be stingy.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.630
We need to get this, okay?

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.980
You know, oh, we're not going to hire this
assistant because I can't afford to pay $1500

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.980
a month.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.539
No, no, I'm going to pay only $800 a month
and you lose them.

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:28.539
No, no.

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:29.940
You need an assistant.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.299
You're way too busy.

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:35.230
And so because you didn't get the assistant,
you kept doing $10 an hour work and your business

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.230
doesn't grow.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.200
And you're wondering how come you never had
an explosion in your business.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.800
Because you keep doing $10 an hour jobs, paperwork
stuff is what you keep doing.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800
No.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.290
Stingypreneurs are truly not entrepreneurs.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.970
They're independent contractors.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.950
But they're not entrepreneurs.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:54.950
They're not entrepreneurs.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.980
Entrepreneurs invest into their business.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.340
Entrepreneurs get a support team around them.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.580
Entrepreneurs keep expanding their staff and
their supporting cast.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.490
And then eventually, they're doing the main
things that matter to grow their business.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.600
And #10, let me tell you about #10.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:15.840
#10 to me, I call them [Mario, this is the
best one, Mario.]

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.259
I call #10 the "I get around entrepreneur."

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:24.539
You know who's the I Get Around Entrepreneur?

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:28.610
The guy that wants to join everything and
sell everything.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:40.429
Man, I've met so many I get around entrepreneurs
that, wasn't there a song, I get around?

00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:47.000
Round and round we go, but Tupac.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:56.940
Okay, now Tupac, is a good song, I get it,
but in the world of business, you know, what

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.269
I'm going to do, here's what I'm going to
do.

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:00.730
I'm doing real estate.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.730
Okay, great.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.120
Oh, I heard solar panels are blowing up.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.429
So you go do solar panels.

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:07.260
Oh, you know what I heard?

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.309
What did you hear?

00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:10.099
I heard that Snapchat.

00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:13.690
. . so we're starting our own Snapchat.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.690
What are you calling it?

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:15.690
Flapchat.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.690
I don't know what you're going to call it.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.690
You know what I heard?

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.690
What did you hear?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.690
I heard that right now. . . is a very good
business to get into.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:25.240
. . There's a lot of money in Colorado right
now because you can sell these brownies, and

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.299
these brownies have stuff that make people
smile.

00:22:28.299 --> 00:22:29.570
You can make a lot of money.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.570
We've got to get into it.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.570
We've got to move to Colorado.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.600
We've got to move to Colorado and get into
the brownie business.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.860
Oh my gosh.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.190
You know what we've got to do?

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.190
What do we go to do?

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.399
All this stuff, from one thing to another
thing, to another thing.

00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:44.470
They get around so much, and you know what
the reputation of somebody is that gets around?

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.640
Not very high.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.539
People don't think too highly of people that
get around.

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:52.880
In the world of business, unfortunately, the
real business people, the real entrepreneurs,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.159
they don't think too highly of people that
get around either.

00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:59.470
So I go on and on and add you other things
on this video, but I want you to be thinking

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.350
about all these things that we talked about.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.850
Read the article about it, and from now on,
you, yourself, when you're doing business

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.850
with people, ask yourself, is this person
a real entrepreneur?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.570
Am I a real entrepreneur?

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.850
Are you a real entrepreneur?

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.850
You?

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.120
Question yourself a little bit.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120
Ask yourself.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120
Because I want to ask myself.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.620
Mario could tell you that half the time I
say, "Mario, what do you think about this?

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.320
Hey, what do you think about this?"

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320
Why?

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.320
Because I want to improve.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.320
Constantly.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.790
Hey, are we. . . we're not this any more.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.790
Are we getting better with this?

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.080
We're constantly wanting to improve.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.770
Ask yourself, are you any one of the ten.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.860
Are you a one-night stand entrepreneur.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.120
Are you the over under?

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.929
Are you the lazypreneur, the get-rich-quick
or the babypreneur, the know it all, or the

00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:45.980
one-hit wonder or the stingypreneur, or the
I get around?

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.980
Are you?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.070
If you are, and you plan on building a big
empire, I highly suggest you adjust.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.000
If you're not, keep an eye out for those who
are and don't fall for them.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.269
Don't let them fool you.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.500
Don't let them distract you.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.899
Know who's the legit, real entrepreneur and
who is not.

00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:07.519
And by the way, if somebody shared this video
with you and you didn't watch this video because

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:10.539
you're a Valuetainment subscriber, maybe you're
watching it right now because somebody shared

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:13.750
it with you, maybe they're trying to tell
you something.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.750
I don't know.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.750
Just maybe.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.240
Maybe they're trying to tell you something
and they care about you so much that they

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.260
wanted to make sure you could make a couple
of minor adjustments yourself as an entrepreneur.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.020
And so with that being said, my favorite pillow
is back.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.080
Many of you kept saying, "Pat, where is that
pillow!"

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.549
Well, Mario and the guys were on a 35-day
RV tour where they lived in an RV. Mario,

00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:37.179
we show the RV we lived in for 35 days?

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:38.179
Show the RV.

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:42.320
And they did some crazy, crazy stuff, but
they're back and the pillow is back in the

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320
videos.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.299

[Throws the pillow] Let's see if we get this
this time.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.149
Oh, Mario caught it this time.

00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:56.149
Good catch, Mario.

00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:57.149
[Thank you.]

00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:58.830
Kind of like Ken Griffey who just recently
retired and Willie Mays.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.460
Except Mario is Guatemalan, and I don't know
how much baseball you guys play in Guatemala.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.460
I've been there before.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.000
Is there baseball in Guatemala or is it more
soccer?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
[Mario: It's more soccer.]
