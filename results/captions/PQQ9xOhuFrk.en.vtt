Tell me, [inaudible] why [inaudible] little girl?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.180
She didn't even open the can.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.600
Listen to me. Listen to me. Nothing was open.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.460
No open containers.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.940
Now's not the time to argue about this, okay.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.780
Number one, you have a baby in your hands.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.760
That's my girlfriend. I should punch you in the f_ing face.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.700
Worry about her, not your girlfriend. You get that straightened out later.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.200
How old is she?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.180
These two dudes just punched her in the face though.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.680
Take a walk.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.440
Well, she tried kicking us, so. That's it.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.280
Yeah, that's fine. I go to stop her,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.640
For LL. For underage drinking.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.860
She says she's twenty.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.660
She had twisted teas.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.000
She wouldn't give me her last name.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.460
So I said, Hey if you're not gonna give me your information, you'll be locked up.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.940
She tried walking away from me.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.540
Put a struggle, walked away from me.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.840
I tried grabbing her.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.020
She tried kicking at us.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.940
So I slammed her on the ground.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.520
She kicked him.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.840
And then I just throw.. I hit her a couple times.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.340
And then I put her in cuffs.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.580
And locked her up.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.300
And I came over and backed everyone else.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.580
Why don't you guys, uh.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.260
Take a walk!

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.580
Why don't you guys go inside now.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.020
'Cause she didn't give him his last name, she started... he started [inaudible].
