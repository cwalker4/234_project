ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:09.936

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.177
HE ANNOUNCED SPACE FORCE.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.646
PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF IT, I AMONG
THEM.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:20.046 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.450 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I LIKE SPACE
EXPLORATION.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.254
I'M EXCITED ABOUT US CONQUERING
SPACE SCIENTIFICALLY AND THROUGH

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:28.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
KNOWLEDGE.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.190
WHY DO WE NEED THE SPACE FORCE?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.560
WHAT DON'T WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT
IT BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU'RE ON

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.760 align:start size:88% position:13%
BOARD.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.097
&gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE IT CAME OUT OF
TRUMP'S MOUTH, DOESN'T REQUIRE

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.066
THAT IT THEN BE A CRAZY THING.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.201
JUST-- I'M JUST SAYING.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.869

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT WHY DO WE NEED
A SPACE FORCE, NEIL?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.309
&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE A HORSE IN THAT
RACE.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:53.746
I CAN TELL THAT YOU MANY PEOPLE
ARE THINKING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.983
A SPACE FORCE BEFORE, AND NOW
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPACE

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:57.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
FORCE.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.318
WE HAVE A SPACE FORCE.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:03.656
IT'S CALLED THE UNITED STATES
SPACE COMMAND AND UNDER THE

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.657
AUSPICES OF THE AIR FORCE.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.358 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; THE AIR FORCE LAUNCHES
SATELLITES.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.530
THE AIR FORCE PUT G.P.S.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.297 size:88% position:44%
SATELLITES IN ORBIT.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.832 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NASA DIDN'T DO
THAT.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.466
THE AIR FORCE DID IT?

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.835
&gt;&gt; THE AIR FORCE DID IT BECAUSE
IT WAS A MILITARY PROJECT.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.771
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND THEY HAVE THAT
SECRET SPACE PLANE THAT STAYS UP

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.039
FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS AT A TIME?

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.175 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I CANNOT COMMENT.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.042 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY DO.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.177
IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SHUTTLE.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.745
&gt;&gt; IT'S A SECRET PLANE.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.181
WHY ARE YOU TELLINGY EVERYBODY
WHAT IT LOOK S.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.784
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY LET US SEE
IT LAND, THEY JUST WON'T TELL US

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.621
WHAT IT'S-- AND IT'S UNMANNED,
RIGHT?

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:34.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEIL!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS--
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU ACTUALLY

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.591
KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING UP THERE?

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.627
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.995 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, YOU SO KNOW.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.397
I'M GOING TO GET YOU DRUNK.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:44.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i>( LAUGHTER ).</i>

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.001
&gt;&gt; ALL I'M SAYING IS THE UNITED
STATES SPACE COMMAND IS

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.004
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE SPACE
ACTIVITIES THAT THE MILITARY HAS

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.275
ENGAGED IN FOREVER, EVER SINCE
THE 1960s, BASICALLY.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.811
AND SO TO HAVE A SPACE FORCE,
YOU JUST SLIDE IN ALL THESE

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.581
ACTIVITIES UNDER THIS NEW
UMBRELLA, AND YOU MIGHT ADD A

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
FEW THINGS.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.717
IN FACT, IF I HAD ANY SAY IN THE
MATTER I MIGHT SAY WHY DON'T YOU

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.786
THROW IN SOME ASTEROID DEFENSE.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE NEED THAT.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.890
AND WHY DON'TY YOU CLEAN UP
SPACE WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, GET

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.028
RID OF THE SPACE DEBRIS.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:20.667 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW BAD IS OUR
SPACE DEBRIS PROBLEM?

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.769
AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.073
&gt;&gt; IT'S RANDOM CHIPS OF PAINT
AND BOLTS AND NUTS-- THERE'S A

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.608
LOT OF HARDWARE IN SPACE.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:32.579
PIECES FALL OFF EVERY NOW AND
THEN, AND IF YOU'RE IN ORBIT AND

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.914 size:88% position:56%
IT FALLS OFF, THAT PIECE IS
GOING 18,000 MILES PER HOUR.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.884
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HIT BY
THAT.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A
SPACE VACUUM?

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.155
ISN'T SPACE ALREADY A VACUUM?

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.957 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOW DO YOU SUCK IT UP OUT OF
SPACE?

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:47.560
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A CLEAR SOLUTION TO
THAT PROBLEM.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.761
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE ISN'T.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start size:88% position:13%
A BIG NET.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.865
&gt;&gt; DISMATS AIR FORCE TRACKS
THESE PARTICLES SO LAUNCH

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.902
WINDOWS ARE PATROLLED WHETHER
SOMETHING WILL GET HIT OR NOT.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.838
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HONEST TO GOD,
SPACE COMMAND OR NASA THEY'RE

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.772
TRACKING, LIKE, A BOLT?

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.775
&gt;&gt; YES, WELL, DEPENDING ON THE
SIZE, YEAH, YEAH.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEY'RE TRACKING THING THAT
COULD HARM SUBSEQUENT

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:06.713 align:start size:88% position:13%
ACTIVITIES.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.149
AND ALL I'M SAYING IS THIS IS
NOT A NEW THING BECAUSE WE'VE

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.152
HAD SPACE ASSETS, MILITARY SPACE
ASSETS SINCE THE 60s.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.154
WHAT IS A SPY SATELLITE?

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:19.359
IT'S A SPACE ASSET IN THE
SERVICE OF THE MILITARY.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.064
THE 2003 GULF WAR WAS ENABLED BY
SPACE ASSET S.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:27.400 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, BUT HERE'S
MY THING IS THAT IF YOU CALL IT

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.073
A "SPACE FORCE" YOU'RE INNATELY
EMBRACING THE IDEA OF SPACE WAR.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.642
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SPACE MUSCLE.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SPACE MUSCLE,
SPACE MILL IT TIRRIZATION.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.080
ISN'T THE PROBLEM THE FUTURE IN
SPACE, WE HAVE PEACE FRONTIERS.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.582 size:88% position:56%
WE DON'T HAVE WAR FRONTIERS.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WE TRIED.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.386 align:end position:100%
IN 19 SCWEF, THERE WAS A TREATY

TODAY 107 COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED
IT.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.428
IT'S THE PEACEFUL USE OF OUTER

00:04:55.428 --> 00:05:00.366
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL-- YOU WANT TO
SING KUMBAYA.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:03.069

IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.243 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.911
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT WITH SPACE
FORCE IT'S LIKE, "YOU'RE ON YOUR

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
OWN."

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.982
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A GRAY AREA IN THERE.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.117 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT ALLOWS TO YOU DEFEND YOUR
ASSETS IN SPACE.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:21.754
SUPPOSE I HAVE A LAYS SCER
YOU'RE COMING AT ME WITH YOUR

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:24.657 align:start size:88% position:13%
BAD SATELLITE AND I TAKE YOU
OUT.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.159
WELL, THAT'S DEFENSIVE.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.262
SUPPOSE YOU'RE COMING AT ME AND
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:34.901
SOMETHING BAD AND I TAKE YOU OUT
PREEMPTIVELY, IS THAT DEFENSIVE?

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.370 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO ARE WE GOING
TO BE FIGHTING IN SPACE?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.941
IS THERE ANYBODY MILITARIZING
SPACE IN AN, OVERT WAY THAT WE

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.576
HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR?

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:48.448
&gt;&gt; WE'RE USING "MILL TIRRIZATION
OF SPACE" AND YOU'RE THINKING

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.649 size:88% position:56%
WEAPONS AND BOMBS DISPLI AM.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:53.486
&gt;&gt; ISN'T SPACE ALL RIGHT
MILITARIZED IF WE HAVE SOME

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:56.255
COUNTLESS NUMBER OF SATELLITES
IN THE SERVICE OF MILITARY

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.324
OPERATIONS ON EARTH'S SURFACE.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: COULD WE FIGHT
EACH OTHER UP THERE?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
COULD OUR SATELLITE FIGHT A
CHINESE SATELLITE?

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.898
&gt;&gt; YOU COULD, BUT IT'S KIND OF
NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, BECAUSE

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.569
IF YOU TAKE OUT THAT SATELLITE
WITH A KINETIC KILL --

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.672 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MEANING A BOMB--
&gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:12.872 align:start size:88% position:13%
BOMB.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.575
A FAST-MOVING OBJECT IS KIND OF
LIKE A BOMB.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:19.746
&gt;&gt; Stephen: FIRE ONE OF THOSE
18-MILE-AN-HOUR PARTICLES.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.217
EACH BIT IS A PROJECTILE THAT
CAN TAKE OUT YOUR OWN

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:24.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
SATELLITES.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.920
WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT
FIGHTING AND-- IT'S NOT

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.756
REALISTIC FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IN SPACE.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.625
IN FACT, THERE'S SOMETHING
CALLED THE KESSLER EFFECT,

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.427 size:78% position:39%
ADVANCED IN 1978.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.664
THE GUY CALCULATED, IF YOU HAVE
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SATELLITES

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:43.069
IN ORBIT, THERE'S A THREB HOLD,
ABOVE WHICH IF YOU TAKE OUT ONE

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.540
OF THOSE SATELLITES INTO 10
PIECES THOSE 10 PIECE WILL TAKE

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.511
OUT 10 SATELLITES AND THOSE WILL
TAKE OUT ANOTHER 10, FROM ONE TO

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:53.713 align:start size:88% position:13%
10 TO 1,000 --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S WHAT

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.982
HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE "GRAVITY."

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:56.649 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:04.257

&gt;&gt; SO, SO, IT'S A DEVASTATING
FACT THAT IF YOU TAKE OUT ONE

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:15.868
SATELLITE ABOVE A CERTAIN
THRESHOLD, ALL SATELLITES CAN

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:16.235 align:start size:88% position:13%
GO.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:21.007
AND THEN WAR IS DONE IN SPACE.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.241
SO IT'S NOT REALISTIC.

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:26.245
LIKE IN WORLD WAR I WHERE THEY
HAD MUSTARD GAS BECAUSE YOU

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
COULDN'T SHOOT PEOPLE IN THE
TRENCHES.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.285
BUT THE WIND CHANGED DIRECTION,
AND NOW THE MUSTARD GAS IS IN

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.454 size:84% position:42%
YOUR OWN DAMN FACE.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:38.524
SO CERTAIN MILITARISTIC OPTIONS,
WHICH SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THAT

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start size:88% position:13%
WOULD HAPPEN, STRATEGICALLY
WON'T HAPPEN.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.693
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BAD IDEA IN SPACE.

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:41.627 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; BAD IDEA GR I W.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.863
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT HOW WE GREW OUR SPACE

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:51.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
PROGRAM DETAILED IN YOUR NEW
BOOK "ACCESSORY TO WAR."

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:54.273
AND WE WILL BE BACK WITH THIS
AND MORE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON IN

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:54.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
JUST A MOMENT.
