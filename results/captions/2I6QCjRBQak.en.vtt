00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.491
 I am Samantha Bee,
welcome to "Full Frontal."

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:06.568
[CHEERING]

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:07.984
Thank you so much,
oh my goodness.

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:08.982
Please.

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:11.120
Woo!

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.240
This week, the
federal government

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.760
got drunk on dysfunction,
passed out, and had

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.200
a three day lost weekend.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.760
Oh man, you should see
how many federal employees

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.500
I almost fucked.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.020
And after the biggest
political crisis in days,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.720
politicians had one
important question--

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.400
whose fault was it?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.670
 Good morning, and welcome
to the Trump shutdown.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.430
 We are now engaged
in a Schumer shutdown.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.377
 This is the Trump shutdown.

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:40.210
 My favorite is still
the Schumer shutdown.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.164
 Why do women get
blamed for everything?

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:47.210
This shutdown passed
quickly, but it

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.620
only gets worse from here.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.780
A much uglier fight
over immigration

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.610
is gonna play out
in the coming weeks.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.710
Why has governing
ground to a halt

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.390
over protections for dreamers
that 86% of Americans support?

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.926
Believe it or not, the
answer isn't entirely Trump.

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.050
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.620
POTUS, seen here
asking Drew Barrymore

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.360
if she likes scary movies,
hates him some immigrants,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.180
but his specific
policy proposals are as

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310
empty as his Oval Office desk.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.560
Those come from
his senior policy

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.740
advisor, and political smallpox
blanket, Stephen Miller.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.850
You know, the guy who negged
the Statue of Liberty?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 The Statue of Liberty
says, "Give me your tired,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770
your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free."

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.630
It doesn't say
anything about speaking

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
English, or being able to
be a computer programmer.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.956
 The poem that you're
referring to was added later.

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.330
It's not actually part of the
original Statue of Liberty.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.940
 Oh, you should be
nice to Lady Liberty.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.980
She's the only woman who
will ever let you inside her.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.830
So, what's the problem
with Stephen Miller,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.807
besides the fact that
his skull looks like it's

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:57.890
trying to escape his head?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.834
I'm glad you asked.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.570
DACA isn't just some
bleeding heart liberal idea.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.300
A lot of conservatives
want to help dreamers too.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.940
In fact, Lindsey Graham
and Dick Durbin spearheaded

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.280
a immigration compromise.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.201
Trump had his Sharpie
poised to sign up.

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.450
But when they got to the
White House to talk about it,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.700
there was a surprise
meeting for them.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.150
 An aide to Dick Durbin said,
Senator Graham and Durbin

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.350
expected to have a meeting.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.720
They showed up, and there's
this, quote, "anti-immigrant

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.600
cast of characters there.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.090
And that was obviously
designed by Stephen Miller

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.160
to try to kill the deal."

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.690
 As long as Stephen
Miller is in charge

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.680
of negotiating immigration,
we're going nowhere.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.870
He's been a outlier for years.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.520
 Now if you'll
excuse me, I'm falling

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.990
behind my speed walking group.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.065
Wait up for me, Connie!

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.550
That's right, this
isn't the Trump

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.330
shutdown or Schumer shutdown.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.480
It's the Stephen
Miller shutdown.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.370
Miller is Trump's
immigration guy.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.430
And in the Trump White House,
that is a powerful position.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.810
It's like the same
level of power

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.840
as the guy who was Bill
Clinton's trim coordinator.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.460
So who is this enterprising
slime mold on the Wonder

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.990
Bread of democracy?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.430
Where did he come from?

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.760
Is he just 10,000 spiders
who really made a commitment?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.720
Steven Miller was born
in sunny California,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.065
where I assume his first
words were s-s-sick burns.

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:22.970
As early as middle
school, Miller reportedly

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.230
broke off a childhood friendship
because the friend was Latino.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.220
Wow.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.160
Even I wouldn't have hung out
with Stephen Miller in school,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.650
and I was desperate
for new members

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.270
of my Anne-Marie fan club.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.590
By high school,
Miller was a practiced

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.170
right-wing provocateur,
appearing on conservative talk

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.300
radio and running
for class president

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.096
on a platform of
"screw janitors."

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.370
 What happened to him?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.310
Did a janitor once
accidentally buff his forehead?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.410
Miller also wrote a very chill
op-ed for his high school

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.020
paper, called "A
Time to Kill," which

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.930
scolded his fellow students for
believing that Islam could be

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.230
peaceful, telling them,
"Millions of radical muslims

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.730
would celebrate your death."

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.940
[LAUGHS] Reminds me of
my 10th grade essay,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.205
"Millions of radical
Muslims would celebrate

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:29.095
me joining Bananarama."

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:32.400
I was so confident of what
Muslims thought of me.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.890
After high school, Miller
fled liberal California

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.290
for Duke University,
presumably because he thought

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.130
it was founded by David.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.440
There he was, captain of Duke's
competitive balding team,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.290
and found his niche at the
college newspaper, where he had

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.020
a regular column in which
he railed against feminism,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.410
multiculturalism, immigration,
liberal professors, the war

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.880
on Christmas, and,
once again, janitors.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.040
He published a screed
against giving the dorm

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.269
janitor a birthday card.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.310
OK, you know what, buddy?

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.893
I'm getting the
feeling that you think

00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:05.490
janitors are an ethnic group.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.170
They didn't all float here in
a dinghy from Janitoruguay.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.880
Miller's right-wing
media fame helped

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.510
propel him to the office door of
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.400
As a Sessions
staffer, Miller was

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.940
instrumental in helping to
kill the 2014 immigration bill.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.790
Then in January 2016,
Trump hired Miller and made

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.180
him his opener at rallies,
where he'd do a tight 17

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.240
minutes on how every Hispanic
immigrant is going to steal

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.670
your job and kill your
daughter, and every Muslim

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.900
is a terrorist.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.360
 We're gonna build
that wall so our kids

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.190
don't have to worry anymore
about unsafe communities.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.740
How many children
are dead because

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.210
of our sanctuary cities?

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.070
How many moms are
grieving because

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.390
of our sanctuary cities?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.090
We've seen example after
example, in the Somali refugee

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.610
program, of individuals
becoming radicalized

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.050
and joining terrorist groups.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.210
They say he's too
tough on crime.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.220
And he's too tough on
illegal immigration,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.060
and he's too tough on
radical Islamist refugees.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.830
 Congrats to Stephen
Miller for being

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.160
the first person in history
ever to utter the phrase

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.730
radical Islamist refugees.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.010
And congrats to me for being
the first person in history

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.190
to die of douche chills.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.110
After their act did
so well on the road,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.880
Trump brought Miller
to the White House

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.600
as his senior policy advisor
and Secretary of foreheads,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.780
where he's been intimately
involved in crafting Trump's

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.780
scariest messages and
creepiest positions--

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.450
from the attempted
Muslim ban to the refusal

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.100
to reauthorize DACA.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.830
Stephen Miller is a real
American success story.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.920
He worked hard, and
stayed true to himself,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.780
and achieved his dreams.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.260
He is the exact
same racist asshole

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.570
he's been since
childhood, but now he

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.030
has the president's ear
and the power to ruin

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.350
thousands of people's lives.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.490
I really have a bone to
pick with the guy who wrote

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.760
"never change" in his yearbook.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.070
Schumer and McConnell
better figure out

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.840
a way to separate
him from Trump,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.940
before they're asked
to pass the janitor

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.740
immigration bill of 2018.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.740
We'll be right back.
