00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:09.235
(dramatic music)

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.028
- [Roy] Many bombers employed
by the commanders during

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:53.195
World War II became famous,
but very few became legendary.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.057
A great aircraft needed
a quality which cannot

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.194
be installed on the drawing
board or in the factory.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.893
A truly great aircraft must
have that touch of genius

00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:06.231
which transcends the good and above all

00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:09.401
it must have a great deal of luck.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.574
Luck to be in the right
place at the right time.

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:16.436
It must have flying qualities
well above the average,

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:20.431
reliability, ruggedness,
and fighting ability.

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.152
And in the final analysis
it needs the skittle touch

00:01:23.152 --> 00:01:27.457
of its air crews to which
it has endeared itself.

00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:30.301
All these things in more,
the Avro Lancaster had

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.634
in good measure.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.116
Despite its power operated turrets,

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:40.941
those abominations which
plagued the war time

00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:44.003
bomber designers, striving
for cleanliness of line,

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.741
the Lancaster embodied a measure of grace

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:49.770
which actually made it
pleasing on the eye.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.775
Its sleek aerodynamic shape
contributed materially

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:55.997
to its excellent all around performance.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:02:00.465
But like so many good airplanes,
the essence of its design

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.203
was its simplicity.

00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:04.971
Its robust structure being ideally suited

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.193
for mass production.

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.284
And this was undoubtedly
one of the main features

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:09.617
for its success.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.058
It was also remarkably adaptable
and the superlative bomber

00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:14.308
on every count.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.656
(dramatic music)

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.808
At first, using 4,000 pound
bombs and smaller weapons,

00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:29.917
the Lancaster carried the
warning to the heart of Germany.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:32.912
It wasn't long, however, before it became

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:35.903
the major offensive weapon of the RAF.

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:40.658
By April, 1942, it was
carrying the 8,000 pound bomb

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:44.658
and by 1943 it progressed
to the 12,000 pounder.

00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.708
In the early days, navigation
was largely by dead

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:53.773
reckoning and bomb aiming
was entirely visual.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:58.372
Gradually radar navigational
aides such as Rebekah,

00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:03.170
Gee, and Oboe became available
and the H2S radar bombing

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.490
equipment with its distinctive
semi-opaque blister

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.657
beneath the rear fuseal arch
became a standard fitting.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:19.135
The most remarkable
offensive weapon to be used

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:22.520
by the Lancaster was
perhaps the bouncing bomb

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.481
which was to be used on
one of the Lancaster's most

00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.898
spectacular and daring raids.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.011
It was dropped by the
immortal 617 squadron

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.956
on the strategically important
Mona, Aida, and Sorpay

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:36.206
damns in Larue.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:49.906
Wartime commander Bomica
Bon, Sir Arthur Harris

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:53.359
heralded the Lancaster as
the finest bomber of the war

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.976
and added, its efficiency
was almost incredible,

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.176
both in performance and in
the way it could be saddled

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.106
with every increasing bomb
loads without breaking

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.439
the camels back.

00:04:13.183 --> 00:04:15.186
The Lancaster far
surpassed all other types

00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:17.280
of heavy bomber.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.984
Not only could it take heavier loads,

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:22.464
it was also easier to handle
and far more important

00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:25.424
to the crews, the casualty
rate was also consistently

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:27.257
lower than the others.

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:33.134
Of all those great airplanes
which fought out the war,

00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:35.636
there are many people
who would insist that

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.636
the Avro Lancaster was the greatest.

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:48.429
In contrast to the
Lancaster the angularly ugly

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:51.362
Armstrong Whitley or the Flying Barn Door

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:53.868
as it was known, was a
familiar sight to people

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:55.820
living on Britain's east
coast during the early years

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.457
of the war.

00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.782
The Whitley was the mainstay
of the RAF bomber force

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:02.387
for the first two years in which the seeds

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:05.327
of strategic night
bombing were being sewn.

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:07.517
Although one of the least
appealing bombers of the war,

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:10.685
the Whitley did represent
an important landmark

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:14.768
in the history of the
RAF's offensive capability.

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:19.969
Few, if any bombers of
the second World War,

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.733
enjoyed a longer or more
distinguished operational

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:26.111
career than the Vicker's Wellington.

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:27.878
Bloodied in combat at the
very outset of hostilities,

00:05:27.878 --> 00:05:31.873
it carried the lion's share
of RAF bomber commands,

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.811
night bombing offensive
until the operational debut

00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:37.762
of the four engine heavies
and it was still in

00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:40.399
the front line when the war ended.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.149
(dramatic music)

00:06:01.512 --> 00:06:03.955
Indeed, such was the
brilliant battle record

00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:06.709
of the Wellington that any tribute can be

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:09.099
but a pale reflection of the distinctions

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.945
that this remarkable war
plane won for itself.

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.964
The Wellington's docility
combined with a lively

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:18.710
performance and the ability
to absorb an outstanding

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.527
amount of battle damage,
rapidly endeared it

00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:24.604
to its crews and its
portly well fed appearance

00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:28.382
engendered the nickname
Wimpy, after the strip

00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:29.929
cartoon character.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:32.679
(dramatic music)

00:06:44.814 --> 00:06:46.921
More than any other bomber,
the Wellington proved

00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:49.060
a power operated gun
carry to be a formidable

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.335
defensive weapon, but it
disproved the widely held

00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:55.507
belief that large bombers could undertake

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:57.947
daylight bombing rates against
heavily defended targets

00:06:57.947 --> 00:06:59.864
without fighter escort.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:05.226
(dramatic music)

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:21.722
Like most successful combat aircraft,

00:07:21.722 --> 00:07:24.468
the Wellington was a result of teamwork,

00:07:24.468 --> 00:07:26.821
but it undoubtedly owed its success

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.018
to the revolutionary geodetic
or basket weave system

00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:32.061
of construction.

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.978
This was an ingenious idea by Boms Wallace

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:36.694
and even more remarkable because of its

00:07:36.694 --> 00:07:38.444
essential simplicity.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.286
Before the end of 1939, the
Wellington was to achieve

00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:07.957
one doubtful distinction.

00:08:07.957 --> 00:08:10.034
It was to teach the RAF the hard lesson

00:08:10.034 --> 00:08:13.265
that the operation of such
large aircraft by daylight

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:17.158
without fighter escort was impractical.

00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:20.131
This lesson was driven home
when 10 Wellingtons were lost

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:24.295
and three badly damaged
out of a formation of 24.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.328
Making an armed reconnaissance
rate on Wilhelm's

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:28.661
initially grows.

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:32.554
The Wellington was from
then on never again used

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:37.263
by daylight unescorted
except in coastland transport

00:08:37.263 --> 00:08:38.517
commands.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.267
(dramatic music)

00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:53.629
With its transfer to a
nighttime bombing run,

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:55.856
the Wellington operated
with conspicuous success,

00:08:55.856 --> 00:08:58.553
spearheading the RAF's night offensive

00:08:58.553 --> 00:08:59.979
against Germany.

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:02.729
(dramatic music)

00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:11.494
The Wellington was an airplane worthy of

00:09:11.494 --> 00:09:13.471
the Royal Air Force.

00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.718
All with the distinction the
name of Great British soldier.

00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:19.875
Other bombers came forward
as the war progressed

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.875
but none enjoyed a finer reputation.

00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:33.407
When in the summer of 1936
the Bristol Blenin made

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.233
its debut it was immediately
hailed as a major

00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:39.313
step forward in combat
aircraft design which placed

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:41.436
the British aircraft
industry in the forefront

00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:44.019
of fast day bomber development.

00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:48.126
It was the first modern, all
metal Cantaleva Mona plane

00:09:48.126 --> 00:09:51.241
of stress in construction,
to be placed in production

00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.098
for the Royal Air Force
and as such, it noted

00:09:54.098 --> 00:09:57.466
the beginning of a new
era in the equipment

00:09:57.466 --> 00:09:58.466
of that era.

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:33.359
For several years acute
uneasiness had existed

00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:36.551
concerning the obsolescence
of the RAF's operational

00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:38.057
equipment.

00:10:38.057 --> 00:10:41.890
Uneasiness accentuated
by developments abroad.

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.401
The emergence of the
Blenin, representing such

00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:47.957
a tremendous technical
advance over the air craft

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:52.124
which it superseded, did
much to still this disquiet.

00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:55.966
More than any other airplane,
it sounded the death smell

00:10:55.966 --> 00:10:58.249
of the fighting bi-plane.

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:00.532
It set a pattern in
the light bomber design

00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:02.361
which other nations
were not slow to follow,

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:05.453
yet the Blenin was fated never to fulfill

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:09.036
the very high hopes
that were placed in it.

00:11:35.627 --> 00:11:38.355
One of the key types
selected by the air industry

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.806
for the re-equipment of
the rapidly expanding RAF

00:11:40.806 --> 00:11:44.763
of the late 30s, the Blenin,
at the time of its service

00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:47.232
introduction was
possessed of a performance

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.738
which enabled it to
outplace most contemporary

00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:51.155
service fighters.

00:11:53.516 --> 00:11:56.342
He at such was the pace of
combat aircraft evolution

00:11:56.342 --> 00:11:59.906
during those last two
years of peace in Europe,

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:02.689
that when the RAF went
to war in September 1939,

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:05.725
it soon discovered that the
Blenin was not the weapon

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.475
that it had supposed.

00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:12.690
Its shortcomings soon
manifested themselves

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.943
in the hard school of aerial combat.

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:20.110
It was to prove woefully
vulnerable to fighter attack.

00:12:21.402 --> 00:12:23.694
It was to be found deficient
in both defensive armament

00:12:23.694 --> 00:12:24.527
and armor.

00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:27.519
Nevertheless it was to bear the brunt

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.726
of much of the fighting
on every front to which

00:12:29.726 --> 00:12:32.195
the RAF was committed
for the first three years

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:34.195
of the second World War.

00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:39.321
Despite its limitations it
was to serve valorously.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:42.071
(dramatic music)

00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:57.564
A parallel might be
drawn between the Blenin

00:12:57.564 --> 00:12:59.147
and the Curtis P40.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.316
Like the American fighter
it was praised and abused,

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:06.816
lauded and vilified,
but it was all that was

00:13:06.816 --> 00:13:09.475
available and however divergent were views

00:13:09.475 --> 00:13:12.200
of the effectiveness of
the Blenin as a weapon,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.367
it was one of the truly
historic aircraft at the war.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:22.968
The short Sterling was
not merely the first

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.343
of the Royal Air Force
true heavies of the second

00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:28.174
World War it was the only
British four engine bomber

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.769
designed from the outset
to take four power plants,

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:35.598
to see operational service
during the conflict.

00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:38.231
The Lancaster and Halifax
having both stemmed from

00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:39.898
twin engine designs.

00:13:40.748 --> 00:13:43.165
(drum music)

00:13:46.588 --> 00:13:48.748
Carrying bomb loads far
greater than any previously

00:13:48.748 --> 00:13:51.882
contemplated, the Sterling
proved one of the most

00:13:51.882 --> 00:13:54.830
important landmarks in
the history of the RAF.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.613
Yet the official history
of the RAF and the second

00:13:58.613 --> 00:14:03.216
World War was to refer to the
Sterling as a disappointment.

00:14:03.216 --> 00:14:05.633
(drum music)

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.416
In consequence, its career as a first line

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.118
heavy bomber was relatively brief.

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:18.926
Nevertheless, as the
RAFs four engine heavy

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.501
of the second Word War,
the Sterling occupied

00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:23.950
a particularly important
place in the history

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.283
of that air arm.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:32.366
The Avro Manchester, the
predecessor of the Lancaster

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:34.817
was not a successful bomber.

00:14:34.817 --> 00:14:37.934
It proved to be unreliable
and underpowered.

00:14:37.934 --> 00:14:40.710
Only 209 were built and
production of the type

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.460
lasted barely a year.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.713
The handedly page Halifax
after some initial

00:14:49.713 --> 00:14:53.880
teething problems did develop
into an outstanding aircraft.

00:14:57.099 --> 00:14:59.390
Remaining in service
until the end of the war,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.395
the Halifax maintained its position

00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:06.228
of one of the two principle
RAF heavy bombers.

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:15.086
The Hampden was one of
the world's most advanced

00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:17.399
war planes at the time of its debut

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:20.051
and it came off a distinguished line.

00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:22.986
It was a forgiving airplane
from the pilot's viewpoint

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.300
and its ease of control
rendered it an extremely

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.654
pleasant airplane to fly.

00:15:27.654 --> 00:15:29.440
With it small enough to
be highly maneuverable,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.317
its cockpit offered an
excellent fighter like

00:15:32.317 --> 00:15:36.484
field of vision and it possessed
a remarkable speed range.

00:15:39.145 --> 00:15:41.744
Named after William
Mitchell the far sighted

00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:44.932
crusading American cornel
of the 20s who was court

00:15:44.932 --> 00:15:47.338
marshaled for his outspoken
views on air power

00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:50.708
and posthumously raised
to the rank of General,

00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:53.879
the North American B25
was possibly the best

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:56.376
all around light medium
bomber of the second

00:15:56.376 --> 00:15:57.209
World War.

00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:05.829
Operationally efficient,
this docile adaptable machine

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:08.074
had an excellent all around performance

00:16:08.074 --> 00:16:11.016
and with particularly good
handling characteristics,

00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:13.754
and it was one of the most
popular of combat aircraft

00:16:13.754 --> 00:16:16.004
among all allied air crews.

00:16:17.753 --> 00:16:19.829
Had the Mitchel never
attacked another objective,

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:22.640
it would have ranked among
the most truly historic

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.280
air craft of the war
for its fantastic attack

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.617
against Tokyo in 1942 when it operated

00:16:27.617 --> 00:16:30.867
from the flight deck of the USS Hornet.

00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:34.767
It was manufactured in larger quantities

00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:37.625
than any other American
twin engine bomber.

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:41.293
No less than 9,816
Mitchel's being accepted

00:16:41.293 --> 00:16:44.627
by the USAAF, although
many of these were destined

00:16:44.627 --> 00:16:46.956
to find their way to the British, Soviet,

00:16:46.956 --> 00:16:49.289
and other allied air forces.

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:53.019
The peak number of Mitchels
in the USAAF service

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:57.186
never exceeded 2,656 aircraft,
but this exceptionally

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:01.653
fine bomber made its mark
on every far flung front

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.974
of the second World War.

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:06.724
(dramatic music)

00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:13.002
While at the select
band of allied aircraft

00:19:13.002 --> 00:19:15.194
that could claim to have
been engaged on every major

00:19:15.194 --> 00:19:17.363
battlefront of the second World War,

00:19:17.363 --> 00:19:20.997
the Mitchel built up an
unbridled tradition of service.

00:19:20.997 --> 00:19:24.324
There can be few more dramatic examples

00:19:24.324 --> 00:19:27.170
of the consistent development
or the basic design

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.545
under the exigencies of
war, then that offered

00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.672
by this remarkable
aircraft which was destined

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.865
to linger on in the service
of many of the worlds

00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:37.782
air arms far into the post war era.

00:19:44.711 --> 00:19:48.211
- [Man] 317 on a control at three o'clock.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.774
- [Man] Come on you guys.

00:19:53.774 --> 00:19:55.323
Get out of that plane, bail out.

00:19:55.323 --> 00:19:57.064
There's one he come out of the bomb bank.

00:19:57.064 --> 00:19:58.171
- [Man] Yeah I see him.

00:19:58.171 --> 00:19:59.701
- [Man] There's a tail gunner coming up.

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.118
- [Man] Watch out for firing.

00:20:03.692 --> 00:20:05.024
Keep your eye on him Bill.

00:20:05.024 --> 00:20:06.395
See any parachutes with them.

00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:09.145
- [Man] No, none at nine o'clock.

00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:14.220
Eight and nine is still in that B17.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.380
- [Man] Come on the rest of you guys,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.797
get out of there.

00:20:18.636 --> 00:20:20.817
- [Man] 12 o'clock.

00:20:20.817 --> 00:20:22.567
109 at three o'clock.

00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:38.599
- [Roy] Few other aircraft
of the second World War

00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:41.349
gained the universal
affection of the air crew

00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:44.194
over so long an operational period

00:20:44.194 --> 00:20:46.777
as did the Boeing B17 fortress.

00:20:48.586 --> 00:20:50.954
This legendary aircraft
formed the spearhead

00:20:50.954 --> 00:20:53.741
of the American bombing
offensive in Europe.

00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:56.204
From beginning to end as
well as serving in every

00:20:56.204 --> 00:20:57.954
other theater of war.

00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.812
No single aircraft type contributed more

00:21:09.812 --> 00:21:13.070
to the defeat of the
Luft Fafa both in the air

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.858
and on the ground than the Fortress,

00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:18.004
which enabled tangible
expression to be given

00:21:18.004 --> 00:21:20.493
to the controversial United States policy

00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:22.737
for the strategic
assault of Germany by day

00:21:22.737 --> 00:21:25.386
and the face of formidable
political argument

00:21:25.386 --> 00:21:28.553
as well as desperate enemy opposition.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.162
A curious feature of
the fortresses history

00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:41.556
is that its reputation
is the leading allied

00:21:41.556 --> 00:21:44.365
day bombers established
despite its inferiority

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:47.622
in many respects of
performance, compared with its

00:21:47.622 --> 00:21:50.872
combat contemporary, the B24 liberator.

00:22:00.082 --> 00:22:03.027
The bomb load of USAAF
fortresses over Europe

00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:05.952
was usually no more than
carried by the diminutive

00:22:05.952 --> 00:22:07.535
Dehavealan Moscito.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.671
Far fewer fortresses then
liberators were built.

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:23.421
12,677 fortresses being
accepted by the USAAF

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:27.352
between July 1940 and August 1945.

00:22:29.082 --> 00:22:32.407
These equipped a maximum of
33 overseas combat groups

00:22:32.407 --> 00:22:33.657
by August 1944.

00:22:43.978 --> 00:22:45.777
The fortress achieved fame
on the strength of several

00:22:45.777 --> 00:22:47.694
outstanding attributes.

00:22:48.757 --> 00:22:50.967
Of these, perhaps the most important

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:53.572
were an excellent high altitude capability

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:56.496
and the ability to
absorb an amazing amount

00:22:56.496 --> 00:22:57.913
of battle damage.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.765
To these attributes were
added in its later variance,

00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:04.985
an exceptionally heavy defensive armament.

00:23:04.985 --> 00:23:06.901
Though the true combat
potential of the fortress

00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:11.068
is achieved only after a
long period of gestation.

00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:16.136
(drum music)

00:23:19.514 --> 00:23:22.429
The fortress had dropped
over 640,000 tons of bombs

00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:26.643
on European targets during the war years.

00:23:26.643 --> 00:23:31.284
This compares with 452,508
tons dropped by the B24

00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:35.451
liberators and 463,544 tons
dropped by all other aircraft.

00:23:38.781 --> 00:23:41.198
(drum music)

00:23:48.056 --> 00:23:50.541
According to records compiled
by its manufacturers,

00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:55.245
the fortress destroyed 23 enemy
aircraft per thousand sorted

00:23:55.245 --> 00:23:59.412
as compared to 11 by B24
liberators, 11 by United States

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.616
fighters, and three by
all United States light

00:24:03.616 --> 00:24:05.199
and medium bombers.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.308
Although it has been
established that the very high

00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:13.068
claims of enemy aircraft
kiddle scored by the fortress

00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:16.206
were greatly exaggerated,
there can be no doubt

00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:18.706
that the total was formidable.

00:24:20.641 --> 00:24:23.460
By its almost unrivaled
period of first line service,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.530
the fortress proved itself
one of the classic bomber

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.197
designs of all time.

00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:32.137
Its performance proved
a triumphant vindication

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:35.073
of the principles of air
strategy and bomber design

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:37.933
established by a few far
sighted airmen and engineers

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:41.267
in the United States
of America, long before

00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:42.350
World War II.

00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:49.546
While the Boeing Super
Fortress gained for itself

00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:52.190
undying fame as the first aircraft to drop

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.511
an atomic weapon, thus bringing about

00:24:54.511 --> 00:24:57.371
the sudden termination of
hostilities in the Pacific.

00:24:57.371 --> 00:25:00.271
It is also deserving of
a place in the history

00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:02.803
of aircraft warfare as one
of the principal allied

00:25:02.803 --> 00:25:05.553
weapons in the war against Japan.

00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:09.314
The laborious and costly
island hopping campaign

00:25:09.314 --> 00:25:11.343
conducted in the Pacific
by the allied forces

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:14.887
was undertaken largely to seize bases

00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:17.068
for super fortress operations against

00:25:17.068 --> 00:25:19.060
the Japanese homeland.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.997
Once bases had been established,
the super fortresses

00:25:21.997 --> 00:25:24.670
of the United States 20th Air Force

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.925
systematically and inextricably
raised the industrial

00:25:27.925 --> 00:25:32.092
cities of Japan one by one
with a terrible weapon of fire.

00:25:34.678 --> 00:25:37.413
The closely packed and
lightly constructed Japanese

00:25:37.413 --> 00:25:41.812
buildings were extremely
vulnerable to incendiary attacks.

00:25:41.812 --> 00:25:43.993
Now the destruction
wreaked by super forces

00:25:43.993 --> 00:25:48.286
in some built up areas
amounted to as much as 99.5%.

00:25:48.286 --> 00:25:51.750
In addition to these
devastating blows against

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.103
strategic targets, the
super fortresses were

00:25:55.103 --> 00:25:58.201
simultaneously employed on
a highly successful campaign

00:25:58.201 --> 00:26:01.971
of mine laying in Japanese
home waters, thereby applying

00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:05.343
an economic and logistic strangle hold to

00:26:05.343 --> 00:26:07.093
the islands of Nipon.

00:26:09.207 --> 00:26:11.179
The delivery of the two atomic bombs

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:13.896
against Hiroshima and
Nagasaki was therefore

00:26:13.896 --> 00:26:17.228
in the nature of a cous
de gras although essential

00:26:17.228 --> 00:26:18.811
to shorten the war.

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:24.372
(peaceful music)

00:27:59.338 --> 00:28:01.807
The super fortress was largely responsible

00:28:01.807 --> 00:28:04.141
for the final defeat
and surrender of Japan

00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.431
without invasion and the instrument which

00:28:07.431 --> 00:28:09.905
provided the ultimate
vindication of the American

00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:12.963
visionaries of strategic air power.

00:28:12.963 --> 00:28:16.031
The super fortresses made
an immense contribution

00:28:16.031 --> 00:28:18.634
to subsequent bomber design.

00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:21.411
It was the second World War's
heaviest production war plane

00:28:21.411 --> 00:28:24.131
and the first pressurized aircraft

00:28:24.131 --> 00:28:27.417
to obtain large scale production.

00:28:27.417 --> 00:28:29.447
It was also the first
to make extensive use

00:28:29.447 --> 00:28:32.947
of remotely controlled
armament but perhaps the most

00:28:32.947 --> 00:28:35.692
remarkable feature of its history

00:28:35.692 --> 00:28:38.055
was the fact that it was
designed, built, tested

00:28:38.055 --> 00:28:42.222
and placed in operational
service within four years.

00:28:52.217 --> 00:28:56.002
Although each type had
its staunch appearance,

00:28:56.002 --> 00:28:58.441
the consolidated liberator
was somewhat overshadowed

00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.740
in fame if not an achievement.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.303
By the Boeing Fortress
during the second World War,

00:29:04.303 --> 00:29:07.569
this was despite the
fact that not only was

00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:09.675
the liberator built in
considerable larger numbers

00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:12.405
than the fortress, it
was produced in greater

00:29:12.405 --> 00:29:15.860
quantities then any
other American aircraft.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.276
Such a unique production
record is all the more

00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:21.046
remarkable for such a
large four engine aircraft

00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:24.068
and the liberator
operated over more fronts

00:29:24.068 --> 00:29:26.341
for a considerably longer period

00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:28.777
and was produced in a
greater variety of versions

00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:31.944
than any other allied or enemy bomber.

00:29:33.932 --> 00:29:36.180
By comparison with the
fortress, the liberator

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.513
was indeed an ugly duckling.

00:29:39.568 --> 00:29:42.973
Its deep, slab sided
fusalage an immense barn door

00:29:42.973 --> 00:29:46.711
like vertical table services,
were features hardly

00:29:46.711 --> 00:29:49.378
indicative of speed and agility.

00:29:53.719 --> 00:29:56.566
One of the prime virtues of the liberator

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:59.337
and one which invariably
hallmarks a great war plane

00:29:59.337 --> 00:30:01.724
was its versatility.

00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:04.488
In addition to strategic
bombing, it was used

00:30:04.488 --> 00:30:07.640
with equal facility for
maritime reconnaissance

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.748
and anti submarine operations,
passenger and freight

00:30:10.748 --> 00:30:13.023
transportation, as a flying tanker,

00:30:13.023 --> 00:30:16.019
and for photographic
reconnaissance as well

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:18.882
as for many other duties.

00:30:18.882 --> 00:30:21.155
It was this quality in fact
which largely accounted

00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:25.155
for the extraordinary
total of 18,188 liberators

00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:30.616
and liberator variance
constructed by the USAAF

00:30:30.616 --> 00:30:32.709
between delivery of the
first production aircraft

00:30:32.709 --> 00:30:36.087
in June 1941 and the
closing down of the last

00:30:36.087 --> 00:30:39.254
assembly line on the 31st of May 1945.

00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:43.955
(dramatic music)

00:31:34.462 --> 00:31:36.962
(guns firing)

00:32:06.447 --> 00:32:09.117
Apart from its unchallenged
production record,

00:32:09.117 --> 00:32:11.987
the liberator earned for
itself a permanent place

00:32:11.987 --> 00:32:15.270
in aviation history for
its remarkable record

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.520
of achievement.

00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:19.984
Whether the material to
be delivered happened

00:32:19.984 --> 00:32:23.021
to be bombs, depth
charges, gasoline, freight,

00:32:23.021 --> 00:32:26.614
troops, of VIPs, the liberator
established a reputation

00:32:26.614 --> 00:32:30.614
second to none for doing
almost any job any way.

00:32:38.264 --> 00:32:41.133
In some respects, the combat
career of the Douglas A20

00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:44.294
was much less spectacular
than that of other bombers

00:32:44.294 --> 00:32:46.544
employed by the combatants.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:51.178
It was associated with
no outstanding operations

00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:55.252
that remained in front line
service throughout the war.

00:32:55.252 --> 00:32:57.773
It did not distinguish
itself on any particular

00:32:57.773 --> 00:33:00.482
battlefront but flew with
equal distinction over

00:33:00.482 --> 00:33:01.482
all of them.

00:33:02.387 --> 00:33:04.627
It did as well in Russia
as it did in the Pacific

00:33:04.627 --> 00:33:07.720
or the western desert and
with all was one of the most

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.496
pleasant of all combat aircraft to fly.

00:33:11.496 --> 00:33:14.663
(dramatic drum music)

00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:48.334
Designated by the Americans as the Havoc

00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:51.937
and by the British as
the Boston, the A20 was

00:35:51.937 --> 00:35:55.337
a pilot's airplane and
its virtues were sworn

00:35:55.337 --> 00:35:58.859
in a variety of languages
ranging from Africans

00:35:58.859 --> 00:36:02.363
to French and from British
to Ukrainian as well as

00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:06.363
being operated by the
Americans and Australians.

00:36:08.037 --> 00:36:11.095
His cosmopolitan nature was
fundamental in its design

00:36:11.095 --> 00:36:13.814
however for it owed its
origins much to the Spanish

00:36:13.814 --> 00:36:17.808
Civil War and subsequently
to the urgent need

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:20.308
for re armament by the French.

00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:24.963
The dangerous signals of
1936 had not been ignored

00:36:24.963 --> 00:36:27.988
in the United States
and prominent aircraft

00:36:27.988 --> 00:36:30.140
manufacturers were considering the future

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.831
possible requirements for
the United States Army Core,

00:36:33.831 --> 00:36:36.513
well in advance of any
military specifications

00:36:36.513 --> 00:36:37.596
being issued.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.190
Well suited to the low level bomber role,

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.043
the Bostons, or Havocs
were adaptable, reliable,

00:36:46.043 --> 00:36:48.710
tractable, and extremely potent.

00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:53.354
Possibly overshadowed
throughout much of its career

00:36:53.354 --> 00:36:56.121
by the more spectacular
exploits which fell

00:36:56.121 --> 00:36:58.315
to the lot of other bombers.

00:36:58.315 --> 00:37:01.404
The A20 did rank highly
amongst the most brilliant

00:37:01.404 --> 00:37:04.270
combat aircraft designs
evolved by the United States

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:05.770
aircraft industry.

00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:13.737
No combat aircraft of the second World War

00:37:13.737 --> 00:37:16.204
either from the access or allied powers

00:37:16.204 --> 00:37:18.903
was the subject of so much modification

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:22.570
and extemporization as
was the Yonkers JU88.

00:37:25.568 --> 00:37:28.352
Operating in various forms
through the entire period

00:37:28.352 --> 00:37:31.230
of the European War
and still in production

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.497
when the hostilities ceased,
the JU88 was the true

00:37:35.497 --> 00:37:37.664
backbone of the Luft Fafa.

00:37:44.973 --> 00:37:47.668
This bomber was produced
in greater numbers

00:37:47.668 --> 00:37:50.473
than all of the other
German bombers combined.

00:37:50.473 --> 00:37:54.306
Some 15,000 being built
between 1939 and 1945.

00:37:57.111 --> 00:38:00.507
The JU88 was continuously
adapted to perform roles

00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:03.669
other than that for
which it'd been conceived

00:38:03.669 --> 00:38:05.850
and performed every task demanded of it

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.267
with distinction.

00:38:08.702 --> 00:38:11.080
Like all combat aircraft,
it possessed its share

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.497
of short comings.

00:38:14.455 --> 00:38:16.863
These were largely due
to changes dictated by

00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:20.047
the needs of the over
strained, depleted German

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:23.380
defenses during the wars closing stages.

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:26.409
Without doubt, despite its shortcomings,

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:29.927
the JU88 was the finest
German bomber to see

00:38:29.927 --> 00:38:32.427
extensive operational service.

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:40.203
This aircraft was conceived
as the result of a meeting

00:38:40.203 --> 00:38:43.424
held in 1935 between high ranking officers

00:38:43.424 --> 00:38:46.765
of the then fledging Luft
Fafa and chief German

00:38:46.765 --> 00:38:48.348
aircraft designers.

00:38:50.108 --> 00:38:53.038
They were informed of the
requirement for a Schnell bomber

00:38:53.038 --> 00:38:57.772
meaning a medium bomber
with a speed of a fighter.

00:38:57.772 --> 00:39:00.198
Yonkers were finally awarded the contract,

00:39:00.198 --> 00:39:04.198
the proto type making its
maiden flight in 1936.

00:39:12.438 --> 00:39:15.342
From the outset of war,
the JU88 flourished

00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:19.683
to serve on every front
and in almost every role

00:39:19.683 --> 00:39:22.015
and apart from its use as a medium bomber,

00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:25.090
it also served as a night
fighter, reconnaissance,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.970
torpedo bomber, mine layer,
and finally as the lower half

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.220
of the missile flying bomb.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.867
Highly regarded by the allies,
the JU88 was considered

00:39:35.867 --> 00:39:39.422
to exemplify the German
philosophy of using one good

00:39:39.422 --> 00:39:42.638
basic air frame for a multitude of tasks,

00:39:42.638 --> 00:39:46.861
rather than involving a variety
of specialized machines.

00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:49.694
And thus, complicating production.

00:39:52.003 --> 00:39:54.912
It is true to say that had the JU88 proved

00:39:54.912 --> 00:39:57.890
less amenable to the process of adaption

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.551
and modification to which
it was eventually submitted,

00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:03.344
then the Luft Fafa would have found itself

00:40:03.344 --> 00:40:06.153
in serious difficulties
in very much earlier stage

00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.153
in the second World War.

00:40:11.481 --> 00:40:13.389
Few were the inhabitants
on England's capital

00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:16.689
and southern counties to
whom in the dramatic months

00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:20.126
of 1940, the distinctive
and disagreeable mode

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:22.958
of the Hankel HE 111's
engine was unfamiliar.

00:40:22.958 --> 00:40:27.754
For this machine, the
first modern medium bomber

00:40:27.754 --> 00:40:31.032
to be acquired by the Luft
Fafa bore the major burden

00:40:31.032 --> 00:40:33.739
of the German bombing offensive
against the British Isles

00:40:33.739 --> 00:40:37.656
during the main phase of
the Battle of Britain.

00:40:39.323 --> 00:40:41.618
Despite its short comings
which became more marked

00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:44.697
as the war progressed, and
which were in no small part

00:40:44.697 --> 00:40:47.709
due to the continual
process of modification

00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:52.031
and extemporization to which
the model was subjected,

00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:55.310
the HE 111 retained its
place as the standard

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.553
Luft Fafa combat aircraft
throughout the war.

00:40:59.553 --> 00:41:02.303
(dramatic music)

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.745
Produced in large numbers,
this aircraft was twice

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:06.508
taken out of mass production
only to be returned

00:42:06.508 --> 00:42:09.335
to the production lines when
the new types with which

00:42:09.335 --> 00:42:13.002
it was to be replaced
failed to materialize.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.487
During the opening phases of the war

00:42:19.487 --> 00:42:21.578
the Henkle HE 111 was
undoubtedly a formidable

00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:22.995
offensive weapon.

00:42:24.371 --> 00:42:26.943
An elegant, well built,
well planned aircraft

00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:29.693
with good flying characteristics.

00:42:32.043 --> 00:42:34.421
It was certainly a
thoroughbred, inheriting its

00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:37.115
shapely contours from its
single engine predecessor,

00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:41.146
the HE 70 blitz which at
the time of its appearance

00:42:41.146 --> 00:42:44.815
had been justifiably acclaimed
as the most aerodynamically

00:42:44.815 --> 00:42:47.982
efficient airplane ever to have flown.

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:55.041
Like many German war planes of its era,

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:58.286
the HE 111 had first
been shown to the world

00:42:58.286 --> 00:43:00.283
as a civil aircraft.

00:43:00.283 --> 00:43:03.260
But its sleek, streamlined
fuse lodge was obviously

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.868
designed for maximum
performance at the expense

00:43:05.868 --> 00:43:07.618
of passenger comfort.

00:43:11.362 --> 00:43:13.625
However, intended from its birth as one of

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:16.412
the Luft Fafa's principle
weapons of the future

00:43:16.412 --> 00:43:19.184
Blitzkrieg, the HE 111 had placed Germany

00:43:19.184 --> 00:43:23.017
at the forefront of
medium bomber development.

00:43:29.193 --> 00:43:31.940
It was however, forced
to soldier on long past

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.583
its allotted span, owing to
the inability of the German

00:43:35.583 --> 00:43:39.319
aircraft industry to produce
a suitable replacement

00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:42.544
and was already approaching
obsolescence when called upon

00:43:42.544 --> 00:43:45.608
to carry the major burden
of the Luft Fafa's bombing

00:43:45.608 --> 00:43:48.608
offensive against the British Isles.

00:43:54.306 --> 00:43:56.607
Despite continual
improvements, it could not

00:43:56.607 --> 00:43:59.003
keep pace with the rapidly
changing requirements

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.253
of air warfare.

00:44:01.452 --> 00:44:03.599
And during the last years
of the war was no longer

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:06.355
the formidable weapon
with which the Luft Fafa

00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:08.022
had attacked Poland.

00:44:16.293 --> 00:44:19.043
(dramatic music)

00:44:21.461 --> 00:44:23.466
One design that did
manage to see production

00:44:23.466 --> 00:44:25.383
was the Yonkers JU 188.

00:44:26.509 --> 00:44:29.102
A twin engine medium bomber
which first saw action

00:44:29.102 --> 00:44:29.935
in 1942.

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:35.167
As early as 1939, Yonkers had been working

00:44:35.167 --> 00:44:39.826
on the JU 288 which was
a completely new design

00:44:39.826 --> 00:44:43.076
far more advanced than preceding types.

00:44:45.498 --> 00:44:47.495
But when it became
apparent that the design

00:44:47.495 --> 00:44:50.402
should meet a specification
which called for the type

00:44:50.402 --> 00:44:54.655
to be in service by 1942,
was not going to be developed

00:44:54.655 --> 00:44:57.541
in time, the Luft Fafa
proposed that instead

00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:00.961
the JU 88 should be modified to meet

00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:02.628
the new requirement.

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:09.119
Hence, in the interim,
the JU 188 was born.

00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:16.680
In principle, Yonkers took
the forward fuse lodge

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.345
section of the JU 88 and added a new wing

00:45:20.345 --> 00:45:22.012
and a new tail unit.

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.781
This new design was designated originally

00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:31.081
as the JU 88E but this was later changed

00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:32.331
to the JU 188E.

00:45:37.454 --> 00:45:40.198
The first aircraft left
the factory in June 1942

00:45:40.198 --> 00:45:43.281
for operational use as a dive bomber.

00:45:45.247 --> 00:45:47.443
However, with the increased defenses of

00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:51.610
the allied forces, it was
not particularly successful.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.515
Its role was changed to that
of a medium horizontal bomber

00:45:57.515 --> 00:46:00.495
and also as a torpedo bomber
for attacking shipping

00:46:00.495 --> 00:46:01.828
in the Atlantic.

00:46:12.968 --> 00:46:15.945
Further developments took the JU 188 into

00:46:15.945 --> 00:46:18.914
the night fighter role for
defending Germany's homeland

00:46:18.914 --> 00:46:23.081
against the increasing allied
strategic bombing campaign.

00:46:25.303 --> 00:46:27.496
In order to achieve
greater speed and altitude

00:46:27.496 --> 00:46:30.475
without the disruption
caused by the introduction

00:46:30.475 --> 00:46:35.039
of a completely new design,
the JU 188 was also developed

00:46:35.039 --> 00:46:38.021
into a high altitude
bomber with a pressurized

00:46:38.021 --> 00:46:39.354
cockpit section.

00:46:41.369 --> 00:46:45.369
This type later became
designated as the JU 388.

00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:02.537
In 1944 the role of the
JU 188 was changed again

00:47:03.425 --> 00:47:05.828
when it was used in the pathfinder role

00:47:05.828 --> 00:47:10.299
during the years bombing
campaign against England.

00:47:10.299 --> 00:47:13.697
Operating from 1942
until the end of the war,

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:16.119
seeing action in Europe
and on the Mediterranean,

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:20.187
Arctic, and Eastern Front,
the JU 188 and its variety

00:47:20.187 --> 00:47:23.913
of roles was among the most
important of the Luft Fafa's

00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:25.663
operational aircraft.

00:47:30.801 --> 00:47:33.891
Bumping Alf England, so
read the title of a Sterling

00:47:33.891 --> 00:47:36.921
marshal song which blared
out of loud speakers

00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:39.667
all over Germany and
the occupied territories

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:43.127
during the Autumn months of 1940.

00:47:43.127 --> 00:47:45.899
With the accompaniment
of roaring arrow engines

00:47:45.899 --> 00:47:50.215
and the beating of drums, it
was an impressive battle hymn.

00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:52.149
But whatever its psychological effect

00:47:52.149 --> 00:47:54.850
on the German populace may have been,

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.697
it was hardly destined
to raise the spirits

00:47:56.697 --> 00:47:59.272
of the personnel of the Luft Fafa.

00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:00.767
They were fully aware
that their bombers did not

00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:03.579
have the range to attack effectively.

00:48:03.579 --> 00:48:06.602
More than a small area
of the British Isles.

00:48:06.602 --> 00:48:10.120
They knew that the Luft
Fafa's lack of a long range

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.391
strategic bomber enabled
the RAF to concentrate

00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:16.143
virtually the whole of
its defensive strength

00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.663
within a limited area.

00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:20.719
An area to which the Luft Fafa was forced

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:23.469
to confine its intentions.

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.827
They also knew that this would sap

00:48:25.827 --> 00:48:28.578
their operational strength.

00:48:28.578 --> 00:48:30.493
Prototypes of four engine
heavies had been built

00:48:30.493 --> 00:48:32.965
but they were abandoned and never saw

00:48:32.965 --> 00:48:35.416
the production lines.

00:48:35.416 --> 00:48:39.413
They did however, possess
the Heinkle HE 177 Grief,

00:48:39.413 --> 00:48:42.080
a long range twin engine bomber.

00:48:44.193 --> 00:48:46.416
An aircraft which was destined to provide

00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:48.651
the most dismal chapter
in the war time record

00:48:48.651 --> 00:48:51.318
of the German aircraft industry.

00:48:52.186 --> 00:48:54.965
Fires in the air, aerodynamic troubles,

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:57.373
and structural failures all contributed

00:48:57.373 --> 00:49:00.599
towards the unpopularity
of this big bomber

00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:03.819
when it reached operational units.

00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:07.030
The faults of this aircraft
were recognized too late

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.792
and when they were recognized
insufficient energy

00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:12.459
was devoted to eradicating them.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.506
There was nothing wrong
with the basic design

00:49:15.506 --> 00:49:17.924
and had effective measures been taken

00:49:17.924 --> 00:49:20.551
the Luft Fafa might have
found itself possessing

00:49:20.551 --> 00:49:23.863
a heavy bomber comparable
with if not superior to

00:49:23.863 --> 00:49:28.694
the best of the allied
machines of the same type.

00:49:28.694 --> 00:49:31.612
Aptly named the Grief, this
aircraft's chief claim to fame

00:49:31.612 --> 00:49:35.092
was the fact that it was
the only German heavy bomber

00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:39.259
to obtain quantity production
during the war years.

00:49:40.386 --> 00:49:43.494
It was in fact one of
the very few entirely new

00:49:43.494 --> 00:49:47.082
German combat aircraft to
progress from the design boards

00:49:47.082 --> 00:49:50.665
to operational service
during the conflict.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.051
But the advantages that
it offered were nullified

00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:56.680
by the German aircraft
industries inability

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.847
to devote sufficient effort
towards its perfection.

00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:06.278
A claim by German
propagandists as the scourge

00:50:06.278 --> 00:50:09.110
of Europe, the aircraft
the conquered nations,

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:13.277
the supreme weapon, the
angularly ugly Yonkers JU 87

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.633
dive bomber attained greater notoriety

00:50:17.633 --> 00:50:20.336
than any other weapon in
the arsenal with which

00:50:20.336 --> 00:50:23.503
Germany launched the second World War.

00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:28.629
It was one of the most
vulnerable of war planes.

00:50:28.629 --> 00:50:32.796
Slow, unwieldy, and the
natural prey of the fighter.

00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:36.371
Yet within the first
nine months of the war

00:50:36.371 --> 00:50:40.342
it had acquired an almost
legendary reputation.

00:50:40.342 --> 00:50:43.083
The German air staff itself
was divided on the subject

00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:46.903
of dive bombing and the
employment of the JU 87,

00:50:46.903 --> 00:50:49.478
but the Polish campaign
appeared to vindicate

00:50:49.478 --> 00:50:50.895
its protagonists.

00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:54.276
The JU 87 knocking out strong points,

00:50:54.276 --> 00:50:57.292
artillery batteries, and concentrations

00:50:57.292 --> 00:51:01.459
whenever the Polish
sought to make a stand.

00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:03.421
When the German offensive against France

00:51:03.421 --> 00:51:06.178
and the low countries opened in May 1940

00:51:06.178 --> 00:51:09.558
the JU 87 repeated its earliest successes.

00:51:09.558 --> 00:51:12.470
Blasting the allied armor in defenses,

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.079
paralyzing whole armies,
playing havoc with

00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:17.824
communications in vital rear areas

00:51:17.824 --> 00:51:20.824
and hounding the steams of refugees.

00:51:21.984 --> 00:51:24.257
With virtually no aerial opposition

00:51:24.257 --> 00:51:27.664
the JU 87 was fully able
to exploit the accuracy

00:51:27.664 --> 00:51:30.877
of bomb aiming inherent in the steep dive

00:51:30.877 --> 00:51:33.991
as well as the demoralizing
effect on personnel

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:36.574
exposed to this form of attack.

00:51:37.533 --> 00:51:40.400
But the use of the JU 87 presumed control

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.741
of the air and the issue
was settled in the Battle

00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:45.933
of Britain when after
a few abortive sorters

00:51:45.933 --> 00:51:49.489
by JU87s during which their formations

00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:52.051
were decimated by opposing
hurricanes and spit fires,

00:51:52.051 --> 00:51:55.963
the dive bombers were withdrawn
from the Sherbook area

00:51:55.963 --> 00:51:59.046
and the JU 87s had ended the eclipse.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.887
The JU 87 was aerodynamically an atrocity.

00:52:05.887 --> 00:52:08.802
It was ugly to the point of absurdity

00:52:08.802 --> 00:52:13.058
and it was virtually defenseless
against the modern fighter.

00:52:13.058 --> 00:52:15.699
Yet its distinctive
shape was the most feared

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:19.787
by Germany's opponents
and this one aircraft type

00:52:19.787 --> 00:52:23.787
revolutionized the very
fundamentals of warfare.

00:52:26.402 --> 00:52:29.319
(triumphant music)
