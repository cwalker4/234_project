00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.330
The knowledge of Palpatine being a force user,
let alone a Sith Lord, was known to a very

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.030
select few in the entire galaxy during his
reign as Emperor.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.779
Among those few who knew were his Royal Guards,
but even they did not know the full extent

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.009
of his power; with only two guards that we
know of actually witnessing his true power

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.300
on display.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.650
So how did those two guards react to their
Emperor going from being a defenseless old

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.880
man to a maniacal force wielding killer?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.450
The two Royal guards in question were with
Palpatine and Darth Vader when the Emperor’s

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.780
shuttle was shot down by the Free Ryloth Movement
during the early years of the Empire.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.450
To give some context to this, Palpatine purposely
baited this emerging rebel group by making

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.210
himself a viable target to them, by placing
himself within their sights as he allowed

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.660
his small Imperial escort to fall into their
trap.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.390
His purpose was to have the rebel group exhaust
all of their assets so they wouldn’t become

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.370
a huge threat in the future, and to perhaps
have some fun too.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.920
One Guard was actually a clone veteran from
the Clone Wars, and the other one was a regular

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.750
Human who was noted for having multiple tattoos
across his face.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.001
Anyway, when Palpatine’s shuttle crashed
onto Ryloth after being shot down by the Rebel

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:23.260
group, only he, his apprentice Vader, and
the two royal guards survived.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.590
They were stranded in the middle of nowhere
and were hundreds of miles away from any known

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.009
settlement; and communications were down so
they were left to fend for themselves.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.569
Shortly after the crash, two modified rebel
freighters started to attack their position.

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.689
Vader and the Royal Guards stepped in front
of Palpatine trying to protect him, but he

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.530
told them their protection was unnecessary
and he began to remove a portion of his cloak,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.490
revealing his hidden lightsaber.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.149
He then ignited his red lightsaber, using
it to deflect oncoming blaster fire while

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.560
shooting force lightning far across the sky,
hitting the rebel freighters as they came

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.619
near.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.590
As he did this, the guards were shocked to
see their Emperor use the force in front of

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.079
them in such a manner.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.110
As we stated earlier, they knew he was force
sensitive, but they had no idea he was so

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.110
powerful.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.310
They were sort of stunned for a moment as
they saw Palpatine shoot force lightning out

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.239
of the tips of his fingers which was powerful
enough to reach and damage the ships far above

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.239
them.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.400
Even Vader was a bit surprised at what he
saw, not at the power that his master was

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.550
displaying, but at the fact that he actually
decided to use it at such a place and time.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.430
As to see his master actually fight was a
rare sight for him.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.120
As this was happening, Palpatine made it clear
that aside from Vader and the Guards, everyone

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.959
who witnessed him using the force was to be
killed.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.390
Following his orders, the four of them quickly
destroyed the two rebel freighters.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.079
But Palpatine’s impressive display of the
force didn’t end there.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.400
As while in the wilds of Ryloth, they came
across a huge horde of Lylek, which were massive

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.490
insectoid creatures that traveled in packs
of hundreds at a time and acted like a hive

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.490
mind.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.099
They were known to wipe out entire villages
and were almost impossible to stop.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.230
While this massive horde of creatures chased
the two Sith Lords and Guards through the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.560
forest, Palpatine used the force to effortlessly
bring down massive trees and boulders behind

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.629
them as a means to slow the bloodthirsty creatures
down.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.849
They eventually reached and entered a cave,
which led them to the nest of the Lyleks and

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.110
right towards the Queen of the hive, which
alone was hundreds of feet big.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.450
Although both the Guards and even Vader were
exhausted at that point, Palpatine seemed

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.450
to be quite delighted and even excited at
what was before him.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.219
While the Guards fended off the creatures
at the entrance, Vader and Palpatine took

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.890
on the Queen and all of her children that
attempted to protect her.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.709
While Vader was just trying to survive at
that point as he was cutting down countless

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.720
beasts, Palpatine was spinning around, laughing
as he cut down and killed everything around

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720
him.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.109
He moved so swiftly and casually it was as
if he was dancing.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.379
Palpatine clearly was having a blast; and
from the point of view of the guards, probably

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.480
looked like a straight up lunatic.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.980
They eventually killed the Queen and her entire
hive, with the clone royal guard not surviving

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.219
as he was overwhelmed during the fight.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.220
The two Sith lords and the surviving Guard
eventually made their way out of the cave

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.459
and into an isolated village.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.630
While at the village, they were soon attacked
by the Free Ryloth Movement that had caught

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.990
up with them, but their forces were destroyed
by Vader and later by Imperial reinforcements

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.690
which came near the end.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.690
After everything had settled, the two Sith
and the remaining Guard had survived not only

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.470
the attacks of an entire planet wide rebel
cell, but also the attacks from the most dangerous

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.840
creatures from Ryloth’s forests.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.900
Needless to say, the surviving Royal Guard
probably saw things that were before completely

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.169
unimaginable to him, and he probably never
looked at Palpatine the same way ever again

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:06.620
whenever he was tasked to guard his excellency.
