Journey to the ISS
Part 2: The Soyuz rendezvous and docking

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.025
Welcome, I am Alexander Gerst

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.628
an astronaut of the
European Space Agency.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.067
I am talking to you from the
International Space Station.

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:25.709
My journey here aboard
a Soyuz spacecraft

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.228
from lift-off in Kazakhstan

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.959
to the time we docked just
took over about 5 hours.

00:00:32.614 --> 00:00:35.505
The video you are about to see
contains some unique footage

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:38.249
taken inside the capsule
while it is in orbit

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:40.936
and explains how the Soyuz
safely reaches orbit

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.118
and docks to the Space Station.

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:45.575
Many other astronauts have
taken the same journey

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:49.902
and some of them will also share their
experience with you in this video.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.364
Have fun watching it.

00:00:57.213 --> 00:00:59.658
Nine minutes ago, a
Soyuz spacecraft

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.955
blasted into orbit from
Baikonur in Kazakhstan.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.832
It is now speeding
around the Earth

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:10.036
thirty times faster
than a jumbo jet.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.957
It has a single purpose:
to catch up with,

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:16.149
rendezvous, and dock with the
International Space Station

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.349
located somewhere 400
km above the ground.

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.737
The astronauts just went through the
last phase of the launch sequence

00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:30.835
the separation of the Soyuz
spacecraft from the rocket.

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:34.658
[NESPOLI] The finishing of the engine

00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:36.009
of the shut-down of the engine

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.277
is pretty strong.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.187
[DE WINNE] And immediately
afterwards, of course, you float.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:46.411
It's really a very nice
feeling that you know

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.244
yes, we are in space,
we had a successful launch,

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:51.123
now we are on the way
to the Space Station.

00:01:51.437 --> 00:01:54.541
[DE WINNE] You can look outside the
window, you see this magnificent Earth

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.585
for the first time from above.
It's really a great feeling.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.424
[PARMITANO] And then
just the absolute beauty

00:01:59.524 --> 00:02:06.168
of the sun coming up really quickly,
illuminating, bursting into flame.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.565
Now in their first
orbits around Earth

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:12.923
at an insertion altitude
of about 220 km,

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:17.019
The three astronauts in the Soyuz
certainly have a wonderful view.

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:23.586
But there is work to be done, as they
are still hundreds of kilometres away

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:26.393
from the ISS -- their
final destination.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.663
The International Space
Station began life in 1998

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:39.194
and has been orbiting Earth about
once every 90 minutes ever since.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.982
The orbital plane of the
ISS is fairly constant,

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:46.312
while the Earth is always rotating.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:50.905
Projecting the orbit of
the ISS onto a 2D map,

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.025
we see a series of intersecting curves.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:58.776
The Mission Control Centres
in Moscow and Houston

00:02:58.876 --> 00:03:01.698
constantly monitor the
position of the ISS,

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.619
and can predict its expected
location in the orbit

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.887
for any given time
in the future.

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:12.522
This is important for determining
when the Soyuz spacecraft launches.

00:03:13.732 --> 00:03:17.497
While it is technically possible to
launch the Soyuz rocket at any time,

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:21.188
it's most efficient to do so
shortly after the ISS orbit

00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:24.807
passes over the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:29.301
This shortens the amount of time to
rendezvous and dock with the Station

00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:32.637
from about two days
to only six hours.

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:37.178
This short rendezvous trajectory
has been implemented since 2013.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.364
However, if the Soyuz rocket
misses the necessary launch window

00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:45.185
or any of the upcoming engine
burns do not occur as planned,

00:03:45.285 --> 00:03:48.260
the spacecraft has enough
extra fuel to revert

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.403
to a two-day long rendezvous.

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:55.802
This happened in March of 2014 because
of an attitude control problem,

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:00.535
and thus, the rendezvous was replanned
to the formerly used long trajectory.

00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.724
[PARMITANO] You take into consideration
that there are some risks,

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:10.408
some are worse than others, including
the possibility of transitioning

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:13.264
from a very short docking
to a long docking,

00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:16.685
which was the standard
until a year ago.

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:20.935
We know of the possibility; it's
something that we are trained for.

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.549
We know that the spacecraft has everything
that we need for those two days,

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.809
and we know how to react.

00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:31.539
Rendezvous is defined as
the sequence of manoeuvres

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.244
governing the approach of two
space vehicles to one another.

00:04:35.344 --> 00:04:39.318
In most cases one of them is the
chaser, performing the manoeuvres,

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:40.968
in this case, the Soyuz,

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:43.839
while the second is a
passive target vehicle,

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.635
in this case, the
International Space Station.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.992
Ideally, both vehicles meet up safely

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:54.545
at an exact preselected
point in space and time.

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:58.010
But how does the Soyuz achieve this?

00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:03.184
Well, the Soyuz has to climb from
its initial insertion altitude

00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:05.495
up to the same altitude
of the Station,

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:09.124
and then join and stay on this orbit.

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.270
It sounds like a simple enough task,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.449
but it cannot be done
in one single manoeuvre

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:16.748
starting from the insertion altitude.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:22.823
Calculations for the final docking are
based on a precise initial Soyuz altitude

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:27.732
and unfortunately, the exact insertion
orbit altitude is not known in advance

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.640
because of some unpredictability
in the rocket launch.

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:33.751
Therefore, two manoeuvres are used

00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:36.393
with an intermediate
phasing orbit in between.

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:40.705
The phasing orbit is the basis for
the final docking calculations.

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:45.557
It is reached using the first
manoeuvre, called a Hohmann transfer,

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:49.627
named after a German scientist from
the beginning of the 20th century.

00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:55.347
During the Hohmann transfer, the
Soyuz has to use its engines twice.

00:05:56.853 --> 00:06:00.165
The first time is to leave
its current insertion orbit

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:03.919
shortly after launch and transfer
up to the phasing orbit.

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:06.501
The second time is to get
the vehicle traveling

00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:09.390
at the right speed to stay on that orbit.

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:15.450
The phasing orbit is lower than
the ISS orbit by about 100 km

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.101
and it serves a very specific purpose.

00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.301
It decreases the phasing
angle, or the angle between

00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.412
the two spacecraft in
their respective orbits.

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:29.432
Here we see the Soyuz
orbiting in the phasing orbit,

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:30.754
depicted in yellow,

00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:34.068
while the ISS is orbiting
in a higher orbit,

00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:35.392
depicted in green.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.747
The third red orbit is the insertion orbit

00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:40.976
the Soyuz has already left.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:44.274
Because the Soyuz is on a lower orbit

00:06:44.374 --> 00:06:46.512
it will travel faster than the Station.

00:06:46.612 --> 00:06:49.692
Therefore, the Soyuz
uses this phasing orbit

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:51.493
to catch up with the ISS.

00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:57.440
Depending on whether the long or short
rendezvous approach is being used,

00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:59.769
the Soyuz will remain in this phasing orbit

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.239
for close to two days, or just a few hours,

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.674
however long it takes to reach
the desired phasing angle.

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:14.429
Meanwhile, the crew haven't just been
enjoying the views and weightlessness,

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.293
they've been busy with leak checks

00:07:16.393 --> 00:07:19.637
and making sure systems
are performing nominally.

00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:23.707
Then they issue the command
for docking probe extension

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:26.853
in advanced preparation for
the final docking sequence.

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:32.004
As soon as the pressure integrity
of the vehicle is confirmed,

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:34.718
the Mission Control Centre gives
the go-ahead for the crew

00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:37.481
to loosen their seatbelts,
open their helmets,

00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:38.895
and take off their gloves.

00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:40.841
&lt;&lt;Oh, that's much better.&gt;&gt;

00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:44.251
Once they reach the phasing orbit,

00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.388
the crew finally have some
well-deserved downtime,

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:51.314
especially those completing the
two-day long rendezvous trajectory.

00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:54.756
[DE WINNE] There are what
we call five deaf orbits.

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:59.092
It's five orbits in which the crew
cannot have contact with the ground

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:04.686
because the orbit of the Soyuz is not
passing over Russia, and you only have

00:08:04.786 --> 00:08:07.709
contact with the ground when you're
passing over Russia with the Soyuz.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.526
So you are completely on yourself.

00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:13.099
So it's actually a nice time for the
crew, because you cannot be disturbed,

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.083
nobody can give you tasks, you
can do whatever you want.

00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:20.332
Luckily for the astronauts, the Soyuz

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:24.308
is designed so they are not confined
to their seats for the entire trip.

00:08:25.226 --> 00:08:28.618
Though small, the spacecraft allows
the astronauts to move freely

00:08:28.718 --> 00:08:30.636
between the accessible modules.

00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.924
The Soyuz has three compartments:
the Orbital Module,

00:08:42.024 --> 00:08:45.250
the Descent Module, and the
Instrument Compartment.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.152
Each compartment has a different
architecture, and a specific purpose.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:53.109
The Orbital Module, or living compartment,

00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.739
is equipped with sleeping
bags, food, and a toilet.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.969
[WILLIAMS] So here
we are in the Soyuz.

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:04.079
This is what we call the БО,
the living compartment,

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:05.914
"бытовой отсек" in Russian.

00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:10.455
It also has a little bathroom, it's
not as good as the other bathrooms

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:12.312
so we try not to use it too much.

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:15.397
It has drinking water in it
if we need something to drink,

00:09:15.497 --> 00:09:19.864
and then, of course, it's filled
up with a lot of cargo for us.

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.759
The Instrument Compartment, not
accessible to the astronauts,

00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:26.369
houses the oxygen and propellant tanks,

00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:30.221
thrusters, the on-board computer,
and a number of sensors.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:35.160
From the Descent Module, the three
crewmembers monitor all information

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.451
about the spacecraft and the ISS

00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:41.298
from ground data, the on-board
computers, and an optical display

00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:44.836
of the view from a periscope
mounted on the outside.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.975
For the second orbital transfer and
the final rendezvous manoeuvres,

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:53.986
the astronauts return to
their seats in this module.

00:09:54.812 --> 00:09:58.713
The second orbital transfer brings
the Soyuz from the phasing orbit

00:09:58.813 --> 00:10:00.511
up to the ISS orbit.

00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:04.896
It's called a bielliptic transfer,
and requires three engine burns

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:07.292
instead of the Hohmann's two.

00:10:07.392 --> 00:10:10.808
From the phasing orbit, the
first two burns bring the Soyuz

00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:12.928
up to the ISS orbit.

00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:16.316
The third burn gets the vehicle
traveling at the correct speed

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:18.572
to stay in the ISS orbit.

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:23.469
The burns of the bielliptic transfer are
calculated based on the precise altitude

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:29.380
of the phasing orbit. Consequently, if
the phasing orbit is too high or too low

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.210
the Soyuz will not meet up
with the ISS as expected.

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:39.472
The reason for using a bielliptic transfer
here instead of the Hohmann's is that

00:10:39.504 --> 00:10:44.257
the Soyuz will not only reach the correct
altitude in the close vicinity of the ISS,

00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:47.252
but also with exactly the desired speed.

00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:55.847
Despite these precise manoeuvres, what if
the thrusters fail to slow down the Soyuz

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:59.532
and the vehicle travels too
fast as it approaches the ISS?

00:10:59.632 --> 00:11:02.192
This could end in disaster, with the Soyuz

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:05.035
crashing into the Station
instead of docking.

00:11:05.153 --> 00:11:08.071
To prevent this from
happening the Soyuz performs

00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:09.854
an additional side burn.

00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:12.338
This changes its orbital plane slightly

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:15.719
and makes a collision between
the two vehicles impossible.

00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:21.305
Throughout the rendezvous process,
the Soyuz on-board computer

00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:25.209
continually determines the position
and velocity of the Soyuz itself

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:26.613
and of the ISS.

00:11:26.713 --> 00:11:30.756
To do so, it uses measurements
provided by the ground controllers

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.898
and a radar system called the Kurs.

00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:36.776
In this way, all of the
burns during the rendezvous

00:11:36.876 --> 00:11:40.630
are calculated and automated
by the on-board computer.

00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:46.938
[NESPOLI] So Soyuz navigates in space and
looks for the Station with a special

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:50.222
radar system, which is called the Kurs.

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:54.321
This gets turned on at
400 km from the Station

00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:56.060
it looks, looks, looks, and usually

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.656
it sees the Station and
locks into the Station

00:11:58.756 --> 00:12:01.428
at around, more or less, 180 kilometres.

00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:04.111
At that distance, we really
don't see the Station.

00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:06.828
It's probably -- even if you
could see it, it's probably

00:12:06.928 --> 00:12:10.157
similar to any of the stars
that are up there in space.

00:12:10.257 --> 00:12:15.281
But you see on the screen the
lock, the software indication

00:12:15.381 --> 00:12:17.552
that the radar locked into the Station.

00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:22.020
The third and final burn of the
pre-mentioned bielliptic transfer

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.471
is very important, because
it sets the vehicle up

00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:28.986
for its near-ISS rendezvous
procedures that will lead to docking.

00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:34.756
[DE WINNE] When you do a normal burn, well
the vehicle rotates to the correct attitude

00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:38.017
at two degrees per second, and
then it takes about eight minutes

00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:39.175
to start the burn.

00:12:39.275 --> 00:12:41.635
When you're close to the Space
Station and you have to brake,

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:43.401
of course this would not work.

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:46.804
So then the vehicle all of a
sudden starts rotating quite fast,

00:12:46.904 --> 00:12:48.579
three and a half degrees per second

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:51.147
and only just after that,
50 seconds after that

00:12:51.247 --> 00:12:52.805
you already have the burn.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:57.161
And once the burn is completed, immediately
the vehicle starts rotating again

00:12:57.261 --> 00:12:58.607
to the normal orientation,

00:12:58.707 --> 00:13:01.652
and the crew has to monitor
this quite intensely

00:13:01.752 --> 00:13:03.757
and these are really high peaks of workload

00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:06.997
to see that everything is okay,
the rotation is going okay,

00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:10.898
you know that you have the burn,
the burn values were okay,

00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.556
you rotate back, and then you see back
the Space Station in your main display.

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:17.694
[NESPOLI] We could see
it, first a dot a little

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.631
bit brighter than the
other stars in the sky,

00:13:20.706 --> 00:13:25.564
and then little by little, we start
to see like a little spider first

00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:28.267
with all the solar arrays and everything,

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:34.463
and then it was apparent that there's a
huge outpost right there in front of us.

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:38.373
During this stage, the crew
commander, sitting in the middle

00:13:38.473 --> 00:13:41.885
gives vital information and
instructions to his crewmates.

00:13:41.985 --> 00:13:45.686
Their workload has increased; many
parameters need to be checked

00:13:45.786 --> 00:13:47.757
and systems activated.

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:51.920
Days before launch, a team
of flight dynamics experts

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.839
at the Mission Control Centres
in Moscow and Houston

00:13:54.939 --> 00:13:58.652
determine the ideal position
and orientation of the ISS,

00:13:58.752 --> 00:14:01.323
based on a careful analysis
of the constraints

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:05.075
that could affect these final
stages of the rendezvous timeline.

00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:09.228
First, there must be adequate lighting
conditions at the time of docking

00:14:09.328 --> 00:14:11.764
so that the Soyuz crew can see the ISS

00:14:11.864 --> 00:14:14.769
without being blinded
or blocked by the sun.

00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:18.200
[NESPOLI] It depends if the Station
is illuminated, is in the sun,

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.692
then you can see it even if
you are relatively far away.

00:14:21.792 --> 00:14:26.574
But if the Station is not in the sun, then
you cannot see it even if you are close.

00:14:26.674 --> 00:14:30.798
Additionally, major temperature
fluctuations of ISS elements,

00:14:30.898 --> 00:14:33.527
such as the solar arrays,
must be avoided

00:14:33.627 --> 00:14:35.629
to prevent structural deformation.

00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:39.387
Finally, there must be clear
communication pathways

00:14:39.487 --> 00:14:42.453
between the ground, Soyuz, and ISS.

00:14:43.831 --> 00:14:48.397
The rendezvous is a fully automated process
performed by the on-board computer.

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:52.133
However, the commander still
takes the hand controller

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:56.289
just in case there is a need to
perform a contingency manual docking.

00:14:56.605 --> 00:15:00.034
[DE WINNE] If you don't see the Space Station
or something happens at that moment,

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.159
then you might have to take manual control.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:05.441
And so you have to remember very well,
where is the Space Station now,

00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.614
what are the actions
that I'm going to take,

00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:10.290
and this is really the
intense moments that happen.

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:15.223
Manual docking requires two hand
controllers to pilot the vehicle,

00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:20.821
a left one that control translation and
a right one that controls rotation.

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:24.319
The crew are thoroughly trained in
these manual docking procedures,

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:28.644
even training until the very last
days before launch in Baikonur.

00:15:30.802 --> 00:15:35.656
Besides contingency docking, the crew might
also utilize their manual control training

00:15:35.756 --> 00:15:37.649
during redocking manoeuvres.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.324
The ISS is constantly visited
by manned Soyuz vehicles

00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:44.678
and other unmanned supply ships.

00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:49.977
Sometimes it is necessary
to undock an attached Soyuz

00:15:50.077 --> 00:15:55.796
and redock it to another port on the ISS
to make room for one of these new ships.

00:15:55.896 --> 00:16:00.513
Luca Parmitano did this
as part of Expedition 37.

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:05.267
[PARMITANO] My crew was one of the few
crews able to perform a manual docking

00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:07.459
and it went very smoothly.

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:10.616
We were excited because it's something
that we trained on for a long time

00:16:10.716 --> 00:16:11.674
and we were able to do it.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.556
Apart from this case, a routine
docking sequence is fully automated

00:16:16.656 --> 00:16:21.764
and the crew's main task is to monitor the
systems to ensure nominal procedures.

00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:25.075
At this stage during routine docking

00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:28.352
the vehicle's relative speed
continues to decrease,

00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:30.969
as does the distance between the two.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.793
[DE WINNE] 400 metres from the
Space Station, a new phase enters.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.677
This is the phase what we call fly-around.

00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:42.738
During this phase, the vehicle is actually
not pointing at the desired docking port,

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:46.273
but at either one of the
Station's Kurs antennas.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:51.073
It's only when the vehicle reaches
its 150 m station keeping mode

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:55.789
that the orientation changes to point
at the selected docking port instead.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:17:00.361
The Soyuz then performs a second
fly-around to align with the docking port

00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:03.475
while keeping a distance of 150 m.

00:17:03.575 --> 00:17:07.100
Once aligned with the docking
port, the crew issues the command

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.183
for the last stage: the final approach.

00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:14.073
The Soyuz computer display
uses data from Kurs

00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:16.535
to provide the astronauts
with pertinent information

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:19.232
about the rendezvous and
docking manoeuvres.

00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:23.468
Among other read-outs, the distance
from the ISS is displayed,

00:17:23.568 --> 00:17:25.219
here showing five metres,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.064
as is the relative velocity
during the approach,

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:30.595
currently 10 cm/s.

00:17:30.695 --> 00:17:34.304
This and other information is
overlaid on the video feed,

00:17:34.404 --> 00:17:36.858
used to track alignment of the target.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:45.312
&lt;&lt;Five metres, zero, one, two... target
in the centre, cross-hairs aligned.&gt;&gt;

00:17:45.512 --> 00:17:49.746
&lt;&lt;Standing by for contact and capture
of the International Space Station.&gt;&gt;

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.112
Contact occurs as soon as the probe touches
the entrance cone of the docking hatch.

00:17:55.212 --> 00:17:58.389
Then the thrusters give
the Soyuz an extra push,

00:17:58.489 --> 00:18:00.941
and the docking mechanism ensures capture.

00:18:04.378 --> 00:18:05.664
&lt;&lt;Standing by for contact.&gt;&gt;

00:18:09.623 --> 00:18:10.820
&lt;&lt;Contact.&gt;&gt;

00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:14.890
&lt;&lt;Mechanical capture.&gt;&gt;

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.353
&lt;&lt;And contact and capture confirmed.&gt;&gt;

00:18:17.404 --> 00:18:20.916
[PARMITANO] I think this
is where the impact was.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:28.897
So I would say about four
to five inches off-centre.

00:18:28.997 --> 00:18:31.483
Pretty good after traveling
for a couple million miles!

00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:36.364
[DE WINNE] The probe retracts, and you get
the two vehicles closer to each other,

00:18:36.464 --> 00:18:38.528
and then when they are
very close to each other,

00:18:38.628 --> 00:18:41.612
less than two to three millimetres,
the hooks start closing.

00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:45.160
And it's when these hooks are fully
closed that can take an enormous pressure

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.548
because they can withstand 16
tonnes of force, each of the hooks,

00:18:50.648 --> 00:18:53.666
and you have eight hooks
on the Soyuz vehicle.

00:18:53.894 --> 00:18:57.793
[NESPOLI] This is still not enough, because
there might be something inside the O-rings,

00:18:57.893 --> 00:19:04.019
some dirt or some debris, that
is not allowing for a good seal.

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:08.836
So there is a series of
vacuum and depressurisations

00:19:08.936 --> 00:19:12.163
done in a very astute manner

00:19:12.263 --> 00:19:18.944
that verifies that each one of these
compartments is actually sealed tight.

00:19:19.044 --> 00:19:22.375
Only at that point -- and by
the way, all of this takes

00:19:22.475 --> 00:19:25.983
I would say an hour, one to two hours.

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:32.190
Only then when everything is
proved to be fully sealed,

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.243
only then you can open the hatch of
the Station, the hatch of the Soyuz,

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.867
and the crew can actually
go into the Station.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.438
[PARMITANO] And what we
usually do is we knock

00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:45.485
on the hatch that goes on the
side of the Space Station,

00:19:45.585 --> 00:19:49.292
they knock back; we know that there
is somebody else on the other side

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.112
&lt;&lt;And the hatches between
the Soyuz spacecraft

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:57.207
and the International Space Station
opening at 11:14 PM Central Time.&gt;&gt;

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.493
[PARMITANO] Then it's hugs and
smiles for everybody.

00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:09.494
The astronauts are now safely on-board
the International Space Station,

00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:12.924
their home for the next six months.
