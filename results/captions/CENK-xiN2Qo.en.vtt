There are only 76
days left in 2017.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.100

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:09.180
or learn a new language,
or step down from office,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.706
time is running out.

00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:18.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.130
All right.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.911
Time is flying by.

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.410
I don't want to
waste another minute

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.060
because I feel like dropping
some of view from way,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.360
way up high to down low.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.630

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.435

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.750
Hello.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150
So you are Jolie?

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.760
Yes.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.390
Hi, Jolie.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.765
Were do you live,
what do you do?

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:01.560
I live in Los Angeles, I
work in media relations.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.550
All right.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.770
And you are Sarah?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.810
Hi, Ellen.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.310
Hi, Sarah.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.726
Where do you live,
what do you do?

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.090
I live-- from Sydney, Australia,
I'm a flight attendant.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.492
Wonderful, all right.

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:13.400
I love you.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.356
Oh, thank you so much.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.230
Tracy-- that's not going
to help you if you--

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.248
I have to drop you anyway
even if you love me.

00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:20.430
Tracy, what do you
do, where do you live?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.780
I'm from Oceanside, California,
and I'm a special ed teacher.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.481
Wonderful.

00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.367
[CHEERS]

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.300
All right.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.562
It's a very easy game.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.270
If you know the answer
you stay up there,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.670
and if you don't you go.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.880
You just know or you go.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.970
OK, we'll go round robin.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.370
I'll start with you Jolie.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.310
Beyonce has a 107 million
followers on Instagram.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.080
How many people does she follow?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.510
She follows zero people.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.439
That is right!

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:47.980
She follows--

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.650
But we want her to follow you.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.150
She needs to follow me.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
That is our goal is to get
her to follow one person,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.050
and it will be me.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.144
OK.

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:56.060
All right, here we go.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.207
Sarah, it's my
goal to get Beyonce

00:01:58.207 --> 00:01:59.290
to follow me on Instagram.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.230
Do you think Beyonce will follow
me before the end of the year?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.080
Yes, I do.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.580
OK, good.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.970
Tracy, Beyonce and Jay-z
are a powerhouse couple.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.720
How do you spell Jay-z?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.777
J-A-Y-Z.

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:15.360
That is right.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.662
You guys are smart.

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:22.370
All right, Jolie.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.280
Beyonce's Single Ladies won a
Grammy for song of the year.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.600
Finish this lyric.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.120
Because if you liked it,
then you should have--

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.900
Put a ring on it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.575
That is right.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.869
Sarah, enough about Beyonce.

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.160
Halloween is around the corner.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.530
What's another word for Ghost?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.200
Scary person.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.180
Casper!

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.810
Yeah, I'll take Casper.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.031
Do you say scary person?

00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:52.530
Scary?

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.420
Yeah.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.690
Well, OK.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.807
They're not really ghosts.

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:00.140
Just because somebody is scary
doesn't make them a gho--

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.660
they first of all have
to be dead, and then--

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.970
all right.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.310
Tracy, it seems like all the
Kardashians are pregnant.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.120
What month do we
celebrate Labor Day?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.897
Labor Day is in September!

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:14.480
That is right.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.070
Jolie, Apple recently
released the new iPhone 8.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.279
Why can't the old Taylor
come to the phone?

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:25.070
Because she's dead.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.611
That's right.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.370
Sarah, the amazing Cate
Blanchett is on the show today.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.610
What are you doing if you're
blanching green beans?

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.040
You are cooking them
a very special way.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.770
Taking the skin off?

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.150
So you're not a chef?

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.639
I am not, no.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.180
All right, you're
a flight attendant,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.230
so you heat things up probably.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.600
You've never blanched anything.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.830
It is boiling them.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.370
And I--

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.869
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:56.725
I can't wait to see
you when you come down.

00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:57.900
[YELLING]

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.400
I know.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.140
It's going to be so much fun.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.640
Watch this, watch.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.140
[CHEERS]

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.870
OK.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.480
Tracy, today is bosses' day.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.760
Who starred in Who's the Boss?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.510
Tony Danza.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.733
That's right.

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:21.540
All right.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.590
Jolie, on this date in
1923, Walt Disney Company

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.220
was founded.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.290
What was Mickey's original name?

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.410
Mickey's original
name was Mickey Mouse?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.290
What was it?

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.640
Mickey Mouse?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.940
So he changed it from Mickey
Mouse to Mickey Mouse?

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.720
I mean-- that's
not what I meant.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320
I meant his name, it was--

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.680
Walt Disney Mickey Mouse?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800
Well Jolie, it has been
a pleasure meeting you.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.591
No, no, no, no, no!

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:04.777
Yeah, no.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:05.360
One more name.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.830
Guess a name, guess a name.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.540
Guess a name.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.910
Guess a name.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.960

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.840

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.067
All right.

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.150
So the rule is, if you get
three in a row you win.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.200
OK, Tracy.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.570
Season two of Stranger
Things premieres this month.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.740
Who plays the character Eleven?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.178
Super cute, looks

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.070
No.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.738
Don't know it.

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:56.210
