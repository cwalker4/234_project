00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:09.794
&gt;&gt; I ASK YOU TO JOIN PRESIDENT

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:13.531
TRUMP AND ME AND THE REST, TO

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:16.267
PUT SOCIALISM ON TRIAL AND

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:17.568
CONVICT IT.

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:22.239
TAX THE RICH, TAX THE WEALTH.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.641
WEALTHY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DON'T

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:26.177
PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE.

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:27.278
I'M HEARING THAT AGAIN.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.214
I THOUGHT I PUT THAT TO BED 30

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:31.816
YEARS AGO.

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:34.785
&gt;&gt; Laura: IT'S LIKE FREDDY

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:35.119
KRUEGER.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.887
IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK.

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:38.889
LARRY KUDLOW NOT ONLY BROUGHT

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.593
THE HOUSE DOWN AT CPAC BUT SENT

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.462
A WARNING SHOT TO THE DEMOCRATS.

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:47.765
MOCK AS YOU MAY, BUT A NEW POLL

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.267
FINDS THAT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:53.571
REGISTERED VOTERS BELIEVE THAT

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:55.239
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUPPORT

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.606
SOCIALISM.

00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:57.742
HERE NOW TO EXPAND ON THAT

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:00.778
MESSAGE, LARRY KUDLOW HIMSELF.

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.712
NICE JOB.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:02.813
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:04.849
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.885
&gt;&gt; Laura: YOU WORKED FOR REAGAN.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.688
I WORKED FOR REAGAN RIGHT OUT OF

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.021
COLLEGE.

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.289
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HOW

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.293
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ANSWERING THIS

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:18.829
BOOMING ECONOMY WITH, LET'S DO

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.396
SOCIALISM.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.165
WHY DO THEY DO THIS?

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.134
WHY IS THIS THE PATH THEY'RE

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:23.467
TAKING?

00:01:23.468 --> 00:01:24.869
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY'VE BEEN MOVING

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.169
LEFT.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.171
IT'S AN ODD STORY, I AGREE WITH

00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:27.438
YOU.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.672
YOU THINK THEY MIGHT LEARN FROM

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:29.740
OUR SUCCESS.

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:35.012
I WAS WATCHING A VERY DEAR

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:37.281
FRIEND WHO WAS AN OBAMA

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:37.681
ECONOMIST.

00:01:37.682 --> 00:01:39.083
EVEN HE'S DEFENDING THIS STUFF.

00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:40.384
IT'S WRONG.

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:41.519
IT'S FUNNY.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.953
AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THINGS

00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:44.054
WERE TURNING UP THE LAST COUPLE

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:46.056
OF YEARS AND THE NEW SET OF

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:48.225
POLICIES OF TAX CUTS AND

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:50.094
DEREGULATIONS AND OPENING UP

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:54.932
ENERGY, AND 3% GROWTH AND MEN

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.867
AND WOMEN BUYING SMALL

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.669
BUSINESSES AGAIN, THEY COME

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.937
ALONG WITH THIS.

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:01.639
IT'S AN ACT OF DESPERATION.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.174
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:05.943
MY MESSAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE.

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:07.178
WE HAVE TO PUT SOCIALISM ON

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.478
TRIAL.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.546
WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE IT.

00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:10.347
WE HAVE TO REBUT IT.

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:12.049
WE HAVE TO PUT PENCIL TO PAPER

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.450
TO SHOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:14.752
THE ECONOMY.

00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:16.320
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE MORAL

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.255
DIMENSIONS OF IT.

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:21.192
AND THEN WE MUST CONVICT

00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:21.559
SOCIALISM.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.793
AND WE SHOULD NOT WAIT.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.728
DO NOT LET THIS FESTER.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.729
LET'S GET GOING RIGHT NOW AND

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.703
LET'S DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S

00:02:32.704 --> 00:02:33.037
SERIOUS.

00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:37.007
THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:37.975
THAT IS OUR TASK AHEAD.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:39.410
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:39.777
ELECTION.

00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:42.479
IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE FUTURE OF

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.913
THE COUNTRY.

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:44.615
&gt;&gt; Laura: I WANT TO GET INTO

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:45.316
WHAT I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:46.784
COULD DO FROM NOW THROUGH THE

00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:48.652
2020 ELECTION TO TRY TO CONVINCE

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:50.054
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:53.290
ALL THE WONDERS OF CAPITALISM

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.792
ABOUT WHY THEY'RE GOING DOWN THE

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:55.259
WRONG PATH.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.161
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN A

00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:57.661
MOMENT.

00:02:57.662 --> 00:02:58.829
BUT IT WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.131
THAT ONE OF YOUR DEAR FRIENDS

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:09.340
SAID TODAY.

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.942
HE SAID, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:14.245
VOTERS, INCLUDING A MAJORITY OF

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:17.514
VOTERS UNDER 30, SAY THEY

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:19.817
APPROVE OF SOCIALISM.

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:21.652
WHAT AMERICANS ACTUALLY WANT IS

00:03:21.653 --> 00:03:25.155
WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD CALL

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:27.825
SOCIAL DEMOCRACY, A MARKET

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:29.894
ECONOMY, BUT A STRONG SOCIAL

00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:30.327
SAFETY NET.

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:33.831
THEY WANT US TO LOOK LIKE

00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:36.634
DENMARK OR NORWAY, NOT

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:37.001
VENEZUELA.

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:39.036
DO YOU CARE TO TAKE THAT ON?

00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:42.339
&gt;&gt; I DO, BECAUSE I HEARD THIS IN

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.140
THE CAMPAIGN FROM SENATOR

00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:45.342
SANDERS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

00:03:45.343 --> 00:03:47.177
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING, IF YOU GO

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:50.981
BACK AND LOOK, DENMARK, NORWAY,

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:54.118
SWEDEN, HOLLAND HAVE ALL PULLED

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:57.454
BACK FROM THIS GREAT SOCIAL

00:03:57.455 --> 00:03:58.455
DEMOCRACY THEY TALK ABOUT

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:01.392
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GROWING.

00:04:01.393 --> 00:04:04.495
THEY CUT BACK ON REGULATIONS.

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.298
THEY'RE NOW GROWING.

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.600
THE COUNTRIES THAT USED TO BE

00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:12.436
BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN, LET'S

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.204
TAKE POLAND AS A PERFECT

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:18.309
EXAMPLE, THEY'RE RUNNING

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.310
FREE-MARKET ECONOMIES.

00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:21.946
ON THE OTHER SIDE, CUBA,

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:24.248
VENEZUELA, IRAN, THEY ARE USING

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.850
THE OLD SOVIET-STYLE MODEL.

00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:28.652
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ANY OF

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:31.021
THESE DEMOCRATS ARE WANTING TO

00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:33.724
CONSCIOUSLY GO BACK TO THE

00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:34.158
SOVIET UNION.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.692
THAT'S NOT MY POINT.

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:37.361
MY POINT IS, HOWEVER, WHEN YOU

00:04:37.362 --> 00:04:39.530
START TALKING ABOUT A CENTRALLY

00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:43.300
PLAN AND CENTRALLY OWNED --

00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:45.703
&gt;&gt; Laura: STATE-OWNED

00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:46.103
ENTERPRISES.

00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:46.837
&gt;&gt; IT COULD BE.

00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:51.709
CAN I JUST GET MY TRUMP QUOTE IN

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.009
HERE?

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.178
SOCIALISM PROMISES PROSPERITY

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.580
BUT IT DELIVERS POVERTY.

00:04:56.581 --> 00:05:02.720
&gt;&gt; Laura: BUT IT'S WEALTH AND

00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:03.620
EQUALITY.

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.723
AND IT'S BEING PACKAGED IN THIS

00:05:05.724 --> 00:05:06.657
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:08.092
PRESENTATION OF FAIRNESS.

00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:11.261
IT'S GOING TO BE BACK TO THE WHY

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:18.202
IS IT FAIR THAT HE'S MAKING $598

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:18.535
MILLION.

00:05:18.536 --> 00:05:19.770
IT'S BACK TO THAT.

00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:22.339
AND IN COLLEGE, AS YOU AND I

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.909
KNOW, THEY'RE BEING SPOON-FED

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.848
THIS DRIVEL ABOUT SOCIAL

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.449
DEMOCRACIES, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.486
BEING WIPED OUT ACROSS EUROPE.

00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:38.822
&gt;&gt; TOP 10% PAY 70%.

00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:45.662
THE BOTTOM 50% OF TAXPAYERS I

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:47.264
DON'T PAY ANY TAXES.

00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:50.167
WHEN YOU LIVE IN A PROSPEROUS

00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:52.603
TIME, THOSE ARGUMENTS WILL FAIL

00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:53.737
BECAUSE IT'S A POVERTY TRAP.

00:05:53.738 --> 00:05:54.705
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE.

00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:58.509
WE HAVE TO SAY, LOOK, YOU WANT

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.377
THIS GREEN NEW DEAL, SO THAT

00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:01.578
MEANS YOU CAN'T TRAVEL, CAN'T

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.114
GET IN A CAR OR AN AIRPLANE.

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.584
&gt;&gt; Laura: STORYTELLING IS ALWAYS

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.453
PROBLEMATIC FOR PEOPLE NORMALLY

00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:11.688
COMFORTABLE WITH CHARTS, DECIMAL

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.627
POINTS, A

00:06:15.827 --> 00:06:18.329
&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS, THE STATE OF

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.731
THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS FAILING

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:21.966
AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.068
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR THE STOCK

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.769
MARKET'S DOING GREAT, WALL

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.271
STREET'S FINE, MAIN STREET NOT

00:06:27.272 --> 00:06:29.106
SO MUCH, THAT'S A VERY SELECT

00:06:29.107 --> 00:06:31.742
GROUP WHO ARE BENEFITTING.

00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:33.010
&gt;&gt; DESPITE WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:39.717
SAYS, THIS IS NOT A HOT ECONOMY.

00:06:39.718 --> 00:06:42.786
&gt;&gt; LAURA: BACK WITH ME, WHITE

00:06:42.787 --> 00:06:45.055
HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR LARRY

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:45.389
KUDLOW.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.658
LARRY, THIS IS LIKE CANDY TO A

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.958
BABY.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:52.096
THIS IS SO EASY, BUT GO AHEAD,

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:52.396
LARRY.

00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:56.934
&gt;&gt; WE JUST SCORED 3.1% GROWTH.

00:06:56.935 --> 00:06:58.836
THAT IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:01.739
13, 15 YEARS.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.807
ON THE ISSUE OF THE RICH AND SO

00:07:03.808 --> 00:07:07.144
FORTH, THIS IS A BLUE-COLLAR

00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:07.745
RECOVERY.

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:11.615
ACTUALLY, MY PAL HEATHER LONG,

00:07:11.616 --> 00:07:13.384
SHE ABSOLUTELY DID IT.

00:07:13.385 --> 00:07:15.486
THIS IS A BLUE-COLLAR RECOVERY.

00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:16.887
IT'S THE BEST JOB PERFORMANCE IN

00:07:16.888 --> 00:07:19.290
THE BLUE COLLARS.

00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.792
THEY ARE ALSO -- THEIR WAGES ARE

00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:24.962
RISING FASTER THAN WHITE-COLLAR

00:07:24.963 --> 00:07:25.262
WAGES.

00:07:25.263 --> 00:07:27.965
DO NOT TELL ME THIS IS JUST A

00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:28.632
RICH PERSON'S ECONOMY.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:31.202
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:34.305
THIS IS WHAT WE SAW WITH REAGAN

00:07:34.306 --> 00:07:36.240
AND CONTINUED IN THE '90S MORE

00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:37.708
OR LESS BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:38.576
IT 20 YEARS.

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:40.811
&gt;&gt; Laura: PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:45.082
THEIR BOATS COMPLETELY REFITTED

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.351
TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS TOO

00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:47.952
EXPENSIVE.

00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:50.254
THIS GUY SAID, IT TRICKLES DOWN

00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:52.723
TO ME.

00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:53.524
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OUT OF

00:07:53.525 --> 00:07:56.493
THE LABOR FORCE ARE COMING BACK.

00:07:56.494 --> 00:07:57.428
&gt;&gt; Laura: THEY'RE SELLING SNAKE

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:57.695
OIL.

00:07:57.696 --> 00:07:58.462
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST.

00:07:58.463 --> 00:07:59.296
IT'S A LIE.

00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.298
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS A LIE.

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:06.804
AND LET'S GO TO THE POINT.

00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:09.907
PAUL ON NOVEMBER 9TH, 2016,

00:08:09.908 --> 00:08:15.212
PRESIDENT WINS THE ELECTION, HIS

00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:15.613
PRESIDENT WINS THE ELECTION, H S

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:17.915
HISTORIC, AND HE PREDICT AS

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:24.888
GLOBAL RECESSION.

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:25.322
N

00:08:25.323 --> 00:08:27.458
FAST FORWARD TWO WEEKS AGO, HE'S

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:28.626
BASICALLY SAYING A VERSION OF

00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:29.893
THE SAME THING, OVER THE NEXT

00:08:29.894 --> 00:08:31.295
TWO YEARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:32.596
DEAL WITH A RECESSION.

00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:33.731
IT IS DOOM AND GLOOM.

00:08:33.732 --> 00:08:35.599
WE'RE THE HAPPY PARTY NOW.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.501
WE'RE LIKE, WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:40.137
THEY ARE THE DOOM AND GLOOMERS,

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:40.471
PERIOD.

00:08:40.472 --> 00:08:43.374
&gt;&gt; GROWTH AND PROSPERITY AND

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:44.375
JOBS BRING HAPPINESS.

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:46.644
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:47.811
A POLITICAL MISTAKE.

00:08:47.812 --> 00:08:49.013
THEY'RE DEALING WITH AN

00:08:49.014 --> 00:08:50.781
ENVIRONMENT OF RECESSION.

00:08:50.782 --> 00:08:52.549
WE'RE NOW MOVING INTO A NEW

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.318
ENVIRONMENT OF PROSPERITY.

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:59.056
LOOK, THIS DEBATE, SOCIALISM,

00:08:59.057 --> 00:09:01.058
CAPITALISM, THIS IS FREEDOM AND

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:04.728
OPPORTUNITY VERSUS STATISM

00:09:04.729 --> 00:09:05.562
&gt;&gt; Laura: AND CONTROL.

00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:08.532
&gt;&gt; AND REGULATION AND CONTROL.

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:09.300
GOVERNMENTS DON'T PRODUCE

00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:09.700
ANYTHING.

00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:11.302
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE THERE AS A

00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:12.269
SAFETY NET FOR THE POOR.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.872
LET ME MAKE THIS POINT.

00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:16.573
GOVERNMENTS DON'T PRODUCE.

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:18.776
WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE, HE HAS

00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:20.711
ENDED THE WAR ON SUCCESS, HE HAS

00:09:20.712 --> 00:09:22.946
ENDED THE WAR ON BUSINESSES.

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:25.115
HE HAS RESTORED INCENTIVES.

00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:27.318
SO, YOU WORK THE EXTRA HOUR, YOU

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.320
MAKE THE EXTRA INVESTMENT.

00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:31.221
&gt;&gt; Laura: YOU GET TO KEEP IT.

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:32.956
WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:33.724
MY IDEA IS THAT THE PRESIDENT

00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:36.293
AND A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE

00:09:36.294 --> 00:09:37.594
WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS.

00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:41.699
THE PRESIDENT GIVES A SERIES OF

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.501
HISTORIC SPEECHES ON THE TENET

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:48.572
OF THIS PRO-GROWTH ECONOMIC

00:09:48.573 --> 00:09:57.414
REVIVAL MIRACLE SPEECHES FOR ALL

00:09:57.415 --> 00:09:59.983
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE NOT GETTING

00:09:59.984 --> 00:10:00.918
THAT EDUCATION.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.753
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:06.056
I LOVE THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:06.957
NEEDS TO BE DONE SERIOUSLY.

00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.159
&gt;&gt; Laura: AND NOT AS A RALLY.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.296
AS A SERIOUS, SERIOUS TALK.

00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:14.098
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE IN YOUR 20'S AND

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:15.766
YOU'RE NOT A SOCIALIST, YOU HAVE

00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:16.834
NO HEART.

00:10:16.835 --> 00:10:20.170
IF YOU'RE IN YOUR 30'S AND YOU

00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:22.473
HAVE NO CAPITALIST, YOU HAVE NO

00:10:22.474 --> 00:10:23.006
MIND.

00:10:23.007 --> 00:10:25.576
THESE KIDS ARE MOVING INTO THE

00:10:25.577 --> 00:10:25.943
WORKFORCE.

00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:27.177
THEY'RE NOT WORKING AND THEY

00:10:27.178 --> 00:10:30.080
WILL LEARN ABOUT INCENTIVES AND

00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:31.315
REWARD AND OPPORTUNITY AND

00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:31.648
FREEDOM.

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:32.116
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:10:32.117 --> 00:10:33.751
THE RESULTS WILL SHOW.

00:10:33.752 --> 00:10:35.018
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT JUST

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:35.919
ABOUT A POLITICAL ELECTION.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.288
&gt;&gt; Laura: IT'S ABOUT THE

00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:38.622
COUNTRY.

00:10:38.623 --> 00:10:40.023
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR

00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:40.791
THE COUNTRY.

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:42.292
FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY VERSUS

00:10:42.293 --> 00:10:43.594
CONTROL AND PICKING YOUR POCKET

00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:45.896
TO GIVE MONEY TO OTHERS.

00:10:45.897 --> 00:10:54.505
&gt;&gt; LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT

00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:56.808
OF HAPPINESS.
