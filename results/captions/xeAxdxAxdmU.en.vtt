00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.530
The President:  Oh, thank you
very much. Thank you very much.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.480
And thank you very much also
to a man named Matt Schlapp.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.130
What a job he’s done.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.050
(applause)

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.790
And to CPAC — I actually started
quite a while ago at CPAC,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.670
and came here — probably made
my first real political speech.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.080
And I enjoyed it so much that
I came back for a second one,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.290
then a third.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.970
Then I said, what the hell,
let’s run for President. Right?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.110
(applause)

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.370
But it’s wonderful to be back
with so many great patriots,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.940
old friends,
and brave young conservatives.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.760
What a future you have.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.120
(applause)

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.370
Our movement and our future
in our country is unlimited.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.690
What we’ve done together has
never been done in the history

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.130
maybe of beyond of country,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.080
maybe in the history
of the world.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.260
They came from the mountains
and the valleys and the cities.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.270
They came from all over.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.480
And what we did in 2016 —
the Election, we call it,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.030
with a capital “E” —
it’s never been done before.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
And we’re going to do it,
I think, again in 2020,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.730
and the numbers
are going to be even bigger.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.630
(applause)

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.470
Audience:  USA! USA! USA!

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.000
The President:  And we all had
to endure, as I was running.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.540
So you had 17 Republicans,
plus me.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.990
(laughter)

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.360
And I was probably more of a
conservative than a Republican.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.409
People just didn’t
quite understand that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.700
They didn’t understand it.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.890
I think now, with what we’ve
done with the judiciary

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.000
and so many other things,
I think they get it very well.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.220
And it’s driving
the other side crazy.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.920
(applause)

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.930
But we all had to endure,
remember?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.810
How many times did you hear,
for months and months,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.360
“There is no way to 270”?
You know what that means, right?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.430
“There is no way to 270.”
They couldn’t get me there.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.340
We might as well
have just given up.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.100
But there wasn’t
any way to 270.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.600
In fact, I actually went up
to Maine to get one,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.420
and I did win the one.
But we didn’t need the one.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.620
(applause)

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.500
We didn’t need it. We won Maine.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.520
We won our half of Maine,
remember?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.580
You have Nebraska.
We won both in Nebraska.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.760
We won the half
we had to win in Maine.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.290
So we got the one,
but we didn’t need the one,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.960
because we didn’t get 270;
we got 306 to 223.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.280
(applause)

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.970
223-306.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.850
A state called Wisconsin,
a state called —

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.170
(applause)

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.250
— Michigan, where — by the way,
where Fiat Chrysler

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.180
just announced
a $4.5 billion incredible —

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.380
(applause)

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.500
— expansion and new plant,
doubling their workforce.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.680
Many, many car companies
have moved back to Michigan

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.520
and are continuing to do so.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.010
(applause)

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.859
Big numbers. Nobody every
thought they’d see that happen.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.780
So I think we’re going to do
even better in 2020.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.160
I think we’re going
to do numbers

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.960
that people haven’t seen
for a long time.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.690
(applause)

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.950
The men and women here today
are on the frontlines

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.830
of protecting
America’s interests,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.960
defending America’s value,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.690
and reclaiming
our nation’s priceless heritage.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.080
It’s true.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.000
(applause)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.810
With your help, we are reversing
decades of blunders

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.920
and betrayals.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.280
These are serious,
serious betrayals to our nation

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190
and to everything we stand for.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.100
It’s been done
by the failed ruling class

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.550
that enriched foreign countries
at our expense.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.510
It wasn’t “America first.”

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.600
In many cases,
it was “America last.”

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.410
Those days are over.
Long over.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:05:01.390
(applause)

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.360
America is winning again.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.700
(applause)

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.180
America is respected again.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.060
(applause)

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.420
And the world knows it.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.120
When I meet
with prime ministers,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.969
when I meet with presidents —
and I get along with them —

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.570
because they know that what’s
taken place over many years —

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.620
not just the Obama
administration;

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.440
long before that —

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.400
they can’t believe, themselves,
that they got away with it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.590
They can’t believe it.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.050
An impossible thing.
And they like me.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.250
(applause)

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.200
And the reason they like me —
they tell me;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.760
they say, “Mr. President…”
I said — as an example,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.450
President Xi of China,
I have great respect.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.580
We have a great relationship.
I say, “How is it possible

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.730
that you got away
with this for so long?”

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.570
(laughter)

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.420
And he said, “Because nobody
ever asked us to change.”

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.050
It’s true.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.600
When they charge
40 percent tariffs

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.570
on our cars
going into China,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.520
and we charge them nothing
coming into our country;

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.360
when they raise their tariff
from 10 percent to 25 percent

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.050
and then to 40 percent —
and they said to me,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.320
“We expected that somebody would
call and say you can’t do that.”

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.520
(laughter)

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.319
“Nobody called,
so we just left it.”

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.680
And I don’t blame them.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.530
We should’ve been doing
the same thing to them.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.800
But we didn’t.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.130
(applause)

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.030
True. Right? Hard to believe.
It’s hard to believe.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.720
But now things are different.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.870
Now we’re negotiating
with China.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.030
They wouldn’t negotiate
with previous administrations.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.470
But I found some very old laws

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.430
from when our country
was rich — really rich.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.630
The old tariff laws —
we had to dust them off;

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.679
you could hardly see,
they were so dusty.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.249
But, fortunately,
they weren’t terminated.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.530
We started getting politically
correct, even back then.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.650
But I said, when we were doing
the great things,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.970
what happened to those laws?

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.340
And I checked,
and I found 301 and 382.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.180
I found one, 1938, where we
can do what we have to do.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.530
But, you know, they had a debate
in —

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.630
it was really a tough time
in our country

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.520
because we had so much money

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.480
we didn’t know
what the hell to do with it.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.880
Tough, tough, tough.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.260
It was called
the Great Tariff Debate.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.960
Mark Levin will look this up.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.260
(laughter)

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.420
And the problem is, with Mark,
if I make a little mistake,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.910
he’ll let us know
on Sunday night.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.140
(laughter)

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.580
I got to be very careful
when I talk about this.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.220
But it was the
Great Tariff Debate of 1888.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.160
And the debate was:

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.640
We didn’t know what to do with
all of the money we were making.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.280
We were so rich.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.440
And McKinley,
prior to being President,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.880
he was very strong
on protecting our assets,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.520
protecting our country.
And he made statements that,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.390
“Others cannot come
into our country

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.170
and steal our wealth
and steal our jobs,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.940
and build their country
and not defend our country.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.920
We can’t do that. We can’t
ever allow that to happen.”

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:37.140
(applause)

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.390
And, you know — I don’t know,
maybe you know.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.880
You know I’m
totally off-script, right?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.080
Audience Member:   (Inaudible.)

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.380
The President:  Thank you,
darling.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.210
(laughter)

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.309
You know I’m totally off script
right now.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.130
And this is how I got elected,
by being off script.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.310
(applause)

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.010
True.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.730
And if we don’t go off script,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.380
our country is
in big trouble, folks.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.080
Because we have
to get it back.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.630
And when I look at what’s
happening on the other side,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.520
I encourage it.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.170
I say, “No, no…”
— I think the New Green Deal,

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.920
or whatever the hell
they call it —

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.400
Audience:  Booo —

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.050
The President:  The Green
New Deal, right?

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.620
Green New Deal —
I encourage it.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.150
I think it’s really something
that they should promote.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.480
(laughter)

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.900
They should work hard on.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.540
It’s something our country
needs desperately.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.290
They have to go out
and get it.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.450
But I’ll take the other side
of that argument

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.470
only because I’m mandated to.
I’m mandated.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.040
But they should stay
with that argument.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.240
Never change.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.460
(laughter)

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.700
Never change.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.350
(applause)

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.570
No planes. No energy.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.900
(laughter)

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.250
When the wind stops blowing,
that’s the end of your electric.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.200
(laughter)
Let’s hurry up. “Darling” —

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.990
“Darling, is the wind
blowing today?

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.940
I’d like to watch
television, darling.”

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:45.110
(Laughter and applause.)

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.640
No, but it’s true.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.450
So the Great Tariff Debate
of 1888 —

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.990
and then we had so much money
we could do whatever we wanted.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.890
We built forces up
that were incredible.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.780
Then, in 1913,
they ended tariffs, okay?

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.480
They ended tariffs.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.970
Somebody got stupid
and they ended tariffs.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.590
They said, “Oh, it’s okay
for other nations to come in.”

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.530
I won’t use a certain words
because it’s not politically —

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.030
but everybody knows
the word I’d love to use.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.910
Should I use it?
I won’t do it.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.660
(applause)

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.450
Our great First Lady
always said,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.540
“Don’t use certain words,
please.”

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.900
I said, “But the audience
wanted me to do it.”

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.600
She said, “Don’t do it.”

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.350
And the problem is,
if I do do that,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.030
they won’t put
the little preamble

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.310
that we just went through.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.810
They’ll just use the word,
and they’ll said,

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.060
“Isn’t that terrible.”
So I won’t use it.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.260
(laughter)

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.150
I’ve learned.
Because with the fake news —

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.460
Audience:  Booo —

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.080
The President:  — if you tell
a joke,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.200
if you’re sarcastic,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.170
if you’re having fun
with the audience,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.150
if you’re on live television
with millions of people

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.390
and 25,000 people in an arena,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.930
and if you say something like,
“Russia, please, if you can,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.710
get us Hillary Clinton’s emails.
Please, Russia, please.”

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:26.900
(applause)

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.340
“Please get us the emails.
Please!”

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:36.350
Audience:  Trump! Trump!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.800
Trump!

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.810
The President:  So everybody
is having a good time.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.790
I’m laughing,
we’re all having fun.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.170
And then that fake CNN
and others say,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.620
“He asked Russia
to go get the emails. Horrible.”

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.860
(laughter)

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.860
I mean, I thought — like,
two weeks ago,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.540
I’m watching and they’re
talking about one of the points.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.070
“He asked Russia
for the emails.”

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.310
These people are sick.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.510
(laughter)

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.350
And I’m telling you,
they know the game.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.700
They know the game,
and they play it dirty —

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.010
dirtier than anybody
has ever played the game.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.190
Dirtier than
it’s ever been played.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.880
But the thing that we’ve done
is very special.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.400
Because, on trade,
and because of tariffs —

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.949
and I know there are people
in the Republican Party

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.710
and people — really,
even conservatives —

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.340
good conservatives —
they don’t like tariffs.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.040
I’m not liking or not liking.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.940
The minimum, the greatest
negotiating tool

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.860
in the history of our country.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.220
Do you think China would be

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.870
sending their top
representatives over?

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.700
Right now, China is paying
25 percent tariff

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.250
on $50 billion
worth of technology goods.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:03.940
I was then going to charge them
25 percent on $200 billion.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.010
Not like $200 million —
that’s a lot.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.230
This is 200 with a “B”
— billion. Two-hundred billion.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.890
So — but I was nice,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.660
because we’re having
a very strong negotiation,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.430
which if it weren’t
for tariffs —

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.490
and I tell this to President Xi;
this is nothing to hide.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.140
I would never be talking
like this because,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.120
in theory, it could hurt
your negotiating position.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.540
But in my case, it can’t,
because it’s true.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.880
I was nice, and I left it
at 10 percent on $200 billion.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.830
And here’s the beauty:

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.860
We’ve lost so much money
with China —

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.530
$500 billion a year.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.970
And on trade,
it’s such a disaster;

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.710
it’s $507 billion a year.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.190
China — just one country.
We lose with everybody, almost.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.660
But China is one country.
$507 billion, for many years.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.970
So the beauty is this: I have $
250 billion

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.040
more to put tariffs on.
The numbers are staggering.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.820
Billions of dollars, right now,
are pouring into our Treasury.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.190
And for those of you
that haven’t done the research,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.100
if you look, of the 25 percent,
our country —

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.390
as it’s turned out,

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.180
because it’s now been on there
for a long while.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.820
Our — and I’m in no rush
because I’m fine with it.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.260
I’m fine with it.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.450
Of the 25 points,
we’ve paid for 4 points,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.920
and China has paid
for 21 points.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.130
Okay?
Twenty-one.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.730
That’s what the numbers are.
It’s very simple.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.800
You know, everyone said,
“Oh, it’s a tax on our…”

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.870
It’s not really.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.590
And what China and other
countries do sometimes

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:50.460
is they will subsidize it.
So the tax really is incredible.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.640
But what it is,
beyond everything else,

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.760
I can negotiate.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.190
But then you have senators
and a few congressman,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.430
but not Mark Meadows.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.240
Where is the great Mark Meadows?
He’s here someplace.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.620
(applause)

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.430
Man, has he been good.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:17.140
Mark and Jim Jordan, and —
(applause)

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.530
— I want to name every one of
those couple of hundred people.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.990
Because we do have a lot. I want
to name every damn one of them.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.690
They have been incredible.
They’ve been fighting.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.180
And I just see Mark
in the audience.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.280
They’ve been fighting —
with Deb, much more important.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.190
His wife is incredible.
What an asset.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.120
He would be nowhere without her.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.770
(Laughter and applause.)
Right?

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.230
But they fight so hard on this
witch hunt,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.370
this phony deal
that they put together;

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.040
this phony thing that now
looks like it’s dying.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.520
So they don’t have anything
with Russia.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.590
There’s no collusion.
So now they go and morph into,

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.580
“Let’s inspect every deal
he’s ever done.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.380
We’re going to go
into his finances.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.150
We’re going to check his deals.
We’re going to check…”

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.420
These people are sick.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.630
(laughter)

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.830
They’re sick.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.050
(applause)

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.020
I saw little Shifty Schiff
yesterday.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.880
No, it’s the first time.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.780
He went into a meeting
and he said,

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.500
“We’re going to look
into his finances.”

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.000
I said,
“Where did that come from?”

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.860
He always talked about Russia —
collusion with Russia.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.840
The collusion delusion.
(Laughter and applause.)

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.660
So now we’re waiting
for a report,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.360
and we’ll find out
whether or not,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.430
and who we’re dealing with.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.700
We’re waiting for a report
by people that weren’t elected.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.690
We had — think of this:
We had the greatest election —

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.039
in all fairness,
I used to hear Andrew Jackson.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.190
This was now greater than
the election of Andrew Jackson.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.490
People say that.
No, people say it.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.690
(applause)

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.750
I’m not saying it. Right?

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.580
This was the equivalent
or greater.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.600
You know, they used to go
to Ronald Reagan,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.899
when I first started.
“This is Ronald Reagan.”

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.470
Then we started
really doing well,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.270
and they were coming
from everywhere to vote.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.290
Those red hats — and white ones.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.030
The key is in the color.
The key is what it says.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.670
“Make America Great Again,”
is what it says.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.020
(applause)

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.720
Right? Right?

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.590
But we had the greatest
of all time.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.620
Now we have people that lost.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:24.210
And unfortunately,
you put the wrong people

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.880
in a couple of positions,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.460
and they leave people for a long
time that shouldn’t be there.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.600
And, all of a sudden,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.190
they’re trying to take you out
with bullshit. Okay?

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.470
(laughter)

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.450
With bullshit.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:52.350
(applause)

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.670
Now, Robert Mueller
never received a vote,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.110
and neither did the person
that appointed him.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.920
And as you know,
the Attorney General says,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.990
“I’m going to recuse myself.”

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.690
(laughter)
“I’m going to recuse.”

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.560
And I said, why the hell
didn’t he tell me that

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.590
before I put him in?
How do you recuse yourself?

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.300
But the person that appointed
Robert Mueller

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.000
never received a vote.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.980
Robert Mueller put 13
of the angriest Democrats

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.860
in the history of our country
on the commission.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.250
(laughter)

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.500
Now, how do you do that?
These are angry, angry people.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.680
You take a look at them.
One of them was involved

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.090
with the Hillary Clinton
Foundation, running it.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.350
Another one has perhaps
the worst reputation

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.300
of any human being
I’ve ever seen.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.650
(laughter)

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.350
All killers.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.670
In fact, it would’ve been
actually better for them

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.250
if they put half and half,

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.920
and Mueller can do
whatever he wants anyway,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.940
which he’ll probably do.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.070
But we have conflicts.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.780
I had a nasty
business transaction

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.060
with Robert Mueller
a number of years ago.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.760
I said, why isn’t
that mentioned?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.240
He wanted the job
as FBI Director.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.600
I mean, these are things that
are out there; they know it.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.320
Why isn’t that —
and I didn’t give it to him.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.920
Why isn’t that mentioned?
Jim Comey — Lyin’ James Comey —

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.200
Audience:  Booo —

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.900
The President:  —
is his best friend.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.780
James Comey is his best friend.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.740
And those are a few
of the conflicts.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.130
Other than that,
it’s wonderful.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.480
(laughter)

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.800
So — so everybody is waiting.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.550
I thought of it
this morning, Mark.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.950
And I heard you made
an incredible speech

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.010
and statement today. Mark Levin.
I heard it was incredible.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.720
(applause)

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.420
And I was on the way.
But I’ll see it later.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.040
I guarantee I’ll be
watching it later.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.220
I have one of the great
inventions in history.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.620
It’s called TiVo.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.050
(laughter)

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.940
I think it’s actually better
than television,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.100
because television
is practically useless

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.450
without TiVo, right?

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.780
(laughter)

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.579
But I’ll be watching it later,
Mark.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.880
But people that got no votes.
But I heard this morning,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.240
“President Trump is waiting
for the Mueller report.”

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.340
I said, wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.490
(laughter)

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:25.300
So the Attorney General
recuses himself,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.410
and I don’t fire him.
No obstruction.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.500
That’s the other thing:
If you use your right,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.510
if you use your power,

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.440
if you use Article 2,
it’s called obstruction.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.450
But only for Trump.
For nobody else.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.770
(laughter)

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.900
So the Attorney General
is weak and ineffective,

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.949
and he doesn’t do
what he should’ve done.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.580
Somebody that never got a vote
writes a powerful letter —

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.010
horrible — about Comey.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:02.170
Every single Democrat said
Comey should be fired,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.140
or worse, if possible.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.210
(laughter)

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.260
Every Republican said —
everybody — in fact,

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.380
when I fired Comey,
I said, “You know…”

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.210
— First Lady — I said, “Melania,
I’m doing something today.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.559
I’m doing it because
it really has to be done.”

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:30.760
He’s bad. He’s a bad, bad —
he’s a bad, bad guy.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.130
That’s been proven now with
all of the emails and the texts.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.890
“I’m doing something
that has to be done.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.940
But you know the good news?
It’s going to be bipartisan.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.220
It’s going to be so popular,
it’s going to be bipartisan.”

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.510
(laughter)

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.500
Every Democrat hates him.
Every Republican hates him.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.030
He did a horrible job
at the FBI.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.170
Speak to the real agents,
the real people.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.850
Because the people in the FBI
are incredible people —

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.560
not the sleaze on top.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.130
(applause)

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:06.240
And I said to the First Lady —
I said,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.940
“But you know the good news?

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.290
The good news is that this is
going to be so bipartisan.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.760
Everyone is going to love it.”

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.910
So we fire Comey.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.670
And Schumer — who called for
his resignation many times —

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.080
Podesta, I believe that day —

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.050
because he still hasn’t
gotten over

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.940
getting his ass kicked, okay?

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.410
(applause)

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.450
I believe that day called
for his resignation.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:40.810
That day. Podesta,
the great genius of campaigns.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.230
(laughter)

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.370
He called for
the Comey resignation.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.740
Others — almost every,
I would say.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.380
Mark, would you say virtually
every Democrat,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.590
virtually every —

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.439
I can’t think of anybody
that said he’s doing a good job.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.030
So I said to Melania,

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.900
“Melania, the good news,
this will be a popular thing.”

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.220
(laughter)

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.900
And I fire a bad cop.
I fire a dirty cop.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.080
And all of a sudden,
the Democrats say,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.430
“How dare he fire him.
How dare he do this.”

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.920
And that’s where we are, folks.
That’s where we are.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.780
We’re in this swamp
of Washington, D.C.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.930
But you know what?
We’re winning, and they’re not.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.760
We’re winning.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:40.570
(applause)

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.820
So, just to finish —

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.360
and I’ll tell you,
Matt Schlapp is loving this.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.600
(laughter)

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.149
He’s saying, “This is a lot more
than we paid for.”

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.050
You know, normally you read
a few pages and you say,

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.750
“Bye, folks.”

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.890
But you know
what I like about this?

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.670
Number one, I’m in love,
and you’re in love.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.910
We’re all in love together.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.660
We’ve done something
that nobody has ever done.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.930
(applause)

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:13.870
Right? It’s easy. No, it’s easy.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.290
You know, a great friend of mine
from New York,

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.900
he’s a stone-cold killer.
He’s a brutal man.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.360
He’s actually not even
a good friend of mine

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.240
because he’d turn on me
in two seconds if it was

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.570
(inaudible).
(laughter)

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.270
But he’s a very rich guy.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.230
And he said, “What are you
going to speak about today?

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.660
Like, what are you
going to speak?”

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.660
I said, “I don’t know.
I don’t know.”

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.910
(laughter)

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.590
He said, “I just heard
that you have the biggest crowd

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.170
in the history of CPAC.
They’re all over.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.340
By the way,
not only in this giant room.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.689
They’re in many hotel rooms
all over the place.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.960
You’re just better
at real estate than they are.”

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:04.800
(Laughter and applause.)
True.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.220
But this guy — you all know
his name — very rich guy.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.160
And he has a problem with
a thing called public speaking.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.300
If he has to speak to more than
like five people, he chokes.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.480
(laughter)

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.400
He can’t breathe.
You know, juh-juh.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.740
“Are you okay?”
He kills people for a living —

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.440
meaning mentally
and financially —

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.770
but if there’s like an audience
of nine, it’s like “augh.”

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.520
(laughter)

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.920
So he said to me,
“How the hell do you do that?”

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.020
And I said, “It’s easy.”

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.210
And the reason it’s easy —
I really mean this —

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.960
there’s so much love
in this room, it’s easy to talk.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.180
You can talk your heart out.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.560
You really could.
There’s love in this room.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.760
(applause)

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.310
You can talk your heart out.
It’s easy.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:59.050
(applause)

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.460
It’s easy. It’s easy.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.430
And we’ve had that from the day
I came down with your First Lady

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.020
on the escalator in Trump Tower.
It’s been easy.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.220
(applause)

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.280
And you know what?
We never had an empty seat.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.160
We went out
and helped Ted Cruz.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.020
We went out and helped
so many people.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.720
And I’ll tell you what:

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.410
If we didn’t do those 32 rallies
— and it wasn’t easy.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.170
When you’re doing rallies
with 25-,

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.920
30,000 people — in Texas,
we had 109,000 people sign up.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.570
We used the Houston Rockets
arena; it holds 22,000.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.490
Tens of thousands were outside.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.050
We were sending notices,
“Please don’t come.”

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.730
That’s a little different.
Usually, people are begging.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.800
“Well, yeah,
like can somebody come?”

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.750
(laughter)
We never had an empty seat.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.300
Of course, the Washington Post —
a guy named David Weigel —

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.780
he wrote an article,
some arena —

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.000
Audience:  Booo —

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.210
The President:  No,
listen to this.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.510
He wrote an article.
He got there four hours early.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.260
He took pictures
of an empty arena.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.750
He then put out a note —
something to the effect,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.970
“Not very good crowd size,
Mr. President.”

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.070
And I never saw it
because I don’t follow the guy.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.760
But thousands of people
that were in that arena

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.880
that was packed
with 25,000 people outside

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.140
that couldn’t get in —

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.990
he got there four
or five hours early

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.700
because he doesn’t fly private.
You know.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.020
(laughter)

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.880
And maybe it’s because
of the carbon footprint.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.100
You think maybe that’s it?

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.350
(laughter)

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.150
Maybe. Must be the carbon
footprint.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.770
He just doesn’t want private.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.470
But he got there hours early.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.910
And, you know, the place
hadn’t started taking in people.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.240
They weren’t going
to take them in.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.930
So there were virtually nobody.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.630
And, you know,
whatever it was — 18,000 —

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.220
when you have nobody,
it’s a little scary-looking.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.440
So he took pictures.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.300
And you know
who really got even?

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.710
Our people.
Because they were incensed.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.610
We had people sitting
on the stairwells.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.620
We had people
sitting in every seat.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.980
I don’t think we’ve had an empty
seat since we announced.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.650
And from the day
we came down the escalator,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:12.110
I really don’t believe we’ve had
an empty seat at any arena,

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.190
at any stadium.
It’s been an incredible thing.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.910
And that’s why I say this has
never, ever happened before,

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.900
and now we have to
verify it in 2020

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.290
with an even bigger victory.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.490
(applause)

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.190
Audience:  Four more years!

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:42.610
Four more years!
Four more years!

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.940
The President:  And, by the way,
just to finish that story,

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.090
the great Sarah Huckabee
and Mercedes,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.070
who is incredible,
sitting right here —

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.770
(applause)
— Mercedes, thank you.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.260
They always say — you know,
they’re good people, right?

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.610
Much better than I am.
They always say,

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.040
“Don’t bring it up.
Don’t fight. Don’t fight.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.540
Everyone understands.”
I said, “They don’t understand.”

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.390
If I don’t explain it, how are
they going to understand?

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.860
So remember the arena one,
right? And then it was shown.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.720
And the Washington Post
had to do —

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.500
and this particular writer —

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.890
had to do a — I thought
he was going to get fired.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.160
I mean, if that were
a conservative,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.390
he would’ve been fired
on the spot.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.380
He would’ve been humiliated
for what he did.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.680
Because it was fake news.
Nobody was in the arena.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.470
There were thousands outside

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.770
but they hadn’t opened
the gates yet.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:44.270
They did the same thing
at our big inauguration speech.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.650
You take a look
at those crowds.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:52.220
And I watched one of the evening
shows that are ridiculous,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.760
how horrible they are,
how mean — how horrible.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.720
And I watched it by mistake.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.990
(laughter)

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:03.540
And they showed — they showed

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.290
from the White House
all the way down.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.290
They showed from the Cap- —
they showed — there were people.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.640
Nobody has ever seen it.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.110
The Capitol down to the
Washington Monument — people.

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.280
But I saw pictures
that there were no people.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.540
(laughter)

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.030
Those pictures were taken
hours before.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.760
Right? And they always
mention crowd size.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.810
“He talks about crowd size.”

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.970
So I’m constantly bugging
Mercedes.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.490
Whenever we have a slow moment,
I say, “Mercedes” — and Sarah —

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.200
“show them the pictures.
Show them.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.110
And compare them with
what they put on television.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.690
Those pictures were
taken hours before.”

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.010
And remember this also —

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.710
not that Obama
would ever do this:

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.770
But we had fencing all the way
down to the Washington Monument.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.110
And it was raining
and it was wet,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.730
and the grass was wet.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.350
And women and men — and I
consider them totally equal,

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.640
so I’m not going
to say it’s harder.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.840
(laughter)

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.050
In fact, it’s probably,
with the men I know,

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.500
it’s actually easier for the
women to make the walk, right?

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.750
Audience:  No!

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.010
The President:  But they had
to walk all the way down.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.860
They had to walk
with high heels, in many cases.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.690
They had to walk all the way
down to the Washington Monument

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.390
and then back.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.750
And I looked,
and I made a speech,

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.110
and I said, before I got on —

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.830
I said to the people
that were sitting next to me,

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.120
“I’ve never seen anything
like this. Look at that crowd.”

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.620
And it was wide.
Wide.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.050
We had a crowd — I’ve never
seen anything like it.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:42.150
And I have to live — I have
to live with “crowd size.”

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.040
It’s all a phony deal.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.380
But I saw a picture
just the other night

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.360
of practically no people.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.830
It was taken hours
before our great day.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.130
That was a great day for us.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.400
That was a great, great day.
People came from all over.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.710
(applause)

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.410
People came from all over.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.910
So, Sarah said,
and Mercedes said,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.790
“Sir, it doesn’t matter.
Nobody cares.”

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.780
I said, “But I care.”

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.320
(laughter)

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.970
And people care. People care.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:19.820
So what I’m going to do is
I’ll give it to the great one.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.600
I’ll give it to Mark Levin.
And I’ll give him the picture.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.030
Then I’ll show you
where they showed,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.980
just the other day,
an empty field —

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.340
like nobody on it.
And you’ll see the sun.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.890
You know, you can see
it’s very dark,

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.900
because the sun is like
starting to rise, right?

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.120
(laughter)

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.360
And you can have some fun.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.990
You’re going to get
big ratings on your show,

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:39.240
I’ll tell you that.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.370
Sunday night, everybody.
Sunday night.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.660
(applause)

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.690
Huh? Ten o’clock, right?
Sunday night at 10 o’clock.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:48.930
Audience Member:   (Inaudible.)

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:50.360
The President:  (Laughs.)
Thank you.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.210
I knew that, actually.
But thank you.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.350
All right, now let’s get back
to what I’m here for.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.720
(laughter)

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.170
And don’t fall asleep.
Don’t fall asleep, right?

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.640
Don’t fall asleep.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.700
You know, somebody said,
“Oh, the speech you made, sir,

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.600
the State of the Union speech
was incredible.”

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.930
(applause)

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:16.280
They said it was incredible.
They said that was so great.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:25.710
And I said — I said — I did;
I got great reviews,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.730
even from some of the really
bad ones out there.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.120
(laughter)

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.590
Of course, by the following
morning,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.880
they had to change because
the head people called up,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.130
“What are you doing?”

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.350
(laughter)

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.360
A lot of it is not the people
on television, you know.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.280
A lot of it is their bosses —

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.440
which someday we’re going to
have to figure out why,

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.740
Meadows, why that is.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.810
Because, you know, if you’re
building a great country,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.130
you have the best employment
and unemployment numbers

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.390
we’ve ever had.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.970
More people are working today
in the United States

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.470
than ever before
in the history of our country.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.610
(applause)

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.360
And you say,
why are they upset by that?

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.580
Why?
Why are they upset by that?

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.390
We’ve slashed 30,000 pages
of job-killing regulations

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.070
from the Federal Register.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.980
That’s an all-time record in the
history of the United States,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.770
even by Presidents
there for eight years,

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.470
and in one case more.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:26.860
We passed the largest
package of tax cuts

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.050
and reforms
in American history.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.210
(applause)

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.790
And we got rid of the individual
mandate,

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.500
which was a big deal.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.560
(applause)

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.310
Which should lead to the ending
of the disaster

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.970
known as Obamacare.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.230
(applause)

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.380
It should.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.430
The great state of Texas
has a case,

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.710
and it was literally based
on the individual mandate.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.750
Now that it’s gone, I don’t know
how they rule against it.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.450
Now we’ll have to find out.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.320
But that’ll soon be up
in the Supreme Court

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.190
of the United States, I hope.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.650
And we’re going to see
what happens.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.550
And then we’re going to get
together with the Democrats

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.790
and come up with really
great healthcare, okay?

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.390
Really great healthcare.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.060
(applause)

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.700
And of the other things we did
in our tax package is ANWR.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.690
Perhaps the largest field
in the world — oil and gas.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.000
(applause)

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.700
I got it approved.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.350
And I didn’t want to get it
approved for a certain reason,

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.800
because I thought somebody
treated me very badly.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.160
Very badly.
Don’t get that vote very often.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.410
And I said, you know,
I don’t want to get it.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.410
Then I get a call
from a friend of mine,

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.710
and he’s in the oil business.
He’s not asking for anything.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.820
He said — but he really
is a knowledgeable guy

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.510
when it comes to oil and gas.
He said to me, “Hey” —

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.480
and they all call me
“Mr. President.”

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.060
I have friends that,
for 35 years,

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.050
“Hey, Don, how you doing?
Hey, Donny. I love you, Donny.”

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.550
For 35 years. Now they call,
“Mr. President, sir.”

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.770
(laughter)

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.040
“How are you?”

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.340
I have a friend —
a very rich guy —

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.430
Richard LeFrak, in New York.
A builder. A good builder.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.270
He calls me all my life,
“Hey, Don, how you doing?”

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.500
I’ve known this guy so long —
from kindergarten.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.830
(laughter)

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.280
It’s true.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.740
“Hi, Don, how you doing?
How’s everything?”

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.650
And now I get a call
the other day,

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.690
“Mr. President,
how are you, sir? How are you?”

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.620
I said, “Richard, lighten up.
Lighten up.”

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.110
(laughter)
“Call me ‘Donald’.”

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.380
(applause)

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.930
“Richard, call me ‘Donald’.”

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.450
You’ve known me for —
I don’t want to say,

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.530
because I don’t want my wife
to hear the number.”

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.550
(laughter)
But — it’s true.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.900
Actually, that’s true.
That’s actually true.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.950
Richard came up; he said,

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.930
“I’ve known your husband
for 65 years.”

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.300
I said, “Don’t say that.”

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.870
(laughter)

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:59.010
I say, “Say 25, 30.
Don’t say 65 years.”

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.870
But I said, “Richard — Richard,
call me ‘Donald’,

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.820
like you always do.
Call me ‘Don’.”

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.330
“Okay.” “Okay, Don. Okay.”
He gets his breath. “Uh-huh.”

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.960
Two minutes later —
“Mr. President…”

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.400
(laughter)

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.990
That’s called respect
for the office, right?

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.260
Maybe that’s a good thing,
right?

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.460
(applause)

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.160
Many — many of my friends.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.180
And that wasn’t in the script
either, Mark.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.600
(laughter)

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.640
But we’re renegotiating,
right now,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:47.110
horrible trade deals
that we’re cracking down —

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.540
and we are really
doing a number —

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.530
cracking down
on countries that cheat,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.810
and standing up
for the American worker

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.760
for the first time
in many, many decades.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.220
(applause)

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.920
Many decades.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.800
Our workers have been
treated horribly.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.590
A country announces
they’re closing their plant

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.260
in Michigan
or Pennsylvania or Ohio —

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.470
they’re closing.
They’re closing a plant;

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.910
they’re going to move to Mexico.
They’re going to move to China.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.240
They’re going to move
someplace else.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.680
They fire all their workers.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.230
And then they sell
their cars, no tax;

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.600
just make them in Mexico,
sell them back to here.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.230
No tax, no nothing.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.080
Those days are all gone, folks.
They’re all gone.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.430
(applause)

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.130
They’re all gone.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:40.040
And in the new deal with Mexico
and Canada, called the USMCA,

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.720
it’s very, very hard —
prohibitively hard —

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:49.040
for a company to fire
its 4,000 workers

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.420
and move to Mexico
or some other location.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.940
It’s now a very costly —
they can do it,

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.330
I guess, if they want.
But it’s costly. It’s painful.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.890
It used to be almost — I said
— I used to —

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.100
I’ve been talking
about this for a long time.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.410
I used to say it’s almost like
we’re giving them

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.110
an incentive
to leave our country.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.110
Again, I’m for America first.
That wasn’t for America first.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.870
(applause)

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:22.690
And we have great companies
that are now

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:27.590
moving back to our country.
They’re coming back in.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.070
(applause)

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.020
They’re coming back in.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.280
And, by the way, you know
I’m building the wall.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.070
We’re finishing the wall.
We got a lot of money.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.270
(applause)

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.640
It’s in the thing.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:48.010
Audience:  Build that wall!
Build that wall!

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:57.300
Build that wall!

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.700
The President:  But — and there
will be some people in the room

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.400
that don’t like this.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.460
We’re down to
3.7 percent unemployment —

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.890
the lowest number
in a long time.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.080
But think of this: I got
all these companies moving in.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.580
They need workers.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.330
We have to bring people
into our country to work

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.100
these great plants that are
opening up all over the place.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:24.300
This was not necessarily what I
was saying during the campaign

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.700
because I never knew we would be
as successful as we’ve been.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.380
Companies are roaring
back into our country,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.870
and now we want people
to come in.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.700
We need workers to come in,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.310
but they’ve got to
come in legally,

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.510
and they’ve got to come in
through merit, merit, merit.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:46.330
(applause)

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.610
Audience:  USA! USA!

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.410
USA!

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.000
The President:  They’ve got to
come in through merit.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.690
They have to be people
that can help us.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:10.910
They have to be people that can

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.180
love our country,
not hate our country.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.600
We have people in Congress —
right now,

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.360
we have people in Congress
that hate our country.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.910
Audience:  Booo —

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.350
The President:  And you know
that.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.699
And we can name
every one of them if they want.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.070
They hate our country.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.780
It’s sad. It’s very sad.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.550
When I see some of
the things being made,

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.050
the statements being made,
it’s very, very sad.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:45.110
Very, very — and find out,
how did they do

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.600
in their country?
Just ask them, how did they do?

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.540
Did they do well?
Were they succeeding?

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.770
Just ask that question.
Somebody would say,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.590
“Oh, that’s terrible
that he brings that up.”

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.020
But that’s okay, I don’t mind.
I’ll bring it up.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.220
(laughter)

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.730
How did they do
in their country?

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.370
Not so good. Not so good.

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.440
But we need workers.
We have to bring in workers.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.750
One other thing — because
we have a lot of people here

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.700
that are important people
in terms of votes.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.620
We have some senators.
We have some congressmen.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.070
When a senator tells us
that he’s a free trader,

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:25.120
so am I. I’m a fair trader.
I’m a free trader.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.540
But when a senator said
we can’t do tariffs,

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.850
where we make a fortune,
or at a minimum,

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.650
we’re able to use this
tremendous power that I found —

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.500
tremendous — old stuff.
Nobody even knew it existed.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.600
I’m able to use it,
at a minimum,

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.110
to negotiate great
and fair trade deals.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.240
They wouldn’t even be talking
to us because it’s so one-sided.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.030
Last year,
we lost eight hundred —

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:55.540
this for many years —
almost $800 billion on trade.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.870
It’s not sustainable.
You can’t do that.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.610
And now we’re making
great trade deals.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.180
But when some of the senators —
good people;

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.560
I think they’re good people.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.410
I just don’t understand
the thinking.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.920
So I say, India is
a very high-tariff nation.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.360
They charge us a lot.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.740
When we send
a motorcycle to India,

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.190
it’s 100 percent tariff.
They charge 100 percent.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.260
When India sends
a motorcycle to us,

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.940
we brilliantly
charge them nothing.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.950
So I want a reciprocal tax,

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.350
or at least
I want to charge a tax.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.610
(applause)

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:36.150
It’s called a mirror tax,
but it’s a reciprocal tax.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.500
Now, here’s what I don’t 
understand: I’ve had

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.070
a lot of people —
Lindsey Graham.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.990
I said, Lindsey —
it’s not his thing necessarily.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:45.490
It’s not the thing
that he’s most adept at.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.390
But he’s adept and he’s smart.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.390
I said, “Lindsey,
if they charge us a hundred,

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.740
I’d like a reci-…”

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.080
If they charge us,
we charge them.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.000
He goes,
“That makes sense to me.”

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.270
(laughter)

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.730
And then he gets on
to judiciary and things

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.290
that, frankly, he likes
and finds very interesting.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.610
But he’s a smart guy,
and he said — I’ll never forget.

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:08.080
It took me about a minute,
which is a long time.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.020
I did a bad description.
It’s so easy.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.830
They charge 100;
we charge nothing.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.640
Now we have reciprocal,
so it’s 100.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.810
But what happens now, for those
that really think about tariffs

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:21.100
and don’t like tariffs
for whatever reason might be —

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.650
and that’s okay.
What’s going to happen is,

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.180
in many cases,
instead of 100 and 100,

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.470
you’re going to have
zero and zero,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:27.740
so you won’t have any tariff.
Okay?

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.940
(applause)

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.190
It’s going to happen.
That’s going to happen.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.710
But you have to — you have
to start working on

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:38.840
some of the senators that say
“I can’t approve this deal.”

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.260
I say, “You know what?
I want to just charge India” —

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.540
as an example, I’m using it.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:45.290
But India is a very
high-tariff nation.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.110
I mean, nobody —
nobody knows it

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.990
because nobody knows what
they’re doing in Washington.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.360
(laughter)

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.830
But India is a very,
very high-tariff nation,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.300
and they charge tremendous —
tremendous numbers.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.020
So they charge 100.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.410
So I say,
“I’m not going to charge 100,

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.660
but I’m going to charge
25 percent.”

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.040
And I hear this turmoil
in the Senate

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.570
because we’re charging 25.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.570
So I call a couple
of the guys up.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.310
I say, “Fellas, listen,
they’re charging us 100

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.370
for the exact same product.
I want to charge them 25.”

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:20.490
And I feel so foolish charging
25 because it should be 100.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.070
“But I’m doing 25 only
because of you.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.720
I want to get your support.”
“Sir, that’s not free trade.”

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.120
Where do these people come from?

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.370
(laughter)

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:33.480
Where do they come from? Where?
Where do they come from?

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.180
I need your help.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:37.980
I need your help —
the voters’ help.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.120
Where do they come from?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.310
So it can only be one of two
or three things.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.960
Number one, I know
they’re very smart people.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.170
I know they are.
And I even like some of them.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.520
(laughter)

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.810
But they’re smart.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.609
So we take that
out of the equation.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.290
So even — and I know
they don’t have evil intentions.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.020
And the other thing could be,
I guess, maybe — you know,

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.220
these companies
are all owned by people,

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.970
and these people
are very generous.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.800
Campaign contributions —

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.680
they’re very,
very generous people.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.550
Can that be possible?
I don’t think so. I hope not.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.180
Because we’re talking
about our country.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.170
We can’t allow a country
to charge 100 percent

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.630
and we get nothing
for the same exact product.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.490
For one thing,
they don’t respect us.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:35.640
They think we’re “stupido.”
They don’t respect us.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.010
(laughter)

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:40.310
But let me tell you something: 
The world

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.560
respects our country again.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.760
(applause)

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.860
They respect us.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:54.320
(applause)

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.950
And America is now booming
like never before.

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.849
Other countries
are doing very poorly.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.000
Other countries
are doing very poorly,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.830
and that makes it even harder
for us to be successful.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.660
Plus, we have a gentleman

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.910
that likes raising
interest rates in the Fed.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:18.880
We have a gentleman
that loves quantitative

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.580
tightening in the Fed.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.430
We have a gentleman that likes
a very strong dollar in the Fed.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.460
So with all of those things —
and we want a strong dollar,

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.710
but let’s be reasonable.
You understand that.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.670
With all of that,
we’re doing great.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.910
Can you imagine if we left
interest rates where they were?

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.380
There’s no inflation,
essentially.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.580
There’s no inflation.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.780
(applause)

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.410
Can you imagine if we left
interest rates where they were?

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.090
If we didn’t do quantitative
tightening,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.780
taking money out of the market?
If we didn’t do quantitative —

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.700
and this would lead
to a little bit lower dollar.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.280
A little bit.
I want a strong dollar,

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:06.480
but I want a dollar that’s going
to be great for our country,

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.450
not a dollar that’s so strong
that it is prohibitive for us

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.210
to be dealing with other nations
and taking their business.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:21.830
(applause)

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:26.700
Since the election,
we’ve created a number that

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.820
if I would have said
during the campaign,

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.960
the fake news just back there
would have said this is crazy.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.560
5.3 million new jobs,
including over,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:43.700
now, 600,000 beautiful,
brand-new manufacturing jobs

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.200
that were never going to
come back to our country.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:54.460
(applause)

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.350
These are jobs that were
never coming back

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.440
to our country. Remember?

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.060
Not to talk badly about
the other administration,

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.240
but if that theory went forward
with Crooked Hillary

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.810
winning the election,

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:12.480
instead of being up almost 50
percent with the stock market,

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.530
you would have been down
50 percent.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:18.580
It was heading down.
It was going to be a disaster.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.030
We have nearly 5 million
Americans

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.880
that have been lifted
off of food stamps.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.779
Nobody ever thought
that was possible.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:32.970
(applause)

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:37.120
The unemployment rate
has reached the lowest

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.700
in over 51 years.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.700
And African American —
and you’ve heard me say

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.260
this many times —
Hispanic American,

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.400
Asian American
unemployment rates

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.160
are at their
all-time historic lows.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:09.940
(applause)

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:14.580
And African American income
has reached an all-time high.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:19.100
So when I’m on the debate stage
with one of these maniacs —

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:23.940
(laughter)
— I mean, trains to Hawaii.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.340
“How do you get to Europe?”

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.620
“We haven’t figured
that one out yet.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.430
We don’t use airplanes anymore.”

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.660
(laughter)

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.810
You saw what I’m doing
in California, right?

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.650
They have a fast train.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:40.700
The fast train goes from
San Francisco to Los Angeles.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:46.200
It’s over budget by hundreds
of billions of dollars,

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.280
so they have a great idea —
the new governor; nice guy.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.520
Yeah, he’s a nice guy.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.840
When I’m with him
face to face, nice.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.160
When he speaks about me,
not so nice.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.360
But face to face,
he loves me.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.560
(laughter)

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.670
He called me up. He said,
“You’re a great President.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:58.950
You’re doing a great job.”

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.350
He actually did,
two weeks ago, three weeks.

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:01.700
So he’ll probably deny it,

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.730
but check the phone records
at the White House.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:05.030
Everybody else does.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.230
(laughter)

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:07.770
Check them. Check them.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:11.670
(applause)

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.370
Check them.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.230
Called me up three
or four weeks ago.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.940
I think they need
some forest money,

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.260
because honestly, the management
of the forests is very bad

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.830
and that’s one
of the problems they have.

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.210
I said,
“You got to get those forests.”

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.330
We can’t keep spending
billions and billions

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:32.170
and losing hundreds of lives,
more importantly.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.320
Got to clean it up.
It’s called management.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:38.740
When a tree falls, you can’t let
the environmentalist say

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.070
you can’t take that tree out.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:42.560
It becomes like a matchstick,
that tree.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.670
It hits a flame, it goes up.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.060
The leaves — every once
in a while, you have to remove

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.750
the leaves because they are so —
a guy smoking a cigarette,

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.720
he throws it away,
he doesn’t mean it.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.490
The thing catches on fire
and we lose 400,000 acres

00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:59.860
and people are killed.
You got to have management.

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:03.240
But he called me up
the other day, recently —

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.870
let’s say four weeks ago or so.
He said,

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.080
“I just want to tell you
you’re a great President

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.090
and you’re one of the
smartest people I’ve ever met.”

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.920
That’s what he said.
Now, that’s what he said.

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.250
Will he admit it?
No, I doubt it.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.620
(laughter)

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:18.410
But that’s what he said.
“And you’re doing a great job.”

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.760
And then he did start
talking about,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.570
in all fairness,
additional money for the fire,

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:23.770
which is —
(laughter)

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:27.400
— it’s okay. That’s okay.
We have great talks.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.040
I mean, I like him.
Gavin Newsom. I like him.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.900
Nice guy. But they say things —
you know, politicians,

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.340
they say things to your face,
and then you see two days later

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.940
they’re giving a news
conference — just like,

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.590
where did that guy come from?
Where did he come from?

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:49.340
But everyone in this great
country, right now,

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.060
because of our great
new economy, is doing well —

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.560
except, of course,
for the Never Trumpers.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.250
But they are on
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:06.840
(Laughter and applause.)

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:13.950
Mouth to mouth.
Mouth to mouth.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.650
They’re hanging in.
A couple of them.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.510
I mean, these guys
have gotten me wrong.

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.820
Not only Never Trumpers.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.620
You have Never Trumpers;
you have certain hardline.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.880
They’re basically dishonest
people —

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.270
because, look, let’s face it:
Whether you like me or not —

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.000
if my name is Smith
instead of Trump,

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.550
and if you told him I put in
over 100 federal judges —

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.430
it’ll soon be 145 federal judges
and 2 Supreme Court judges.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:38.630
(applause)

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.480
And 17 appellate
division judges.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.630
That we’ve got the best economy
maybe in our history.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.360
That we’ve got
the best employment numbers

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.540
and unemployment numbers
in our history.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.600
That we’ve cut more regulations
in two years

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.980
than any
President has ever done,

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.110
whether it’s for eight
or beyond.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.420
(applause)

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.340
That we’ve taken care
of our military with —

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:06.670
(applause)
— $1.7 billion.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:13.460
Think of that.
Think of what we did.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.430
Think of what we did
with our military.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:21.630
Think of the numbers
that we have for our military.

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:22.950
We have numbers —

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.249
nobody has ever heard
of these numbers before.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:29.380
And you know, part of
the problem that we have —

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.420
because I’m a cost cutter.

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.100
But — and you are
all cost cutters.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.000
But we have to take care
of our military. We have to.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.300
(applause)

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.040
Seven hundred billions dollars
we spent.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.950
And that was the first year.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:48.330
And then the second year,
$716 billion.

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:54.350
Now, I have no choice.
I’d like to spend much less.

00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.420
Obama was spending much less but
our military was being depleted.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.890
He was fighting in endless wars;
they’d never end.

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:04.300
And, by the way, as of probably
today or tomorrow,

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.790
we will actually
have 100 percent

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.720
of the caliphate in Syria.
One hundred percent.

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:12.980
(applause)

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.680
One hundred percent.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:21.390
And we’ll leave
a small group of guys and gals.

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:24.630
But we want to bring
our people back home.

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:26.540
We want to bring
our people back home.

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.810
It’s time.
Been in these wars.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.530
We were going to be in Syria
for four months.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.230
We ended up five years.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.980
This fighting —
they just like to fight.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.830
We want to fix our country.
We want to fix our bridges,

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:41.810
our highways,
our roads, our schools.

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.430
We want to fix our country up.
It’s time.

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:45.830
(applause)

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.120
It’s time.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:51.280
But I was told by a general,
who I had to fire — I said,

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.440
“General, how long before we get
100 percent of the caliphate?”

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.630
He said, “Sir, two years.”

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.959
I said, “I can’t
take it two years.”

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.940
And then I flew to Iraq;

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.080
first time I left
the White House —

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.660
because I stayed in the White
House for months and months

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.980
because I wanted the Democrats
to get back from their vacations

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.020
from Hawaii
and these other places.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.420
(laughter)

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.760
And I figured it would look good
if I stayed in the White House

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.190
so that you people all love me
and vote for me, okay?

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:24.610
I figured it would look good.

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:27.310
(Laughter and applause.)
I figured it would look good.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.570
So I stayed in the White House.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.190
And I’ll tell you what:
I was there — I told my wife,

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.930
“Go to Florida.
Enjoy your Christmas.”

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:37.610
I stayed for Thanksgiving.

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:40.620
I said — I mean, I was in
the White House for a long time.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.320
Months. Months.

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.640
I had cabin fever
in the White House.

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.010
(laughter)

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:48.960
But if you’ve got to
have cabin fever,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.200
that’s the place
to do it, okay?

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.450
(laughter)

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:52.680
But I was there, I don’t know,

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.900
for a number of months,
through Christmas.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.980
I spent my New Year’s
all by myself.

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.390
(laughter)

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:01.680
Audience:  Aww —

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.380
The President:  Don’t cry. All —

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.650
it was me and about 500 men and
women outside with machine guns.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.370
(laughter)

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:16.400
I never saw so many
beautiful-looking machine guns.

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:19.989
I’d look at that equipment
and I’d say, “Man…”

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:24.030
They sit in the trees.
They sit on the lawn.

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:26.920
I told people,
“I’m in this mess” —

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.550
you know, people don’t know
how big the White House.

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:29.790
First of all,

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:31.470
it’s one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:32.950
It’s really — I made
a lot of money with luxury.

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:34.150
(applause)

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:37.940
This building is — 1799 —
which, of course,

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.730
when President Xi comes,
I say “1799,” like it’s old.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:44.130
To him, that’s like
a brand-new house in China.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:45.360
(laughter)

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:48.810
In China, they go back —
they go back 8,000 years.

00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:52.490
So that’s — that’s like a new —
that’s like a new residence.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.350
But I sat in the White House
for months and months,

00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.250
except I took a day off.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.460
I flew to a lovely place
called Iraq,

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.410
and I flew at night
and I got there at night.

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:13.340
And I said to myself,
this is interesting,

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.680
because they say, “Sir,
all of the lights in the plane,

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.480
sir, are going off.”
I say, “Why?”

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.840
(laughter)

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.200
“Because we’re getting ready
to land.”

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.390
We’re an hour out.
I said, “What about the shades?”

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:26.730
“Well, we want it better
than that.

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:27.980
May be like
(inaudible).

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.340
So we turned the lights off,
put the shades down.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.439
This is a big seven forty —
Air Force One.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.690
And we’re landing,
and I go up and I look.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:37.620
And I’ve landed;
I like to sit with pilots.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.600
I respect people that know
what they’re doing,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.250
and these are the best
in the world. I really do.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:42.450
(applause)

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.150
These are the best in the world.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.550
And the pilot says, “Sir,
we’re landing in approximately

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:54.349
one and a half minutes.”
I say, “But there’s no runway.”

01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:58.530
“No, sir, the runway
is right up there, sir.”

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.860
I say, “I don’t see it.”
I have pretty good vision.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.190
(laughter)

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:04.160
At least for my age
I have good vision.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.460
(laughter)

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.300
I guess for my age
I have great vision.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.610
But I don’t have vision
like a 35-year-old captain.

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:13.060
He said, “No,
it’s right up there.”

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.050
I said, “I’m sorry, Captain,
how about this:

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.690
Should we lift off
and try it again?

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:19.390
Captain, there’s no runway.”

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.500
Anyway — he sits right up there
and we land.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.450
There’s practically not lights.
These are little pin spots.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.610
And I said, think of this:

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:34.910
We spent $7 trillion
in the Middle East

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.640
and we can’t land
with the lights on —

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:42.080
(laughter)
— 20 years later. How bad is it?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.440
No, seriously,
how bad is it?

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.680
(applause)

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.380
How bad is it?

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.690
Seven trillion dollars and we
have to fly in with no lights.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.050
But I met some
incredible people.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.830
I met some incredible
people — generals.

01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:00.420
One of them came from Syria —
the operation in Syria.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:02.990
And I was upset
with my generals

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.660
because they weren’t
getting it finished.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.380
I want the job done.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.550
I want to bring
our people back home.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:14.020
(applause)

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.310
It’s not fair.
And this is why I flew.

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.010
So I met generals I didn’t know.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.820
General one, general two,
general three.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.200
I mean, these generals —

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.040
there’s no person in Hollywood
that could play the role.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.790
These guys
are like perfect people.

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.700
I said, “What’s your name?

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.590
“Sir, my name is Raisin.”
What the hell kind of a name?

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:36.790
(laughter)

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:39.060
I said, “Raisin,
like the fruit?”

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.750
He goes, “Yes, sir, Raisin.”

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.450
“What’s your last name?”
“Caine. Raisin Caine.”

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:43.650
(laughter)

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.080
I said, “You got
to be kidding me.”

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.350
(applause)

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.340
It’s true. Raisin Caine.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.240
I just made him a big star.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.230
(laughter)

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.500
Just like I did with Mattis
when I said,

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.400
“We’re going to give you
a new nickname,

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.650
because ‘Chaos’ is not
a good nickname.”

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:03.950
So we changed his name.
Called him “Mad Dog.”

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.510
But it wasn’t working too well.
Mad Dog wasn’t working too well.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:10.600
So what happened
is I flew to Iraq.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.190
I wanted to meet the people
on the site,

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.020
because I learn more
sometimes from soldiers,

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.050
what’s going on,
than I do from generals.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:18.290
I do. I hate to say it.

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:19.740
And I tell that
to the generals all the time.

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.950
(applause)

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:23.840
But I didn’t have to go there.
I didn’t have to go there.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.770
Because I meet —
and I land in this airport,

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.150
the most incredible thing.

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.950
We must have spent
$3 billion building it.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.630
It’s one of the reasons I don’t
want to leave Iraq so fast.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:36.020
I said, “Well, how do we leave
this thing?”

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.610
So I have Raisin Caine
and three other generals,

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.430
colonels, sergeants.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.680
And I said, “Bring the cameras.
I’m going to make a movie.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.970
This is the most
incredible thing.”

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.210
(laughter)

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:51.340
And I said to the generals,
“Listen, we got to get out.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:55.200
I want to know why is it going
to take two years to knock off

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.600
2 or 3 or 4 percent,
which is what we had left.”

01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:01.920
“It won’t, sir.” And I said,
“Tell me why it won’t.”

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.060
“It won’t, sir.

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.060
If we attack them
in a different manner,

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.800
we can do it much faster.”

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.440
“Okay, General Raisin Caine,
how fast can” —

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.930
“Sir, we can have it
totally finished in one week.”

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:17.390
I said, “One week?
I was told two years.”

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:18.730
(laughter)

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.640
One week?

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.160
“That’s right, sir.
We’re only hitting them

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.100
from a temporary base in Syria.

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:29.840
But if you gave us permission,
we could hit them from the back,

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.650
from the side, from all over —

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.950
from the base that you’re
right on, right now, sir.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:36.040
They won’t know
what the hell hit them.”

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:42.320
(applause)

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.619
“They won’t know what the hell
hit them, sir.”

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.110
And I said, “Why didn’t
my other generals tell me that?

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.350
Why didn’t they tell me that?”

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.140
I said,
“Did you tell them that?”

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.130
“Not our place to say it, sir.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.260
They come in from Washington,
sir. We have to take orders.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.480
You’re the first one
to ask us our opinion.”

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.730
(applause)

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:11.030
It’s true. It’s true. True.
True.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:14.340
So I went back and I said,

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.210
“I’m going to get back
to you soon, Raisin.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.450
I think you’re great.”

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:18.690
(laughter)

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:23.390
“I like you, Raisin Caine.”
But I did say — I said,

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:25.090
“Well, hey, listen,
we’re in Iraq.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.710
Isn’t that very far away from…”

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.670
“I was here in a very short
time, sir. I flew right in.”

01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:31.880
Of course, he’s taking a plane

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.880
that goes 2,000 miles an hour,
you know.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.010
But incredible. What you learn
from being on the site —

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:44.440
my father was a builder.
He always used to say,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.360
“Nobody ever got rich
by sitting behind their desk.”

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.720
(applause)

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.420
It’s true. It’s true.

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:54.570
He’d say,
“You got to be on this site.

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:56.510
You got to be
with the contractors.

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:59.500
You got to see
if they’re ripping you off.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.470
You’ve got to collect every nail
that’s dropped,

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:03.980
every piece of wood.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.850
You can sell it.
You got to be on the site.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.640
You got to see
while they’re building,

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.260
while they’re
under construction,

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.710
is that wall straight
or if it’s crooked.

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.710
And you have to fix it
before they build it,

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:16.640
not after they build it,
when you rip everything down.”

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.870
(applause)

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:19.570
True.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.820
You don’t get rich
by sitting behind a desk.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.520
So I didn’t want to do that.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.580
And I’m in the White House
and I was lonely.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.310
I said,
“Let’s go to Iraq.”

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:32.140
(laughter)

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.270
And I had a hell
of a meeting in Iraq.

01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:35.590
And I’ll tell you,
those generals —

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.120
not just Raisin Caine,
General Caine.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.220
Those generals were great.
They were great.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.870
They knew their stuff.
They were gung-ho.

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.350
And it is true — I mean,
you talk central casting.

01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:48.910
These guys — you couldn’t —
I mean, it’s incredible.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.400
They had a master sergeant.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.790
I could take him right now,
bring him to Hollywood,

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.430
make a military movie,
and he’s the star of the movie.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.770
That happened once before,
you know.

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:00.350
That did happen once before.
Remember?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:03.480
They brought a man in —
a sergeant, a drill sergeant —

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.250
to teach some actor
how to be a drill sergeant.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.950
The drill sergeant
was so incredible

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.680
that he ended up
starring in the movie,

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.190
and he should have gotten
the Academy Award,

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:15.210
by the way, but he didn’t.
That’s because

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.850
Hollywood discriminates
against our people.

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.210
(applause)

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.600
You know the movie
I’m talking about, right?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600
What was that movie?
You know the movie.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.900
But while we’re making
great strides,

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.490
and our country
is doing as well —

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:34.960
and maybe, in many ways, better
than it’s ever done before —

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.270
Democrat lawmakers are now
embracing socialism.

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:41.380
They want to replace
individual rights

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.020
with total
government domination.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:47.220
Audience:  Booo —
The President:  Just this week,

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.420
more than 100 Democrats
in Congress

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.900
signed up for a socialist
takeover of American healthcare.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.940
Their radical
government-run plan —

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:04.860
if you call it that — would lead
to colossal tax increases —

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.310
increases like
you’ve never seen before

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:14.500
— and take away private coverage
from over 180 million Americans.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.680
Audience:  No!

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.300
The President:  And we have some
great private coverage,

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.550
and we’ve initiated
some incredible plans,

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:27.060
like the new cooperative plan,
where you get better insurance

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.590
than Obamacare
for a fraction of the cost.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.830
But perhaps nothing
is more extreme

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.080
than the Democrats’ plan

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.150
to completely
takeover American energy

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.980
and completely destroy
America’s economy

01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:47.540
through their new $100
trillion Green New Deal.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.100
Audience:  Booo —

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.800
The President:  Under
the Green New Deal —

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.350
which somebody described
as a high school term paper

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.340
written by a poor student —

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.890
(laughter and applause)
— it’s true. It’s true.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.230
Who would believe it?
It so — it’s so bad.

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:09.440
But I don’t —
I’ll be honest with you, folks.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.360
I said — you know, it’s
Saturday morning, and I said,

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.070
“Matt, should we do a little
more, like, spend time?”

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.410
He said, “Yeah,
would you do that?”

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:16.700
By the way, everybody okay?

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.910
(applause)

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:21.110
I haven’t seen anybody leaving.
I haven’t seen anybody.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.290
I know one thing: If Mark Levin
gets up and leaves,

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.850
I’ll finish very quickly,
because then I know.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.050
(laughter)

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:29.670
But I haven’t seen anyone
leaving.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.450
Nobody has left.
I watch those doors.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.640
Because a lot of times —
a lot of times —

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.880
well, one time,
the press said people left.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.140
Yeah, you know where they went?

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.390
To the bathroom.
And then they came back.

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:41.640
(laughter)
Two people.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.880
(applause)

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.670
They showed two empty seats
in a stadium of 19,000.

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:47.150
They showed two empty seats.

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.370
The people left right
in front of me, and I said,

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:52.970
“Oh, man, maybe this isn’t
a good job I’m doing.”

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.680
Then they came back.
They went to the bathroom.

01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:58.040
(laughter)

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.810
And a certain fake news deal
showed a picture

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:05.750
on the front page
of these two empty seats.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:09.080
They said Trump had empty seats.
We never have empty seats.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.170
The Green New Deal would
completely abolish

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.500
the American oil,

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.850
natural gas, coal,
and nuclear power industries,

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:19.680
of which we’re now
the leader in the world.

01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:21.600
We’re the biggest now
in the world

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.840
because of moves that I’ve made.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.040
(applause)

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.290
Happened over the last
two years, by the way.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.490
And we’re trying to speed up
pipelines in Texas,

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:32.170
which would have taken 15 years.

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:35.050
We think we’re almost very close
to getting them approved.

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.820
When that happens,
we’ll go probably another 30

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.800
to 40 percent.
We need pipeline approval.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.470
We’re going to have it
very quickly.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.760
It would have taken —
it was going to be a 14-

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.140
to 15-year process.
We should have it done.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.660
We’ll pick up 30
to 40 percent more.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.090
(applause)

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:55.260
Their plan would remove
every gas-powered car

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:59.020
from American roads.
Oh, that’s not so bad.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.720
They want you to have one car
instead of two,

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:07.430
and it should be electric, okay?

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.460
So tell people, no more cars.
No more cars.

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.950
I think the auto industry
is not going to do

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:13.160
too well under this plan.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.680
What do you think, Meadows?
How is this?

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.050
Will the auto industry be good?
I don’t think so.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:18.949
It’s not looking good.
I think maybe —

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.150
maybe you’re going to see some
bad stock prices if that passes.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:24.850
It would end air travel.

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:28.060
But you’ll get on a train,
don’t worry about it.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.860
You just have to cross off
about 95 percent of the world.

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:36.250
And it would force
the destruction or renovation

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.160
of virtually every existing
structure in the United States.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.860
New York City would have
to rip down buildings

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.390
and rebuild them again.
I don’t think so.

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:47.250
This is the craziest plan,
and yet I see senators

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.860
that are there
for 20 years — white hair.

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.780
See, I don’t have white hair.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.700
(Laughter and applause.)
I don’t have white hair.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:03.430
No, I see these white-haired,
longtime senators

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.280
standing behind
this young woman,

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:09.660
and she’s ranting
and raving like a lunatic.

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.370
(laughter)

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.660
And these senators — these 
senators: “Yes, I agree

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.950
with this.
Yes, I agree.”

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.860
The crazy female senator
from the state of Ohio,

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.870
the state of Hawaii.
Right?

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.890
She’s like —
she’s like a crazed person.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.590
What she said about men
is so bad.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.230
What she said about men
is so bad.

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:35.930
But she’s standing
in the hallway.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.900
And she didn’t know
too much about the plan

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.420
because she’s — you know,
she can’t understand that plan.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.640
(laughter)

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.689
Which probably makes her smart,
actually.

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.430
Now, this is the senator
from Hawaii,

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.980
and they’re saying to her,
“What do you think?

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.440
Well, I don’t know how people
are going to get to Hawaii,

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.800
but I’m in favor
of the plan.”

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.070
(Laughter and applause.)

01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:02.730
I don’t get it.
I don’t get it. I don’t get it.

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.430
So she’s in favor of the plan,

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.370
but you won’t be able
to get to —

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:10.410
well, we can take boats,
I guess. We’ll go back to boats.

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.030
This is the new Democrat
platform for the —

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.560
and I don’t want to
talk them out of it.

01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:19.060
I don’t. I don’t.
I swear I don’t.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.240
This is a killer.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.380
I got to get off this subject.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.290
I want them
to embrace this plan.

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.360
I want them to go
and sell this plan.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.070
I just want to be the Republican
that runs against them for that.

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:48.820
(applause)

01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:51.070
I’m going to regret this speech.

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:55.470
This speech should have been
delivered one year from now,

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:56.860
not now, damn it.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.090
(laughter)

01:13:58.090 --> 01:13:59.570
Because they’re going to
grab out together,

01:13:59.570 --> 01:14:00.790
and they’re going to say,

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.370
“You know, this guy
is really laying for us.”

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:07.770
I should’ve saved the Pocahontas
thing for another year.

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:09.210
(laughter)

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.390
Because I’ve destroyed
her political career,

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:12.980
and now I won’t get a chance
to run against her,

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.340
and I would’ve loved it.

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.600
(laughter)

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.300
We got to — you know,

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.060
I don’t want to knock out
all of the good stuff

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.290
and end up with somebody
that’s actually got talent.

01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:23.650
That would be terrible.

01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:27.150
(Laughter and applause.)

01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:30.890
So I do like the Green New Deal.

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:32.300
(laughter)

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:38.470
I respect it greatly.
It should be part

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.460
of the dialogue
of the next election.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:52.900
(Laughter and applause.)

01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:58.020
And I think it has
tremendous promise

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.520
and tremendous potential
for the future of our country.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:08.830
Socialism is not about
the environment.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.110
It’s not about justice.
It’s not about virtue.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:17.990
Socialism is about
only one thing.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.350
It’s called “power
for the ruling class.”

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.560
That’s what it is.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.760
(applause)

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.760
Look at what’s happening
in Venezuela

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.460
and so many other places.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.530
All of us are here today
because we know that the future

01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:35.870
does not belong to those
who believe in socialism.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.770
(applause)

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.520
And I heard, yesterday,

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:48.330
a great speech from our
Vice President Mike Pence,

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:49.750
talking about
this very subject —

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:50.950
(applause)

01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:52.700
— and talking about it
beautifully.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.800
(applause)

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.720
The future belongs to those
who believe in freedom.

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:07.020
I have said it before
and I’ll say it again:

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.780
America will never be
a socialist country — ever.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.190
(applause)

01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:22.780
Audience:  USA! USA!

01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:34.010
USA!

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:36.370
The President:  Young Americans
— I love young Americans.

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:39.800
Speaking of young Americans —
Candace, stand up.

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:42.790
(applause)

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.990
Candace is getting married.

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:46.480
(applause)

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.410
Stand up.
You’ve been incredible.

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:56.460
Thank you.
Your whole group has been great.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.020
You’re getting married.
Seems like a nice guy to me.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.910
(laughter)

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:03.520
Congratulations.
You’ve been so great.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.450
Thank you very much, Candace.
Thanks.

01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:09.490
(applause)

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:11.200
And, Charlie, what a job
you’re doing.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.240
Where’s Charlie?
Where’s Charlie?

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.940
Where is Charlie Kirk?

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:18.440
Because he has done
an incredible job.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.990
Thank you very much, Charlie.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:24.150
(applause)

01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:28.570
But young Americans like you
are leading the revival of

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:32.020
American liberty, sovereignty,
and self-determination

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.350
in the face
of left-wing intolerance.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.010
The anger — the unbelievable
anger — I see it every day.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.350
Fortunately, for you,
it’s mostly pointed at me.

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:46.090
(laughter)

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:50.300
You have the courage to speak
the truth, to do what is right,

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.000
and to fight for what you
believe, and keep doing it.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.310
(applause)

01:17:57.310 --> 01:18:02.950
We reject oppressive speech
codes, censorship,

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.650
political correctness,

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:08.770
and every other attempt
by the hard left

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:15.320
to stop people from challenging
ridiculous and dangerous ideas.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:17.800
These ideas are dangerous.

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.190
(applause)

01:18:20.190 --> 01:18:22.680
Instead, we believe
in free speech,

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.090
including online
and including on campus.

01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:31.610
And, by the way, there’s
a young gentleman with us today.

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:40.830
(applause)

01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:42.280
There’s a young gentleman.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.540
I turned on my television
the other day,

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.400
and I saw somebody that was
violently punched in the face.

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:56.430
Violently punched.
And I said that’s disgusting.

01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:59.600
By a bully I’d like
to do a lot of things.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.550
But, of course,
we would never do that.

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:04.560
Because if I ever said violence,
they would say,

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.010
“Donald Trump attacked.”
No, no, no. Just for the media:

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.500
I’m sure he’s
a lovely young man;

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.220
just had
a little temper tantrum.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.900
(laughter)

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.310
I’ve been there before
with those people.

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:20.010
I don’t want to do it again.

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:25.770
So, the man’s name
is Hayden Williams.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.820
(applause)

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.670
Where’s Hayden? Where is he?

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:36.300
Where is he?
Hayden, come up here.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.640
(applause)

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:56.260
Come up here.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.850
Williams:  Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:05.600
So, at the Leadership Institute,

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.620
we’re committed to making
campuses great again.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.520
And I thank you so much
for bringing me up here

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.610
to let me speak.

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:13.830
It’s great — it’s great that
I’m being recognized,

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:16.270
and — but there’s so many
conservative students

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:19.480
across the country who are
facing discrimination,

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.060
harassment, and worse, if they
dare to speak up on campus.

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.020
So I’m glad that we could —

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.270
we could, you know,
bring this to the forefront.

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:29.570
And I’d just like to say,
you know,

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:32.260
if these socialist progressives
had their way,

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.070
they would put our Constitution

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:36.150
through the paper shredder
in a heartbeat.

01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:38.440
So, you know,
it’s as important now

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.050
than ever the work at Leadership
Institute and Campus Reform

01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:45.890
— you know, exposing these
liberal abuses to the public —

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:50.580
(applause)
— it’s as important now as ever.

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:54.350
And these students —
these students do it

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:58.340
because they have a love
of our nation and freedom,

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.070
and frankly, a love for you,
Mr. President.

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:02.370
So if you keep defending us,
we’ll keep defending you.

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:03.570
(applause)

01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:04.790
The President:  Thank you.
Williams:  Thank you.

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:06.020
(applause)

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.720
The President:  Stay here
for a second.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.880
So, here’s the one thing.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.410
I was going to call him,
but I don’t have to now.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.280
I see him here.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.310
But here’s the one thing:
I learned a number of things.

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:21.790
First of all,
he can take a punch.

01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:24.020
If Muhammad Ali could take
a punch, he can take a punch.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.370
(laughter)

01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:27.590
Because you weren’t going to
go down no matter how —

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:30.470
that was a hell of a hard punch.
He was a strong guy.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.300
But you know what? You’ve got
yourself a great lawyer.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.540
I know your lawyer.
She is a great lawyer.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.270
Just tell her to do me a favor:
Sue him.

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.819
But he’s probably got nothing,
but sue him forever.

01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:47.200
But sue the college,
the university.

01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:50.040
(applause)

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.740
And maybe sue the state.

01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:56.730
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:02.390
he took a hard punch
in the face for all of us.

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:05.590
Remember that.
He took a punch for all of us.

01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:10.350
And we can never
allow that to happen.

01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:17.950
And here is, in closing with
Hayden — here’s the good news:

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:22.460
He is going to be
a very wealthy young man.

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:30.070
That’s okay.
(Laughter and applause.)

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.770
Go get ’em, Hayden.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.390
Today I’m proud to announce
that I will be very soon

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:44.150
signing an executive order
requiring colleges

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:46.340
and universities
to support free speech —

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.570
(applause)

01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:49.450
— if they want
federal research dollars.

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:51.150
Audience:  USA!

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.920
USA! USA!

01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:17.270
The President:  If they want
our dollars,

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:20.330
and we give it to them
by the billions,

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.430
they’ve got to allow
people like Hayden

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.360
and many other
great young people,

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.660
and old people, to speak.

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:30.930
(applause)

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:32.630
Free speech.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.319
And if they don’t,
it will be very costly.

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:43.890
That’ll be signed very soon.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.600
Every day,
we’re restoring common sense

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.790
and the timeless values
that unite us all.

01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:54.520
We believe in the Constitution
and the rule of law.

01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:57.290
We believe in the
First Amendment right.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.980
And we believe
in religious liberty.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:12.090
(applause)

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.580
And we believe strongly
in the Second Amendment

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.290
and the right
to keep and bear arms —

01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:31.110
(applause)

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:35.100
— which is under siege, folks.
They have a lot of plans.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.930
It’s under siege.
Be careful.

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:41.190
But I’ll protect you, I promise
you that. I’ll protect you.

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:42.500
(applause)

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.750
Because it all has to come
through my office.

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:49.470
And we hopefully are going
to be here for six more years,

01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:51.210
so you’re in good shape.

01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:57.110
(applause)

01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:58.920
We believe in
the American Dream,

01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:02.170
not in the socialist nightmare.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:08.570
And we believe in the words
of our national motto:

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.390
In God We Trust.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:21.720
(applause)

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.410
Every day, my presidency
will defend American families.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.600
We will defend
America’s workers —

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.850
our great,
great cherished workers —

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.900
that now we’re taking care of.

01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:40.230
They’re not losing their jobs.
We’re creating those jobs.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:43.060
We’re not letting
those companies

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.770
destroy their lives anymore.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.760
We will defend
the American way of life,

01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:53.770
and we will always
defend America’s borders.

01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:57.770
Because without borders,
as I’ve said many times before,

01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:59.470
we don’t have a country.

01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:07.520
(applause)

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.780
The lawless chaos
on our southern border

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.570
provides a lucrative cash
flow to some of the most

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.580
dangerous criminal organizations
on the planet.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.770
Deadly cartels constantly —

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.790
daily, hourly —
violate our borders

01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:30.770
to flood our cities with drugs
that kill thousands

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.500
and thousands
of our citizens violently.

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.430
What are these people
talking about

01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:39.210
when they talk
about the border?

01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:44.230
“Keep it open.” Keep what open?
Have you been there?

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:47.490
Have you seen? I just got back.
I’ve been there many times.

01:26:47.490 --> 01:26:49.870
I see what’s happening.
I don’t like it.

01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:53.160
But I have to tell you,
our Border Patrol,

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.380
our ICE agents,

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.230
our law enforcement,
the job they do —

01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.430
(applause)

01:26:57.430 --> 01:27:01.050
— and they don’t have the backup
of a wall, in many cases —

01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:03.700
the job they do is incredible.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:10.580
These ruthless cartels terrorize
innocent communities

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:14.790
on both sides of the border
and spread instability

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:18.050
throughout our hemisphere.
When I was there two weeks ago,

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:21.970
26 people were killed
very close to where I was,

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.420
on the Rio Grande.

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.170
Sounds nice, right?
The Rio Grande.

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.740
Rough. Rough stuff.
Twenty-six people were killed,

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:33.340
and they were buried right near
where I was standing.

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:35.660
And the paper
doesn’t write about it.

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.820
The news doesn’t
write about it.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.220
In the last two years alone,

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:44.660
ICE officers made
266,000 arrests.

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.610
Think of what that means.
Think of that — arrests.

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.610
I’m not talking
about people coming in.

01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:56.480
I’m talking they went out
and arrested 266,000 people

01:27:57.070 --> 01:28:01.030
who have criminal records and,
in some cases, for murder.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.190
Who the hell wants to do that?

01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:06.150
Thank God they’re doing it
because I don’t want to do it.

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:07.540
It’s dangerous.

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.740
(applause)

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.560
It’s hard.
But they love our country,

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.159
and they’re tough people,
but they love our country.

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.390
Including those charged
or convicted

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:20.620
of approximately
100,000 assaults,

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.330
30,000 sex crimes,
25,000 burglaries,

01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:31.180
4,000 kidnappings,
and 4,000 violent murders.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.700
These are people that
ICE is going in and getting,

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.190
and either putting in jail
or ideally

01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:38.920
bringing them back
to other countries

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.600
and letting them put in jail,
because we don’t want them.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.149
We don’t want to have to pay
for them for 50 years.

01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:47.400
You want them to pay a price,

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.230
but we don’t want to have to pay
for them for 50 years.

01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:52.560
And all the nonsense
you hear about

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.440
“the people that come
in illegally are far better

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.930
than the people we have” —
it’s not true, folks.

01:28:57.930 --> 01:29:01.420
Okay? It’s false.
It’s false propaganda.

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.770
(applause)

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.470
Right?

01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:09.770
One recent study from FAIR —
F-A-I-R —

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.020
found that illegal aliens
are incarcerated at three times

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.260
the rate of legal residents.
Those are the numbers.

01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:22.070
And if you look at prison
population in federal prisons,

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.710
these federal prisons are —
the number is staggering.

01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:29.570
The number of illegals —

01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:35.310
far, far, far greater than any
proportion of our population.

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:38.310
But you don’t hear that;
you hear like these people

01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.190
are the greatest people
in the world.

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:43.280
Just ask the Angel Moms
how good are there.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.990
Those great Angel Moms who were
treated so badly — so badly.

01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:50.340
(applause)

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.360
Incredible people.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.920
But the simple reality is that
every crime

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:57.860
committed by an illegal
immigrant is a crime

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.050
that should never have happened
in the first place.

01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:05.930
(applause)

01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:08.890
The border crisis is also
a heartbreaking

01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:10.590
humanitarian tragedy.

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:15.670
Vicious coyotes, smugglers,
and human traffickers prey

01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:18.660
upon innocent women
and children.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.520
One in three women
is sexually assaulted

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.400
on the dangerous journey north.

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:32.230
When I ran for president,
my first speech,

01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:33.930
I mentioned the word “rape.”

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.249
The press went after me;
I couldn’t believe it.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.570
I said, “Will it be like
this always?”

01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:44.660
The answer was yes.
It even got worse.

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.980
From day one,
I mention the word “rape.”

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.480
If you look at that speech,
that was so innocent

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.279
compared to
what’s really happening.

01:30:54.910 --> 01:31:00.380
That was a very innocent speech
compared to the real facts.

01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:04.880
Illegal immigration
is not compassionate.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.690
It’s inhumane,
unjust, and cruel.

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:19.450
(applause)

01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:21.549
The media fights me on this,
but I say it:

01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:25.180
Mothers who love
their daughters,

01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:27.970
when their daughters
are getting ready

01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:31.880
to make that 2,000-mile trek
up through Mexico —

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.500
and frankly, I wish Mexico
would stop them

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:37.390
at their northern border,
at our —

01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:39.540
(applause)
— I wish Mexico would stop them.

01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:43.910
Because you know,
they have a border.

01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:45.440
They call it
their southern border.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.150
It’s 2,000 miles down
from our southern border.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.400
I wish Mexico
would stop them.

01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.690
But they have
their own difficulties.

01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:54.660
Frankly, I understand that.

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.780
We’re working along well
with them.

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:00.150
And they are doing a lot
of things to help us with asylum

01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:03.830
and other elements
of what we’re doing.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.250
But mothers, who love
their daughters,

01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:13.340
give them massive amounts
of birth control pills

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:16.600
because they know their
daughters are going to be raped

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.520
on the way up
to our southern border.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.870
Think of that.

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:24.900
True story, told to me
by the Border Patrol.

01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:28.940
So true and so sad.
Think of how evil that is.

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.980
Think of how bad it is.

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:35.190
Those caravans —
you look at those caravans,

01:32:35.190 --> 01:32:36.890
and some are phenomenal people.

01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:41.060
But in those caravans
you have stone-cold killers.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.470
You had the interview done
by some innocent person

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:46.810
who I think is
actually back there now.

01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:49.390
“And what is it
that you want asylum for?

01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.090
Why are you coming to America?”

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:56.040
“Uh, murder.”
She goes, “What?” “Murder.”

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:02.170
I mean, what’s going on
is incredible.

01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:03.920
And when those caravans
are formed,

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.240
do you think those countries

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.000
that we used
to give a lot of money to —

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.160
I’ve cut it way back.
I’ve cut it way back.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.470
(applause)

01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:14.990
Guatemala, Honduras,
El Salvador.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:18.270
Do you think they’re giving us,

01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:20.640
as we say, their best
and their finest?

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.430
“Oh, let’s send our best people
up to America.

01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:26.420
Let’s have our best people
go in the caravan

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:29.680
so we can give America
our greatest people.”

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.910
No, no, no, no. They give us
some very bad people.

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:37.600
People with big,
long crime records.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.360
People with tremendous violence
in their past.

01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:48.010
Murderers, killers,
drug dealers, human traffickers.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.090
They want to keep their good
people because they’re smart.

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.350
It’s so sad to see
how stupid we’ve been.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.640
Border Patrol recently reported
apprehending

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:03.890
7,000 unlawful migrants
in a single week

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:07.990
on just one part
of the Texas border,

01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:09.810
a couple of weeks ago.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.090
Our immigration system
is stretched

01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:14.090
far beyond
the breaking point.

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:18.950
To confront this national
security crisis,

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:22.220
last month I declared
a national emergency.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.800
A national emergency.

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:38.500
(applause)

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:41.180
And when I see these people —

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.070
and they’re good people —
some senators, mostly —

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:45.119
I tell you, the House
has been fantastic.

01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:46.850
The House — you know,

01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:48.850
backing we’ve had
from the House has really been —

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:50.940
I’m talking about in the last
short period of time.

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.590
There’s a lot of spirit
in the House,

01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:54.560
and I think in the Senate too,
but we’re going to have to see

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.220
because we have
a vote coming up.

01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.390
And a lot of people
talk about precedent.

01:34:58.390 --> 01:35:00.740
Precedent.
That if we do this,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.850
the Democrats will use
national emergency powers

01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:05.720
for something
that we don’t want.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.390
They’re going to
do that anyway, folks.

01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:09.280
The best way to stop
that is to make sure

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.580
that I win the election.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.870
That’s the best way
to stop that.

01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:13.110
(applause)

01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:18.330
They’re going to do it anyway.
They’ll do it anyway.

01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:25.160
I watch — good people,
they’re friends of mine,

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.000
“We’re very concerned
with setting precedent.”

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.750
That’s “precedent”
not “president.”

01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:32.140
(laughter)

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:36.850
Precedent. “We’re very concerned
about setting precedent.”

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:43.230
I’m very concerned with having
murderers and drug traffickers,

01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:46.620
and drugs and drug cartels,
pouring into our country.

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.850
That’s what I’m concerned about.

01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:49.050
(applause)

01:35:49.050 --> 01:35:52.250
And the Democrats, they’re going
to do whatever they do

01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:53.540
if they get into power,

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.810
and it won’t have
a damn thing to do

01:35:55.810 --> 01:36:00.310
with whether or not we approve
our national emergency.

01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:02.410
Because let me tell you —
they don’t like it

01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:06.190
when I say it —
but we are being invaded.

01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:09.970
We’re being invaded by drugs,
by people, by criminals.

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:11.310
And we have to stop it.

01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:13.840
And we want people to come in,
as I said before,

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.860
but they have to come in
legally and with merit.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:26.620
(applause)

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:30.250
Previous presidents have used
their national emergency power

01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:34.640
to promote
democratic elections in Belarus,

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.790
to ensure political stability
in Burundi,

01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:42.880
and to defend
the sovereignty of Lebanon.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.110
And you know what? That’s okay.
In Lebanon — it’s good.

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:46.810
Fine. Use it.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.680
But we need it right here
in our country.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.380
We have to use it
for our country.

01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:54.980
Many emergency declarations
have been used

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.960
to protect people in faraway
nations and distant lands.

01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:06.120
Now we are protecting,
finally, our people.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.090
You. Our people.

01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:12.490
(applause)

01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:17.820
And we are proudly standing
with the heroes

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:21.590
of ICE and Border Patrol
and law enforcement.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:27.280
(applause)

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.200
Illegal immigration is also
deeply unfair

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.420
to American workers
and taxpayers,

01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:39.750
including millions and millions
of hardworking legal immigrants.

01:37:41.010 --> 01:37:43.200
If you care about
helping immigrants

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:47.710
and care
about their success,

01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:50.250
if you care about
reducing poverty

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:52.020
and raising living standards,

01:37:52.630 --> 01:37:56.150
then you must support
a safe, strong,

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.060
and very, very secure border.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:03.430
We need an immigration policy
that helps all Americans thrive,

01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:10.350
flourish, prosper.
We need an immigration policy

01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:12.690
that’s going to be great
for our corporations

01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:17.530
and our great companies.
We need an immigration policy

01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:20.490
where people coming
into our country

01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:25.300
can love our country
and love our fellow citizens.

01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:31.490
(applause)

01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:35.440
And this includes shutting down
sanctuary cities.

01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:46.290
(applause)

01:38:46.290 --> 01:38:50.010
And we want to end
catch-and-release.

01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:55.390
We catch them, we realize
they’re a criminal,

01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.450
and we have to release them.
Think of this:

01:38:59.450 --> 01:39:02.200
They come onto our land,
they put one foot on our land.

01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:05.560
We now have to take them
through a massive court trial.

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.820
Who does this?

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:10.340
Other countries say,
“Get the hell out of here.”

01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.630
We have to take them
through court.

01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:15.980
So we catch them.
We talk to them.

01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:22.370
If they’re criminals, or if
they’re not, we release them.

01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:25.880
We say, “Come back for a hearing
in front of a judge.”

01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:28.940
You know how many judges
you need to do this?

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.120
We have 900,000 people
backlogged.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.970
That’s the good news.
The bad news? Nobody shows up.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:38.840
Three percent of the people
come back for a trial.

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.390
It’s insane.

01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:44.510
Not my fault I inherited
this mess, but we’re fixing it.

01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:46.680
(applause)

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.650
We have to end chain migration,

01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:53.040
and we have to cancel
the visa lottery.

01:39:53.730 --> 01:39:57.680
Every American,
no matter where they’re born,

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.470
will benefit from the creation
of a lawful immigration system.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.470
It is such —
you talk about an emergency.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.960
Our immigration system
is so broken, folks.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.080
It’s so broken.
It’s so sad to see.

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.630
It’s incompetent. It’s laughed
at all over the world.

01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:16.540
We have people pouring in

01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:19.730
from not just
the southern border in Mexico.

01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:23.370
From China.
They have a baby on our land.

01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:24.690
The baby becomes a citizen.

01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:28.720
“Welcome to the United States”
for hopefully 90 years. Okay?

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.350
And then the parents
come in with the baby

01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:32.850
because the baby is a citizen.
This is like crazy.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:34.890
They used to call it
“anchor babies”

01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:36.200
but they don’t use
that term anymore

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.900
because it doesn’t sound nice.

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:41.840
Our laws are so crazy.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.780
But one by one,
we’re finding ways.

01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.080
You know,
they call them loopholes.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.930
A lot of our laws —
loopholes.

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:51.760
Well, I’m finding loopholes
to get around the loophole.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.070
Okay?
(Laughter and applause.)

01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:54.740
Because our Congress can’t act.

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.539
They can’t act.
They just can’t act.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.210
The Democrats in Congress
don’t want to touch any of it.

01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:04.580
Visa lottery — that’s where
they put in the names;

01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.360
they put it in a lottery,
and you pick,

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.030
“Oh, here’s a wonderful person.
Wonderful.”

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:11.880
You know,
he killed four people.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.860
“Here’s — here’s
another wonderful.”

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:15.920
(laughter)
And then they get in and we say,

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.980
“Gee, that person just
came into our country.

01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:22.550
He just robbed a store
and killed somebody.”

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:23.810
How is that possible?

01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:26.270
Because they send us
the people they don’t want.

01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:27.470
(applause)

01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:35.580
The biggest form of subsidy
we give to other nations.

01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:41.270
Immigration systems
that prioritize the admission

01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:44.600
of those who can support
themselves financially

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.930
and contribute.

01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:49.040
We want people
that can help themselves,

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.150
that can support themselves.
We have people coming in.

01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:54.070
We support them from the day
they come in

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:57.270
until the day they die.
We can’t do that as a country.

01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:59.730
We can’t afford to do that
as a country.

01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:01.960
(applause)

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.600
Sadly, on immigration
and so many other issues,

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:08.790
Democrat lawmakers have
totally abandoned

01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:11.140
the American mainstream.

01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:13.390
But that’s going to be good
for us in 2020.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.530
They’re embracing open borders,
socialism,

01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:19.980
and extreme
late-term abortion.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.900
Audience:  Booo —

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.350
The President:  Weeks ago,
lawmakers in New York cheered

01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:29.830
as they passed legislation
to allow babies

01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:31.929
to be ripped
from the womb of their mother

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.010
right up
to the very moment of death.

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:41.420
Then, in an act
and a statement,

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:46.150
the likes of which I don’t think
I’ve ever heard, in Virginia,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.010
the governor —
a Democrat —

01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:54.030
stated that he would
allow babies to be born,

01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:57.470
to be born outside.

01:42:57.470 --> 01:43:01.160
He would wrap them.
He would take care of them.

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.360
And then he’ll talk
to the mother and the father

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.200
as to what to be done.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.130
And if they didn’t
want the child,

01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:13.270
who is now outside of the womb —
long outside of the womb —

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:16.110
they will execute
the baby after birth.

01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:18.450
Audience:  Booo —

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.090
The President:  They will
execute the baby after birth.

01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:26.820
And that’s one many people
have never even heard of

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:28.610
or thought about.

01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:32.240
This is a radical agenda
by the Democrats.

01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:34.530
And when you put something up,

01:43:34.530 --> 01:43:37.620
as was just put up
before the Senate,

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.120
everybody on the Democrat
side votes for it.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.960
By the way,
I have to say one thing:

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.050
They’re lousy politicians
and they have lousy policy.

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:49.700
They have policy I could
never sell if I wanted to.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:56.170
But — but — big but —
they always stick together.

01:43:56.170 --> 01:43:58.690
And the Republicans
don’t remember that.

01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:02.080
(applause)

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.600
Remember that.
They always stick together.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.700
They vote in blocs.
They have 47.

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.240
We had a tremendous victory.
We were given no credit.

01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:16.690
I can’t go and campaign for all
of the people in the House.

01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:20.850
Too many. And guys like Meadows
wins by so many points

01:44:20.850 --> 01:44:23.190
he doesn’t need any help.
He doesn’t need it.

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.570
I say,
“Mark, do you need any help?”

01:44:24.570 --> 01:44:25.860
“No, I’m okay.”

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.080
(laughter)

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.560
He’ll win by 30, 35.
They’re okay.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.359
These guys —
you know a funny thing?

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.460
The ones that love Trump,

01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:35.310
the ones that are really
the Trumpers

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:40.230
— like Meadows, Jordan,
Gates, so many of them.

01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:43.050
I don’t want to —
I could just name so many.

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.980
They’re the ones
that win with that.

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:47.450
I mean, it’s like they don’t
even have an election.

01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:49.840
It’s the ones that sort of —
they’re a little shy

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.910
about embracing what we’re
all about, they get clobbered.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:57.220
They get clobbered.
Take a look.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.439
Those are the ones
that get clobbered.

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:04.210
But the good news is they’re all
starting to find that out.

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:09.530
Just this week, Senate Democrats
opposed legislation to prevent

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:14.300
the killing of newborn infant
children who survive abortions.

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:18.370
Virtually every Democrat
voted against protecting

01:45:18.370 --> 01:45:22.450
these precious babies.
Every one. They vote in groups.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.340
And we did have that
great victory. We won for 51.

01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:30.889
And two that we didn’t
like got out.

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.950
They said they retired.
They didn’t retire.

01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:35.400
They were retired.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.170
(applause)

01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:41.520
They said, “These two senators
have decided to retire.”

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.760
No, no, no.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.590
They retired because they had
like very little support.

01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:47.920
Like how about 5 percent?
Any percent.

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:54.130
No, we did great. We had 53
we picked up in the Senate.

01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:56.270
They were going to win
the Senate, remember?

01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:58.460
And I’ll tell you, folks,
I worked hard.

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.430
I did 32 big, fat rallies.

01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:03.630
(applause)

01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:08.000
And those rallies brought us
to a tremendous Senate victory

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.340
so that we can continue onward
with our judges

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.900
and our approvals.

01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:23.280
And the fake news back there,
they love to say

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:26.170
“Donald Trump suffered
a big defeat.”

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:29.020
First of all,
we won the Senate,

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.620
which, frankly, judges —
you know, I hate to say it:

01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:36.110
In all due respect for us,
the Senate, far more important.

01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:37.770
I really worked hard.

01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:39.860
But think of it.
We won the Senate

01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:43.740
and we had this,
like, tremendous victory.

01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:47.860
We get no credit at all.
Wait until you see what happens.

01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:51.550
They say, “Donald Trump
suffered a humiliating defeat.”

01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:52.800
I said,
“I wasn’t running.”

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.180
(laughter)

01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:57.170
And one of the commentators —
and I appreciate it —

01:46:57.170 --> 01:47:00.540
one of the shows where they were
saying how I suffered a defeat,

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.040
this commentator said,
“Excuse me, he didn’t run.”

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.620
You know, not all our candidates
were exactly great.

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:09.940
Let’s face it. You know,
you can only do so much.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.030
But wait until you see
what’s happening when I do run.

01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:17.490
And what they don’t say is —
governor of Ohio, great guy.

01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:20.400
Mike. Mike.
Mike was down six.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.390
He won by seven with one day.
Right?

01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:23.740
(applause)

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:27.580
He was down by six.
One day into the election,

01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:32.160
I went out, I campaigned,
worked hard, made a speech.

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:35.710
Jim Jordan was there.
Everybody was there.

01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:39.670
It was a fantastic crowd
like this. Like this.

01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:41.390
And all the people
in the other ballrooms

01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:43.330
that are waiting for us.

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:44.620
And he ended up winning.

01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:46.420
He was down by six;
he won by seven.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.390
One day.

01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:49.680
(applause)

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.029
Then we have Georgia —
the governor of Georgia.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:56.070
Great guy. Where’s Georgia?
Great guy.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.340
He was losing
in the primary by 10.

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.610
I got a call from David
Perdue and Sonny Perdue —

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:06.020
two great guys.
“Could you endorse him?”

01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.710
I said, “Let me check.”
And I checked him.

01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:11.340
He was a Trumper
before Trump was a Trumper.

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:13.020
(laughter)

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.700
And I said, “I love this guy.”
He’s down by 10. He won by 40.

01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.900
(applause)

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.600
Can you believe that?

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:23.150
I endorsed him, Mark.
He won by 40.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:27.390
Then he had a tough race
against the new star

01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:30.950
of the Democrat Party —
not Democratic.

01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:33.160
It’s Democrat.
We have to do that.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:36.290
You know, it sounds prettier
when we use “Democratic.”

01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:37.790
I even like —
I hate to say in the speech,

01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:40.440
the “Democrat Party”
because it doesn’t sound good.

01:48:41.290 --> 01:48:43.640
But that’s all the more reason
I use it, because it doesn’t.

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.030
(laughter)

01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:46.830
They should change it
because it sounds much better.

01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:49.030
Rhetorically, it’s much better.
Much better.

01:48:50.170 --> 01:48:56.760
But then, he had an election
against their star

01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.980
who followed me after
the State of the Union Address.

01:49:01.890 --> 01:49:05.630
I didn’t think she was great.
But she’s their star.

01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:06.850
And who showed up?

01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:12.090
Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama,
and President Obama.

01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:13.350
Audience:  Booo —

01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:15.170
The President:  And they
campaigned for her,

01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:20.440
and they worked so hard.
And all our man had was Trump.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.190
(laughter)

01:49:22.190 --> 01:49:24.330
And we kicked their ass.

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:30.940
(applause)

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.640
True.

01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:40.800
We had a rally at the airport,

01:49:42.190 --> 01:49:45.750
where 55,000 people
showed up to the airport.

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:47.040
It was one hangar.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.240
They had three other hangars
that were full.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.370
They went so far back.

01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:53.740
The problem was they gave
the press, like these guys —

01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:55.470
they gave the press
too good a location

01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:57.390
because the people behind them
couldn’t see properly.

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:58.820
I was so angry.

01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.170
But we had
55,000 people show up.

01:50:00.170 --> 01:50:01.660
I said, “You’re going
to win the election.”

01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.870
He won the election.

01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:05.310
He won it fairly easily,
against their star.

01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:09.490
And now David Perdue is going
to win for senator in 2020.

01:50:09.490 --> 01:50:10.690
(applause)

01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:16.610
And then — and then we had
Florida, and many others.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.530
(applause)

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.070
And we have a candidate,
Ron DeSantis —

01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:24.320
(applause)
— a friend.

01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:32.830
A friend of many of us
in this room.

01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:35.020
But nobody knew he was running.

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.520
He was running against,
in the primary,

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.419
somebody that was easily
going to win.

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:43.650
He was scheduled to be
the next governor of Florida.

01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:47.179
But Ron has been great to me
on the witch hunt.

01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:49.280
He’s been a defender of me

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.630
against these
phony charges of Russia.

01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:54.780
Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
My wife said,

01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:57.060
“You never spoke to anybody
from Russia, darling.”

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.290
I said, “That’s right.”

01:50:58.290 --> 01:50:59.520
(laughter)

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.720
But Ron DeSantis —
I like people that defend me.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.420
You know, when people defend me,
I defend them.

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.670
(applause)

01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:07.490
So he came.
That’s why I like Mark.

01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:10.100
That’s why I like Mark Levin.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.520
And I’m not sure
a lot of people like him.

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.650
He’s tough as hell.
But I like him. I love him.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.890
But then we have Florida.

01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:21.570
So, Ron DeSantis is at three.
Three.

01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:25.230
He calls up, “Sir,
can I have your endorsement?”

01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:27.130
I said, “Ron, you’re at three.

01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:31.910
Your opponent is, I guess,
agriculture commissioner

01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:34.600
— has 22 million in the bank.

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.790
His poll numbers are very good.
He’s up in the 20s or 30s.”

01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:42.440
I said, “Ron, don’t make me
do this, Ron.”

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.840
(laughter)

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.710
“Sir, I can win.”

01:51:45.710 --> 01:51:50.470
“All right, Ron. Here we go.”
Because I know if he loses —

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.750
which almost never happens
when I endorse somebody.

01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:54.250
Almost never.

01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.990
Only one time,
and that was because it was done

01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:58.470
in the middle
of the day of the election.

01:51:58.470 --> 01:52:00.070
Nobody knew I did it.
They got home, they said,

01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:01.820
“I didn’t know Trump
endorsed him.”

01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:04.650
But we rarely, rarely lose.

01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:08.270
But I said, “Ron, don’t do it.”
I said, “All right, I’ll do it.”

01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:13.140
He went from 3 to 60.
To 60.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:16.300
(applause)

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:21.000
And then he ran against a guy
who had unbelievable support.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.330
He had every celebrity
go into Florida.

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.920
He had money all over the place.
And Ron was in there pitching,

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.770
and I was in there
pitching with him.

01:52:30.690 --> 01:52:34.390
And we now have a great governor
in the state of Florida.

01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:38.240
(applause)

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.830
And I could mention
many others —

01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:41.380
other governors,
many other states.

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.279
But I’m not going
to bore you with it.

01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:47.420
And I think — I really think
that it’s incredible

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:50.510
what we did in the midterms.
I think it’s incredible.

01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:52.740
Governor of Florida.
Governor of Ohio.

01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.410
Remember, “You can’t win unless
you win the state of Ohio.”

01:52:55.410 --> 01:52:57.420
We got the governor of Ohio,
and he’s great.

01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:58.700
Mike.
We love you, Mike.

01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.970
(applause)

01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:04.520
As we defend American values
at home, we are also defending.

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:07.920
American security abroad.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:12.680
We have secured
all sorts of funding,

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.190
all sorts of record everything.

01:53:15.190 --> 01:53:17.840
And we will never forget
our military.

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:20.180
We will never forget
our veterans.

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.350
We are taking care
of our veterans

01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:24.090
like they’ve never been
taken care of before.

01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:25.290
(applause)

01:53:25.290 --> 01:53:29.790
We just got them Choice,
so now they can go see a doctor.

01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:33.750
(applause)

01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.910
Now they can go and see a doctor

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:40.110
instead of waiting on line
for weeks and weeks and weeks.

01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.970
And we got them Accountability.

01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:49.760
You couldn’t fire anybody
in the VA.

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.790
You had sadists.

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:57.770
You had people that took
advantage of our veterans.

01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:01.020
They’ve hit them.
They were sadists.

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:03.490
They were sick people.
You couldn’t fire them.

01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:06.220
You had thieves that were
stealing — openly stealing.

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.400
You couldn’t fire them.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.220
I got a bill passed: VA
Accountability.

01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.730
Now you look at the guy,
you say,

01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:15.330
“Get the hell out of here.
You’re fired. Get out.”

01:54:15.330 --> 01:54:16.650
(applause)

01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:17.850
Nobody
thought we could get it.

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:20.170
For 40 years
they tried to get it.

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:24.529
For 40 years they tried
to get it; they couldn’t get it.

01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:28.460
And VA Choice,
they thought — for many,

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.830
many decades they’d been trying
to get VA Choice.

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.650
You couldn’t get it.

01:54:32.650 --> 01:54:36.680
Now, instead of waiting on line
for two days,

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.060
nine days, three weeks —
people were dying.

01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:44.360
People that weren’t very sick
would be dead

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.950
by the time they saw a doctor,
six weeks later.

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:52.320
Now these great veterans,
if there’s a big wait,

01:54:53.010 --> 01:54:55.820
they go outside,
they go to a local doctor.

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.120
We pay the bills.
They get better.

01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.460
Everybody is happy.

01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.250
And we actually save a lot
of money, if you can believe it.

01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:03.520
(applause)

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.480
And I got that approved
after 44 years of being unable

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.150
to get it approved —
for our veterans.

01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:10.630
We love our veterans.

01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:15.610
(applause)

01:55:15.610 --> 01:55:17.530
And just in finishing up,
as you know,

01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:19.320
I just returned
from Vietnam,

01:55:20.230 --> 01:55:22.720
where I had
very productive meetings

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:28.220
with Chairman Kim Jong Un.
Very productive. We get along.

01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.740
(applause)

01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.660
We’ve developed a good
relationship —

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:35.210
very good — and made
great historic progress.

01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:37.060
And I do get a kick out
of all these people

01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.410
in previous administrations:

01:55:38.410 --> 01:55:41.900
“Donald Trump should not,
under any circumstances,

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.190
be doing this or that.”

01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:44.690
You know, they’re telling me
how to negotiate.

01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:46.460
These guys died.

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:49.180
One administration gave billions
of dollars to him

01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.190
and got nothing.

01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:54.730
And we haven’t given him
anything yet.

01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:57.650
I look forward to maybe
doing something at some point.

01:55:57.650 --> 01:56:00.580
But I know one thing: I’m going
to get other countries to give.

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.010
Maybe not us, but I’m going
to get other countries to give,

01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:05.770
and if it all works out.

01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:07.330
(applause)
If it all works out.

01:56:07.330 --> 01:56:09.260
But I had to walk.

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.660
Because every once in a while,
you have to walk,

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.740
because the deal wasn’t a deal
that was acceptable to me.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:21.470
I don’t like these deals
that politicians make.

01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:23.770
They make a deal
just for the sake of doing it.

01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:25.360
I don’t want to do that.
I want to make a deal

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.740
that either works,
or let’s not make it.

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.950
(applause)

01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:32.780
But the one thing we have,
though, is we have no testing,

01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:35.530
no missiles going up,
no rockets going up.

01:56:35.530 --> 01:56:39.420
No nuclear testing.
We got our great people back.

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.270
We get our great,
great people.

01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:47.780
And that includes our beautiful,
beautiful Otto — Otto Warmbier —

01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:50.570
whose parents I’ve gotten
to know, who’s incredible.

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:52.369
And I’m in such a horrible
position,

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:56.060
because in one way
I have to negotiate.

01:56:56.630 --> 01:57:01.110
In the other way,
I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier,

01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:03.130
and I love Otto.

01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:05.440
And it’s a very,
very delicate balance.

01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:08.250
He was a special young man.

01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:10.780
And to see what happened
was so bad.

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.480
It was so bad.

01:57:13.450 --> 01:57:18.580
And a lot of what I do
with respect to North Korea,

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:20.890
and any success
that we hopefully have —

01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:22.670
and we’ve had a lot.

01:57:22.670 --> 01:57:25.590
We’re given no credit.
They don’t remember that,

01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:27.960
in the last days
of the Obama administration,

01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:30.750
rockets were flying
all over the place,

01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:32.450
nuclear testing was going on.

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.130
Mountains were being —
these are big mountains.

01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:37.730
They were being shoved
over three, four inches.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.480
People thought it was
massive earthquakes,

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.470
then they found out,
no, that was nuclear weapons —

01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:45.440
nuclear testing.
So much.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:48.670
We’re getting the remains back
of a lot of our soldiers

01:57:48.670 --> 01:57:50.010
from many, many years ago.

01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:51.210
(applause)

01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:53.420
Mike Pence was in Hawaii.

01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.620
It was one of the most
beautiful ceremonies.

01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:58.120
We’ve made a lot of progress,

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.900
and we’ll continue
to make progress.

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:03.570
And I really think what we’re
doing there is very important.

01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:05.840
But we actually had to walk,

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.330
but I think we had
a very good meeting.

01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:10.430
In fact, when I came home,
they put out a statement that,

01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:12.560
actually,
they were willing

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.740
to do much less
on the sanction front.

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.690
But you see,
that’s not what happened there.

01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:22.330
So already, I think
we’re negotiating.

01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:26.230
And I’ll tell you this:
North Korea has an incredible,

01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:29.520
brilliant economic future,
if they make a deal.

01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.580
But they don’t have
any economic future

01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:34.090
if they have nuclear weapons.

01:58:34.090 --> 01:58:35.810
It’s really a bad thing
for them.

01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:38.990
So we’ll see how it all goes.
But I think it’s going well.

01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:42.100
I think we learned a lot
over the last couple of days.

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.320
And again, the relationship
seems to be very, very strong.

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:46.710
And that’s an important thing,

01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:51.510
especially when we’re dealing
with this kind of a situation.

01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:54.850
(applause)

01:58:54.850 --> 01:59:00.540
For years, you watched as your
leaders apologized for America.

01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:03.530
You saw that.
Would you like to apologize?

01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:05.530
No. I’m not apologizing.

01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:06.930
(applause)

01:59:06.930 --> 01:59:10.770
Now you have a President
who is standing up for America.

01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:14.750
After decades of building
up foreign nations,

01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:17.410
we are finally
building up our nation,

01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:20.460
and we are doing it
with American hands,

01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:21.800
American grit,

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:26.140
and with beautiful,
beautiful American steel.

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:33.940
(applause)

01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.640
We are fighting to ensure

01:59:36.930 --> 01:59:40.190
that every young American
inherits the same blessings

01:59:40.190 --> 01:59:42.200
and the same
boundless opportunity

01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:47.440
that our ancestors fought to
secure with all of their heart,

01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.760
might, and soul.

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:55.140
Now more than ever, we need
the proud men and women of CPAC.

01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:59.160
And I want to thank everybody
here, because it is incredible.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:03.680
Your organization is incredible.
Matt and Mercedes, incredible.

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.010
(applause)

02:00:05.010 --> 02:00:08.560
You’re energized, you’re
mobilized, and you’re engaged.

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:11.960
We need your voice.
We need your patriotism.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.300
We need your commitment.

02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:17.870
We need your incredible spirit
on the Fourth of July.

02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.670
We are having,
in Washington, D.C.,

02:00:21.670 --> 02:00:26.470
a great tribute to America.
I hope you can all come.

02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:29.310
Fourth of July —
keep it open.

02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:32.230
We want to bring millions
of people into the city,

02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:36.250
and we want people to come
who love our country.

02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:39.550
Those are the people we want.
The Fourth of July.

02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:41.800
(applause)

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.500
A salute to America.

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:49.450
Now is the time to embrace
the promise of our history.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.830
Now is the time to defend
our American legacy.

02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:58.440
And now is the time
to seize our glorious destiny.

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:03.300
And, by the way,
I’m watching those doors.

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:06.140
Not one person has left, and
I’ve been up here a long time.

02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:07.820
(laughter)

02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:09.180
I said, “Matt, is that okay?”

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:11.330
He said, “I love it.
Don’t leave.”

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:14.520
But not one person.
So if you hear tomorrow,

02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:17.710
when they read “people left” —
nobody left early.

02:01:17.710 --> 02:01:19.759
There hasn’t been
one person that’s left.

02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:23.090
But when you read it,
you just say “fake news.”

02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:24.610
(applause)

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:28.350
This magnificent nation
will always be the home

02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:32.330
of those who cherish life,
who love liberty,

02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:37.200
and who defend the sacred rights
given to us by Almighty God.

02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:41.230
(applause)

02:01:41.230 --> 02:01:44.690
Together, we are one people,
one family,

02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:51.280
and one nation, forever united
behind one great American flag.

02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:55.520
(applause)

02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.060
Thank you to everybody
in this room

02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.720
and to all of
the other rooms,

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.050
all over the campus
and all over the country.

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:06.110
We’re hooked in all
over the country.

02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:07.750
Thank you very much.

02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:10.370
I want to thank CPAC.
What a job they’ve done.

02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:14.430
What a job Matt Schlapp
and his family

02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:16.870
have done in such
a short period of time,

02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:20.720
in bringing this to a level
like it’s never been before.

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.370
God bless you. God bless
the United States of America.

02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:26.610
Thank you very much.

02:02:26.610 --> 02:02:26.950
(applause)
