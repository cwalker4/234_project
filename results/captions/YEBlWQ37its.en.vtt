00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.719
Hi, I'm Grant Williams.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.530
About a month ago, in Things That Make You
Go

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.110
Hmmm, I wrote a report called "Car Trouble"
about the US auto industry.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.520
And I wanted to
flesh that story out for you today because

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.720
it's something that is happening right now,
and it's

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.590
a lot bigger story than people think.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.750
To do this, I'm going to enlist the help of
a couple of people-- Daniel Ruiz, a fantastic

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.419
auto
analyst from a company called Blinders Off,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.570
who presents an incredible amount of information
and digs really deep into the sector; and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.620
my good friend Michael Lewitt, who's a person
I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.210
spend a lot of time talking to about this
particular industry because he follows it

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
very, very
closely.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.990
We're going to give you a sense of what's
going on, give you a sense of where the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.680
problems lie, how big they are, and at the
end hopefully a few ideas how you might profit

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.300
from it.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.640
The US auto industry is a big deal.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.600
It represents 3% of US GDP and employs roughly
5% of

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.060
the total workforce in the United States.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.930
In the last six years, $775 billion of exports
of cars

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.460
and auto parts have left the United States,
making it by far the biggest export sector.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.180
The
number two is aerospace, which is a distant

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.030
$125 billion dollars behind it.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.770
On a global basis,
research and development in the auto industry

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.299
is the second biggest sector of 40 sectors
measured worldwide-- it really is a big deal,

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.470
not just in the United States but beyond.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.151
Car sales have been rising now for some six
straight years, ever since Cash for Clunkers

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:34.840
was
instituted in 2010, and that's been a huge

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.020
benefit for the industry as a whole.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.360
It gave the auto
industry a $3 billion jump start when it needed

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.590
it most, back in the depths of the post Great
Recession period.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.560
But what it's actually done is pulled forward
a hell of a lot of demand.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.450
And we're at the point now where we're seeing
the back side of that demand, and the missing

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.900
purchases that have all been made in the last
six years are starting to be felt.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.240
Throw in the fact
that in the era of cheap money you've had

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.530
this surge of people looking to borrow money
to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.200
buy cars at really low interest rates, and
you see auto loans ballooned to over a trillion

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.689
dollars
now-- that's way higher than they were before

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.689
the credit crisis.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:13.569
In amongst those trillion dollars, the fastest
growing sector-- I hate to say it-- is once

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.440
again
subprime.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.620
And while the subprime sector is not as big
a problem on a wider basis as

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.450
mortgages were back in 2007, 2008, the 2015
series of subprime auto originations are

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.011
forecast to see the biggest delinquencies
of any tranche before that, with default rates

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.011
projected
to hit 15%-- that's a major problem.

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.011
To help me pick this apart and give you a
sense of where the problems lie, how big they

00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:35.011
potentially are, and what you can do about
them, I've enlisted the help of two really

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.011
smart
guys.

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.011
First of all Daniel Ruiz of Blinders Off,
who's a hardcore auto industry analyst who

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.011
has
as good a grasp on this sector as anyone I've

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.011
seen, and he's got some fascinating information
and charts for us that gives us his perspective

00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:40.011
of where he thinks the problems lie.

00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:41.011
And my old friend Michael Lewitt, who runs
The Credit Strategist.

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.011
Michael's a brilliant thinker,
a great communicator.

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:43.011
He's one of the guys I rely on when I'm thinking
through the auto sector,

00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:44.011
trying to get a handle on where the problems
lie, Michael's someone I go to frequently.

00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:45.011
So those two guys are going to help me and,
hopefully, help you make sense of this whole

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.011
thing.

00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.011
Kicking things off is Daniel Ruiz.

00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:48.011
And Daniel starts by looking at a sector of
market that

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.011
perhaps is not intuitive to most of us.

00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:50.011
He goes straight for the used car sector.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.011
And there's a
really good set of reasons for that, and Daniel's

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:52.011
going to lay them out for you right now.

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:54.900
I'm going to start with the used car values,
which really, in my opinion, is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.830
the foundation of the entire automotive industry.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.390
And one chart that's gotten a lot of
popularity lately is the NADA Used Vehicle

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.670
Price Index.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.150
It's been falling, significantly, and
because of that decline, we've had a lot of

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.160
attention on used car values.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.410
It's probably best that I start at the beginning,
which is what happened during the last

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.410
recession?

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.551
Because used car values fell significantly
during the last recession, but something

00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:28.580
else happened.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.620
And I want to talk more about the recovery
and why we've had the results

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:41.019
that we've had in the automotive industry,
with last year being a record-setting year--

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.489
and
so was the previous year.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.129
Used car values have rebounded really, really
sharply since the recession.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.900
That was largely
in part because new car sales volume was very,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.240
very low during the recession.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.230
Used car is
nothing more than a new car once it rolls

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.000
over the curb.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.690
So we had a really, really short supply of
pre-owned cars coming out of the recession.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.069
The
government stimulated the automotive industry

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.030
with what we all know as Cash for Clunkers-
- great program, stimulated sales, we had

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.959
a huge spike in volume of new cars sold.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.550
But
used car supply was actually starved, because

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.039
those sales did not produce trades.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.800
So we
actually took trade ins out of the equation

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.029
with Cash for Clunkers and further starved
used

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.029
car supply.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:39.009
Since then, we've enjoyed what I would consider
are extremely short trade cycles.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.219
So I'm
going to start with the why-- why are we seeing

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.319
the things that we're seeing?

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.849
Why are we
reading about the negative effects that falling

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.909
used car values are having?

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.460
We've all become very familiar with the NADA
Used Car Value Index.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.719
I'm going to explain
why it relates to higher delinquency rates

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:06.069
and subprime, why auto loan originations are
falling, and why there has been a divergence

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.279
between auto incentives and sales volume.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:17.569
Typically the more manufacturers support cars
with incentives, the more cars they sell,

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.539
but
that's not been the case.

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.569
We've now missed new car comparisons four
months in a row

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.159
despite a higher incentive spend.

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.969
So again, why is this happening?

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.349
It all relates to used car values.

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.149
The simple answer is as used car values fall,
it has a lot of

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.219
impact on all the things that we've just talked
about.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.280
And there's a lot of negative equity
out there.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.499
So that's at the core of things, and I truly
believe that used car values are the

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.249
foundation for the entire automotive industry.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.710
I'm going to start with talking about trade
cycles, because I think that's something that's

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.430
at
the core of this.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.029
We've enjoyed really, really great sales numbers
for a long time.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.509
And the
reason why is because we've had extremely

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.159
short trade cycles.

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:13.400
When used car values are really outperforming,
as they did shortly after the recession, it

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.210
allows dealerships to trade folks out of cars
a lot quicker.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.349
An optimal trade cycle happens
when the principal balance owed on a car meets

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:30.789
the current market value of that vehicle,
at the point where there is no inequity or

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.009
when you're in an equitable position.

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.580
That allows
an easy transition from the car that you currently

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.039
own to that new car that you may consider
purchasing.

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:52.629
So for years we had a very, very strong and
very short trade cycle.

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:57.279
Customers would come
into a car dealership for an oil change, and

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.710
it was a very, very easy thing for a salesperson
to walk up and say, hey, would you like a

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.710
new one?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.990
Would you like a different color?

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.839
Would you like something with the newest upgrades?

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.979
And by the way, your payment's not
going to go up, because you have equity in

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.649
your car and we really need it.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:19.339
So it was a very, very easy transaction for
quite a long time.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.649
But things have changed.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.800
The
effect of falling used car values takes that

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.759
out of the equation.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.499
Trade cycles are extremely important.

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:31.979
The vast majority of new car sales involve
a trade-in.

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:37.680
If we're bringing our cars back quicker, that
has a direct effect on sales velocity of new

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.770
cars.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.999
The shorter the trade cycle, the higher the
sales velocity of new cars.

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:45.899
The longer the
trade cycle, the slower the velocity of new

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:46.899
cars.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.289
What caused used car values to fall?

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.680
What was the correction?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.789
What happens?

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:56.719
It's important to understand the effect that
leases have on used car values.

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.539
As a used car
manager working at a car dealership, you have

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:05.689
to consider quite a few things when you're
trading in a vehicle.

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:07.759
How am I going to market the vehicle?

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.309
How am I going to sell the car?

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:10.800
Where am I going to price the vehicle?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.069
Who's my competition in my local market?

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:19.830
Something that needs to be of big consideration
is that used cars always have to have a

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.090
value proposition to a new car.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.429
And what most consumers measure as value is
their monthly

00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:27.949
payment.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:32.719
There has to be a good reason for buying something
that may not be the perfect

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:38.280
color, that might have some miles and some
wear and tear, that that's had some usage.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.440
And the reason why folks buy pre-owned cars
is because they present a better value in

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.810
terms of monthly payments than new cars.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:52.699
Well, when leasing gets to a certain level--
and really to extremes, which we've seen where

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.899
$50,000 cars are leasing in the mid $400 range.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:01.899
That puts a really, really significant
downward pressure on used car values.

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:09.819
Used car managers really have to figure, how
am I going to market this car to a potential

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:10.819
customer?

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:14.480
How am I going to justify the payment compared
to a potential lease on a new

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
car?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:23.220
It leaves you in a situation where if you
have a $45,000 car and somebody wants to trade

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:30.250
it one year later, is a $10,000 depreciation
enough?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.420
Is a $15,000 depreciation enough?

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.970
$400 is a $20,000 loan.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.560
And when you have $50,000 cars that are leasing
for $400 or

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.579
$500 per month, there's no market for that
one-year-old car.

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:48.839
There's no market for the twoyear-
old car.

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:52.839
And it puts significant pressure on all vehicles
that are pre-owned.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:56.690
I think when most of us think about the auto
sector, we instinctively think

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.690
about new cars.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.509
You drive down the street and see dealer lot
after dealer lot filled to the brim

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:03.560
with shiny new cars.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.610
But as Daniel points out, it's the used car
market that really has a massive

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.910
effect on the overall industry, and the undercurrents
that Daniel lays out are really quite

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.910
surprising.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.779
I was taken aback with just how serious they
are when you look into it, and

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:19.420
illustrates perfectly the knock-on effect,
which is something we try and talk about at

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.699
Real Vision
all the time.

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:25.139
To get another perspective on the auto industry,
I wanted to call my friend Michael Lewitt.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:28.720
Michael is someone that I rely on when I'm
thinking about this and trying to get my head

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.600
around it, because he looks at this stuff
all the time.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.550
He's one of the best credit writers out
there.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.080
He writes The Credit Strategist.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.050
So I sat down with Michael for a chat to get
his

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.279
perspective on the auto industry.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.430
OK, well, when we were putting this story
together about the auto sector, one of the

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.649
first people
I thought of, Michael, was you, because over

00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:45.720
the years you have been one of the people
that

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.329
I've relied on to keep me current on the state
of play in the auto sector.

00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:52.370
So I wanted to bring
you in and get your thoughts on where we are

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.139
on the time line for this whole thing playing
out.

00:10:55.139 --> 00:11:00.750
Right now you have retail suffering from a
real structural shift that's clearly

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.180
having an impact not only on industry but
on the economy, unemployment-- everything

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.180
else.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.140
And I think autos are the next industry.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.269
Just like retail, a lot of it is technology-driven
through

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:16.829
Amazon.

00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:19.220
I think autos are the next.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.519
I think autos have one advantage-- they were
not sunk by private equity firms coming in

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.070
and
loading them down with debt.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.709
They don't have that problem, although they
still have significant

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:37.569
health care and legacy obligations left over
from the bankruptcies and so on.

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:42.240
Michael makes a great point tying in the auto
industry to the retail sector and the US consumer.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.209
It's a very important linkage to make.

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:48.029
Now, the US consumer is 70% of the economy.

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:52.000
So it's vital to understand what's happening
to the US consumer.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.019
Michael takes a typical credit guys look at
the auto companies.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:59.290
And his point that they're not
weighed down by the debt strapped on to them

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.240
by private equity is important because with
that they've been even more trouble.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.509
But it's clear that as the US consumer comes
under

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:09.910
pressure, the auto industry is going to be
one of the sectors that suffers the most.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.940
The overall industry, I think, is probably
going to see-- at least in the US-- lower

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.940
volumes.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.769
I
mean, China and other places is a whole other

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:19.319
issue.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:24.050
But there's clearly secular change
coming, and it's going to have major impact

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.170
on the US economy.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.860
While we're talking about
what's already happened to the manufacturing

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:35.709
economy in the US, and there's been some
positive signs because of the recovery of

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:39.439
GM and Ford and so on, I think we're now going
to

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:41.800
see another potential leg down.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.300
If the volumes, which are now like-- what--
$17, $18 million a year, fueled by a lot of

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.750
subprime
auto loans and so on are going to fade.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.610
I mean, right now we're at peak inventories.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.850
We're
at peak subprime loans.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.360
We're at levels that are not sustainable.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.740
So you're also going have
to deal with that.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.740
But it's unlikely that these levels are going
to continue in a 2% growth

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.190
economy, so you have—
Well, that's something I wanted to dig into

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.930
with you, because if you look at this, these
companies they have pulled forward a lot of

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.939
demand, going all the way back to Cash for
Clunkers.

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:24.019
They've managed to have rising sales for seven
straight years now after that.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:26.889
But the last four months, we've seen that
turn.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:31.019
We've started to see auto sales decline, and
most worryingly-- perhaps-- truck sales, which

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.889
as the price of gas came down.

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.470
So if you add that, you add the massive amount
of inventories on dealer forecourts, which

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.129
is
at levels-- I don't think the data goes back

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:42.129
to the '80s.

00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:44.160
We have never even had close to this.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.470
And the subprime trade-- you're are three
to five year time line.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.820
I'm interested to see how you
see that playing out, because when you look

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.029
at how important the US auto industry is to
the

00:13:54.029 --> 00:14:01.129
US GDP-- it's 3% GDP and employs 5% of the
workforce, I think-- it's something that they

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:04.699
can't
allow to be in trouble, you know what I mean?

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:06.910
So--
Well, Three to five year-- I didn't mean to

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.910
interrupt.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:13.820
Three to five years is-- what I'm talking
about is the beginning of real secular structural

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.820
change.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.089
I'm not talking about the cyclical change,
the turn in the market.

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:22.360
Inventories are at record
highs.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.310
There are record numbers of cars coming off
leases.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:29.220
Used car prices are dropping
sharply.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.570
The average age-- I still think the average
age of the fleet is over 11 years, if I'm

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.570
not mistaken.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.439
People keep their cars longer.

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:40.749
I keep hearing about the strength of the consumer,
the strength of the consumer.

00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:44.100
I think that's
one of the great fairy tales.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.939
The consumer is still dealing with epically
high and rising health

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:51.779
care costs.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:56.470
The health care system is failing, and until
they-- and even if they come up with a

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:03.249
solution to Obamacare, it's going to take
at least a three-year sort of turnover to

00:15:03.249 --> 00:15:04.249
fix it.

00:15:04.249 --> 00:15:08.290
So people don't have-- they're borrowing money
to buy these cars.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.050
And so you have over $1
trillion of subprime loans, all this other

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.050
stuff.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.490
And the Fed is raising rates-- they're still
very low,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:21.430
but you have a situation where it may not
be three to five years until you start seeing

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.129
the
numbers of cars manufactured and so on get

00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:25.720
reduced.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.050
And that would be coincident with other things
we're seeing that suggest that a recession

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.050
is a
real possibility.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.150
You know, the yield curve is inverting.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:40.170
It gets flatter every day.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.410
The Fed's going
to raise rates later today unless a meteor

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.980
hits the world.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.629
And so the shorter end's going to
likely to move up further.

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:52.629
I don't see that.

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:57.889
The long end this morning, I thought I was
misreading

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:03.209
the tenure of the 213, which really shocked
me, which was at 220 just last Friday-- Monday.

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:05.199
So the curve is flattening.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:11.389
So when you have all these indicia that show
you that the economy is not growing and that

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:17.360
we're likely heading towards slower conditions,
and autos are right in the heart of that.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.079
So I
think that when you have what I call cyclical

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.740
conditions combining with secular conditions
or

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.800
structural conditions that are all negative,
that's not good.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.309
And I think-- in fairness, I think the auto
industry needs to be commended, because it

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:41.559
is
definitely trying to get ahead of the curve

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:44.129
on the technology side and everything.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.220
But on the
sales side, it's doing the same old stuff,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.389
which is incentives and all this stuff.

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:54.070
And then the
lenders are just making money available, but

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.070
money's getting cheaper.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.910
I mean, remember-- auto loans are on the shorter
end of the curve, and that's the side that's

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.910
going up.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.680
Now, it's still very low, but it'll end up
being a problem and you'll see defaults rise

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680
and everything.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.010
Now, I don't view auto loans as a threat to
the economy the way housing was.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.159
It's just not--
you can walk away from your car.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.699
You can't walk away from your house as easily.

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:18.250
But it's going to be a problem.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.630
And I think that time frame is shorter than
three years, because

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:30.470
you're just seeing it coincide with other
signs that the economy is slowing down.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.549
We'll come back to Michael later.

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:37.460
But what I want to do now is switch the focus,
go back to

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.770
Daniel, and get his thoughts on the leasing
and securitization of the auto industry, which

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.710
plays
a big part in trying to understand, again,

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.510
these cross-currents that are forced upon
the industry

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.230
by securitization of finance.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.580
So let's get Daniel back in and hear his thoughts
on the lease

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.649
market.

00:17:53.649 --> 00:18:02.350
Another thing to consider is the level of
negative equity that we have in leases today--

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.429
active
leases that have not matured yet.

00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:08.669
Credit risk on a lease is very different than
credit risk on

00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:10.429
a regular automobile loan.

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:16.120
Losses happen on regular automobile loans
when they default.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120
How much was owed?

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.980
What was the balance on the vehicle, and how
much should we

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.419
recover when we sent the vehicle to auction?

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:25.320
But they require that default in order to
realize

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.940
those losses.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.260
With leasing, you introduced residual risk.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.970
A lease does not have to default in order
for a

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:40.440
captive bank to lose money on the transaction--
it just has to mature.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.920
And what's concerning
is the level to which these loans have been

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.920
securitized.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:52.640
An auto lease, asset-backed security is a
thing, and it adds a layer of complexity that

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.370
really
needs to be looked into.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:00.170
The level to which loans have been securitized
is back to the peaks

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.350
before the recession.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.669
And it's very understandable, because for
years used car values

00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:09.370
outperformed residual values.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:15.080
So as these leases matured, the clients--
it was never a risk

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.080
to the captive bank or the bondholder.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.880
When leases mature and they have equity, it's
a huge boost to new car sales, because the

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.440
equity can be used towards a down payment.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.100
The customer rarely ever returns the car.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.980
They'll choose to buy it before returning
it, because they want that built-in equity,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.520
and they
look at it as a value.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:42.720
It's only when used car values start underperforming
residual values that we need to become

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720
concerned.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.240
And this is what concerns me about these securitized
loans and leases-- it's

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:57.159
needless to say that the amount of residual
losses that are currently on the books unrealized

00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:58.550
is significant.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:04.250
There are over 10 million leases outstanding,
and for every $1,000 that these

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:11.420
captive banks miss that residual calculation
by, every $1,000 represents $10 billion.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:18.120
So now I'm going to focus on GM, because they
have the largest day supply out there right

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.080
now as far as manufacturers, and their response
has been the most extreme, in my opinion.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.820
I was concerned that if we miss sales figures
in April, manufacturers were going to respond

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:35.130
by raising incentives pretty aggressively,
because we're so close to the time of the

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.299
year
where we have to get rid of leftover product.

00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:42.200
Higher incentives is exactly what we got.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.110
They responded to their day supply problem
very

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:53.370
aggressively with a very, very low lease payment
on a Silverado and a 20% reduction from

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.190
MSRP on a Chevrolet Malibu.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:01.940
One has to consider what the direct effect
of that level of discounting is going to be

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.740
on
used car values.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.179
What's a one-year-old Silverado worth today?

00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:09.500
A two-year-old Silverado?

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:15.299
If you're taking 20% off on a new Malibu,
how much do you have to discount that one

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:17.429
or
two-year-old Malibu so that, if you try to

00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:21.230
retail it, there's some sort of a value proposition
to

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.720
the new car?

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.260
As buyers of cars, we look out for incentives,
and we like them to be as big as they possibly

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.390
can be in order to get a discount on their
shiny, new car.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.820
But when Daniel talks about the
incentives and what the dealers are having

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.511
to do to try to shift some of this massive
inventory

00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:43.049
overhang, you start to think of it in a different
way.

00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:47.559
And this notion of incentives and the
degree to with which they're becoming increasingly

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:51.210
more important to the manufacturers, is
something that Michael and I spoke about on

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.820
our call.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.779
The incentives now are at all-time highs--
I think $4,000.

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:04.470
I heard an advert on the radio this
past week advertising $14,000 off a Dodge

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.860
Ram truck.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:11.410
And I was trying to figure out what a
Dodge Ram truck must cost.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.950
And that's got to be a 30% discount on that
thing, or 20%.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.400
It's a good--yeah, the incentives are crazy,
because the lots are full.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.220
Driving around South
Florida the lots are full, and there are only

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.340
so many people for so many cars.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.000
There are a lot
of immigrants down here, there are a lot of

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.400
immigrants in the US, but now there are fewer
immigrants in the US.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:40.460
So if the population stops growing from that
segment, they're not going

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.330
to be getting cars.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.990
So I think that the industry is running up
against it, and they're trying to deal with

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.190
it in the
traditional way on the sales side, on the

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:59.090
nontraditional way with the technology and
everything, but it's not going to be a smooth

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.090
transition.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.610
That commercial I heard on the radio for the
big discount for the Dodge truck-- when I

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.630
heard
it, I was astounded at the sheer size of the

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.630
discount.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.000
But Daniel makes a great point-- that this
is something that, once it starts, this is

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.140
a set of dominoes that just keeps toppling.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.450
And as GM
cuts prices, so Ford will have to cut prices,

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.789
so Chevy cut prices, and the dominoes just
keep

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:20.789
cascading.

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:22.909
And this is really just starting to get going
now.

00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:26.309
So it's a great time to be a buyer of a car
because the incentives you're going to get

00:23:26.309 --> 00:23:28.450
offered, but it might not be such a great
time to be

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.940
a buyer of the stocks of the automakers.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:37.010
Another thing to consider is that when one
manufacturer has a day supply problem-- like

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:43.429
GM, for example-- the other manufacturers
don't rest while they get their house in order.

00:23:43.429 --> 00:23:46.809
The auto industry is very, very competitive.

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:53.169
Anyone that competes directly with GM is going
to adjust in order to not lose market share.

00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:58.799
So the heavy discounting becomes contagious
and the unintended collateral damage is used

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:00.000
car values.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.269
This is all happening at a very bad time,
and it's why I consider this to be the perfect

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:09.669
storm
for used car value declines.

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:14.980
There's such heavy emphasis on new car incentives
to deal

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:21.710
with this day supply problem and it's putting
such enormous pressure on used cars, and the

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.830
timing couldn't be worse.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.630
Something that I'm keeping an eye on that
is extremely concerning to me is the amount

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:34.630
of
2016 leftovers that we have in May of 2017.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.690
Pick your favorite search engine for vehicles.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:45.340
Plug in 2016 new cars at any distance, and
you will be amazed at how many vehicles we

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.679
have available.

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:50.880
And we're halfway into 2017.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.260
This is extremely alarming, and the reason
why is because 2016's represent the most

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:03.920
heavily discounted portion of new car inventory,
and these cars aren't selling.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.500
It's a very
strong indication that demand has fallen for

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.350
new vehicles.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:15.210
Dealers put a lot of emphasis on making sure
that new vehicles never roll into the next

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:16.560
model year.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.700
And the reason why is because, at a certain
point in time, a manufacturer will

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.460
stop supporting leftover models.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.240
They'll simply make a lump sum payment to
the dealership,

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.100
and at that point, it becomes their problem.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:36.010
This makes the 2016's that are leftover today
extremely difficult to sell because they're

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:41.250
competing against the heavy incentives on
the 2017's.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:47.809
In a lot of cases, it's less expensive,
from a payment standpoint, to purchase a new

00:25:47.809 --> 00:25:52.280
2017 versus a heavily discounted 2016.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:26:01.190
I look at the 2016 leftovers like plaque that
builds in an artery-- they're just slowing

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.720
things
down.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.799
And you have to wonder how many 2017's are
going to be leftover.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:12.110
Once enough
these cars pile up, the patient has a heart

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.140
attack.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.070
You have to stop production.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:20.200
So perhaps you've seen the chart for Morgan
Stanley Research projecting as much as a

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.440
50% decline in used car values in the next
two years.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.840
When I first saw the chart, I just
simply could not believe that something like

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.730
that would be possible, knowing full well
that

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:37.149
we have a perfect storm that would make that
scenario very, very likely.

00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:41.350
We have a day
supply problem from new car manufacturers

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.120
that's putting a massive amount of pressure
on

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:52.370
used car values, ahead of a huge, huge supply
problem from lease maturities.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.250
And the
leases are going to go to auction, because

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.690
they have negative equity.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:03.470
We also have the potential for more supply
from subprime loan defaults.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.280
There's a recent
report that Santander, one of the largest

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.790
subprime lenders out there, only verified
income

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.740
on 8% of their customers.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.760
This is extremely concerning to me.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.360
It's because the subprime lending industry
is also extremely competitive.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.990
When somebody
walks into a dealership, they want to purchase

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:29.730
a car and they have bad credit, their
application gets sent to multiple banks.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:35.809
The responses are then reviewed and the most
appealing terms are selected.

00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:39.000
The most appealing terms are not always interest
rate.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.961
Oftentimes the approval that has the
least amount of stipulations, the one that

00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:46.659
has the least amount of checks, is the one
that's

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:50.220
chosen to quicken the sale.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.740
If a customer can't provide proof of income,
if they can't provide

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.690
proof of residence, it could delay the sale.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.110
There's also a risk that the customer might
go to

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.529
another dealership and purchase from them.

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:10.100
The lenders know this, and no income verification
is a competitive advantage.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.470
Does any of
that sound familiar?

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.929
Taking shortcuts, not verifying things, all
in the pursuit of more loan

00:28:18.929 --> 00:28:21.039
originations?

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:22.500
We've been here before.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.409
Apparently we haven't learned anything.

00:28:25.409 --> 00:28:28.470
Daniel asked exactly the right question--
haven't we learned anything?

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.889
But unfortunately these
days that question always seems to just be

00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:33.779
rhetorical, because of course we haven't learned
anything.

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:38.049
We're right back where we are, and all the
conditions are in place for another storm

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.030
along the same lines as we saw in 2008.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:45.160
And although, as I said earlier in the program,
the subprime auto sector is a much smaller

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.430
part of the US economy, the ripples that this
can have through a sector that employs 5%

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.220
of the
entire US workforce are seriously, seriously

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.900
dangerous.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.350
So having established all this, having understood
where the problems lie, and hopefully giving

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.360
you some sort of sense of the severity of
them, what happens next?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.470
Where do we go from
here?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.400
Well, Daniel has a roadmap of his own, which
I want to share with you.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:16.860
What happens next will be a series of events
that will have a domino effect.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.460
In my opinion,
what we'll see next is-- we've already seen

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.910
elongated trade cycles in passenger cars.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.950
We
will now see elongated trade cycles in light

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.250
pickup trucks and SUVs.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:38.539
The next thing that we're going to experiences
is an affordability issue, when residuals--

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:45.000
which adjust quarterly-- continue to fall
until they reach equilibrium with used car

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
values.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.870
New car sales volume will continue to decline.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.419
The day supply at dealers will continue to
rise.

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:59.360
At some point, dealers will refuse inventory
from manufacturers.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.730
When that happens,
manufacturing will slow or stop while we work

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.270
through the supply issues.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:12.740
This has a potential to last for a very long
time, because we not only have a new car supply

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.980
problem, we also have an inbound used car
supply problem.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.759
And that used car supply
problem is unrelenting until the end of 2019.

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:27.279
So that's how Daniel sees things playing out
in the not too distant future.

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.240
But I wanted to get
another perspective and I wanted to see what

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.240
Michael thought.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.830
And Michael brought up
something very, very interesting, and that's

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.150
the effect that technology is going to have
on the

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.480
car industry.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.990
And unfortunately, like all technological
change, it's massively deflationary.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.880
And for an
industry like the auto industry, that relies

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.440
on selling more and more cars every year,
that's

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.270
another headwind it's going to have to deal
with.

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.970
Their balance sheets are OK.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:57.370
The issue is they are wrestling with truly
historic technological

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.370
shifts.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:06.490
A double whammy of electric cars-- or what
I call non-fossil fueled cars-- and this

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.600
driverless car thing.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.029
My mom's a perfect example.

00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:11.029
My mom is 86.

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:12.029
God bless her.

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:14.440
She can still drive, but she doesn't
like to.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.930
So we just gave back her car last week.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.770
And she doesn't need it anymore, between
Uber and if she wanted to get a car, we could

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.730
get her a car that she doesn't have to drive.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.479
I
mean, that's historic.

00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:29.250
Otherwise I got to go schlep and take her
everywhere, which I am happy

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.460
to do.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.779
But that's just a whole segment of the population.

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:37.629
And I live down here in Florida, so we see
all these elderly people driving, which is

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.039
not a good thing.

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:41.450
And it just ripples through.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.429
It's
number of cars manufactured.

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:44.970
It affects the insurance.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.659
It affects everything.

00:31:46.659 --> 00:31:52.830
But I still think it's three to five years
away, but it's three to five years of, I think,

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.670
a continual
transition away from the traditional auto

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.670
manufacturers.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.539
And unless they are able to shift,
which I think they're doing--

00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:04.639
But what does all this mean for us as investors?

00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:09.040
Michael and Daniel have painted a pretty
troubling picture of the US auto industry,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.399
and I wanted to ask Michael how he thought
this

00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:15.710
would play out and where we as investors should
be looking to try and, A, represent the view

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.620
that's been put forward in this video and,
B, the companies and the stocks through which

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.500
we
want to make some money out of it.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.720
When you think about this and you lay this
progression out in your head, where do you

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.120
think
people should be looking for the first sign?

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.350
Should they be looking at the credit company?

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.809
Should they be looking at the Big Three?

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:39.090
Should they be looking at like the Ally Financials
or

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.030
the Santander-- the subprime auto loans?

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.490
Where do you think the signs are going to
come

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.129
and where do you think people should be focusing
their attention?

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:47.990
Well, the first thing is I think the Big Three
are sort of dead money.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.180
I think that GM is the
cheapest stock in the S&amp;P 500.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.720
And I think its going to stay near the bottom.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:02.360
I just think that these are deep cyclicals,
and they're just not going to go anywhere,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360
in my
opinion.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.760
I mean it is a cheap stock by every measure,
but it's going to stay cheap because of

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.500
what we've discussed.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.090
I think that the problems are going to come.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.139
I think that you're going to see rising defaults
with

00:33:16.139 --> 00:33:21.009
the lenders, and they're going to be problematic.

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:26.920
And they're going to have other problems
with consumer loans and everything else, so

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.779
I think they're depending on-- you have to
sort of

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:35.529
go granularly-- but I think they're an area
that's going to be a problem.

00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:39.610
What's interesting is everybody looks at the
financials and go, oh, well, rates are going

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.769
up,
that's good for the financials.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:44.860
But it doesn't always work out that way, because
there are other

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.139
things going on.

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:51.639
And then I think the rental car business is
going to continue to suffer.

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:56.590
And then you have the
auto parts industry and anything ancillary,

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:00.820
because if in fact-- the first wave is going
to be just

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.590
cyclical.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.550
The second wave is going to be structural.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:10.520
And when the structural wave comes, it's
going to look more like what's happening in

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.710
retail, where we actually have much lower
demand for your product.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.890
And then you're going to see the auto parts
makers and so on-- the Auto Zones, Pep Boys,

00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:22.700
and all that stuff.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.830
And it's funny-- those seem to be real favorites
of a lot of the hedge funds,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:34.780
and I wouldn't be surprised to see that money
sort of start to exit, because the macro picture

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:42.400
for them is not there yet, but it's going
to start to become problematic.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:50.450
And that's a business-- one of the reasons
the FANG stocks are so popular is because

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.660
future
growth is considered very high.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.470
I don't see how you make that case for anything
auto related,

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:01.960
other than possibly Tesla-- but that story's
so far ahead of itself it's just ridiculous.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:10.760
I think that you're looking at a slowing growth
sector that you need to sort of start exiting,

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:18.630
because it's moving away from the old model
to something that we don't know what it's

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:24.550
going
to look like, but it's not going to look the

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.830
same.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:38.680
OK, so we've covered a lot of ground today,
and I want to try and wrap that up for you

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.220
and
give you an overall sense and recap some of

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.220
the charts we've seen.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.202
And the first component
of this that I really want to pay attention

00:35:45.202 --> 00:35:47.530
to is the physical side of the cars themselves.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.780
You look at auto sales which, as you can see
here, have rallied strongly since the trough

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.760
in
2009, we've had six straight years of rising

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760
sales.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.350
But that trend has clearly changed.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.710
And
you can see it's not just a domestic problem.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:05.420
Domestic cars, imported cars, are all seeing
declines in sales on a year-on-year basis,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.720
and that is a big problem for companies like
GM

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.050
and Ford, for example.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.530
And Michael Lewitt calls GM and Ford dead
money, which means he doesn't expect the stocks

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.560
to really go anywhere.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.540
And that's never a good thing if you're looking
to invest in a company,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.910
but if you're looking to short something or
you see a story with problems, then having

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.020
stocks
that really aren't going to go anywhere is

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.320
actually a great head start.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.130
If you add into the mix
the finance arms that GM and Ford have, which

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.960
could be a source of some trouble for them,
as we've seen with the loan numbers, that

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.570
could give you a good tailwind if you want
to have

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.650
a short in either of those companies.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.651
So that's the physical side of the equation.

00:36:38.651 --> 00:36:42.270
The other component of this is the finance
side, and this is where, perhaps, the problems

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.430
are
going to start manifested themselves very

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.430
soon.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:50.100
Auto loans in total now are over a trillion
dollars-- and of that, subprime loans have

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.100
increased rapidly.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.490
And we started to see a--
delinquency rates rise very, very quickly.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.030
That shows the stress that these guys are
under

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.730
because, as Michael pointed out, most of these
loans are at the short end of the curve, and

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.270
that's where the Fed tightening is going to
have its biggest effect.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.520
So you can expect to see that contagion spread
through the 2015 series of subprime loans

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.120
are forecast to hit possibly 15% default rates,
which is a significant increase.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.810
And this is
going to put some material pressure on companies

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.430
like Capital One, as you can see here.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:23.770
And another company that you might look at
is Ally Financial.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:27.150
And the third one may be
Credit Acceptance Corporation.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.600
But to me the poster child for all this is
Santander.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.710
Daniel talked about them only doing due
diligence on about 8% of their subprime loans.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:39.680
And when you understand that those
subprime loans form 80% of their loan book,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.680
you realize what a precarious position they're
in and how easily that stress could come to

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.360
bear on them and cause severe problems for
the

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360
stock.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360
So there you have it.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.750
The US auto sector is a big part of the economy--
3% of the economy,

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:58.060
employs 5% of the workforce-- and it's a major
driver of US economic performance.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.150
And to
me, to Daniel, to Michael, and to many other

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.800
smart thinkers around the world who are
looking at this stuff, the problems are starting

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.090
to build in that sector and it looks like
a place

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.640
that's going to come under significant pressure.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.810
Hopefully we've give you a sense of the currents
and the dynamics that are going to create

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.760
that pressure and we've given you a few ideas
as to how you might profit from it.
