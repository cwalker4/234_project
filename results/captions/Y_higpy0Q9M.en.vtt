00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
It's not a good time to be a dairy farmer in the United States.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:05.795
It hasn't been for a while. Milk prices have dropped below

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.480
the cost of production for four years in a row

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.480
and thousands of dairy farms close every year.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
Advances in technology and genetics

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.080
mean that smaller numbers of cows

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.440
can produce greater amounts of milk. Too much milk.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.440
Tidal waves of milk in the American market lower prices,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.560
leaving some farmers to just dump thousands and thousands of

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.200
unprofitable gallons. Similar stories have played out

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:29.185
in Australia and around the European Union. But

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.980
it's by no means universal. Dairy farmers struggling in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.020
Wisconsin and Michigan just have the peak across the northern border to

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.800
see how different their lives could be.

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.535
Dairy production ramped up during World War II and the subsequent

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.405
reconstruction of Europe. But that demand dried up by the mid to late

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.215
1950s. By the 1960s, many countries were

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.485
overwhelmed with excess dairy products. Some countries started

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.475
subsidizing their dairy farmers directly. Even today, one study

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.205
estimates that dairy subsidies cost American tax payers about

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:00.175
$20 Billion dollars every year.

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:03.185
Often in Canada we say, "you know Americans pay twice for their

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.665
milk; once at the supermarket and another time through their taxes."

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.745
But not Canada. Instead, Canada implemented a

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:12.445
three part supply management system that empowered their

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.335
dairy farmers. Here's how it works: the first

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.525
part controls production. To sell their products, Canadian dairy

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:21.525
farmers must have a quota, or a license to produce a

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.275
set amount of milk. Basically, provincial marketing agencies

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:27.265
predict how much dairy products Canadian consumers will buy

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:30.285
that year. And it uses those numbers to set the quotas. Farmers buy

00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:33.305
more quotas or sell off their existing quotas, depending on how

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.200
much they expect to produce. So these quotas prevent overproduction

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.780
of dairy. Which in turn prevents prices from

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780
spiraling downwards.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.700
The second part guarantees minimum prices for Canadian dairy farmers.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
Imagine that: from one year to the next, the price of  cow feed jumped by 20 percent.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.655
Normally, that would cut into a dairy farmer's profits. In Canada

00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:54.500
however, milk marketing boards in each province  negotiate

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.485
with milk processors to set a minimum price

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:59.695
that takes into account these price fluctuations. So farmers are compensated

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:01.635
relative to their costs each year.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:05.895
The third and final part of the supply management system  takes aim at

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:08.725
foreign dairy. Every year Canada imports an allotted

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.085
amount of foreign dairy. Typically,

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:12.885
around 10 percent of its total domestic market, with

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:16.275
low or no tariffs. After that, tariffs shoot up

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:19.285
Sometimes up to 300 percent. This prevents foreign dairy

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.275
from flooding the market and encourages Canadians to buy Canadian

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:25.175
products. So this is how Canada tries to keep its

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.245
dairy farmers in business. It has a vested interest in

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:31.325
doing so, as the industry is the backbone of many rural communities.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.475
Providing more than 220,000 jobs and

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.715
nearly $20 Billion to Canada's GDP in 2015.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.580
Some Canadians dislike this system, arguing that consumers pay

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.640
more for dairy products than elsewhere. Whats more,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.525
some critics of the program in Canada argue that the government props up

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:49.435
dairy farmers more than it should,  resulting in an average income for

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.315
dairy farmers of exceeding $160,000 dollars,

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:55.355
and what one agricultural experts calls, "a sense of entitlement by

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:58.395
the sector", which has a powerful lobby at both the Federal and

00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.365
Provincial level. However,

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:03.325
a 2017 Neilson study showed Canada's milk prices are on

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:06.095
par with prices from similarly developed nations. And

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.095
at least one public opinion poll puts Canadian support for the system

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.400
at about 75%. "If you value the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.505
qualitative as opposed to mere the quantitative I

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:18.515
think you'd opt for the Canadian system over the

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:20.405
American one, because the lifestyle

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:23.375
that rural people in Canada lead is much, much, much more

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.580
robust, than the rural lifestyle of people in the US".

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.840
Internationally though, Canada's system has fewer fans.

00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:37.965
Since the 1980s, Canada's trading partners have repeatedly demanded

00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:38.955
they lower their dairy

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:41.800
defenses, with some calling into question the legality of the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
quota system under World Trade Organization laws.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.665
The fight over milk between the US and Canada has played out

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:50.365
in free trade agreements from the mid 1990s onward.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:53.385
It revolves around how much of Canada's domestic dairy market

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:56.500
will be filled by tariff free imports from the US.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.620
Under NAFTA, the figure is disputed. One USDA official

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.700
told CNBC, "that no US  dairy

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.600
exports to Canada were tariff free under NAFTA".

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.840
But other experts cite the figure at around 1% - 3%.

00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:11.035
During negotiations  for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obama

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:14.125
administration secured 3.25% of the Canadian market

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.000
without tariffs. However,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.900
President Trump pulled out of that agreement in January 2017. The President

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.535
sees Canada's system as deeply unfair to American dairy

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.500
farmers in Wisconsin, and other border states.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.220
So during the talks the renegotiate NAFTA, he threatened

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.775
to leave Canada out of the agreement, and impose steep tariffs on

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:32.665
cars if they didn't offer dairy concessions.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:35.600
Those threats worked. Under the USMCA:

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.425
NAFTA's replacement, 3.59% of Canada's

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:41.495
total domestic dairy market will be comprised of imports from the US,

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:43.300
without tariffs. After that, the

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:44.605
tariffs kick in once again.

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:47.900
"We think it's a great deal, obviously US, Mexico,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.235
Canadian deal, its good for agriculture. I think its

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:54.515
good for the US economy. I think President Trump, achieved

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:58.105
most if not all the objectives that we had to begin with".

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:01.125
This agreement has infuriated some Canadians, with farmers worried

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:04.305
for their future, and some consumers calling for a boycott of American

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:07.335
dairy products. For all the fanfare around the deal though,

00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:10.405
some American dairy experts argue that the effects will be modest.

00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:13.035
The US already had 3.25% access

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:15.895
under the TPP before they pulled out. And the difference between that and the

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.335
USMCA amounts to only an estimated $70 Million dollars

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:21.375
more for the American dairy industry. And besides,

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:22.435
it's unclear if

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:24.455
access to Canada's relatively small market

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:27.745
can make a dent in the US's massive milk surpluses.

00:05:27.905 --> 00:05:30.800
The US has a huge dairy trade surplus with Canada,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.735
which was already increasing prior to

00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:35.000
USMCA negotiations. To put the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.100
size of the problem in perspective; Wisconsin

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.220
alone produces more milk than all of Canada.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.380
"I think for any country, to actually put their faith

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.075
in dairy exports is a panacea to,

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.725
you know, huge oversupply of dairy production,

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:50.265
as the Americans have done, I

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:53.105
think its a really, really rum game. I think it's a tsunami

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:55.995
washing across the US, with no home.

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:57.995
So, what are you gonna do?"
