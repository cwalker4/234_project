00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.368
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.838
It's a great honor to have
the Amir of Qatar with us.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.907
He's a friend of mine -
knew him long before I

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.309
entered the world
of politics.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.277
He's a great gentleman.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.279
He's very popular
in his country.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.447
His people love him.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.017
We're working on unity in
that part of the Middle

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.019
East, and I think it's
working out very well.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.021
There are a lot of
good things happening.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.925
Also, we have a gentleman,
on my right, who buys a

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.294
lot of equipment from us.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.663
A lot of purchases in the
United States, and a lot

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:34.501
of military airplanes,
missiles -

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.568
lots of different things.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:39.773
But they've been great
friends in so many ways.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.742
We're working very well
together, and I think it's

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.310
working out
extremely well.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.813
So, Amir, thank you very
much for being here.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.716
Appreciate it.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.151
Amir Al Thani: Thank you
very much, Mr. President.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:51.985
The President: Thank you.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.620
Amir Al Thani: I'm very
happy and honored to be

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.355
here, and thanks
for this invitation.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.725
Our relationship between
Qatar and the United

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.860
States has been
more than 45 years.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.929
It's a very strong,
solid relationship.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.635
Our economic partnership
is more than $125 billion,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.603
and our aim and goal is
to double it

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.238
in the next coming years.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:18.244
Our military cooperation
is very solid, very strong.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.147
As everybody know, that
the heart of fighting

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.316
terrorism is from
Al Udeid Base.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:27.921
And, thank God, it's been
a very successful campaign

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:33.827
against the terrorist
groups around our region.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.030
Lately, before I come
here, I was in Tampa.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.999
I visited the CENTCOM, and
we met with the generals.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.571
And it was a very
important visit, and it

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.974
shows how strong our
cooperation is between the

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.743
armed forces.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:55.315
Of course, we speak today,
and we see the suffering

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.783
of the Syrian people.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.819
And me and the President,
we see eye to eye that

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.088
this matter has to
stop immediately.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:05.191
We cannot tolerate - with
a war criminal, we cannot

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.627
tolerate with someone who
killed more than half a

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.596
million of his own people.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.698
And this matter should
end immediately.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.932
Thank you very much,
Mr. President.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:13.933
The President: Thank you.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.103
And Tamim and I have been
working for a number

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:21.074
of years now - actually, even 
before the fact - on terrorism.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.744
And we're making sure
that terrorism funding is

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:29.048
stopped in the countries
that we are really related to -

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.950
because I
feel related.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.786
But those countries are
stopping the funding of

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.856
terrorism, and that
includes UAE; it includes

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.826
Saudi Arabia; it includes
Qatar and others.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.396
A lot of countries were
funding terrorism and

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.397
we're stopping it.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.832
It's getting
stopped and fast.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.033
Very important.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.903
And you've now become a
very big advocate, and we

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.104
appreciate that.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.539
Amir Al Thani: Thank
you, President.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.409
I want to make something
very clear, Mr. President:

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.812
We do not and we will not
tolerate with people who

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:00.813
fund terrorism.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.815
We've been cooperating
with the United States of

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:06.886
America to stop funding
terrorism around the region.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:10.123
We do not tolerate with
people who support and

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.124
fund terrorism.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.626
I would like to also thank
the President for him

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:18.097
being involved personally
in solving the GCC crisis.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.132
He's been very helpful.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.135
He's been supporting us
during this blockade.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.604
And I would like to also
thank the American people

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.039
for being very supportive.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.443
And his role is very vital to 
end this crisis in our region.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.411
Thank you, sir.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.378
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.180
Thank you.
