00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.410
When you have ancient cultures all over the world

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.310
Who are describing

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.580
non-human entities in the unseen

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.250
Which is almost? What isn't unseen to the humans in the way that I've just described

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.029
many taking a reptilian form and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.260
That has passed through the ages and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.560
Then you meet people in places like America of course once you start talking about this you become

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.200
Someone that people will give information to because they can see a way of getting out to the public arena

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Because you won't think they're crazy

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.350
and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.350
They telling you the same

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.459
You know people who've been in mind control projects people who've been in government

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.259
Projects, who've interacted with these entities in in underground bases

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.730
And they're describing what the ancients described

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.149
When you've got this this managed unfortunately just died in his 90s William Tompkins

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.710
writing a book in

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.689
2015

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.309
Describing how he was seconded in 1942 into a top-secret

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.559
Naval intelligence operation in America based at the Naval Base, San Diego where

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.739
He is his role of the role of that organization was to interact with

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.509
non-human entities and

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.279
He produced his documents. He produceds pictures of people he was with to support what he claims and

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.529
He's saying world governments that could control by a reptilian non-human race

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.559
I've been saying that since the 90s, but he's

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.669
What well let let's look at how it works

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.129
First of all these entities operate in the unseen overwhelmingly in the unseen

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.330
Because we like I said earlier live in a frequency band a band of frequency

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.799
Anything beyond that frequency we can't see we're not aware of and you know

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.699
People have no trouble accepting that the old analog system of radio and television stations

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.119
Our different frequencies sharing the same space without interfering with each other unless they're really close on the dial

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.049
you know the analog system BBC one and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.219
ITV and CNN, they're sharing the same space, but they're just on different frequencies and the

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.139
The television picks up different frequencies as you change the channel

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.989
Well in the same way

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.929
Worlds of, or realities of.. it's a better term. are

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.789
Sharing the same space without interfering with each other and still so very close on the dial

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.349
At that point where they're close on the dial and and and and there is some form of interaction

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.289
That's what we call ghosts and paranormal activity

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.199
and so these

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.638
Not just reptilian, but other non-human entities are operating just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.519
outside of the human sight and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930
They

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.379
Have to have

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.279
vehicles within our frequency band within our world that represent their interests that

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.599
are

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.008
basically vehicles for them to manipulate our society and so

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.209
Particular bloodlines were

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.199
created

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:48.369
That are hybrids part reptilian not not always reptilian but reptilian but part human

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.219
Which is the origin of the Royal .... bloodline a

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.489
whole order of the ages

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:06.849
You know the ancient Chinese emperors used to claim the right to be Emperor because of their descendents from the serpent gods

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.139
and

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.139
the reason that these

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.679
Royal bloodlines and aristocratic 
 bloodlines have

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.039
Incessantly obsessively interbred it's because they're holding this hybrid genetic program and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.100
For long time

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.540
They ruled because they were the special bloodline

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.440
What is it?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.890
Just down the road from us now in London. We have a head of state even today

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.430
Who is head of state because of her bloodline the?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.200
Queen if she was a different bloodline she might be cleaning the throne not sitting on it. This is the nonsense of it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.519
Why are you queen because someone had sex with someone and and and and that person was born first

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250
therefore their the monarch.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.889
Sorry, I thought we lived in a civilized society with some form of intelligence

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.939
What's going on, but across much of the world as?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480
Humanity started to

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.110
awaken a bit more from its civility to

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.680
To these Royal bloodlines

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.759
They couldn't sustain it any longer and so

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.809
the Royal in-your-face control

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.170
started to disperse it's still around in some areas like we still have a monarchy in here and the Commonwealth countries, but

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.590
Lots of countries had disappeared, but these bloodlines didn't

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.129
and their sense of being special and being quote royal never ended either and

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.139
so they moved into the dark suit professions of banking of

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.640
politics of what all the dark suit professions government administration, etc and they've gone on running the show ever since

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.190
While not being overtly royal and of course what happened with the

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.510
so-called British a great British Empire these other European empires is these bloodlines went all over the world and they

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.140
imposed themselves

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.110
In the North America in South America in Australia all over the world

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.270
And they've gone on controlling ever since, but when you look at the situation from

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.390
from just a you know general population perspective everything seems to be

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.079
Unconnected people seem to be unconnected, but when when you go deep into the shadows they're not unconnected

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.930
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.340
