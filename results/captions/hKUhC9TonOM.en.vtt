BRIAN: IT'S A GREAT INSTRUMENT.

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:07.598
LOUIE ARMSTRONG WAS MY IDOL

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:09.800
GROWING UP BECAUSE HE COULD SING

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:10.634
TOO BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN PLAY

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.536
THE TRUMPET.

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.370
STEVE: SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO TOOT

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.973
HIS OWN HORN.

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:17.341
HE JOINS US FROM CLEVELAND.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:19.343
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:19.743
NICE TO SEE THE BEATLES ALL

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.912
TOGETHER.

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.180
BRIAN: ABSOLUTELY.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:25.583
STEVE: ISN'T IT CURIOUS.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:28.118
NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN 15 PAGES OF

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:30.487
JAMES COMEY'S MEMOS.

00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:33.424
THESE ARE THINGS HE LEAKED TO

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.692
HIS FRIEND, THAT WOULD SPUR A

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:35.125
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION OF

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:35.859
DONALD TRUMP.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:39.096
WE LOOK AT THE STUFF.

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:40.564
THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE THAT

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.967
WOULD SUGGEST RUSSIAN COLLUSION.

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:44.568
THERE IS NOTHING IN THERE TO

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.469
SUGGEST OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:47.905
SO WHAT GIVES?

00:00:45.603 --> 00:00:49.940
&gt;&gt; STEVE, AS A CURRENT AUTHOR

00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:50.741
MYSELF I ENVOY COMEY'S

00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:52.042
INCREDIBLE PRESS TOUR.

00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:52.409
HE IS EVERYWHERE SPEAKING TO

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:54.745
EVERYBODY.

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:59.283
HE HAS A NUMBER ONE, NUMBER ONE

00:00:54.878 --> 00:01:01.118
BOOK OUT THERE, BUT THE MORE

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:03.153
EXPOSURE HE GETS, EVEN AMONG

00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:05.723
PEOPLE NATURALLY FRIENDLY TOWARD

00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:08.158
HIS POINT OF VIEW, THE LESS HIS

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:08.525
IMAGE OF GRANDEUR, IT IS JUST

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.127
SHRINKING.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.794
HE IS MELTING RIGHT BEFORE OUR

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.231
VERY EYES.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:15.566
NOW HE SEEMS LIKE, THAT AWE,

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.468
SHUCKS THING IS GONE.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.768
NOW IT SEEMS LIKE REVENGE OF THE

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.670
NERD.

00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:20.104
THE GUY IS TRYING TO STICK IT TO

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:21.605
DONALD TRUMP.

00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:24.908
IT ALSO SEEMS, I DON'T WANT TO

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:28.812
BE A SCHOOL EXIST, AN ARMCHAIR

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:29.847
SCHOOL EXIST ABOUT, SEEMS --

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:31.882
PSYCHOLOGIST ABOUT THIS.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.150
HE SEEMS SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:34.818
SABOTAGING HILLARY CLINTON'S

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:37.388
PRESIDENTIAL AS PER RAGES HE IS

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:38.222
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO INSULT

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:39.390
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.124
TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S

00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:41.692
LITTLE HANDS.

00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:43.260
HIS TIE IS TOO LONG.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:45.696
ORANGE FACE AND ALL OF THESE

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:47.931
PRESS EVENTS HE IS DOING.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.667
IN TERMS OF THE BOOK AND THE

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:50.601
MEMOS, IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A BIG

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.337
NOTHING BURGER.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:55.673
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THERE THAT

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.342
CORROBORATES IF ANY WAY THE

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:59.043
COSMIC CHARGE OF COLLUSION.

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:00.844
STEVE: RIGHT.

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:02.479
&gt;&gt; MOREOVER, TALKING ABOUT SOME

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:03.881
OF THE EVIDENCE BACKING THE

00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:07.418
CHARGES AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:08.719
THE INFAMOUS STEELE DOSSIER AND

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.722
COMEY SUGGESTING IN A VERY

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:16.093
RECKLESS WAY, YES IT ES POSSIBLE

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:19.363
SOME OF THESE MORE LURID SEX

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:20.931
ALLEGATIONS, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:22.366
ALIENS WILL POPULATE THE EARTH

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:23.801
OR DISCOVER GOLD UNDER THE

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.234
FOX NEWS BUILDING ON

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.236
SIXTH AVENUE.

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:27.604
HE IS IS COMING ACROSS AS

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.773
RECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE, AS

00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:31.308
SOMEONE WHO IN EVERY SINGLE WAY

00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:33.444
TRYING TO EXPLOIT THE

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:36.013
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HIS CACHET.

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:37.448
I THINK THAT IT IS, THIS IS

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:38.015
ADVANTAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP AS OF

00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.983
RIGHT NOW.

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:41.552
BRIAN: UNLIKE YOUR BOOK, YOUR

00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:43.287
MEMOIR LOOKING BACK AT YOUR

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:44.288
YEARS, HE HAS AN UNFOLDING

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.823
INVESTIGATION AND NEWS HAPPENING

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:49.960
WHILE HIS BOOK IS COMING OUT.

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:51.895
SO HE WANTS TO TALK TO ABOUT HIS

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:53.230
BOOK AND REFLECTIONS.

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.530
HE IS FORCED TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:56.333
NEWS.

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:58.235
JAKE TAPPER DID A GREAT JOB.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.535
BRET BAIER WILL BE BETTER NEXT

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.904
WEEK.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.607
HE ASKED HIM ABOUT PETER STRZOK.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:06.877
PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT,

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:08.145
TEXTING SOMEBODY, LED THE FBI

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.013
INVESTIGATION, TEXTING

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:10.414
DISPARAGING THINGS ABOUT THE

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.116
PRESIDENT.

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:13.083
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HE FEELS

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:14.284
THERE IS BIAS HERE?

00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:14.985
SURE I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED

00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.254
ABOUT THAT.

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.122
THAT IS THE REASON BOB MUELLER

00:03:17.388 --> 00:03:19.656
REMOVED PETER STRZOK.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:20.958
THAT IS THE MISSING THE POINT.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.393
THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE.

00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:24.094
HE TALKED TO HILLARY CLINTON.

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:25.662
HE TALKED TO MICHAEL FLYNN.

00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:27.498
HE WAS PART OF AN INVESTIGATION

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:29.466
LOOKING AT EMAILS BACK IN

00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:31.235
OCTOBER THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.036
RELEASED LATER THAT MONTH.

00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:35.672
PETER STRZOK WAS SOMEBODY ON THE

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.342
WRONG SIDE OF THIS.

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:39.710
&gt;&gt; PETER STRZOK, BRIAN, IS ALSO

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:41.445
EVIDENCE OF WHAT SEEMS TO BE,

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:44.348
AND I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE I

00:03:41.578 --> 00:03:46.450
HONOR THE FBI AND THE DOJ.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:50.087
THEY ARE THE IMPARTIAL ARBITERS

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:50.654
OF OUR FATE WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.922
AND ORDER, "CRIME AND

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:55.225
PUNISHMENT" BUT THERE DOES SEEM

00:03:52.055 --> 00:04:00.063
TO BE, AT LEAST THERE WAS, A

00:03:55.492 --> 00:04:01.432
STINK IN THESE INSTITUTIONS, AN

00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:03.066
ANTI-TRUMP STINK.

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.168
STRZOK ONE OF THE MOST VIVID

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.336
EXAMPLES OF THAT BUT AT SOME

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.571
POINT YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR ELF

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.575
IN THE PRESIDENT'S SHOES.

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:15.679
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL INCREDIBLY

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:16.980
POWERFUL COLLECTION OF FBI AGENT

00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:20.818
S AND ASSISTANT ATTORNEY

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:23.787
GENERALS AND SO FORTH WERE

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:25.189
ALMOST PRE-DETERMINED TO SINK

00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.658
YOUR POLITICAL FATE?

00:04:25.422 --> 00:04:28.025
IT REALLY SEEMS VERY, VERY

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.660
UNSAVORY.

00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:32.896
IF THE FLYNN THING, THE GENERAL

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:34.231
MICHAEL FLYNN THING, IS THE

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.865
STRONGEST EVIDENCE THEY HAVE OF

00:04:34.364 --> 00:04:37.000
OBSTRUCTION, THE PRESIDENT

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:39.236
SAYING TO COMEY, I HOPE YOU CAN

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:42.005
SEE YOUR WAY CLEAR TO LET THIS

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:43.907
THING GO, WHY CAN'T WE CONSTRUE

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.741
THAT AS IT MOST NATURALLY WOULD

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:46.109
BE CONSTRUED?

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:48.679
HERE IS WAR HERO.

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:49.012
HERE IS A MAN THAT SERVED HIS

00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:51.114
COUNTRY.

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:52.950
HERE IS A GUY WORRIED ABOUT HIS

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:54.384
OWN SON'S FATE, GENERAL FLYNN.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.220
CUT I AM SOME SLACK ON SOMETHING

00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:58.689
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

00:04:56.353 --> 00:05:01.058
AINSLEY: GERALDO, WHEN I READ

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:02.359
THROUGH THESE MEMOS, MOST OF OUR

00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:03.227
VIEWERS WILL NOT SIT DOWN TO

00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:06.330
READ THE PAGES.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.197
IT IS OUR JOB E JOB TO TELL THEM

00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:09.166
WHAT IS IN IT.

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:11.301
THREE MEETINGS, TWO AT TRUMP

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:11.602
TOWER AND ONE AT THE WHILE

00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:12.903
HOUSE.

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:13.904
A MEETING WITH REINCE PRIEBUS

00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:14.972
AND THREE PHONE CALLS WITH

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:16.807
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:18.375
I READ THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.409
THERE WAS THINGS THAT STOOD OUT.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.879
MOST OF THE INFORMATION OUT

00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:23.847
THERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:25.949
YOU MENTION THE STINK THING,

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.384
COMEY SAID HE DIDN'T LEAK IN THE

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:28.085
MEMO HE TOLD

00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:29.353
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS THAT HE

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:29.753
DID LEAK TO HIS FRIEND THE

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:31.788
REPORTER.

00:05:29.887 --> 00:05:33.490
HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:35.459
WENT BACK TO HIM AND SAID I

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:36.460
DIDN'T STAY IN THAT HOTEL ROOM

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:38.862
IN RUSSIA.

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:39.763
THAT DIRTY DOSSIER THING STOOD

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:40.898
OUT TO ME.

00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:42.132
YOU MENTIONED THE STINK PART.

00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:43.867
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID AFTER THE

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.268
FIRST MEETING IN THE

00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:48.138
THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.140
PLEASANT AT ALL TIME, WAS

00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:53.410
CHAOTIC, TOPICS TOUCHED,

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:55.379
RETURNING LATER MADE IT

00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:55.712
DIFFICULT TO RECOUNT IN LINEAR

00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:57.381
FASHION.

00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:58.949
IT WAS JIGSAW PUZZLES WITH

00:05:57.514 --> 00:05:59.216
PIECES PICKED UP AND RETURNED

00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.984
TO.

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.387
HE SAYS HE IS NOT POLITICAL.

00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:04.788
THAT SOUNDS EXTREMELY POLITICAL.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.322
SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS DISDAIN FOR

00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:07.357
THE PRESIDENT.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:08.892
IF HE WAS GOING TO GET FIRED HE

00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.459
WANTED THAT IN THERE FOR HIS

00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:11.328
BOOK.

00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:12.029
WHAT STRUCK YOU WHEN YOU READ

00:06:11.461 --> 00:06:15.732
THE MEMOS?

00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:16.099
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW ANSWER SY I FEEL

00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.701
SIMILARLY.

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:21.872
FIRST OF ALL THE MEMOS WERE A

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:22.205
CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF COVER YOUR

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:25.275
BEHIND.

00:06:23.874 --> 00:06:27.511
HE WANTED, EX POST FACTO, AFTER

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.812
THE FACT, TO RECREATE A

00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:30.080
SITUATION THAT REFLECTED MOST

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:32.249
NEGATIVELY ON THE PRESIDENT AND

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:35.786
MOST POSTIVELY ON JAMES COMEY.

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:37.621
HE KNEW THAT HIS DESTINY WAS

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.724
VERY FRAGILE, HIS STANDING WITH

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:42.459
THE FBI, VERY MUCH TENUOUS, VERY

00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:44.161
MUCH IN DOUBT BECAUSE OF THE

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:46.563
PRESIDENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM.

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:48.999
BUT FOR HIM TO WRITE THESE

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:49.433
THINGS DOWN, IT SEEMS SO

00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:51.001
SELF-SERVING.

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:54.271
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME ALMOST AS IF

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:57.674
HE WAS PENNING THE FIRST DRAFT

00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:58.075
OF THE BOOK THAT HAS NOW BEEN

00:06:57.808 --> 00:06:59.443
PUBLISHED.

00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:00.410
STEVE: YOU KNOW WHAT IS

00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:02.245
INTERESTING ABOUT THAT --

00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:04.047
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO NOBILITY IN JAMES

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.781
COMEY THE WAY I SEE IT RIGHT

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:06.650
NOW.

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.651
STEVE: HE TOOK NOTES OF HIS

00:07:06.783 --> 00:07:08.585
CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD TRUMP

00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:10.220
BUT NEVER TOOK NOTES WITH

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.088
HILLARY CLINTON OR BARACK OBAMA

00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:13.223
OR LORETTA LYNCH.

00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:15.425
ISN'T THAT IRONIC?
