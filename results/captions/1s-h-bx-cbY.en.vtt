00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.434
Even though yesterday

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:02.769
it might have sucked
for Hannity,

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.771
it helped his ratings,
because everyone tuned in

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.173
to see what creative excuse
he'd come up with

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.776
to explain
his Michael Cohen relationship.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.179
And the answer was,
it's complicated.

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.715
Let me set the record straight,
here's the truth:

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:19.185
Michael Cohen never represented
me in any legal matter.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.521
I never retained his services.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.122
I never received an invoice.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.591
I never paid Michael Cohen
for legal fees.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.062
I did have
occasional brief conversations

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.464
with Michael Cohen--
he's a great attorney--

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:33.132
about legal questions I had

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.602
where I was looking for input
and perspective.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.404
He-he wasn't your lawyer?

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.407
He just answered
your legal questions?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.877
How do you not know
the definition of "lawyer"

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.614
when your head
is shaped like a dictionary?

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:50.216
How do you not know this?

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.486
Seriously, giving legal input
and perspective

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.822
is exactly what a lawyer does.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.957
Hannity might as well
have come out and said,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.560
"He was just my lawyer
but just the tip.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.162
Just the tip, guys.
Just the tip."

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.898
Now, what-what people
are really wondering is this,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.835
whatever legal advice was,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.904
why didn't Hannity get it from
his regular attorney, right,

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:14.107
instead of turning to a guy
who's specifically known

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.641
for paying off mistresses?

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:16.976
Why did he go to him?

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.111
But, according to Hannity,

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.413
baby, this is
not what it looks like.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.684
To be absolutely clear,
they never involved any matter,

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.220
any-- sorry to disappoint
so many--

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.889
matter between me,
a third party,

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.691
a third group at all.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.560
And our... my questions
exclusively almost focused

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:35.895
on real estate.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.697
Wow, he really slipped
in the "almost" there.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.865
Did you hear it? Yeah?

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.266
It was super quick.
It was super quick.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.135
He was like, "All my questions
to Michael Cohen

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.736
"were exclusively almost
real estate.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.872
Exclusively almost.
Exclusively almost."

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.740
Yeah, he sounds like the voice
at the end of those medical ads.

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.876
"Zyrnax is exclusively
almost side effect-free.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.043
Exclusively almost."

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.245
You can't say
"exclusively almost."

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.180
"Exclusively almost"
is the kind of phrase

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:55.581
that makes people ask
more questions.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.251
If someone tells you that
they exclusively almost have sex

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.786
with adults, you're not hiring
them to babysit your kids.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.055
That's not what you're thinking
of right now.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.591
But, okay, fine,
okay, fine, Hannity claims

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.127
he was just getting some
informal real estate advice

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.197
from Michael Cohen, which makes
what he said a few hours earlier

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.367
on his radio show
all the more confusing.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:26.846
Okay, okay.
Okay, whoa, whoa. No, no.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.782
So he's not your lawyer.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:32.718
All you had was a few chitchats
about real estate,

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.554
but you definitely want
attorney-client privilege.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.755
Yeah, you definitely want that.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.090
What the... did you bury
under that house?

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.626
No, I'm just saying,
I've had a lot of conversations

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.562
about real estate.
At the end of it,

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.665
I never went,
"This never happened."

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.236
And, you know, what gets me
is-is how casually

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.372
Hannity is trying to minimize
his connection to Michael Cohen,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.575
like it means nothing,
especially when,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.510
every other day of the year,

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:00.313
he's the guy who can bake
a conspiracy cake out

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.349
of nothing more than an egg
and the word "Hillary."

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.986
Let's talk about a family
responsible for actual crimes.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.622
We'll call it the head of
the notorious political cabal,

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.058
of course,
Bill and Hillary Clinton,

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.626
the Clinton crime family.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.894
If we're gonna go
to crime families,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.630
let's look
at the Mueller crime family.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:20.366
And, well, this is near and dear
to Comey's heart.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.535
We'll call it
"The Comey Crime Family."

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:23.970
I like
how Hannity puts a question mark

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.405
at the of each one
just to cover his ass.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:29.308
He's like, "I didn't say
Mueller runs a crime family.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.711
I just said,
'Mueller runs a crime family?'"

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.713
(laughter)

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.248
Well, you know what, folks?

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.284
I have a theory of my own,
and I-I honestly think

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.785
that it's gonna bust this whole

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:42.054
Hannity-Michael Cohen story
wide open.

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:44.924
Get ready
to have your minds blown because

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.727
I believe... I've uncovered

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.364
a complex criminal network.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.366
My theory is

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.835
that Sean Hannity is a client...

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.937
of Michael Cohen.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.173
(laughter)

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:04.611
(cheers and applause)

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:13.686
Look, we may never know
the true nature

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.755
of Hannity
and Cohen's relationship,

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:20.159
but what we do know is that
as someone is discussing Cohen

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:21.727
and his case on the air,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.863
Hannity should have been
more transparent, right?

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.464
He should have said something
about it.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.233
In fact,
what Hannity did was so shady,

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.969
even when he tried to talk
about other things on his show,

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:32.004
his own guests had
to call him out.

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:33.873
And please do enjoy.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.941
A foreign national using, uh,

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:38.644
Russian sources,
of all things, to get it--

00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:41.013
is that a crime
in Alan Dershowitz's book?

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:43.616
Well, first of all, uh,
Sean, I do want to say

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.384
that I really think

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.421
that you should have disclosed
your relationship

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:52.458
with, uh, Cohen when you talked
about him on this show.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.794
I think it would have been,
uh, much, much better

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.062
had you disclosed
that relationship.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.396
You were in a difficult
situation, obviously.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:58.798
If you understand
the nature of it, Professor.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.066
-Yeah. Yeah. -I'm gonna deal
with this later in the show.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.534
-Yeah. No, I understand.
-It was minimal.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.802
I put out a statement about it.

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:03.936
I know. I understand.
You should have said that,

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.338
and that would have been fair
to say

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.206
-that it was minimal. Look,
you were... -That's fine...

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.607
You had the right, by the way,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.910
-not to have your identity
revealed. -I do, don't I? I have

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.645
-the right to privacy. I do.
-Right, but, you know,

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:14.647
it's a complex situation. When
you're speaking to millions of

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.516
-people, I think you should...
-It was such a minor...

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.452
Professor,
it was such a minor relationship

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.053
-in terms of that it had to...
-You should have said that.

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:23.756
"You-you should have said that.
You should have said that."

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.758
(applause and cheering)

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.793
"You should have said that."

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:30.496
(applause and cheering continue)

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.797
That was priceless.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.733
And keep in mind,
this guy Alan Dershowitz--

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.735
he isn't...
he isn't a hater, right?

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.603
He's been a vocal defender
of President Trump

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:39.505
and a frequent guest
on Hannity's show.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:41.707
That's how you know
that this is bad for Hannity.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.343
He's getting called out
by someone on his own team.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.213
You know what
this reminded me of? It's, uh...

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.915
It reminded me of the one
deleted scene from Star Wars

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:52.818
when the stormtroopers
called out their boss.

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.288
Now we can finally destroy
the rebels.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.257
Sir, real quick.
We all think

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.792
you should have disclosed
your relationship

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.028
-with Luke Skywalker.
-What?

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:06.332
I barely know the guy.
He's not even my son.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.001
It's more like
a baby-mama thing.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.637
Sir, sir,
you should have told us.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.307
This isn't a big deal. Ugh!
I have a right to privacy!

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.145
If it wasn't a big deal,
why didn't he tell us?

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:20.613
STORMTROOPER #2:
What a dick.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.148
(laughter)

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.783
Yeah, it's true.
That scene was exclusively

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.282
almost from Star Wars.
