I'm going to give a gift
to myself right now.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.842
I'm going to enjoy this
montage of baby animals

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.509
doing adorable things.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:11.778
[music - justin bieber, "baby"]

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.781
--thought you'd
always be mine, mine.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:19.252
Baby, baby, baby, always.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.254
Baby, baby, baby, no.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:26.726
Like baby, baby, baby, oh.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.228
Thought you'd always be mine.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.698
I'm gone.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:36.202
Now I'm all gone.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.671
Now I'm all gone.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:43.643
Gone, gone, I'm gone.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.643
Yeah!

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:52.117
[applause]

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:55.188
Why do baby goats have to jump
like that, with all four legs?

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.790
It makes me want one so bad.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.225
Just-- all four.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.760
OK.
