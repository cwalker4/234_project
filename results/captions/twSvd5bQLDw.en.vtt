00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:17.864
Thanks, man.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.654
I'm excited about being here.
We're going to have some fun.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:21.934
My name is Michael Jr.

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:23.784
I'm going to do some jokes.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:25.968
(Laughter)

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:28.149
(Applause)

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.686
Yet, at the same time,
I’d like to explain to you how life

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:35.292
well, how comedy works.

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.987
So let's stop right here.

00:00:36.988 --> 00:00:39.878
I actually like the city of Reno a lot.

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:41.665
I was here once...

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.121
(Applause)

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.237
I was here once;

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:47.010
I was keynote speaking for a corporation

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:50.013
and something really kind of strange
happened when I was here.

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:53.103
Normally, I'm the type of person
I like to be on a stage alone.

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:54.853
I don't need any help or anybody...

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:58.823
So this CEO of this large company
introduces me, and he has the microphone,

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:03.123
and normally, we have two different mics,
and he leaves, and then, I'm there.

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:04.382
That's the plan.

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:05.993
Dude stays there.

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:07.572
(Laughter)

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:10.303
I'm standing right next to him
with no mic.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:11.573
(Laughter)

00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:15.574
And then he looks at the audience,
and I'm standing there, and he says...

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.535
First, let me explain this.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.598
I'm the type of comedian,
like, I'm observational.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.838
I pay attention to things
like college students.

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.668
Take someone who goes to a nice school

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:26.743
like the University
of Southern California.

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:29.663
Ask them what school they go to,
you get a nice quick answer,

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:31.294
- "What school you go to?"
- "USC."

00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:33.673
New York University -
you get a nice quick answer,

00:01:33.674 --> 00:01:35.323
- "What school you go to?"
- "NYU."

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.353
Ask somebody who goes
to community college.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:39.633
You get a much longer
response, don't you?

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:40.726
(Laughter)

00:01:40.727 --> 00:01:41.975
"What school you go to?"

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:46.465
"Well, see, right now, what I'm doing,
I'm gonna get a couple credits, right?

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.925
Then my financial aid
is supposed to come through.

00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:50.555
Then I'm gonna transfer, man.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:52.843
They say school kills creativity anyway.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:55.453
Man, I feel vulnerable.
Is Brené Brown around?

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.528
Man, I feel very vulnerable right now."

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.079
(Laughter)

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.155
Let me tell you a little more about me.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.385
I love being a dad.

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:07.255
And I have five kids, yeah.

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:09.455
And I travel a lot

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:10.930
so I can see them all.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.291
(Laughter)

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.512
Ha, ha! I'm just playing.
I don't see them, I don't see them.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.182
(Laughter)

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:22.692
No, I do. I have five kids.
They're all with me.

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:24.073
I live in Dallas now.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:25.545
My kids are awesome.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:27.432
The thing about having a big family is

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.762
you always have
to figure out ways to save money.

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.842
We wanted to get
our family pictures taken,

00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:33.291
and that stuff was expensive.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:37.186
So what we did to save money was
we all got in the front seat of the car,

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:39.293
looked both ways, and ran a red light.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.183
That's what we did.
That's what we did.

00:02:41.184 --> 00:02:43.224
(Laughter)

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.492
Two weeks later,
the picture came in the mail.

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:46.813
(Laughter)

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:49.217
But my son blinked

00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:51.477
so we had to do it again,
we had to do it again.

00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:52.607
This stuff is crazy.

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:54.727
(Laughter)

00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:57.068
I was doing that joke in prison recently.

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:00.617
I wasn't in prison,
like, "Hey, I'm funny. Get off me!"

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:01.947
It wasn't like that.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.283
(Laughter)

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.592
Whenever we're doing a big live event
- like we're doing one tonight in Reno -

00:03:07.593 --> 00:03:10.502
whenever we do a large ticketed event,
a concert, in a city,

00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:14.186
we always look for a homeless shelter,
a prison, an abused children's facility

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:16.026
to go to during the day to do comedy.

00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:18.036
So I'm so I'm doing a prison this time...

00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:19.056
(Applause)

00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:21.176
It's a TEDx talk,
I don't got that much time.

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:22.678
You don't got to clap, it's OK.

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.159
(Laughter)

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:29.138
So we're doing this prison,
and I do the joke about the red light,

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.148
and 75% of the prisoners laughed;

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.319
the rest of them... nothing.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.498
Then I realized what was going on.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.898
Some of them had been locked up so long,

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.229
the dude next to them
had to explain the joke.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.286
He was like, "See, nowadays,
when you run a red light,

00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:45.606
they send a picture
with the ticket in the mail."

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:47.646
Then he looked at the dude next to him,

00:03:47.647 --> 00:03:50.985
"A red light is what they use for traffic
when you go down the road."

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:52.325
(Laughter)

00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:54.875
And then he said,
"A road is what they use..."

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:55.960
(Laughter)

00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:57.100
Wow!

00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:58.941
Where am I at right now, man?

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.382
So I'd like to explain to you
how comedy works.

00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:05.652
This is how comedy works;
really all comedy.

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:09.136
Any time you laugh, this formula
is taking place in one way or another,

00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:12.826
but specifically, with regards
to stand-up, this is how it works as well.

00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:16.298
First, there's a setup,
and then, there's a punchline.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.620
Let me explain.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.764
The setup is when a comedian
will use his talents and resources

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.064
to seize any opportunity

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:26.495
to ensure that you, the audience,
are moving in the same direction.

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:29.185
The punchline occurs
when he changes that direction

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:30.619
in a way you're not expecting.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.719
When you catch on to this change,
you've received the punchline.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.164
The results are revelation, fulfillment,
and joy expressed through laughter.

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:39.314
(Laughter)

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:40.715
Let me give you an example.

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:46.435
A few summers ago, I took my family
on vacation to Mexico.

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:48.844
The first two days were rough

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:51.844
because the people there
kept calling me a "Negro."

00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:54.421
The third day, I realized
they were saying "amigo,"

00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:56.471
and it was all cool; that was cool, so...

00:04:56.472 --> 00:04:58.089
(Laughter)

00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:03.728
Did you see what just happened
right there?

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:04.859
(Laughter)

00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:11.350
So when I was a child, I used
to struggle with my reading.

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.860
I used to really have a hard time reading.

00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.012
I don't know, I just struggled with it.

00:05:16.013 --> 00:05:17.482
I read now just fine;

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.823
like the signs over the door
that say 'exite, ' I can read that stuff.

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:22.693
(Laughter)

00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:25.393
But when I was a kid,
I used to struggle with my reading.

00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:28.353
I couldn't sound a word out
phonetically, it just didn't work.

00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:32.743
So now, looking back at it, I realize
I developed seven different ways

00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:35.113
to look at a word
to determine what the word was.

00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:37.803
And I just started noticing this
really in junior high.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.713
So I would look at the font size,
the color, the positioning,

00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:43.913
what's in front of it, what's behind it,
how people responded to it.

00:05:43.914 --> 00:05:46.263
I got really good at
looking at words differently

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:49.643
to the point in high school,
people didn't know I wasn't really reading

00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:51.843
I was just working it out
really, really fast.

00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:53.553
Now as an adult, I read just fine,

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:57.473
but I still have this ability to look
at words, and people, and situations

00:05:57.474 --> 00:05:59.483
seven different ways almost immediately.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:03.074
In fact, it's the primary place
where I pull my comedy from.

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:06.625
So that very thing from my past
that looked like it was a setback,

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:08.825
looked like it was some sort of handicap,

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:13.715
turns out I'm actually able to use it
for what I'm called to do now.

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:17.093
So just like you, you've probably
had some sort of setbacks,

00:06:17.394 --> 00:06:19.533
but if you, in a way, would embrace it,

00:06:19.534 --> 00:06:22.343
you'll probably find there's
more opportunities out there.

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:24.236
Now I find comedy all over the place.

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:25.246
At the airport today:

00:06:25.247 --> 00:06:27.946
little white kid walked up to me,
asked for an autograph.

00:06:27.947 --> 00:06:31.036
I was like, "Hey buddy, what's your name?"
He said, "I'm Tanner."

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:33.093
I looked at him, I said, "No, you're not."

00:06:33.094 --> 00:06:34.544
(Laughter)

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:40.571
His mom was cracking up.

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:41.901
He was like, "I am Tanner!"

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.537
(Laughter)

00:06:43.538 --> 00:06:45.607
"No. Trust me. You're not."

00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:46.688
(Laughter)

00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:52.510
Or I'll notice stuff; I saw this dude
with a muscle shirt on.

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.450
You ever see a dude
with a muscle shirt, like a white tank,

00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.000
but he ain't got no muscles?

00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:58.051
(Laughter)

00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:00.111
What is that? A wife threatener?

00:07:00.112 --> 00:07:01.302
(Laughter)

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:06.314
Depending on
where you're from in the country,

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:08.054
you'll understand that joke better.

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:09.920
(Laughter)

00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:11.880
And his friend had on a shirt that said,

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:14.540
"If you don't speak English,
leave the country."

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.370
Hmm... but it was written
in English. So...

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.701
(Laughter)

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.079
So I walked up to him,
and I said, "You're dumb!"

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.212
(Laughter)

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.922
But I said it in Spanish though
so he wouldn't know...

00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:32.373
(Laughter)

00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.810
So I'm able to find comedy
in a bunch of different places

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:40.380
as a result of embracing what seemed
like it was a handicap from my past.

00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:42.320
I notice even what people say sometimes.

00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.810
Have you ever heard the phrase,

00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:46.362
"Boy, I wish I could've been
a fly on the wall"?

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:49.167
Every time I hear that,
I walk up to the person, and I say,

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.457
"And then what?"

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:51.597
(Laughter)

00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:52.758
No, no, no, no.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.288
You want to be a fly on the wall

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.908
so you could hear the information
that was in the room.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.348
Well, I've done the research.

00:07:58.349 --> 00:07:59.798
Hmm... Flies don't have ears.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:00.821
(Laughter)

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:01.841
Yeah.

00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:04.241
You would be just as ignorant
as you currently are

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:05.462
(Laughter)

00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:07.861
but you would be a fly.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.141
(Laughter)

00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:12.050
Nobody even listens to a fly.

00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:13.093
(Laughter)

00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:15.646
I mean, let's say you're
a fly that could read lips.

00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:17.836
What are you going to do
with the information?

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:18.990
(Laughter)

00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:20.590
And you've got two days to live.

00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:21.790
(Laughter)

00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:23.392
You're making bad choices.

00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:24.713
(Laughter)

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:29.078
Or people will say stuff to me like,

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.129
"Michael Jr., where you from originally?"

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.659
I'm like, "Originally? Huh.
Well, I was conceived in Michigan."

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.039
(Laughter)

00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.620
"Before that, I was in my dad."

00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:38.711
(Laughter)

00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:39.740
Yeah.

00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.962
(Laughter)

00:08:42.062 --> 00:08:44.350
"And then, there was
a swim competition," right?

00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:45.561
(Laughter)

00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:48.570
"And I won, which is crazy"

00:08:48.571 --> 00:08:49.785
(Laughter)

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.776
"because currently, I don't swim at all."

00:08:51.777 --> 00:08:53.027
(Laughter)

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.464
I used to be pretty good
though, apparently.

00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:57.595
(Laughter)

00:08:58.515 --> 00:08:59.914
I am not politically correct.

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:03.374
I'm just going to tell: I know
I do comedy, but it's just too much work.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:04.474
I'm just telling you.

00:09:04.475 --> 00:09:06.824
You have to watch the news
and know the language.

00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:10.294
If you put the right stuff in your heart,
the right stuff will come out.

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:12.934
So I never tried,
I never try to be politically correct.

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:13.994
Some people work hard.

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:17.114
I'm at a coffee shop; a white guy
in front of me orders a coffee.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.714
The lady in front of him
is like, "How do you want it?"

00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:22.854
He looked back at me and was like,
"Um, African-American please."

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:24.265
(Laughter)

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.449
I was like, "Cool.
Let me get the Caucasian Mocha.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.129
Let me get that if I could...

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.989
just get the Caucasian Mocha, I guess.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.029
I'm trying to learn, I'm trying to learn."

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.340
(Laughter)

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:41.694
Coaches would say some stuff too.

00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:43.697
Ever hear your coach say something like,

00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:46.570
"The stuff I'm teaching here,
it's not just about this game,

00:09:46.571 --> 00:09:48.084
You could apply it to life."

00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:50.771
Here's the thing, people:
that's not true.

00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:52.800
I thought it was true.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.190
Straight out of high school,

00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:56.430
one of my first jobs was...
I used to park cars.

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:59.621
One of the cars was really nice
so I took it for a little spin.

00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:02.291
The company found out,
and my boss lost the account.

00:10:02.292 --> 00:10:04.011
He was yelling at me and screaming

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:05.611
I didn't know what to say or do.

00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:07.933
I thought back
to my high school football coach.

00:10:07.934 --> 00:10:11.314
I looked at my boss, and I was like,
"You know what, man?

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:14.055
You win some, you lose some, man."

00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:15.546
(Laughter)

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.725
"You can't let this one loss
get you down."

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:19.998
(Laughter)

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:22.908
"The important thing is
I went out there, and I had fun.”

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:24.709
(Laughter)

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.950
(Applause)

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:30.401
Then I got fired, man.
I got fired right away.

00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:31.592
(Laughter)

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:35.678
Actually, I do play some basketball.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:38.252
I didn't want to perpetuate
stereotypes, but it's true.

00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:39.752
(Laughter)

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:42.142
But in basketball,
you're supposed to run and jump.

00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:44.432
I don't really feel like
doing both all the time.

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:46.883
So some friends recently
took me ball hunting.

00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:49.921
Some people call it golf or whatever.

00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:51.142
(Laughter)

00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:56.518
I shot a 121.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.178
That’s what I shot, a 121;

00:10:58.179 --> 00:10:59.248
and then we had lunch.

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:02.328
And it was like, "Hey. We're gonna do
the other nine holes now."

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.228
(Laughter)

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:07.258
I said, "I'm not going back
out there, I'm not going."

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:08.998
Because they lied to get me to go.

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.938
They’re like, "The greens are awesome.”

00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:13.408
I was like, "Cool,"
I showed up with some cornbread.

00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:14.708
I was like, "All right ..."

00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:16.017
(Laughter)

00:11:16.817 --> 00:11:18.966
I don’t know how to say
cornbread in German.

00:11:18.967 --> 00:11:19.967
I'm sorry.

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:22.227
I just did that just for Germany.

00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:24.048
I've never really been there before.

00:11:25.068 --> 00:11:26.797
I do think working out is important.

00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:28.718
I was at the gym the other month.

00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:32.086
I was going to do some cardio, right?

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:33.446
But they moved it upstairs.

00:11:33.447 --> 00:11:35.206
I ain't going up there, man, please.

00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:36.806
(Laughter)

00:11:36.807 --> 00:11:39.153
And I get recognized at the gym.
I got recognized.

00:11:39.154 --> 00:11:41.553
I'm working out,
this lady was like: (Gasping).

00:11:41.554 --> 00:11:42.703
I said, "How you doing?"

00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:46.223
She said, "You don't understand
Michael Jr.! You're my favorite comedian.

00:11:46.224 --> 00:11:48.283
Every time I see you,
I laugh my butt off."

00:11:48.284 --> 00:11:49.964
I was like, "Uh... Keep laughing!"

00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:52.190
Keep laughing."

00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:53.411
(Laughter)

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:00.538
So there's a club in Los Angeles.

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.348
When I moved to Los Angeles,
and I was brand new in comedy,

00:12:03.349 --> 00:12:06.579
there's a club there that it's
like the best club in the country.

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:09.618
It's called the "Comedy and Magic Club."
It's in Hermosa Beach.

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:12.268
This club is extremely hard
for a comedian to get into.

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:14.099
The way I got into this club is

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:16.964
a guy named George Wallace
saw me when I lived in New York.

00:12:16.965 --> 00:12:18.439
He knew I was funny and clean

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.849
so when I moved to Los Angeles,
he took me to the Comedy and Magic Club.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.129
Now he couldn't get me on stage,
it's way too prestigious of a club.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.609
They have to know who you are.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.396
So he got me into the green room.

00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:31.443
I'm in the green room
and suddenly, brand new in town,

00:12:31.444 --> 00:12:34.413
and I find myself in a green room
with some soldiers in comedy.

00:12:34.414 --> 00:12:37.673
There's George Wallace,
Garry Shandling, Jay Leno.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.113
I'm brand new in town.

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:42.429
And at the time, a football player
got hit in the eye with a flag,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.229
and he lost his vision in one eye,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.729
and he was suing the league
for 400 million dollars.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.629
Now, all of these guys are helping
Leno on that joke subject

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.096
for the monologue
for "The Tonight Show" on NBC.

00:12:52.097 --> 00:12:54.016
I ain't saying nothing.

00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:57.764
I'm just happy to be in the room
sharing french fries with these dudes.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.280
But your gift will make room for you.

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:02.682
So then, they got quiet,
and they all looked at me,

00:13:02.683 --> 00:13:04.582
and I'm thinking, "Oh, snap!

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.103
This is an opportunity."

00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:08.053
I said, "Let's see if I got this right.

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:11.103
He got hit in the eye with a flag,
he lost his vision in one eye,

00:13:11.104 --> 00:13:13.604
and he's suing the league
for 400 million dollars.

00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:16.392
He’s not gonna see half of it."

00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:17.682
(Laughter)

00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:25.713
Like, for real.

00:13:25.714 --> 00:13:26.755
(Laughter)

00:13:27.485 --> 00:13:28.555
So here's the thing:

00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:31.514
how did I get that joke that fast
under that much pressure?

00:13:31.515 --> 00:13:34.323
The truth is it wasn't
as much pressure as you might think

00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:36.613
because I'd been practicing
since I was a child

00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:39.323
in the form of a kid
who was having a hard time reading.

00:13:39.324 --> 00:13:41.663
I was practicing just like
you've been practicing;

00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:43.703
you just didn't know you were practicing.

00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:45.963
I'm here to let you know
you've been practicing.

00:13:45.964 --> 00:13:47.964
And for a lot of you, guys,
it's game time.

00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:49.832
It's game time.

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:53.649
So now, I'm in the club;
and I'm performing there.

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:56.244
This is probably
like seven, eight years ago.

00:13:56.245 --> 00:13:57.614
I'm headlining at the club,

00:13:57.615 --> 00:13:59.174
and right before I got on stage,

00:13:59.175 --> 00:14:01.274
I had a change in mindset about comedy.

00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:03.475
Most of the time
when a comedian gets onstage,

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.197
he wants to get laughs from people.

00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:06.927
And I felt a shift take place:

00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:09.497
Instead of going up there
to get laughs from people,

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:12.537
I felt like I was supposed
to give them an opportunity to laugh.

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:14.727
I did a little prayer,
and I clearly felt like

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.969
I was supposed to give
an opportunity to laugh.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.229
This changed everything.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.989
Because now I'm not looking to take;

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.169
I'm simply looking for
an opportunity to give.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.829
This is why we go to homeless shelters
and these places.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.149
In fact, that very night
when I leave the stage,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.939
I'm outside, people want autographs,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.859
we're hanging out taking pictures,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.199
and I look across the street,
and I saw a homeless guy.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.990
I had never seen a homeless guy
outside this club before ever.

00:14:38.271 --> 00:14:40.470
But that doesn't mean
he wasn't there before.

00:14:40.471 --> 00:14:44.900
That just means before,
my mindset was to get laughs from people,

00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:46.461
so why would I even notice him?

00:14:46.634 --> 00:14:49.383
But now I changed my mindset,
and I see this homeless guy,

00:14:49.384 --> 00:14:51.376
and I have the thought, "What about him?

00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:53.593
How could I give him
an opportunity to laugh?"

00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:56.503
And that's when we started doing
homeless shelters and prisons

00:14:56.504 --> 00:15:00.504
and making laughter commonplace
in non-common places.

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:03.869
So now, as a result of doing that,

00:15:05.553 --> 00:15:08.393
we went to this one place,
we went to Montrose, Colorado.

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.928
It's an abuse facility for children
who were being abused by their parents.

00:15:12.929 --> 00:15:14.678
And I'm hearing all these stories,

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.918
and this grandmother told us
about her grandson

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:20.018
who was so afraid of his mom
who's on drugs and been abusing him.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.418
One of the things she's been doing
is she was pulling out his toenails.

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:24.680
So I hear this story,

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:27.428
and they bring all these kids inside.

00:15:27.429 --> 00:15:29.058
And Spiderman is sitting right up.

00:15:29.059 --> 00:15:30.988
This little boy is so afraid of his mom,

00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:33.275
everywhere he goes,
he wears a Spiderman costume.

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:35.390
He's sitting right up front at the show.

00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:38.109
If my mindset was still
to get laughs from people,

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.509
there's no way I would've been able
to do the show.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.750
But my mindset changed;

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.660
so now, I have to do the show.

00:15:46.023 --> 00:15:47.312
So I get up on stage,

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.712
and people start laughing
slowly but surely.

00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:52.512
Twenty minutes in it,
I hear a voice come from right here,

00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:54.672
and the voice says, "My name is Ronan.”

00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:56.592
And this little boy pulls off his mask,

00:15:56.593 --> 00:15:58.693
introduces himself to me.

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:01.653
And I can't even tell you
what it meant to me.

00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:03.965
He started talking to me
for like nine minutes,

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:06.205
like I wasn't doing
a comedy show at the time.

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:07.863
(Laughter)

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:10.113
But it was all because I made this shift.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.550
I made this change,

00:16:12.551 --> 00:16:13.680
and I say it simply.

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:14.970
Instead of trying to get,

00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:17.450
I'm going to see if there's
an opportunity to give.

00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.000
If you can make this adjustment,

00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:20.860
it will change your life for the good.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:21.930
If you're a mechanic,

00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:24.050
you may think
you get paid to fix vehicles.

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:25.540
But if you can make this shift,

00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:29.150
you will recognize you help people
reach their desired destination.

00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:32.061
That will put your alarm clock
out of business.

00:16:32.528 --> 00:16:33.567
My senses are

00:16:33.568 --> 00:16:36.668
there's a lot of people out there
still hitting the snooze button.

00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:38.740
Before I bounce

00:16:38.741 --> 00:16:40.770
- bounce means to vacate the premises -

00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:42.010
(Laughter)

00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:44.181
I’d like to explain to you how life works,

00:16:44.531 --> 00:16:46.871
at least from a comedian’s perspective.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.330
First, there's a setup,

00:16:50.285 --> 00:16:51.944
and then there's a punchline.

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:55.434
Your setup is your talents,
your resources, and your opportunities.

00:16:55.435 --> 00:16:57.444
And most of the time, we use our setup

00:16:57.445 --> 00:17:02.274
to ensure that the people around us
are moving in a direction that serves us.

00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:03.864
Which means the punchline occurs

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:06.904
when you change that direction
in a way they're not expecting.

00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:09.834
You actually use your setup
for other people.

00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:13.444
The results are the same, yet multiply:
revelation, fulfillment, and joy.

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.394
But it's not just for the one
receiving your punch line;

00:17:16.395 --> 00:17:19.565
it is absolutely for you
as you deliver the punch line.

00:17:20.618 --> 00:17:23.877
In fact, if I ask the question
to everyone here, everyone watching,

00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:25.679
if I ask you this question,

00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:29.548
"How many people here
know what your setup is?"

00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:32.347
Every one of you would be able to tell me.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.399
Because your setup is the fact
that you have a house, a car,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.309
you've been married, you went to school.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.283
Your setup is about what you've received.

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:43.444
But what if I asked the question,
"What is your punchline?”

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:48.203
Because your punchline is about
what you’re called to deliver.

00:17:48.204 --> 00:17:50.933
And if you only know your setup
and not your punchline,

00:17:50.934 --> 00:17:54.743
you'll make the mistake
of trying to add more setup.

00:17:54.744 --> 00:17:56.783
"If I could just get another degree,"

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.323
"if I could just get married,"

00:17:58.324 --> 00:17:59.823
"if I could just lose weight,"

00:17:59.824 --> 00:18:03.294
but what you really need
is to know your punchline.

00:18:04.547 --> 00:18:06.846
Because to know your setup
and not your punchline

00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:08.537
is an uncomfortable place to live.

00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:10.712
Let me give you an example.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:15.209
How many people are still thinking about
the story of me and the CEO on stage?

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:19.978
The reason all you guys are
still thinking about that story

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:22.079
is because all you have is the setup;

00:18:23.115 --> 00:18:24.984
you don't have the punchline.

00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:26.605
Yet, we've moved on

00:18:27.035 --> 00:18:29.695
and allowed ourselves to be entertained

00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:33.414
like there wasn't something missing.

00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:37.414
So we'll go to a comedy show,
or a football game, or a concert

00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:40.105
even though there's something missing.

00:18:40.475 --> 00:18:43.295
And that's just the story
I told you ten minutes ago.

00:18:43.745 --> 00:18:45.635
What about your story?

00:18:46.273 --> 00:18:50.083
You've been living it your entire life,
and if all you know is the setup,

00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.490
and not the punchline,

00:18:51.491 --> 00:18:53.626
you’re living in an uncomfortable place.

00:18:53.627 --> 00:18:54.796
And please be clear.

00:18:54.797 --> 00:18:57.226
Just like when I had
a hard time reading as a child,

00:18:57.227 --> 00:18:59.496
your setbacks are part of your setup

00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:02.301
so you can deliver the punchline
you’re called to deliver.

00:19:02.936 --> 00:19:06.006
Much like a slingshot,
the further you've been set back,

00:19:06.489 --> 00:19:08.699
the further you're going to reach.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.345
But what are you going to aim for?

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:15.107
Everyone has a setup,

00:19:15.617 --> 00:19:17.497
and everyone has a punchline.

00:19:18.477 --> 00:19:20.307
You need to find your punchline

00:19:20.936 --> 00:19:21.936
and deliver it.

00:19:22.316 --> 00:19:23.425
I'm Michael Jr.

00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:24.485
I love you.

00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:25.645
(Applause)

00:19:25.646 --> 00:19:26.755
Thank you guys.

00:19:26.756 --> 00:19:28.007
Aw, you guys are awesome.

00:19:28.008 --> 00:19:29.017
Standing ovation!

00:19:29.018 --> 00:19:30.067
Thank you so much.

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.118
Thank you, thank you!

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:33.378
(Applause)

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:34.693
Get up, dude! You too!

00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:35.750
I'm just playing.

00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:36.773
Thank you.

00:19:36.774 --> 00:19:38.346
(Applause)
