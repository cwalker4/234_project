HAND OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL

EVENTUALLY DECIDE IF HE CAN BE
INDICTED.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.212

SMART MOVE:  SAY WHO SHE IS,

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:57.263 size:84% position:42%
THEN WAIT FOR HER TO STAWND
BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGING HER.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:05:00.633 align:start position:0%

THIS EVENING IS NOT A REPUBLICAN

AGENDA OR A DEMOCRAT AGENDA.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:22.054 align:start position:0%
IT'S THE AGENDA OF THE AMERICAN
