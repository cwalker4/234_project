00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.602
-Before we get started
with this, I just want to say

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:04.738
the President
started a press conference

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.806
at around 5:00 tonight.
We tape at 6:30.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.207
It was still going on
when we started,

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.810
and so I just want to thank,
in advance,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.378
everybody who works
on "A Closer Look,"

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.380
because they were pulling clips

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.049
right up to when
I walked out here, so...

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:20.854
If this looks crazy, one,
it already was crazy,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.788
two, it's because
it was doing it in realtime.

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.123
So here we go.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.792
President Trump just held
a crazy solo press conference

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.828
in New York where he defended
his Supreme Court nominee

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.197
Brett Kavanaugh from
sexual-assault allegations.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.733
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:38.437
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.741
Trump, of course, lies freely
to his adoring fans

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.309
at rallies and on Fox News.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.811
But yesterday,
at the United Nations,

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.614
we saw what happens when
he steps outside his bubble.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.183
He repeated a ludicrous
campaign talking point,

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.051
and the crowd laughed at him.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.121
-In less than two years,
my administration

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:59.959
has accomplished more than
almost any administration

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.196
in the history of our country.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.732
America's --
So true.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:10.603
[ Laughter ]

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.606
Didn't expect that reaction,
but that's okay.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.874
[ Laughter ]

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:18.111
-He had no idea
what he was saying was funny.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.512
[ Laughter ]

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.514
It's like he's been playing
for the Harlem Globetrotters

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.882
his whole life,
and suddenly

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.784
they're playing against
the Golden State Warriors.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:25.784
[ Laughter ]

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:27.186
"What do you mean
technical foul?

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.055
I always use this ladder."

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.124
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:36.462
Now the U.N....

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.698
The U.N. used to be
a solemn, dignified place,

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.467
and now Trump has turned it into
the studio audience

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.369
from "Married...with Children."

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.137
From now on,
all of Trump's speeches

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:47.440
should come
with a sitcom disclaimer.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:51.710
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.780
It's such a bummer
to watch world leaders

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.248
sit around and laugh at us.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.816
I just wish somebody
would run for President

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.618
promising to do something
about it.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.253
-The world is laughing at us.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.022
The world is laughing at us.
They think we're stupid.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.658
They think our representatives
don't know what they're doing.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.693
They laugh at us
behind our back.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:08.928
-See? He fixed it.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:12.665
Now, instead of
laughing behind his back,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.567
they laugh right in his face.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.835
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:19.304
But Trump, of course...

00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:21.507
Trump cannot abide
being humiliated

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.976
or exposed as the liar he is,
so later in the day,

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.411
when he was asked
about the laughter,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.046
he made
this preposterous claim --

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.948
he meant to get laughed at.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.454
-Oh.
It was meant to get laughter?

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.657
So you've been
doing that joke for two years,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.158
and the first time
it ever worked

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.593
was at the U.N.?
[ Laughter ]

00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:43.630
"You guys are a great audience.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.932
My usual crowd
doesn't get that one."

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.701
That was not
meant to get laughter.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.236
Trump's like
the kid at the sleepover

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.438
who wakes up with his hand
in warm water and says,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.340
"Oh, good.
I meant to pee my pants."

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.544
[ Laughter ]

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:00.746
But this incident
was a deeply revealing look

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.448
at the ways in which Trump
and his sycophants

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.249
lie and then create
alternate realities

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.652
to justify those lies.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.387
Because this morning,
his aides and supporters

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.355
on state TV adopted his line

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.392
and insisted that the crowd
was actually laughing with him.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:16.295
-When he said that,
they loved how honest he is.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:19.465
And it's not diplomatic,
and they find it funny.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.333
-I like the President.
I like his comment.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.702
I like the reaction.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.271
And then, when he said, "I
wasn't expecting that reaction,"

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.973
I liked it when everyone
laughed afterwards.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:31.344
I was surprised,
or should I say, not surprised

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.579
but taken aback by the way
other people said,

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.381
"Oh, the world's
laughing at us."

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.816
I think that we're having fun.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:40.253
-So, to recap, Trump lied,
got laughed at,

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.788
and then lied
about getting laughed at,

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.623
and then Fox News lied
about Trump's lie

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.792
about how he got laughed at
for lying.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.328
And Trump's claim
that he's accomplished more

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:50.729
than any administration
in history

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.431
wasn't the only laugh line
in his speech.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.467
He also repeated
a debunked talking point

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.402
that he's used before
that Germany is becoming

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.871
dependent on Russia
for oil and gas.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.540
And when the camera took a crowd
shot of the German delegation,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.943
they seemed
to be laughing at him.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:09.081
-Germany will become totally
dependent on Russian energy

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:14.019
if it does not
immediately change course.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.322
Here in the Western hemisphere,

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:20.693
we are committed to maintaining
our independence

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:25.998
from the encroachment
of expansionist foreign powers.

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:27.800
[ Laughter ]

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.440
-Look...
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.775
Look at that dude's face.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:40.646
You know it's bad when
you've made the Germans laugh.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:41.880
[ Laughter ]

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.184
In Germany,
that face is the equivalent

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.453
of a Steve Harvey laugh.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:51.524
-[ Laughing ]

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:54.927
-Trump kept undercutting his
speech by embarrassing himself.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.063
In fact, in that same clip,
he tried to deride

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.999
international organizations
by calling them expansionists,

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.168
but he couldn't even
say the word.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.437
-Here in the Western hemisphere,

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:08.641
we are committed to maintaining
our independence

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:14.580
from the encroachment
of expansionist foreign powers.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.650
-Why does he slur
his words so much?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.285
Trump's a teetotaler, and yet
in the middle of the speech,

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.955
he still got pulled over
for a DUI.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.423
[ Laughter ]

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:26.959
In fact, later in his speech,
Trump did it again

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.395
when he misread the phrase
"human smuggling,"

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.496
but in a classic Trump move,
he tried to pretend

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:34.834
that what he accidentally said
was what he meant to say.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.637
-The United States
is also working with partners

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.973
in Latin America
to confront threats

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:44.944
to sovereignty
from uncontrolled migration.

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:49.147
Tolerance for human struggling

00:05:49.147 --> 00:05:51.450
and human smuggling...

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.354
[ Laughter ]

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:57.089
-"Human juggling."

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.224
[ Laughter ]

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:00.626
That's right --
human struggling,

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.895
as in, "I watched
the President's U.N. speech

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.031
and saw a human struggling
to pronounce words."

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.199
[ Laughter ]

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.567
So, this week --
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:12.238
We've seen, this week,
that there's an entire

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.906
right-wing propaganda machine

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.841
to insulate Trump
and his inner circle

00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.076
from the reality of their lies

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.711
and the consequences
of their actions.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.679
Let's not forget
Trump's Supreme Court nominee

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.849
Brett Kavanaugh
did the exact same thing.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.483
The very first words
Kavanaugh spoke

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.819
to the American people
after Trump nominated him

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.821
were a flagrant and obvious lie.

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.324
-Mr. President, thank you.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:37.029
Throughout this process,
I have witnessed firsthand

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:42.735
your appreciation for the vital
role of the American judiciary.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:47.139
No President
has ever consulted more widely

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.377
or talked with more people
from more backgrounds

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:55.314
to seek input about
a Supreme Court nomination.

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:58.150
-That was such an obvious
and shameless lie.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.853
Trump was handed a list
by a conservative think tank,

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.822
and he picked a name
from that list.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.924
Can you imagine if Kavanaugh
had said that

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.926
in front of
the U.N. General assembly?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:11.263
-No President
has ever consulted more widely

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:14.133
or talked with more people
from more backgrounds...

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.434
[ Laughter ]

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:20.872
...to seek input about
a Supreme Court nomination.

00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:24.710
-Now, Kavanaugh's willingness
to lie so shamelessly

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.579
in that first speech and in his
Fox News interview this week

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.481
has wrecked his credibility
as he faces

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:31.216
horrific, credible
new allegations

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:33.318
from a third woman,
Julie Swetnik.

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.721
In fact, Kavanaugh's account of
his supposedly pristine,

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.456
choir-boy high school
and college days

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.924
in that Fox News interview
on Monday

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:41.593
has since been challenged
by many of his own classmates.

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.062
For example,
nearly a dozen people

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.663
who knew him well
and socialized with him

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.431
said Kavanaugh
was a heavy drinker in college,

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.400
with one saying Brett
was a sloppy drunk

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.337
and another saying he was
frequently incoherently drunk.

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:52.738 line:0%
And in his high school yearbook,

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:54.306 line:0%
he listed himself
as the treasurer

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:57.376 line:0%
of the "Keg City Club --
100 kegs or bust."

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.778
In fact, he was so drunk for his
high school history class,

00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:01.446
that when he was asked
to describe the U.N.,

00:08:01.446 --> 00:08:03.649
he called it...
-Expansionist.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.384
[ Laughter ]

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:09.221
-And on top of that, Mark Judge,
Kavanaugh's friend and classmate

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:10.689
and the man
who was allegedly present

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:13.893
during the incident described
by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:17.196
wrote a memoir about his drunken
past, called "Wasted," in 1997.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.998
And in that memoir, he doesn't
name Kavanaugh specifically

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:22.368
but he does reference
a character who passes out drunk

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.770
and throws up in a car
named Bart O'Kavanaugh."

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.071
[ Laughter ]

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.941
Dude, you couldn't come up
with a better fake name

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.509
for Brett Kavanaugh?

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.111
"Hey, man, I'm gonna
put you in my book."

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.213
"All right, but make sure
you change my name."

00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:36.782
"Don't worry, dude.
No one will know it's you."

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.418
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:43.756
Now, let's make something clear.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.991
Getting drunk in high school,
getting drunk in college

00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:48.860
is not in itself suspicious,
nor is it disqualifying

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.929
for the Supreme Court.

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:51.397
But Lying about it
definitely is,

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.632
especially when the women
credibly accusing you

00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:55.534
of sexual assault say
you were drunk when you did it,

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:56.969
and yet,
in his Fox News interview,

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.905
Kavanaugh was adamant that
he was never blackout drunk.

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:01.707
-Was there ever a time
that you drank so much

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.642
that you couldn't remember
what happened the night before?

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:05.777
-No.
That never happened.

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:07.246
-You never said to anyone,

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.880
"I don't remember anything
about last night"?

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.916
-No.
That did not happen.

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:13.586
-Except people who knew
you say it did happen.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.154
Kavanaugh lies so much,
at this point,

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:16.989
I'm expecting him to leave
during the hearing tomorrow

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.658
and come back in
with a fake mustache.

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.226
[ Irish accent ]
"This man is innocent.

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:23.262
I'm the one who's guilty."

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.864
The name's Bart O'Kavanaugh."
[ Laughter ]

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:29.501
"And I'm from Ireland City,
Ireland."

00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:31.136
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:33.872
So, Kavanaugh's classmates
say he was frequently drunk,

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:35.707
and Kavanaugh's own credibility
is in tatters,

00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:37.409
and yet yesterday,
during a meeting

00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:38.878
with the president of Colombia,

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.246
Trump stood firmly
behind Kavanaugh.

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:44.216
-I mean, charges come up
from 36 years ago

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.486
that are totally
unsubstantiated?

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:51.657
I mean, you, watching this,
as the president

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.525
of a great country, Colombia,

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:55.761
you must say,
"How is this possible?"

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.730
-Don't bring him into this!

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.532
[ Laughter ]

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.266
Look at him.

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:02.735
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:06.538
He looks like he's sitting in
the front row at a magic show.

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:09.308
"Don't pick me.
Oh, please, don't pick me."

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.712
Now, late today, right before
we started taping the show,

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:15.848
Trump held
a rare solo press conference.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.249
Now, a lot of what
you're gonna hear

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.118
is gonna sound insane,
but don't worry.

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:21.320
Trump established
that he is not insane

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.656
and is, in fact,
very intelligent.

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:27.960
-If you look at, Mr. Pillsbury,
the leading authority on China,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.197
he was saying that China has
total respect for Donald Trump

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:36.769
and for Donald Trump's
very, very large a-brain.

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:38.237
[ Laughter ]

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.571
-"A-brain."

00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:44.577
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:47.980
"Some have said my brain
is a spicy meatball."

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.384
[ Laughter ]

00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:54.753
So, today,
Trump's Supreme Court nominee

00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:57.255
was credibly accused of sexual
assault by multiple women

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:59.124
and his confirmation
is in serious doubt.

00:10:59.124 --> 00:11:02.795
But I got to say, it seems like
Trump's handling it pretty well.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.931
-If we brought
George Washington here,

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.100
and we said,
"We have George Washington,"

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.835
the Democrats
would vote against him.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.405
We paid $1.8 billion in cash --
cash -- this whole room

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:15.674
would be filled up
with hundred-dollar bills.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:17.876
"This is so-and-so calling..."
He took the call.

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:19.779
Why is he taking a call
from a Russian?

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.314
It's a con job,
and it's not a bad term.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.783
I'm a very famous person,
unfortunately.

00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:26.886
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.921
On that we're in agreement.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.589
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.624
From there,
Trump went off the rails,

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:35.393
attacking the women alleging
sexual assault against Kavanaugh

00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:38.130
and claiming the entire process
was a conspiracy.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.700
-I think when you really
look at it all,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.236
it's not gonna change
any of the Democrats' minds.

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.672
They're obstructionists.

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.774
They're actually con artists,
because they know

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:50.909
how quality this man is,
and they've destroyed

00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:52.210
a man's reputation.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.580
And they know
it's a big, fat con job.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.050
-A big, fat con job?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.119
I'm pretty sure those were the
results from Trump's physical.

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:03.522
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:07.125
Now Trump responded
to the third allegation today

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.194
by focusing on her lawyer,
Michael Avenatti,

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:11.697
the same lawyer who represented
Stormy Daniels in a case

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.799
that ended with Trump's
personal lawyer Michael Cohen

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:16.202
pleading guilty to crimes
involving Trump.

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.969
-Are they liars?

00:12:17.969 --> 00:12:19.705
-I can't tell you.
I have to watch tomorrow.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:20.873
I'll have to read --

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.041
I just heard about one
a little while ago.

00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:25.845
I can tell you
her lawyer is a lowlife, okay?

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.813
-Oh, come on.
If he was such a lowlife,

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.148
you would've hired him.

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:30.816
[ Laughter ]

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:33.518
"Is he available?
I love that guy."

00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:36.354
Trump also cast out on
the details of the allegation,

00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:39.458
suggesting that no one knows
when they actually happened.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:44.396
-Whether it was a man or a woman
30 years ago, 36 years ago --

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.131
In fact, they don't even know
how many years ago.

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:48.200
Because nobody knows
what the time is.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.670
-Just because you don't know
doesn't mean nobody knows.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.838
[ Laughter ]

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:54.673
If someone asked Trump
the name of his son,

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:57.776
Trump would say, "No one knows."
[ Laughter ]

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:00.712
And as usual, he concocted
a deluded conspiracy theory,

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:02.914
claiming the Democrats
had made up the allegations

00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:04.583
and that they knew
they were false.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.319
-They go into a room,
and I guarantee you

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:11.457
they laugh like hell
at what they pulled off on you

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.791
and on the public.

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.259
They laugh like hell.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.028
-No, dude.
They're not the ones laughing.

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.197
You're thinking
of the United Nations.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.865
[ Laughter ]

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:23.402
This whole thing, of course,

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:26.304
it's straight out
of Donald Trump's playbook.

00:13:26.304 --> 00:13:28.673
He's denied the many credible
sexual-assault allegations

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:30.575
against him and viciously
attacked the women

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:33.378
making those accusations,
and he did the same thing today.

00:13:33.378 --> 00:13:35.814
-I've been accused.
False accusations.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.916
Excuse me.
-How have those --

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:40.853
-And I was accused by,
I believe it was four women.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.022
You can check with Sean Hannity.

00:13:44.022 --> 00:13:48.160
-Oh!
We should ask Sean Hannity?

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.361
You're never in a good place

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.331
when your first character
witness is Sean Hannity.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.432
[ Laughter ]

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.900
"I didn't eat that guy.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.469
Just ask my pal Hannibal Lecter.

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.004
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.739
So, Trump defended a man
credibly accused

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.842
of sexual assault today
in a solo press conference

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.442
that was off the rails
and made it clear

00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:06.011
that he is definitely a...

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.246
-Human struggling.

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.681
-This has been
"A Closer Look."

00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:13.219
[ Cheers and applause ]
