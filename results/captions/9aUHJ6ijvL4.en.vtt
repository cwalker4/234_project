MARK MISSUS LIFE LIBERTY AND

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.900
ON.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:32.734
YOU DON'T DO A LOT OF

00:00:32.735 --> 00:00:33.201
INTERVIEWS.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:33.701
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT.

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:34.402
&gt;&gt; IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:34.669
YOU.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.270
YOU ARE NICLAS SAMMONS

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:35.670
LAWYER.

00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.439
YOU BROUGHT A LAWSUIT AGAINST

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.207
THE WASHINGTON POST WHICH WE

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:42.710
WILL GET INTO GREAT DETAIL.

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:43.811
YOU ARE LIKE THE GO TO GUY

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:44.646
WHEN IT COMES TO CASES LIKE

00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:44.946
THIS.

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:45.980
THIS IS UNIQUE.

00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:50.385
YOU TAKE UP THE CASE OF THE

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:55.590
UNDERDOG, RICHARD JEWELL IS A

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.057
PERFECT EXAMPLE.

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:56.758
NAME SOME OF THE CLIENTS YOU

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:57.325
HAD IN THE PAST.

00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:01.596
&gt;&gt; RICHARD WAS MY FIRST ONE

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:02.530
THAT GOT ME INVOLVED IN THE

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:03.298
FIRST AMENDMENT AREA, IN 1996

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.367
WITH THE CENTENNIAL PARK

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:06.701
BOMBING.

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:07.435
SINCE RICHARD, I HAD OCCASION

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:08.503
TO REPRESENT INTERESTING AND

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:11.439
WONDERFUL, DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.906
JOHN AND PATSY.

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:14.142
REPORTER: MZ AND THEIR SON,

00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:17.245
I'VE REPRESENTED THE FAMILY

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:17.946
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:22.384
I'VE REPRESENTED BETH

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:23.084
HOLLOWAY, NATALIE HOLLOWAY'S

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:24.786
MOM FOR OVER TEN YEARS.

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:27.188
GARY CONDON FOR A NUMBER OF

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.926
YEARS, HERMAN CAIN,

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:33.729
REPRESENTED A YOUNG GIRL

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.063
INVOLVED IN A KOBE BRYANT CASE

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:42.771
AND MORE RECENTLY A MAN

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:43.539
FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING A

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.574
PEDOPHILE BY ELON MUSK.

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:49.211
HE WAS THE HERO OF SAVING THE

00:01:49.212 --> 00:01:57.920
13 BOYS IN THE CAVE DISASTER.

00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:58.620
I'VE HAD A VARIETY OF

00:01:58.621 --> 00:01:58.954
CLIENTS.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:01:59.688
I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW SOME OF

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:00.155
THEM VERY WELL.

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:00.889
RICHARD WAS THE FIRST IN THIS

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.190
AREA.

00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:06.895
HE DIED 11 YEARS AFTER THE

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:08.430
FALL ACCUSATIONS.

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.231
I THINK THE STRESS CONTRIBUTED

00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:10.232
TO HIS DEATH AND I MISS HIM

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:10.599
EVERY DAY.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.333
HE CHANGED MY LIFE AND CHANGED

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:11.700
MY CAREER.

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:12.401
MARK LET'S TALK ABOUT FREEDOM

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:18.507
OF THE PRESS ISSUE.

00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:19.475
DO YOU STAND FOR FREEDOM OF

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:20.542
THE PRESS OR DO THE PEOPLE YOU

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:22.277
SUE STAND FOR FREEDOM OF THE

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:22.645
PRESS.

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:23.312
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.814
I'M A BELIEVER IN THE FIRST

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:26.181
AMENDMENT.

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:27.182
I BELIEVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:31.120
HAS NO STRENGTH IN REAL VALUE

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:33.756
IF THERE IS NOT ACCOUNTABILITY

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:34.390
FOR WRONGDOING.

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:40.462
WHEN PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:41.196
SAY HE'S TRYING TO CHILL

00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:44.333
SPEECH, I AM TRYING TO SEEK

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:48.404
REDRESS FOR FALSE SPEECH.

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:53.776
FALSE SPEECH HAS NO VALUE AND

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:54.677
IN THE SAMMONS CASE, YOU ARE

00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:55.344
TALKING ABOUT FALSE SPEECH

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.780
THAT THREATENED, ATTACKED AND

00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.814
VILIFIED A MINOR CHILD.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:02.685
IF I AM ACCUSED OF KILLING

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:03.619
THAT KIND OF SPEECH, I'M HAPPY

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.557
TO TAKE THAT UP, BANNER AND

00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:09.058
WAVE IT PROUDLY.

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.725
WE DON'T NEED THAT SPEECH.

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:10.359
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIRST

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.994
AMENDMENT IS ALL ABOUT.

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:12.628
MARK: I MENTION THE FIRST

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.231
AMENDMENT, WE HEAR PEOPLE

00:03:15.232 --> 00:03:15.831
THROW AROUND THE FIRST

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:18.767
AMENDMENT, FREEDOM OF THE

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:25.007
PRESS, WE HEAR REPORTERS WHO

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:25.841
USE IT, WHEN OUR CONSTITUTION

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:27.209
WAS ESTABLISHED, FREEDOM OF

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.578
THE PRESS BASICALLY MEANT THE

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.380
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS

00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:32.181
HANDS-OFF BUT THERE WAS STILL

00:03:32.182 --> 00:03:35.351
POWER IN THE STATE WHERE

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:36.052
PEOPLE COULD BRING DEFAMATION

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:37.887
SUITS, CORRECT.

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:38.287
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.825
DEFAMATION LAW, THE ABILITY TO

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:43.559
SUE SOMEONE FOR FALSE ATTACKS

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.795
ON YOUR REPUTATION WAS

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:46.829
GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY STATE

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.798
LAW UNTIL 1964.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.870
IN 1954, A NEW YORK TIMES

00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:54.537
VERSUS SULLIVAN, THE SUPREME

00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:55.371
COURT BROUGHT IN THE FIRST

00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:58.541
AMENDMENT IN CASES INVOLVING

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:06.749
PUBLIC OFFICIALS, AND IN THOSE

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.517
CASES, ACTUAL MALICE STANDS OF

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:08.184
THE FIRST AMENDMENT APPLIED

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:09.052
BUT IN THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:04:09.053 --> 00:04:09.786
CASES, YOU WERE GOVERNED BY

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:10.153
STATE LAW.

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:10.887
STATE LAW GENERALLY ALLOWS YOU

00:04:10.888 --> 00:04:12.789
TO RECOVER IF THE REPORTING IS

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.992
FALSE AND WAS NEGLIGENT.

00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:17.293
NOW UNDER THE NEW YORK TIMES

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:22.832
STANDARD THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:23.766
HAD TO PROVE YOU ACTUALLY KNEW

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:26.336
IT WAS FALSE, SUBJECTIVE OR

00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:26.936
YOU ACTED IN RECKLESS

00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:27.570
DISREGARD FOR THE TRUTH.

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:30.974
THAT GOT EXPANDED BY SOME

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:34.811
BRIGHT MEDIA LAWYERS INTO

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:36.312
PUBLIC FIGURES AND PEOPLE OF

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:37.013
GENERAL NOTORIETY A FEW YEARS

00:04:37.014 --> 00:04:37.313
LATER.

00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:38.848
THEN IT WENT TO WHERE THEY

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.551
APPLIED IT IN ROSENBLUM VERSUS

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:42.719
THE MEDIA TO ANYONE INVOLVED

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.524
IN PUBLIC INTEREST.

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:48.191
THE SUPREME COURT REALIZED

00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:48.792
THEY HAD GONE TOO FAR.

00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:49.826
THEY DIAL THAT BACK AND

00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:55.498
REVERSED ROSENBLUM AND SAID IT

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.466
WAS ONLY APPLYING TO A PRIVATE

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.335
FIGURE IF THAT PERSON HAD

00:04:58.336 --> 00:04:59.035
VOLUNTARILY SUBJECTED HIMSELF

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:01.938
OR HERSELF INTO THE FOREFRONT

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.109
OR VORTEX OF A PUBLIC

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.776
CONTROVERSY TO INFLUENCE THE

00:05:06.777 --> 00:05:07.611
OUTCOME OF THE CONTROVERSY.

00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:11.782
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE ACTUAL

00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:12.549
MALICE STANDARD CAME FROM ON

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.951
PUBLIC OFFICIALS, IN TERMS OF

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:17.421
HOW ITS ROOTS IN THE FIRST

00:05:17.422 --> 00:05:17.788
AMENDMENT.

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.157
I THINK JUSTICE THOMAS

00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:26.196
RECENTLY COMMENTED IN A

00:05:26.197 --> 00:05:26.864
CONCURRING OPINION THAT HE

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:27.564
QUESTIONS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:28.165
VALIDITY OF THAT RULE.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:28.765
I THINK HE IS RIGHT.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.335
I CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THE

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:33.504
MEDIA NEEDS BREATHING ROOM

00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:36.540
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT, TO

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.776
RUSH OUT AND ADOPT A SOCIAL

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:42.913
MEDIUM MOB ATTACK ON A

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:45.783
16-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:46.550
THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:50.621
REQUIRE THAT TO BE A VIABLE

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:56.994
PROTECTIVE TO OUR CITIZENS.

00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:57.828
&gt;&gt; WE HAD FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:58.529
LONG BEFORE THOSE TIMES.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.231
&gt;&gt; WE DID IN THE MEDIA SEEM TO

00:06:00.232 --> 00:06:02.666
DO OKAY.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:03.367
&gt;&gt; RADIO, TV WAS DEVELOPED,

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.602
ALL FORMS OF COMMUNICATION,

00:06:04.603 --> 00:06:06.570
NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS WERE

00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:09.607
DEVELOPED, SO THE MEDIA

00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:12.676
BROADLY SPEAKING, REALLY HAD A

00:06:12.677 --> 00:06:14.011
REVOLUTION IN COMMUNICATION,

00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:16.347
EVEN PRIOR TO THE NEW YORK

00:06:16.348 --> 00:06:18.015
TIMES VERSUS SULLIVAN.

00:06:18.016 --> 00:06:19.417
I WOULD ASK YOU THIS QUESTION,

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:24.055
ARE WE BETTER OFF WHEN WE

00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:26.924
BASICALLY HAVE REPORTERS THAT

00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:29.794
CLAIM IMMUNITY?

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:30.495
IMMUNITY FROM THE LAW, WHERE

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:31.195
THEY CAN BASICALLY SAY

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:34.198
ANYTHING, CALL PEOPLE NAMES,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.099
RUN REPORTS AND DO A LITTLE

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.536
RETRACTION LATER, MAYBE OR

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:40.505
MAYBE NOT?

00:06:40.506 --> 00:06:41.405
DO YOU CLAIM THAT FREEDOM OF

00:06:41.406 --> 00:06:41.772
THE PRESS?

00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:42.507
IS THAT REALLY A HEALTHY WAY

00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.809
FOR A NATION TO COMMUNICATE

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.476
PEOPLE TO PEOPLE, GROUP TO

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:45.843
GROUP.

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:46.411
&gt;&gt; LOOK AROUND YOU.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:49.781
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:50.581
LOOK AT THE DETERIORATION IN

00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:54.819
THE MEDIA IN THE LAST SEVERAL

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.853
YEARS.

00:06:55.854 --> 00:06:56.621
THE LAST COUPLE DECADES, I'VE

00:06:56.622 --> 00:06:57.388
WATCHED IT SINCE THE RICHARD

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:57.789
JEWELL CASE.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.423
IT'S HORRIBLY UNHEALTHY.

00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:01.659
THERE IS NOTHING VALUABLE TO

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.927
OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE FOR

00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:05.730
PEOPLE TO JUST SIMPLY GO OUT

00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:09.133
AND TELL RUMORS, LIES, MAKE

00:07:09.134 --> 00:07:15.807
ACCUSATIONS WITH NO SOURCES,

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:16.908
TO BE ABLE TO USE THE MEDIA

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:17.809
AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO IN

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.743
EFFECT, ADVANCE HIS OR HER OR

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:19.978
SOME CORPORATIONS OWN AGENDA.

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.412
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:22.313
NICHOLS.

00:07:22.314 --> 00:07:25.517
A LOT OF AGENDAS AT WORK.

00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:26.952
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T

00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:30.088
HAVE AN AGENDA WAS NICLAS

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.422
SAMMON.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:32.057
HE WAS ON A FIELD TRIP TO THE

00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:33.925
NATIONAL MALL TO PARTICIPATE

00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:36.294
IN THE RIGHT TO LIFE MARCH.

00:07:36.295 --> 00:07:38.096
IT'S GOTTEN TO BE A SITUATION

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:40.265
WHERE IT STARTED OFF, WHEN YOU

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:43.468
GOT TO THE INTERNET, MARK, AND

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:44.569
YOU HAVE THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.072
REVIEW COULD SIT IN THE

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:54.112
PRIVACY OF YOUR HOME, WITH A

00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:54.880
FEW STROKES OF THE KEYBOARD

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:55.647
WITH ANONYMITY, YOU CAN SEND

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.149
OUT STATEMENTS TO THE WORLD

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.784
THAT COULD RUIN HER REPUTATION

00:07:58.785 --> 00:07:59.217
IN SECONDS.

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:02.287
IF YOU TRACK THAT INTO HOW

00:08:02.288 --> 00:08:05.557
IT'S EVOLVED TO SOCIAL MEDIA,

00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:06.725
WHERE YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.927
PEOPLE ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK

00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:12.531
AND THEIR ANONYMOUS, AND THEY

00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:15.000
DETERIORATE THE LEVEL OF

00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:15.767
DISCUSSION WERE NOW IT'S JUST

00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:18.503
GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AND

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:18.804
WORSE.

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:22.040
NOW THE NEWS MEDIA TRACKS IT,

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:22.941
BECAUSE NOW YOU GO LOOK AT

00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:24.209
MOST OF YOUR ARTICLES AND

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.447
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOURCES

00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:31.617
SAY, PEOPLE CLOSE TO, NOBODY'S

00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:32.017
IDENTIFIED.

00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:33.552
IT USED TO BE THE MEDIA WAS

00:08:33.553 --> 00:08:38.690
VERY CAREFUL IN USING ANY TYPE

00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:39.291
OF CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE.

00:08:39.292 --> 00:08:41.026
THEY HAD TO HAVE IT BACK IN

00:08:41.027 --> 00:08:44.096
THE WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN

00:08:44.097 --> 00:08:44.396
DAYS.

00:08:44.397 --> 00:08:45.865
THE WASHINGTON POST REQUIRED

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:47.666
TO SOURCES TO VERIFY ANY

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:51.170
INFORMATION ATTRIBUTED TO DEEP

00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:52.872
THROAT.

00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:53.439
THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.273
NOW THE MEDIA IS SIMPLY BECOME

00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:57.243
LIKE THE INTERNET USERS IN THE

00:08:57.244 --> 00:08:57.877
SOCIAL MEDIA USERS BECAUSE

00:08:57.878 --> 00:08:58.777
THEY PUT OUT A LOT OF

00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:01.547
INFORMATION WITHOUT ANY

00:09:01.548 --> 00:09:04.750
ATTRIBUTION TO REAL SOURCES

00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:06.152
WHO ARE IDENTIFIED, WHO CAN BE

00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:09.688
ACCOUNTABLE FOR LIES.

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:13.626
MARK: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT YOUR

00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:14.393
CLIENT NICLAS SAMMON IN A

00:09:14.394 --> 00:09:15.327
MOMENT, BUT FIRST I WANT TO

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:16.262
ASK YOU ABOUT THIS THING WE

00:09:16.263 --> 00:09:20.132
CALL THE MEDIA, CNN,

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:22.101
ULTIMATELY OWNED BY TIME

00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:22.501
WARNER.

00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:26.973
&gt;&gt; MAYBE AT&amp;T NOW, BIG

00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:28.474
CORPORATIONS.

00:09:28.475 --> 00:09:29.609
&gt;&gt; NBC, MSNBC, COMCAST.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.812
&gt;&gt; BIG CORPORATION.

00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:33.613
MARK: WHAT KIND OF INFLUENCE

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.115
DOES THAT HAVE ON NEWSROOMS.

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:37.116
&gt;&gt; TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF

00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:44.056
COVERAGE WE HAVE AT NBC AND

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:44.490
MSNBC AND CNN.

00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:45.758
THERE'S NO OBJECTIVITY, THERE

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:49.996
IS NO FAIRNESS, IT'S JUST LIKE

00:09:49.997 --> 00:09:53.432
THEY'VE BECOME AN EXTENSION OF

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:54.534
POLITICAL PARTIES OUT TRYING

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:55.134
TO INFLUENCE THE PUBLIC,

00:09:55.135 --> 00:09:56.369
INSTEAD OF INFORMING THE

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:56.702
PUBLIC.

00:09:56.703 --> 00:10:00.473
IT USED TO BE THE STANDARD WAS

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.809
GET AT FIRST BUT GET IT

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.142
RIGHT.

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:04.644
THEY'VE THROWN OUT GET IT

00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.846
RIGHT.

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:07.814
NOW I DON'T THINK THEY EVEN

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:08.548
WORRY ABOUT GETTING AT FIRST

00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:09.349
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.085
I USE THE EXAMPLE, THAT IF YOU

00:10:12.086 --> 00:10:15.722
LOOK BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:19.259
NICLAS, YOU HAD THE MEDIA ALL

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:25.231
OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:26.065
THEY HAD THE BUZZFEED REPORT

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:26.833
THAT SAID THE PRESIDENT HAD

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.601
DIRECTLY TOLD MICHAEL COHEN TO

00:10:28.602 --> 00:10:29.502
LIE TO CONGRESS ABOUT THE

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:32.105
TRUMP HOTEL IN RUSSIA, AND

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:36.609
THEN FRIDAY NIGHT, MULLER

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.544
COMES OUT AND SAYS THAT STORY

00:10:37.545 --> 00:10:39.546
IS INACCURATE, IS NOT TRUE.

00:10:39.547 --> 00:10:42.982
THE MEDIA WENT TO BED FRIDAY

00:10:42.983 --> 00:10:43.950
NIGHT WITH TWO BLACK EYES AND

00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:46.519
THEY WOKE UP SATURDAY MORNING

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.687
ON THE 19th OF JANUARY AND

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:50.724
THEY CAME OUT SWINGING AGAIN,

00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:51.525
THIS TIME THEY WERE SWINGING

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.327
AT A YOUNG BOY BECAUSE HE WAS

00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:57.798
WEARING A MAKE AMERICA GREAT

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:02.703
AGAIN CAP AND THEY TOOK HIM

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:03.804
OUT AND TRIED TO PUNCH HIM AND

00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:04.938
BEAT HIM AND ATTACK HIM LIKE A

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:05.439
SCHOOLYARD BULLY.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.673
THE REASON I MAKE THAT POINT

00:11:06.674 --> 00:11:08.141
IS THAT THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO

00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:09.042
LOOK INTO THE ALLEGATIONS IN

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.143
THE STATEMENTS BEING MADE ON

00:11:10.144 --> 00:11:10.577
SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:14.514
THEY JUST JOINED THE SOCIAL

00:11:14.515 --> 00:11:21.888
MEDIA MOB.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.656
THAT'S WHY I MAKE THE

00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:23.323
REFERENCE THAT THEY HAVE

00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:23.924
BECOME AN EXTENSION OF

00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:24.558
POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.292
SOCIAL MEDIA MOB AND THAT'S

00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:30.464
BEYOND THE WILD WILD WEST.

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:31.265
THERE IS NO REAL LEGAL

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:31.799
ACCOUNTABILITY YET.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.666
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:35.402
FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE THE

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.437
TYPE OF CONDUCT AND THE TYPE

00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:38.605
OF SPEECH WE ARE SEEING ON THE

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:39.473
SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES, BUT IT

00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:40.040
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:42.676
IT'S GOING HAVE TO BE

00:11:42.677 --> 00:11:45.846
ACCOUNTABILITY, MARK, AND IF

00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:46.814
WE DON'T GET ACCOUNTABILITY,

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:49.016
DETERIORATION WILL CONTINUE.

00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:50.184
MARK: WHEN WE COME BACK I WANT

00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:51.552
TO ASK ABOUT YOUR CLIENT

00:11:51.553 --> 00:11:54.254
NICLAS SAMMON, HOW IS HE

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:54.555
DOING.

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:55.622
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR

00:11:55.623 --> 00:12:00.060
FIGHT WITH THE WASHINGTON POST

00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:01.028
WHO, IF ANYONE'S NEXT, WHAT

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:01.795
YOUR PLANS ARE, WHAT YOUR

00:12:01.796 --> 00:12:02.796
ARGUMENTS ARE, AND WHAT IS THE

00:12:02.797 --> 00:12:04.965
REACTION OF SOME OF THE

00:12:04.966 --> 00:12:05.566
TARGETS, YOUR POTENTIAL

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:10.337
TARGETS OF YOUR LITIGATION.

00:12:10.338 --> 00:12:10.938
LADIES AND JONAH, DON'T

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:11.672
FORGET, ALMOST EVERY WEEKNIGHT

00:12:11.673 --> 00:12:16.578
YOU CAN WATCH ME ON LEVINTV,
