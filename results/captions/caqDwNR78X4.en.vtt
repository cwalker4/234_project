00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.970
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now: more of my interview
with former President Bill Clinton and writer

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.480
James Patterson: about their political thriller,
"The President Is Missing."

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.129
I sat down with them yesterday.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.460
President Bill Clinton, James Patterson. The
book is...

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.000
JAMES PATTERSON, Co-Author, "The President
Is Missing": Guilty as charged.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.730
JUDY WOODRUFF: The book is "The President
Is Missing."

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.640
A former president of the United States, a
fabulously successful writer, who calls the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.500
shots when you're working together on a book?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.380
BILL CLINTON, Former President of the United
States: Well, I think we know who's better

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.940
at this. He's one of the world's great storytellers.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.030
But we both wanted to do it, and our lawyer/agent/friend
Bob Barnett suggested we do it. And when he

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.010
mentioned it to you, he said, I have been
trying to get you to write a thriller for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.860
years, and you are never going to do it. You're
too busy with your foundation. So, why don't

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.190
you do one with James Patterson?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.730
I said, he'd never do that. Never.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.200
So Bob talked to him. He said yes. And we
just started.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.710
And I told him he was going to have to do
a little hand-holding in the beginning, because

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.869
I didn't -- I have read thousands of thrillers,
but I -- I guess, by now, but I didn't know

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.219
how to do it.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:18.369
But we started with an outline. And he said,
OK, here's 20 questions you have got to answer

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.479
of how to make this authentic.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.640
JAMES PATTERSON: I didn't tell him there would
be another 20 after that.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.270
BILL CLINTON: And so we started working. And
then, every draft, we traded back and forth,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.270
sometimes several times.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.090
JAMES PATTERSON: Yes, when Bob came to me
-- we both grew up in small towns, but, in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.759
my small town, nobody ever came.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.140
But when I was 8 or 9 years old, Eisenhower
President Eisenhower, and I never forgot that.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.609
I never forgot that. And I also tried to never
forget where I came from. I never get a big

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.329
head because of whatever. I don't think anybody
should get big heads about anything, but I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.670
really tried not to do that.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.649
So, when I got the opportunity to write a
book with President Clinton, I jumped at it,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.770
and to spend a year with him, which has been
fabulous.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is a book about a president.
It starts out, he's facing an impeachment

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.899
hearing, something you know about, President
Clinton.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:14.780
He's also confronting an international terrorist
threat that, implausibly, he decides to deal

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.511
with himself. He has to...

00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.989
JAMES PATTERSON: Not implausible in terms
of the book, though, in terms of the story,

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.490
in terms of why he decides to do that.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.490
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.620
JAMES PATTERSON: But, yes, implausible in
terms of like -- I mean, even when we talked

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.560
about it, the president said, this would be
irresponsible, except under this kind of circumstance.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.560
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's what I want to
ask you about, because he has to ditch the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.010
Secret Service, President Clinton, in order
to do -- to go and do this thing on his own.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.010
That would never happen, would it?

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.790
BILL CLINTON: Well, it never has happened.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.950
In the book, we explain what the law appears
to be, which is that anybody except the president

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.390
who is covered by the Secret Service, including
members of the president's family, can sign

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.340
off the coverage and assume the risk, normally,
for a very specific purpose and limited time.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.450
If you read this book, you will see there's
a very specific reason he thinks he has to

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.340
do it. And he acknowledges that it won't be
very long, but this is a cyber-security novel,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.819
so the things happen fast, clock is ticking.
He has to make a decision. And he thinks he's

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.019
doing the right thing.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:37.739
But, in general, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't
do it. And you see why shouldn't do it, with

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.739
the consequences that flow.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.849
JAMES PATTERSON: There is an incredibly devastating
attack launched toward the United States.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.480
If something like that happened, this is how
it would happen. There's an attack on a presidential

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.051
motorcade. If it happened, it would happen
like this. The president goes missing. If

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.430
that -- inconceivable as that might normally
be, if it happened, this is how it could happen.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.900
JUDY WOODRUFF: The theme of the book is around,
as you said, a cyber-attack, a cyber-threat.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.290
Is it fair to say, President Clinton, that
you think that that is now the most serious

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.409
kind of potential threat this country faces?

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.260
BILL CLINTON: Well, of course, a nuclear,
chemical or biological attack could kill more

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.999
people more quickly.

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:23.160
But I think it is more likely that a serious
cyber-attack could do a massive amount of

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.590
damage and be successful.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.630
JAMES PATTERSON: Currently, you know, we have
a very large defense budget, which is getting

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.880
larger, but only a very small part of it is
designated towards cyber-defense.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.780
And I think we both think that we need to
reexamine that in terms of how big that piece

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.780
should be.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.730
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is one way of educating
the public, because...

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.022
BILL CLINTON: Yes, we're trying to do something
that you don't normally do. Can you write

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:53.660
a legitimate thriller that's really fun to
read and faithful to the way it would unfold,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.870
and also makes a point that makes people more
interested in the cyber-security thing, because

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.060
anything electronic can be hacked.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.710
And that's the point we're trying to make
here.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.061
JAMES PATTERSON: And it's not just that it
goes off temporarily. It can be erased. Or

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:12.420
your bank records, Wall Street, all of it,
it could be erased. That's what really makes

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.420
it scary.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.270
And we tried to create a president that we
would remind people how important this job

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.370
is, how stressful this job is, so that when
people -- and I'm not being political here,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.110
but when people go out to vote, they would
really think about that a lot, even in the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.720
midterm elections, that, when they go out,
they are going to elect people to Congress.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.950
This is really -- governorships -- this is
really important stuff. This is not -- and

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.650
these people are not silly. They're not villains.
They want to do an important job. And let's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.380
be real careful about who we elect.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.960
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the other points, I
guess you could say moments of education,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.550
comes through in the dysfunction in Washington,
one of the things that is surrounding this

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.180
president, this fictional President Duncan.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.780
And, at the end of the book, he laments -- quote
-- and I'm quoting -- "The downward drift

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.830
into tribalism, extremism and seething resentment,
us vs. them, a blood sport, the well of trust

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.150
runs completely dry."

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.819
I guess my question to you is, though, with
President Trump's success, aren't we deal

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.680
-- isn't that here to stay for the foreseeable
future?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.230
BILL CLINTON: Well, for a while, it is.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.440
But I think -- you know, I think, in the campaign,
for example, I believe that I attacked him

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.680
less personally than anybody else, that I
always said, look, this election is about

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.530
you. Here's why you should be for Hillary,
one, two, three.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.751
I think the -- everybody should be trying
to recapture that. For example, I think we

00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:46.600
should be rooting for him to succeed with
the Korea negotiations. I don't like having

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.430
to brag on the dictatorial proclivities of
the North Korean leader, but I think the South

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.320
Korean president has been a genius, the way
he's kind of gotten them together.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.010
And I think anything we can do to reduce that
threat is a positive thing.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.050
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're watching this summit
that looks like it's going to take place between

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.160
President Trump and the North Korean leader.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.140
Do you believe the North Koreans -- you have
dealt with them -- are prepared to completely

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.040
dismantle their nuclear weapons program?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.840
BILL CLINTON: Maybe, maybe not. But even if
they're not, if they are prepared to have

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:29.970
an inspection regime which would give us greater
confidence that the nuclear material, the

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:39.610
fissile material, and any technology would
be identified, monitored and couldn't be given

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.530
or sold to anyone else, that would be worth
doing.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.970
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have said -- you have continued
to say you believe that NAFTA was the right

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.390
thing to do, that the benefits outweigh the
disadvantages.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.701
However, your party just has steadily moved
in the direction of protectionism. So, my

00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.950
question is, that's the political reality,
isn't it, on trade?

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.970
BILL CLINTON: Yes.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:10.520
People will tend to resent any force that
is not helping them. So who cares if trade

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.630
is helping somebody else? Who cares if technology
is helping somebody else? I get that.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.150
I do think NAFTA needs to be upgraded. It's
25 years. There's all the other technological

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.210
and other changes. I think there is plenty
of room for them to -- for both sides to say

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.550
they have got something done, and they can
redo this.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.320
We pretty well know what's going to be hurt
in the trade agreement, who will be helped,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.260
who will be hurt. We should get our money
on the front end from now on. But, otherwise,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.610
I still believe in trade.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: You going to do another collaboration
after this one? You going to write a second

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.650
Patterson-Clinton book?

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.500
JAMES PATTERSON: Well, we have had a lot of
fun doing it. We really -- it's been a tremendous

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.630
experience for both of us. It's been fun out
here and doing interviews and big crowds and

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.670
really positive crowds.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.860
BILL CLINTON: I was thrilled, at my age, to
try something new.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.380
JAMES PATTERSON: He's probably got a detective
series started already on the side.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.470
BILL CLINTON: Spending 35 years reading all
these mysteries, all of a sudden, I got to

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.690
help write one. It was fabulous.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.560
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, gentlemen, the book is,
"The President Is Missing."

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.500
Thank you very much for talking with me, James
Patterson, President Bill Clinton.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.500
JAMES PATTERSON: Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.500
BILL CLINTON: Thank you.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.750
And you can watch the first part of my interview,
including President Clinton's comments about

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.110
Monica Lewinsky. That's on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
