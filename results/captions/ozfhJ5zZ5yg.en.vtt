Okay, I think you know why I was asking the question. What brought you here to audition. What brought me you to audition I?

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.668
Don't think it's that interesting of a question actually, but I think Andrew hey

I'm gonna just want you now if you want to carry on being a smartass you can leave the room

I'm sorry first of all okay. What are you gonna think I'm gonna sing House of the Rising Sun

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.809

I'm just okay. I do you are really pushing this no all right. I'm just gonna sing it. I'm sorry

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.909
I didn't mean to push any buttons all right

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.239
There is a house in New Orleans

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.970
It's called the Rising Sun

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.430
And it's been the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.229
ruin of

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.769
Many poor boy and God I know I'm one

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.589
My mother was a tailor

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.259
She sewed

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.119
my new blue

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.770
jeans

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.630
my father

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.350
Was a gamblin man

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.070
Way down in New Orleans

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.389
Thank you, are you angry am I angry very on edge. Tell us what happened what happened

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.409
I just am on edge from waiting so what just from waiting

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.319
It's just you know the thing is you want to be in the music business?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.729
But you don't want to wait to get into American Idol that to me seems to be a problem

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.949
And you know for you to have a bad

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.580
No no

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.190
I'm not reading it too far because you just told me that you're a little bit annoyed that you had to wait three hours

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.839
To come in here and get your shot when there are people that would wait

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.480
Years to do so so I am now angry at you who I don't like at all

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Well why are you doing?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.039
No, there's no problem at all I think that I don't know why you guys there's no problem. You walked in mm-hm very

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.060
Sulky quite rude very aggressive, and you've got very very bad energy oh

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.760
Man you do

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.889
let's have a little conversation about this I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.780
Was trying to seem confident confident

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.319
I knew it you don't have to good to back it up. That's what I think is disappointment

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.399
I don't I don't I don't agree with you. I think I do have the goods to back it up. I'm still getting

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.090
Andrew now I'm sorry Victoria. No Mandy wasn't good enough today. Dog. No. I said yes, you're

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.049
Kidding

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.409
Kind of got to like except on I mean you have an attitude, but you're at least charming

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.980
Wait a minute you're being really vicious here, I'm sorry. I really don't like you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.599
I don't know why but I'm not judging you in this way

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.950
There you're being awful right

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.299
Thank you see you later ladies

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.990
Okay

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.350
It's the first time I think I've heard someone sing

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.950
That never stayed on any melody

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.810
So to speak I can even tell what song that was after the first couple of bars

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.109
So I think that you have a pretty voice, but I think that you need a lot more vocal training well listen, sweetheart

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.600
I don't really care about your opinion

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.559
I really could care less because I'm 22 years old and I'm beautiful and I can sing so I really don't care what you think

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.260
Okay, I'm gonna be a star and you have my number, and if you change your mind. Give me a call

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.589

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.219
We've made a biggest are what's going on Jennifer

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.479
Not a lot ready to get my saying on you know you can't sing with gum in your mouth

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.569
Give me your love, baby and night

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.240

We're not gonna give you any love, baby don't want it. I like that answer

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.390
I don't think it's gonna help us to love ya. Can I keep on going no no no Jennifer?

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.379
The song was all over the place you were all over the place. It's a terrible audition

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.020

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.839
I wouldn't want to sound like you Jen about music. Okay. I like her sighing. I don't think you should have come here today

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.320
Okay, well that's your matter of opinion. It's a pretty good opinion. I say it's awful - you think it's awful - okay

Why should I sing a whole lot better than you do and for you to tell me I'm he left Tanika Seneca

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.780
Welcome to American Idol smackdown

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.718
You're not standing here being judged by people about how you think you're not singing

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.390
Are you and for you to tell me that I need lessons?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.950

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.909
Yeah, we're telling the truth, and you don't want to hear it oh that, thank you very much. Thank you

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.240
Powerful Lamar

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.410
Randy

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.469
Lamar man I got mad Luffy and man, but I was kind of torturous, man

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.669
I mean, I you know the pitch was all over the place. It was like

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.560
You

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.480
know I

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:56.760
Just don't think you're that good man, sweetie. Yeah, the more - you're 19 years old. I'm 20 okay 20

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.999
I'm not gonna say that you bet you're a terrible singer cuz you know maybe shockers out. That's not true

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:12.030
Are you good listener I am very good listener, okay, so listen to us for a second

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.190
It wasn't great. There's a voice in there somewhere you need to do a lot of work

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.520
I don't even know if you really for this level no no

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.549
Listen I asked if you were good listening you keep singing

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.300
I want to just share something with you

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:41.490
You have to find some humility in order to do this and pull back inside listen and stop trying to exalt yourself

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.540
And that's what you're doing you're running, so just need to do the work

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.809
You haven't done the work yet, so let's take a vote Lamar

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:55.200
No, I'm gonna say no cuz you're not ready a dog. I feel your passion, but see you're not even listening

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.050
Lamar we're trying to help you I

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:12.009
Can't sing no. We said nobody

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.730
Said that it wasn't great - they dog you're not ready for this level we're trying to find the best

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.220
We're trying to find the best you weren't the best

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.760
This is crazy

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.430
You
