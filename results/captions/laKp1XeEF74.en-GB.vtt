00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.190
Black holes are structures in
the fabric of space and time

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.550
itself, and they're amongst
the most extraordinary objects

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.420
that we know that
exists in the universe.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.820
Despite the
mathematical complexity

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.940
in describing black
holes, and the myriad ways

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.610
in which black holes can
form in the universe,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.659
we also know that they possess a
very striking simplicity, which

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.700
is one of the things I
wanted to try and describe

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.630
to you tonight.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.050
The modern conception of
black holes began in 2000--

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.460
sorry, 1915-- and
it took many years

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.250
before the properties of black
holes were properly understood,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.130
and longer again until
we have found evidence

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.080
that black holes exist.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.200
But we do know
black holes exist,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.090
and in 2015, there was
a dramatic confirmation

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.940
of the existence of black holes,
the first direct detection

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.160
of black holes by
the measurement

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.840
of the gravitational
waves emitted

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.810
by a system of two black holes.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.490
This was a system
of two black holes

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.380
that were orbiting each other.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.180
They coalesced to form a
single black hole, and then

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.790
that cataclysmic
explosion when they

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.530
formed that single
black hole, they

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.030
emitted a gravitational
radiation.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.020
That gravitational waves
moves through the universe

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.490
and was measured by the
LIGO experiment in 2015.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.120
That was the first direct
detection of black holes.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.980
It was the first
direct detection

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.870
of a binary system
of black holes.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.690
Before them we weren't
sure that they existed.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.090
And it was also the
first direct detection

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.960
of gravitational waves.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.585
So in short, that was a
truly spectacular discovery,

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.210
and that's something
I want to tell you

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.610
about in tonight's lecture.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.900
In telling the story
of black holes,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.040
we'll start with the beginning
of the story of gravity,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.682
or the modern story of
gravity, which is Isaac Newton.

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:04.140
And citing from
Isaac Newton, we'll

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.930
moved to general relativity,
Einstein's theory of gravity,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.400
which is our best
theory of gravity,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.110
and it's the arena where most
of the discussion of black holes

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.680
will happen tonight.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280
But we know that relativity
is not the final story.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.687
It's not the most
fundamental story of gravity.

00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:22.770
We know there's a new
chapter, and the new chapter

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.320
must include quantum theory.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.720
So there is some way in
which general relativity

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.330
must be subsumed into a deeper,
more fundamental structure.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.860
And I want to explain why
black holes, and the properties

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.370
of black holes, are the
key theoretical laboratory

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.620
for making that
next step forward

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.405
in the search for
fundamental physics.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.970
So I want to begin
our journey in 1687,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.980
which is when Isaac
Newton formulated

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.680
his theory of gravity.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.660
And along with his
laws and mechanics,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.370
that comprises,
really, the beginning

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.091
of modern fundamental physics.

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:07.140
And Newton thought a lot
about how things fall.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.420
So for example, this apple.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.540
Famously, he thought
about how apples fall.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.940
And he realised that everything
falls in a very similar way,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.230
and in fact, in
exactly the same way.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.510
So that apple falls, as
I've just demonstrated,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.440
this ball similarly
falls in the same way.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.740
And if I take this ball and
impart a small transverse

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.190
motion to it, it's still
falling to the Earth

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.620
in the same way the apple was.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.160
But because of the
transverse motion I gave it,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720
the actual orbit was
slightly different.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.030
And Newton thought
about this a lot,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.750
and from these
simple observations,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.530
he made the breathtaking
leap that the moon is also

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.220
falling to the earth in exactly
the same way the apple was

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.940
falling to the earth or this
ball was falling to the earth.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.530
And he came up with an
ingenious thought experiment,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.630
which hopefully I
can convince you,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.600
following Newton, of
why that's the case.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.029
So here is a picture
that Newton drew,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.769
and it's a picture of a planet.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.950
I'm not quite sure why it
has all these fissures in it.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.800
But in any case, he has a
planet with a little volcano,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.410
a little mount on the top of it.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.900
And he imagined standing
on top of that hill

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.200
and throwing objects.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.940
In fact, he thought of having
a cannon and firing cannon

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.290
balls from it.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.800
So starting from the point
V, he fires a cannon.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.107
And if it was thrown
at a small velocity,

00:04:44.107 --> 00:04:46.690
the cannonball would fall to the
earth and end up at the point

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.640
D. If you threw it a little
further, it would end up--

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.840
sorry, a little faster--

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.330
it would end up at the
point E. But in both cases,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.050
just like the ball I
demonstrated a few moments ago,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.860
it's falling to the
earth all the time.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.110
Faster still, it would go
up to point F, and then G.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.330
And if you took, at the
surface of the earth,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.650
and I took that ball, and I was
able to throw that ball at 7.9

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.660
kilometres a second, which,
admittedly, I couldn't throw.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.980
But if it could
be thrown, then it

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.700
would keep falling to
the earth the whole time,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.010
but it would never
actually touch the earth.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.300
It would come back and make the
orbit, which was the final line

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.490
that Newton drew.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.280
So Newton understood
that all of these orbits,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.910
these closed motion of
particles, like the moon,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.180
are actually objects
that are falling.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.450
So from simple thought
experiments of apples,

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.530
he made this leap to the
cosmos, and it was a brilliant,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.950
but simple, insight.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.550
But Newton didn't stop there.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.450
He made this
mathematically precise.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.070
And in Newton's
theory of gravity,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.580
he said that all
objects, all masses,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.220
feel a gravitational force.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.980
There's a gravitational
force between the apple

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.480
and the earth.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.930
And we perceive that, as
the motion of the apple

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.150
falling towards
the earth, there's

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.560
also a gravitational force
between the earth and the moon.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.440
And we perceive that, because
of the transverse motion,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.920
that the moon stays
in a stable orbit.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.580
Newton's theory is
magnificent, and it held sway

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.260
for over 200 years.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.510
This was our deepest, most
fundamental understanding

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.400
of gravity.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.740
It predicted the motion
of all of the planets

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.380
in the solar system,
and it actually

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.650
predicted the existence of a
new planet, the planet Neptune.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.340
So by studying the
motion of Uranus,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.480
and it's using the
mathematics of his theory,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.540
people realised that
it almost worked,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.420
that there were some
small deviations.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.370
And those deviations
would be accounted

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.800
for in Newton's
theory if there was

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.130
another planet in
a further orbit,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.220
just outside the
orbit of Neptune.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.745
And the theory was precise
enough that you could predict.

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:18.430
Well, astronomers predicted
exactly where that planet

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.880
should be, and it was found.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.580
So Newton's theory
was quite spectacular.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.610
But there's something very odd
about Newton's theory as well.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.240
And the odd thing is that the
force, the gravitational force

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.820
that Newton invoked, is
instantaneously communicated.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.470
So with this apple,
if I move the apple,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.150
the force between the
earth and the apple

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.500
is instantaneously communicated.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.410
It doesn't take a little
split second for it

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.740
to be communicated,
it's instantaneous.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.850
And this troubled Newton,
instantaneous action

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.290
at a distance.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.200
And I want to put up
this fragment of a letter

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.740
that Isaac Newton wrote
to Bentley in 1692.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.012
Bentley was the Master of
Trinity College in Cambridge.

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.470
And I was actually
fortunate enough

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.090
to see this volume at the
Wren Library, just a couple

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.170
of months ago.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.070
And I found it very moving
to see Newton's handwriting,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.990
and I felt a physicality,
a connection,

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.260
spanning us across these
centuries, that separating us

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.920
in time.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.740
In this letter, somewhere
towards the bottom,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.630
Newton said something
quite extraordinary,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.280
so I've highlighted it here.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.900
It says, "that gravity
should be innate, inherent,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.080
and essential to matter,
so that one body may

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.810
act upon another at a
distance through a vacuum

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.000
without the mediation
of anything else,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.210
is, to me, so great an
absurdity that I believe

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.780
no man who has in philosophical
matters, any competent faculty

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.860
of thinking, can
ever fall into it."

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.440
So this action of
distance is disturbing him

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.110
at this very deep,
fundamental level,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.660
and it's worth registering
this for a moment.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.310
So at the very foundations
of his theory, he's troubled.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.670
But nevertheless, despite his
troubles and those obstacles,

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.850
he's been able to
build his theory.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.932
And the theory, as I was just
saying, is truly magnificent.

00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.140
It's not a hodgepodge theory.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.071
It's a great theory.

00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:29.570
And it's a little
template, I think,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.137
for how often progress can
happen in theoretical physics.

00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:34.970
One doesn't necessarily
have the big picture

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.620
and the complete
picture, and there

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.770
can be troubling aspects
in your understanding,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.180
but it's the creative act to be
able to pierce through the void

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.150
and come through and create
some new body of knowledge,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.490
even though you have at
the back of your mind

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.249
some deep reservations that
this is not the final story

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:54.415
and that things will change.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.560
The next chapter began in 1905.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.280
1905, Einstein came up and
developed his special theory

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.930
of relativity.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.750
And one of the aspects of the
special theory of relativity

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.150
is that Einstein
discovers it and he said

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.100
the universe has a speed limit.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.220
And the speed limit is
300,000 kilometres per second.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.030
That's the speed of light.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.950
At this point,
Newton's theory, which

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.700
has just been happily existing
as the most fundamental

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.620
understanding of
gravity, suddenly

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.010
ran into a contradiction,
or a paradox.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.400
If forces instantaneously
communicated in his theory,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.860
and Einstein says that
nothing goes faster

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.140
than speed of light,
something has to give.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.060
In a remarkably
short amount of time,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.710
Einstein himself was
the one who worked out

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.280
what the next step was.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.720
In 1915, Einstein developed his
general theory of relativity,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.820
and he swept away completely the
notion that gravity is a force.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.490
There is no force of
gravity in Einstein's theory

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.610
of relativity.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.650
Instead, gravity is the
manifestation of the curvature

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.720
of space and time, space-time.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.290
So we can draw some
pictures to get

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.690
some intuition and understanding
of what this means.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.895
So imagine that space
is a rubber sheet

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.020
and you place a heavy object
into the rubber sheet,

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.260
like a shot put, it would
curve the rubber sheet,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.270
much like in the
picture of the earth

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.090
curving the space in the
picture that you can see.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.050
So the Earth's0 curving
space around it,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.060
and now the moon is
orbiting the earth,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.490
not because of
force pulling on it,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.370
but just like a marble rolling
on that curved rubber sheet.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.080
If there was no friction, that
ball, the moon, the marble,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.450
would just roll around on that
rubber sheet indefinitely.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.090
So the slogan of
general relativity

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.200
is that matter curves
space and time,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.510
and curved space-time
informs how matter moves.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.440
It's important to
understand and emphasise

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.880
that general relativity doesn't
prove Newton's theory is wrong.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.060
That's not the way
science progresses.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.460
What Einstein did, or
what his theory does,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.540
is subsumes Newton's
theory into a deeper, more

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.080
profound structure.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.050
And if you take the domain
in which Newton's theory was

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.050
developed, essentially,
the solar system,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.190
then Einstein's theory, as
a very good approximation,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.640
does reduce to Newton's theory.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.050
So Einstein's theory
incorporates Newton's theory.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.010
It extends it.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.440
It makes new predictions.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.690
And one of the most stunning
predictions it makes

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.740
is that there
exists black holes.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.100
Two or three weeks
after Einstein

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.430
wrote down these field
equations, Karl Schwarzschild,

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.650
who was a German
scientist who was

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.360
in the Prussian front, a
soldier on the Prussian front,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.620
and a few weeks after Einstein
wrote down these field

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.280
equations, he found the
first black hole solution.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.470
A black hole is a
region of space and time

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.680
in which, once you go
inside the black hole,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.750
you can never escape.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.030
The boundary of the black hole
is called the event horizon.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.140
So if we imagine
we're in a spaceship

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.780
and we cross the event
horizon, going from the outside

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.800
to the inside of the black hole,
once past the event horizon,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.050
no matter how you
fire rockets, you're

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.920
always going to stay
inside the black hole.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.570
Similarly, if you
shine a light beam--

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.403
you shine a torch, or
any other light beam--

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:59.850
from inside the black
hole, it necessarily stays

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.130
inside the black
hole and won't ever

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.740
emanate past the boundary of the
black hole, the event horizon.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.760
So since light can't come
from inside to the outside,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.630
out black.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.340
They don't emit any light.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.320
One of the ways in which
black holes conform

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.290
is in the final stages
of evolution of stars.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.330
And evolution of
star is a battle.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.030
It's a battle, on the one hand,
between the matter of wanting

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.080
to collapse in on
itself, and the pressure

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.630
caused by the thermonuclear
reactions happening deep

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.410
inside the core of the
sun, holding that pressure,

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.420
the force of gravity, at bay.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.560
So for most the
evolution of the star,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.570
those two forces, using
that Newtonian language,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.490
the force of gravity
pulling the matter in

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.840
and the pressure pushing
it out, are at equilibrium.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.750
But as the nuclear
material is exhausted,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:06.820
the nuclear fuel is
exhausted inside the star,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.890
if the star is big enough,
it will collapse in on itself

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.750
and a supernova will happen.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.510
That will collapse in
and then explode off

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.960
and, again, if the
star is big enough,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.360
there will be a core of matter
inside the interior of the star

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.256
that will keep
collapsing in on itself

00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:28.380
and will form a black hole.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.480
One of the most extraordinary
facts about general relativity

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.440
and these black holes is,
despite the complexity

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.960
of what I've just said,
how a black hole can form--

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.280
after all, the star could be 20
solar masses, 50 solar masses--

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.460
you think of the complexity
of the supernova explosion,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.520
how much matter is ejected,
and so on and so forth,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.730
the final black
hole that is created

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:04.760
is specified by two numbers,
its mass and its spin.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.165
All the other information
about the black hole--

00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.800
sorry, all the other
information about how

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.510
the black hole was formed--

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.669
is lost, and you just left
with those two numbers.

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:17.210
Actually, to be more
precise, there's

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.490
three numbers,
and exactly three.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.880
So now this is a fact.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.940
The third number is the electric
charge, but in practise,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.190
the electric charge in
astrophysical black holes is

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.070
going to be extremely
small, or non-existent,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.920
because charge will naturally
neutralise the black hole very

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.162
quickly.

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:37.370
But the mathematics of
relativity says it's specified

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.760
by three, and in practise,
it will be just the mass

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.030
and the spin, which will
determine the properties

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.702
of the black hole.

00:16:45.702 --> 00:16:47.160
So that's what I
wanted to mention.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.493
That's what I mentioned at
the beginning of the lecture,

00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:52.412
that black holes, in general,
extremely are extremely simple.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.970
If black holes are black,
how do we detect them?

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.630
Here is, I quickly add,
an artist's impression

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.140
of a star in a black hole.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.990
It's a companion
system, a binary system.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:18.000
And the black hole is spinning.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.660
And you can see that
it's stripped off,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.310
or it is continuing to strip
off, matter from the star.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.010
And as it strips off the
matter, because the black hole

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:33.040
is rotating, that matter gets
swirled around the black hole

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.730
and starts to form,
heat up from a plasma.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.850
In fact, that plasma, as it
generates magnetic fields,

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:46.007
it also shoots up these jets
along the axis of the direction

00:17:46.007 --> 00:17:46.840
which it's spinning.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.240
This plasma reaches
very high temperatures

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.260
and starts to emit X-rays.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.680
And the first indirect
detection of black holes

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.809
came from measuring the X-rays
produced by black holes,

00:18:03.809 --> 00:18:04.600
as in this picture.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.020
We now know that there's many
black holes in the universe

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.480
by these indirect tests.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.830
And in particular, there's
a supermassive black hole

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.700
at the centre of our galaxy--

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.530
our galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.810
It's in the constellation
of Sagittarius,

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.450
and it weighs three or
four million times the mass

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.000
of our sun.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.460
In fact, most galaxies
in the universe we think

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.526
has a similar sized black
hole, or even bigger.

00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:39.900
There's another very beautiful
piece of indirect evidence

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.760
for the existence of this
black hole in the centre

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.520
of our galaxy.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.370
So here is a picture of--

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:56.340
I'm going to run a little video,
and it's a video of the motion

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.100
of stars right at the
centre of our galaxy.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.180
It was taken over 14
years, and the red cross

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:13.390
is the place where we think the
supermassive black hole exists,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.390
and there's no light being
emitted from that region.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.194
So the date was taken
from 1992 to 2006,

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.360
and let's have a look at it.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.700
So one thing I
should quickly add.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.930
This is not a simulation.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.520
Often, you see simulations,
but this is real data.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.360
This is real observations
of individual stars around

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.380
the centre of our galaxy.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:47.520
And if I just stop
at about here,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.100
you see we have these
nice elliptical orbits

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.810
of these stars going
around the central object.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.180
And by studying the detailed
shape of those orbits

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.490
and the time taken for the stars
to go around a complete orbit,

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.760
we can use the mathematics
of general relativity

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.740
to deduce what the
mass of the object

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.800
is that they're
orbiting, and that's

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.790
three to four million
times the mass of our sun.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.340
And in addition, if I just
take it a little bit forward,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.470
there's two orbits
that get extremely

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:25.840
close to the central object,
but don't hit whatever it is.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.920
So we know the size,
as well as the mass,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.700
and we know of no
other object that

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.880
can weigh three or four million
times the mass of the sun

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.360
and squeeze into that amount
of space, except a black hole.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.030
So we believe there is a
black hole at the centre

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.205
of our galaxy.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.960
So these are the
indirect ways to check

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.430
the existence of black holes.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.410
Let me come on to
the direct way.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.770
In 1916, just one year after
Einstein formulated his theory

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.170
of general relativity,
he realised that general

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.100
relativity predicts that
gravitational waves exists.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.490
As matter moves
through space and time,

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.622
it forms gravitational waves.

00:21:17.622 --> 00:21:19.330
And the picture you
can have in your mind

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.530
is that as you move your hand
through the surface of a pond,

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.350
you form ripples on the
surface of the pond.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.800
Similarly, as mass moves
through space and time ,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.567
it forms gravitational waves.

00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:34.150
In fact, as we're
moving around, we're

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.010
forming gravitational waves.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.990
However, these gravitation
waves of the motion of ourselves

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.280
are extremely tiny.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:51.220
The gravitational waves caused
by the Earth orbiting the sun

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.830
are also extremely tiny.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.180
As the Earth orbits
the sun, it's

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.230
emitting gravitational
waves in all directions,

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.040
and you can calculate what
the total amount of power

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.960
is from all those gravity waves.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.120
So imagine you gather
them all together

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.120
and say, how powerful is that?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.020
That would be powerful enough
just to light up a light bulb.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.790
So even though these are
existing, the sun and the earth

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.160
is only producing these
tiny, tiny little ripples

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.130
in space and time.

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.860
There's a reason for
why these are so small.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.271
And the reason is that gravity
is an extremely weak force.

00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:35.020
So I'm going to use
the Newtonian language

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.610
because it's convenient here.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.760
We're not used to thinking
of gravity as being weak.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.300
For example, if we jump,
we fall to the ground

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.100
and it feels like
gravity is pulling us

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.540
down with a strong force.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.510
But we can do a very
simple experiment

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.510
which compares gravity, and
the strength of gravity,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.330
to another force.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.750
And it's a very
simple experiment,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.720
but it's an
important experiment.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.150
It involves a magnet
and a paperclip.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.420
And obviously, just like the
beginning of the lecture,

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.810
if we drop the paperclip,
it falls to earth

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.210
under the influence of gravity.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.120
But I can compare the
gravitational force

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.500
of the whole of the planet
Earth on that paperclip

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.980
to the electromagnetic force
on this tiny little magnet.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.570
And we know what will happen.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.310
It holds it up.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.780
And it's a simple observation,
but it's a profound one.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.300
It tells us that gravity
is extremely weak.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.330
It's just that when all the
other forces are not around,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.890
gravity is the only
one left, and it

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.060
dictates what's going on.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.620
So gravity is weak.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.817
Gravitational waves
are very small.

00:23:54.817 --> 00:23:56.650
If we're going to have
any hope of detecting

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.470
gravitational waves, we're
going to have to look

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.375
for a cataclysmic explosion.

00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:06.660
And a cataclysmic explosion
is the coalescence

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.880
of two black holes.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.120
So we imagine we have a
system of two black holes,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.590
perhaps formed like the
picture we had before--

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.040
one went supernova,
formed the black hole,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.790
and then the companion star
later also formed a supernova

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.250
and turned into a black hole.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.980
And those black
holes were rotating,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.050
spinning on their own
axes, but they're also

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.310
rotating around each other.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.970
Because of the simplicity
of black holes,

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.320
specified by their
mass and their spin,

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.000
we can calculate how much
gravitational waves would

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.650
be admitted by the system.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.070
If every black
hole was different

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.120
and a highly complicated
individual object,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.250
we wouldn't be able to do this.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.950
But that simplicity
of black holes

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.380
allows us to
calculate the gravity

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.425
waves that are produced.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.280
And here is a prediction
from general relativity

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.450
of the gravity waves
that are produced.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.520
So we're imagining the two
black holes orbiting each other.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.810
Their emitting
gravitational waves.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.310
As they emit the gravitational
waves, they lose energy

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.470
and they get closer and
closer to each other,

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.920
and they eventually inspiral
and form a single black hole.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.480
So on this graph, on
the vertical axis,

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.250
I've got the strength of
the gravitational waves,

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.670
and on the horizontal
axis, it's a time scale.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.750
And you'll notice that the
time scale is in roughly tenths

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.920
of seconds.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.690
So we're looking at the very
final part of the coalescence

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.070
of these black holes.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.650
For millions of years,
they'll be actually rotating

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.580
around each other, producing
gravitational waves

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.630
at a constant frequency,
like on the left-hand side

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.370
of the graph.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.870
As they get closer, in the
final inspiral and coalescence,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.400
the frequency of the
gravitational waves goes up

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.810
and the amplitude goes up.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:20.130
They form a single
black hole, and then

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.750
the strength of the
gravitational waves dies away.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.660
In fact, this frequency of
these gravitational waves

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.450
being produced in
this process of almost

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.300
the same as audio frequency.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:38.340
So people talk about the
gravitational waves signals

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.500
using the analogy of sound.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.400
So the frequency is constant,
and then as they coalesce,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.890
it goes up in
frequency and louder,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.110
and then it suddenly rings down.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.225
So it's called a
chirp and ring down.

00:26:51.225 --> 00:26:55.100
So it would be
something like wooop.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.315
That's a sound
version of that graph,

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:58.815
if you don't like
looking at graphs.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.905
The point here is that the
simplicity those black holes

00:27:05.905 --> 00:27:09.640
and general relativity allows
us to determine that signal.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.690
So we know, out of prediction
from Einstein's theory

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.590
of relativity, of what
gravity waves are produced,

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.912
gravitational waves, are
produced by these systems.

00:27:20.912 --> 00:27:21.870
How do we measure them?

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.280
The technique is
laser interferometry.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.940
And being a theorist,
I love the fact

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.030
that I can now play around
with some equipment here,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.660
and hopefully not break it.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.710
What I brought in is a
laser interferometer.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.030
And maybe if we can just have--

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.280
yeah, the picture there,
let me just switch this on.

00:27:55.329 --> 00:27:58.640
It should just start
warming up in a second.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.140
OK, right.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.610
So what have we got here?

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.820
I've got it in a black box.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.510
It's not very dangerous, but
it's a little bit dangerous.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.010
So you can't see
it, but you can see

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.170
from above what's happening.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:15.300
We have the laser here, and
it's emitting a laser beam

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.230
straight out the end here.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.020
And this little object
here is a beam splitter.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.320
So half of the light
gets reflected up here

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.700
to a mirror, which then
gets reflected back,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.850
and then will go
straight forward.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:35.530
And the other half will
go through to this mirror

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.840
and then come back
to the splitter

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.260
and then go off
in this direction.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.000
So there is a coherent
laser light beam that's

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.499
split into two beams and then
is sent down in this access.

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:51.915
So let's have a
look what happens.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.670
And if we can have
the lights down.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.930
There are the two
beams I mentioned.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:06.980
And something interesting
happens if we manipulate them

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.890
So they're sitting
on top of each other.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.730
This is the phenomenon
of interference.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:18.560
Light is a wave, and just
like water waves on a pool--

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.140
on the surface of a pond,
or something like that--

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.730
interferes, light
wave also interferes.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.910
The point about this set up is
that this interference pattern

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.480
is very sensitive.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.270
And if you change the
geometry a little bit,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:45.240
fire a sound wave, then you see
that the interference pattern

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.590
changes.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.110
This is exactly the
principle that's

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.870
being used in the
LIGO experiment

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.570
to detect gravitational waves.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.780
Taking laser beams,
interfering them,

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.350
and then seeing when the
gravitational wave comes in,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:08.350
that the interference
pattern has moved.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.230
So can I have the
lights back up again?

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.730
Thank you.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.210
And can we have the
slides back as well?

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.900
Thank you.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:27.640
So here is a photograph, two
photographs, of two detectors.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.670
One in Hanford in Washington,
the upper left-hand side

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.530
of the United States, and
the other one in Livingston

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.930
in Louisiana, down
in the lower right.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.440
And the pictures above them are
pictures of the two jet LIGO

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.760
detectors.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.560
And you can see that
there's two long arms,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.120
and down each of
those arms, which

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.090
are actually four
kilometres long,

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.914
a laser beam is being sent.

00:30:52.914 --> 00:30:54.580
It's being sent and
there's a big mirror

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.800
at the end of one arm.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.080
There's a big mirror at
the end of another arm.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.240
And the light's coming back,
and it's being interfered,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.690
much in the same way we
just demonstrated here,

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.030
at that central
detection facility

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.130
at the apex of the two arms.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.290
If a gravitational wave
comes through this system,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.150
it tends to squeeze
one of the arms,

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.060
makes a little bit shorter,
makes the other arm longer,

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.870
or vise versa.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.000
The gravitational waves that
were caused by the two black

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.270
holes colliding, that
were observed in 2015,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.070
changed the length
of these arms,

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:42.125
these four kilometre arms, by
1,000th the size of an atomic

00:31:42.125 --> 00:31:42.625
nucleus.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.960
This is truly
breathtaking engineering.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.410
All vibrations-- for example,
me hitting the table,

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.720
just like a few moments
ago-- would completely

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.210
swamp the signal.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.129
All seismic vibrations--
all vibrations

00:32:04.129 --> 00:32:06.420
of machinery in the laboratory,
et cetera-- all of that

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.830
has to be shielded away by
elaborate and sophisticated

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.930
engineering.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.650
And once that's happened, you
have this perfectly stable

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.600
system.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.100
If a gravitational wave comes
in, it produces a signal.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.160
And you're waiting for the
movement of 1,000th of the size

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.900
of the diameter over
four kilometres.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.470
One of the key aspects
of this experiment

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.370
is that there should be two.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.310
The distance between
the two detectors

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.920
is about 3,000 kilometres.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.890
So given that
gravitational waves

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.090
move at the speed of
light, the time taken--

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.960
the gravitational wave will
hit one of the detectors first,

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.440
and it will hit the second
one a little bit later.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.520
And a little bit later
is exactly quantifiable.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.230
It's about 10 milliseconds.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.680
So if a gravitational
wave signal has come in,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.270
the two signals,
when you move them

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.880
on top of each other
separated by 10 milliseconds,

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.290
should be the same.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.540
And in the lower right-hand of
the figure of the image, that

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.760
is actually the real data
that was published by the LIGO

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.610
experiment, saying we have
detected gravitational waves.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.010
Now, it's true that there's
a lot of noise there,

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.100
but the main feature that
I want you to pick up on

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.880
is that they are exactly
in phase, especially

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.820
towards the latter
part of the event.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.350
They're exactly in phase.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.010
You can see that constant
frequency process,

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:43.730
the increasing amplitude, the
chirp, and then the ring down.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.480
As I said before, this was
the first direct detection

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.600
of black holes, the
first direct detection

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.320
of gravitational waves, and
the first direct detection

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.827
of a binary system
of black holes.

00:34:02.827 --> 00:34:04.410
So if you think about
it for a moment,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.230
it's very hard to
know that you have

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.120
a binary system of black holes.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.270
A black hole and a star,
you look for X-rays,

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.610
and you also see the
light coming from a star.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.830
But if you have just
two black holes,

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.340
they might be producing X-rays
from some remnant, accretion

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.221
that surrounds them.

00:34:20.221 --> 00:34:22.429
But you wouldn't know if
that's one black hole or two

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:24.090
black holes.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.210
So this is the first
direct evidence

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.480
that there are binary systems
of black holes in the universe.

00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:34.860
I've blown your mind
once, hopefully,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.868
about the engineering feat.

00:34:36.868 --> 00:34:38.159
I want to blow your mind again.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.560
By studying that
signal and comparing it

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.320
to the theoretical
observations predictions

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.070
from general relativity, we
know that the masses of the two

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:55.920
black holes were 36 times the
mass of our sun and 29 times

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.570
the mass of our sun.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.550
In fact, before
this experiment, we

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.140
didn't know such black
holes of that mass existed.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.710
They coalesced to form a black
hole, which weighs 62 times

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.990
the mass of our sun.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.340
So there's one equation in
this talk, and here it is.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:19.700
36 plus 29 minus
62, and that's 3.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.930
So after they coalesced,
there was three times

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.040
the mass of the sun of
matter that was ejected

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.120
into gravitational waves.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.880
And the amount of energy
that is, you use the famous E

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:40.670
equals mc squared
equation of Einstein.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.180
And that was released in
a tenth of a second, which

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:49.820
was that final chirp on the
graph that I showed before.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.120
The amount of power that
was produced in that moment

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.150
was 3 times 10 to the 49 watts.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.280
Even if you have
facility with numbers--

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.620
you're a mathematician
or you're a physicist--

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.260
when you get numbers
like this, 10 to the 49,

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:12.610
that's 1 with 49 0's following
it, you lose intuition.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.200
This is a huge number.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.870
So you can try and
think about, what's

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.020
a powerful object that you
know about in the universe?

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.660
You might begin on earth
with powerful objects,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.070
nuclear reactors, for example.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.960
Forget that.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.880
Let's go to the sun.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.330
Let's think of the
sun for a moment.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:36.290
All of the power from the sun
reaching us about 90 million

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:42.730
miles away, driving all of
life on Earth, that power,

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.520
the total power
emitted by the sun,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.630
is about 10 to the 24
watts, 1 followed by 24 0's.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.470
So this is much, much
more powerful than all

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.680
of the power emitted by the sun.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.220
In fact, it's more power
emitted by all of the stars,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.040
not just in our
galaxy, but in all

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.332
of the galaxies in the universe.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.560
So when I mentioned
cataclysmic explosion earlier,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.510
this simplicity of space-time,
just the mass and the spin

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.410
swirling around each other, that
rearrangement of space and time

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:28.970
into a single black hole
is truly cataclysmic,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:33.996
and that's despite the
fact that gravity is weak,

00:37:33.996 --> 00:37:35.870
in the sense that I was
describing it before.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.720
We also know that the
event happened about 1.3

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.090
billion light years away.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.760
That means the
gravitational waves

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.980
were emitted about
1.3 billion years ago

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.340
and then arrived
at Earth in 2015.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.120
And I find that kind of poetic.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.330
1.3 billion years
ago, Earth had just

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.460
evolved from single
celled organisms

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.870
to multicellular organisms.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.370
And we wait a little bit longer,
and multicellular organisms

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.450
become fish and reptiles.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.480
Dinosaurs come, dinosaurs go.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.100
Mammals come, evolve.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.300
Humans evolve.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.260
Isaac Newton comes.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.030
Einstein comes.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.620
We start building this detector.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.080
And I say we because it is we.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.600
It is humanity who does this.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.980
We build this detector, and
finally, when it's ready to go,

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.670
it has its upgrade,
we switch it on.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.190
And actually very soon after
the upgrade, we switched on.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.580
Bang, the signal is
there, coming towards us.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.810
I also want to
emphasise at this point

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:54.260
that gravitational waves,
observations that we've had,

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.927
and there's been
three more since then,

00:38:55.927 --> 00:38:57.260
there was just one two days ago.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.910
You may have noticed
that in the news--

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:03.410
it's not just verifying
that Einstein was right.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.810
It's not verifying that,
oh, black holes really do

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.330
exist, confirming what we knew.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.480
That's all true, but the
really exciting thing

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.750
is it's a new type of
astronomy that's being created.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.770
We now have a new window
at looking at the universe.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.590
Not through electric
electromagnetic radiation,

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.240
like in the telescopes
we've been using,

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.950
but by gravitational waves.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.300
And we're going to learn
more about black holes

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.440
and their properties
and their distribution,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.014
and we probably are
going to learn things

00:39:36.014 --> 00:39:37.430
that are brand new
that we haven't

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.880
thought about before as well.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.780
So gravitational wave
astronomy and observations

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.470
over the next 10,
20, 30, 40 years

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.210
is going to be an extremely
exciting field in science,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.100
or fundamental science.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.240
OK, so let's leave
the observations

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.436
and let's go back to some
theoretical pondering.

00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:01.060
Let's return to the
question about what

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.967
happens inside a black hole.

00:40:03.967 --> 00:40:05.800
So the two figures here
are Stephen Hawking,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.420
of course, and Roger Penrose,
who in the '60s and early '70s

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.340
really pioneered and laid the
foundations for understanding

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.410
the true properties
of black holes,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:21.940
and in particular, what happens
deep inside the black hole.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.950
If you cross into the event
horizon, as I've said before,

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.420
you are never coming out
past the event horizon.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.640
In fact, if you crossed
a big enough black hole,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.790
you wouldn't even notice
that anything was different.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:39.290
You would feel exactly the same
as if I stood on this table

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.090
and jumped off the
table, so I would

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.070
be in freefall for a moment.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.590
That sense of freefall
would be exactly what

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.200
you would feel, if the
black hole was big enough,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.870
as you crossed
the event horizon.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.110
As time went on, you
would then find, actually,

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.216
you would be squeezed
and stretched.

00:40:58.216 --> 00:41:02.110
It's called spaghettification.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.410
You'd be squeezed and
stretched, and eventually, you

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.660
would confront what's
inside the black hole,

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.390
this space-time singularity.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:15.080
And this space-time
singularity is inevitable.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.740
And the picture I've drawn
doesn't capture a key feature

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.222
of space-time singularities.

00:41:21.222 --> 00:41:23.180
And the key feature of
space-time singularities

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.830
inside black holes is that
they're singularities in time

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:28.625
and not in space.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.480
If a singularity was
a point in space--

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.970
let's imagine it was in
the centre of this room--

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.790
you have this strong sense that
you should be able to avoid it.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.500
If you find your
rocket, surely I

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.040
could just move away from
the space-time singularity.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.770
Why do I have to hit the
space-time time singularity?

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.770
That's true, and that's because
space-time singularities

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:53.870
and black holes are
not of that form.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.840
Space-time singularity
is a singularity in time,

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.890
and you should think of a
moment in time in the future

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.540
that you can't avoid.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:08.110
We can't avoid next Tuesday,
and that's exactly--

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.130
not rough, exactly--
how you can't

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.920
avoid the space-time
singularity in a black hole.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.850
And it's this change of grammar
that's actually important.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.614
A space-time
singularity happens.

00:42:21.614 --> 00:42:25.020
You go inside the event horizon
and the space-time singularity

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.520
will inevitably happen.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.770
For the biggest black
holes that we know of.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.630
It's of the order of 100 hours.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.920
Inside the black hole in
the centre of our galaxy,

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.590
it's about three hours, I think.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.200
Or maybe it's one hour.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.650
It's roughly that.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:46.940
Interestingly, the longest you
have before the singularity

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.340
happens is just to relax.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.580
You just freefall, and that's
the longest you've got.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.630
Any other motion you do, if
you switch on your rockets,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.860
it makes your--

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.814
the singularity happens quicker.

00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:04.730
I think there's a life
lesson there somewhere,

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:05.896
but I'm not sure what it is.

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:10.490
But it's interesting.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.860
I think it's not
emphasised enough,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:19.010
that one more level of
that analogy with Tuesday

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.480
is firing your rockets
trying to avoid

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.250
the space-time singularity would
be exactly analogous to say,

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.860
I'm going to hop in
my car and I'm not

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.020
sure which direction
you are driving,

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.750
but you just try and drive
away from next Tuesday.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.590
It's meaningless.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.320
And similarly,
that's exactly what's

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.870
happening inside the black hole.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.650
So what is a
space-time singularity?

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.990
So a space-time
singularity is where

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.540
the laws of general
relativity break down.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.760
So general relativity
is no longer

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.910
valid at the
space-time singularity.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.420
And at first hearing this, that
sounds like a very bad thing.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.560
It sounds like general
relativity is no longer--

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.510
it's somehow a flawed theory.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.050
It can't tell us what we need
to know about what would happen

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.630
deep inside a black hole.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.606
But, in fact, that's completely
the wrong way of looking at it.

00:44:13.606 --> 00:44:15.480
What the space-time
singularities are telling

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.480
us is that there's
an opportunity

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.100
for deeper insight into the
fundamental laws of physics.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.930
We know that general
relativity is not

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.680
the theory of everything.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.230
After all, it
doesn't describe any

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.740
of the quantum
forces, which we'll

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.440
be discussing in a moment.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.920
So there must be a bigger
theoretical framework,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.830
deeper fundamental physics,
beyond general relativity.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.030
And what the result of Stephen
Hawking and Roger Penrose says

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.390
is that black holes
are a great place

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:51.980
to think about where you
should go beyond our existing

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.610
knowledge.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.970
Black holes aren't
the only place

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.490
that space-time
singularities exist.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.870
They also exist at the very
beginning of the Big Bang.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.730
So if you look at all
the galaxies today,

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.430
they're all expanding
away from each other.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.220
If you run the history of the
universe backwards in time,

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.090
those galaxies will be getting
closer and closer and closer.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.090
And about 14 billion years
ago, all of those galaxies

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:24.520
would be on top of each other,
and that would be the Big Bang.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.620
And that moment if the
Big Bang, in the context

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.570
of Einstein's theory
of general relativity,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.350
is a space-time singularity.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.500
So another place to think
about fundamental physics

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:39.780
beyond general relativity is the
very beginning of the Big Bang,

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.940
or the very early
part of the universe.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.090
Up until now, I've just been
just describing gravity,

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.000
but I now introduce
another player

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.730
into the game, which
is the quantum world.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:58.020
All of fundamental physics
rests on two pillars.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.220
On the one hand, Einstein's
theory of general relativity,

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.310
describing gravity.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.960
And on the other,
the quantum world,

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.630
which describes all of
elementary particle physics--

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.110
electrons, protons,
neutrons, quarks.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:15.910
All of the elementary
particles that

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.180
are observed in the particle
accelerators, including

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:24.902
the Large Hadron Collider, are
described by the quantum world.

00:46:24.902 --> 00:46:26.860
And there's something
called the standard model

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.680
of particle physics, which
encapsulates our deepest

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.890
understanding of
elementary particles

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.130
and their interactions.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:41.170
Both of these fundamental
theories are extremely accurate

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:46.960
and describe nature with
exquisite precision and beauty,

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.640
but they're mathematically
inconsistent.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.680
And that's a paradox
when you first hear it,

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.480
but it has a very
simple explanation.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.040
When I've been
describing gravity,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.800
I've literally been forgetting
about the quantum world.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.680
And we can do that because
all of the quantum forces--

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.010
for example, the electromagnetic
force is one of those forces--

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:17.200
are neutralised over the scales
that I've been describing.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.030
So the only force
that's important,

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.950
using the Newtonian
language of gravity

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.770
on the scales of black holes
and galaxies and so on,

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:28.420
is gravity itself.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.910
And we use Einstein's
theory of general relativity

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.070
and forget about
the quantum world.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.580
Similarly, when people
do experiments in Geneva

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.110
at the Large Hadron
Collider, they

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.430
understand and appreciate that
the gravitational interactions

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.890
are extremely tiny compared
to the interactions they're

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:48.970
looking at.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.400
Think of the paperclip
and the magnet.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.490
And they, again, pretend that
gravity doesn't exist at all.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.010
They just pretend
it's not there.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:03.740
So in both domains, we're
approximating what's going on.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.480
The quantum world,
we approximate

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.000
by saying there's no gravity.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.740
And in these descriptions
of black holes

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.840
and gravitational
waves, and so on,

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:17.310
we approximate by saying the
quantum world doesn't exist.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.130
But nevertheless, we would
like to do better than that.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.500
We would like to put
these both together

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.500
into a cohesive,
logical framework.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.020
And the question
remains, then, is

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:34.087
how do we unify these two
great pillars of knowledge?

00:48:34.087 --> 00:48:36.420
So in the rest of the talk,
I want to just give you some

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.755
flavour why we think black
holes are the key laboratory,

00:48:40.755 --> 00:48:46.122
or a key laboratory, for that
next stage of unification

00:48:46.122 --> 00:48:47.080
in fundamental physics.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.236
I can just tell you one
thing about quantum theory

00:48:55.236 --> 00:48:56.610
to motivate what
I wanted to say.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.550
In quantum theory, the
vacuum, empty space and time,

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.820
is actually not as empty
as you might think.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.500
A way of thinking
about it, it's a sea

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.110
of virtual particles
and anti-particles

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.950
coming into existence out of
nothing, literally nothing,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:21.440
existing for a little while,
and then annihilating away

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.990
to nothing.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.020
So in this picture, I've got--

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.910
a red arrow might
represent an electron

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:35.020
coming into being with its
anti-particle, a positron.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.240
They exist for a little,
short amount of time,

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.140
and then they annihilate away.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.980
And we call these
particles virtual,

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.250
because they're not
directly detected.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.190
However, they can be
indirectly detected,

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.630
or their effects can
be indirectly detected.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:54.490
And they can be measured, and
we know that these are real,

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:59.050
So our conception of what the
vacuum is in quantum theory

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.980
is changed from
our naive picture.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.110
Stephen Hawking asked
the great question,

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:12.330
in essence, what happens to
these processes in the presence

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:14.970
of a black hole?

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.840
Now, Stephen
Hawking did not have

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.260
the theory of quantum gravity.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.580
This is a work in progress.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:27.680
But he's taking one component
of the quantum theory

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.200
and taking a component
of general relativity,

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.320
a black hole, and
fusing them together

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.430
to obtain some insight.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.230
And by doing a
specific calculation,

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.310
he showed that the
following happens.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:48.150
Away from the black
hole, these processes,

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.490
these virtual
processes, continue

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:54.780
much as they were happening as
if there wasn't a black hole.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.500
But near the event
horizon, occasionally

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.230
one of these particles
can be stripped off,

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:04.110
one of the virtual particles
can be stripped off,

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.780
it goes inside
the event horizon,

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:11.720
and the singularity
will happen for it.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:19.390
The other particle can escape
away from the black hole.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:22.390
And in this process, the
particle that escapes

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.720
turns into a real particle.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.560
So the net effect
of this process

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.850
is the black hole, with this
virtual processes happening

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.810
all over the place, is
such that, effectively,

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.360
the black hole is
emitting particles.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.350
And it's not just emitting
particles in any old way.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.750
It's emitting them in
a very precise way.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.330
It's emitting them it as
if it was a hot object

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.800
with a temperature.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.350
And this Stephen Hawking's
famous Hawking radiation.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.230
There's more.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.630
The properties of black
holes obey a series

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:12.610
of laws, which have the same
form as the laws governing

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.410
thermal systems.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:18.486
A thermal system is any
system involving heat,

00:52:18.486 --> 00:52:19.610
so think of a steam engine.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.340
There's very precise
laws that were developed

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:29.140
in the 19th century to describe
the physics of steam engines,

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.580
and any objects involving heat.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.260
And these laws have
a great universality,

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.730
that are another
great achievement

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:41.050
in the quest for understanding
fundamental physics.

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:45.280
They explain, for example, if
you pump up a bicycle tyre,

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.300
the valve will always get hot.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.660
If you release the valve and
the air comes rushing out,

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.320
the valve will get cold.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.349
If it's a hot, sunny day
and you're in your kitchen

00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:58.390
and you think you'd like
to be cooled down a bit,

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.650
you might be tempted
to open the fridge door

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.380
and the cold air comes out.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.060
But these laws
that I'm describing

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.910
would say if you do that,
overall, the temperature

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:15.240
the room will increase,
because the heat being produced

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.670
at the back of the
fridge will always

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.640
be bigger than the
cold air coming out

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.700
of the fridge, or the
reduction of temperature.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.400
So these laws, they
basically govern everything

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.060
in everyday life with
anything to do with heat.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.660
It's quite remarkable
that black holes

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.080
obey these same kinds of laws.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.050
These laws of
thermal systems were

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.830
developed in the
mid-19th century,

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.770
before atoms were
universally accepted

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.330
as fundamental building
blocks of matter.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:00.940
When the atomic
theory came along,

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:05.110
people realised that it
explained where these thermal

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:07.040
those came from.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:12.060
The thermal laws have a
microscopic explanation.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.040
So for example, take
a hot cup of tea.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:18.280
It has heat.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.900
It has a temperature.

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:24.830
But we from the point
of view of atoms, that

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:28.629
can be explained in terms
of the individual motions

00:54:28.629 --> 00:54:29.170
of the atoms.

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.260
So heat is this disordered
motion of the atoms.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:41.140
That's what it is, in terms
of this atomistic big picture.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.580
And for example, the
temperature of the tea

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:50.310
is determined by the average
speed of these atoms.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.720
So the atomic picture
provided a deeper, more

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.340
profound understanding of
what these thermal laws were.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.710
And that's the status of
black hole thermodynamics,

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:11.750
or thermal physics,
at the moment.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:15.290
We know that they
obey a series of laws,

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:18.770
but we don't have the
underlying picture

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:23.680
of atoms of space and time
which explains those laws.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.400
So that's one of the big
outstanding question, what

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.880
is the microscopic
description in understanding

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.460
of these thermal laws?

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.540
What happens when the black
hole emits its particles,

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.980
more and more particles?

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.779
Eventually, it will
reduce to nothing.

00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:45.570
And remember, I said
in general relativity,

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.390
black holes are very
simple, that no matter how

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:51.420
they were formed, from all
the matter of the collapsing

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.940
star, material in the
star, they were then

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:59.970
specified by the mass and the
charge, the mass and the spin.

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.830
If the black hole
then evaporates,

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.650
producing all this
thermal radiation,

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:09.000
it seems like we have a process
in which information has turned

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.510
into pure thermal
radiation, and that

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:17.740
goes against the grain
of quantum theory.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.160
That's a major
outstanding question,

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.460
what happens to the black
hole as it fully evaporates?

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:31.400
A variation of that
question is the singularity

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.520
inside the black
hole will be revealed

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.090
when the black hole evaporates.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.350
So what is the nature of the
singularity, and what is that?

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:44.980
These new atoms of space and
time tell us what that is

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.720
and how it's resolved.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.350
This is the cutting
edge of research

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.110
into black hole physics today.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:57.440
So I just wanted to end the talk
with some comments about string

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.060
theory.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:03.580
So string theory is an attempt
to unify quantum theory

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:08.212
with Einstein's theory
of general relativity.

00:57:08.212 --> 00:57:09.920
And the fundamental
idea of string theory

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.660
is extremely simple.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.980
The idea is this.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:19.640
If you zoomed in
into the atom, you

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.010
would find a halo of electrons
surrounding a nucleus

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.330
of protons and neutrons.

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:27.600
If you zoomed into the
protons and neutrons,

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.370
you would find quarks.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:32.740
If you zoomed further
into the quarks,

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.180
we don't know what
you would find,

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.220
but we think you'll find
something, some deeper

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.660
structure.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.010
But don't go to the next step,
go all the way to the end,

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.500
and what is the endpoint
of that process?

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.500
And the end process,
it's postulated,

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.750
is that the fundamental
building blocks

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:54.680
are strings, these one
dimensional filaments of energy

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.490
which would have no
further substructure.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.940
And one of the most
appealing things in strings

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.510
is that the different
vibrations of the string

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:08.490
would correspond to different
elementary particles.

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:11.960
So the one string, if it's
vibrating, just like a violin

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.710
string, one note would
correspond to an electron,

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:19.640
another note would correspond
to a quark, another note

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.040
to a photon, a
particle of light,

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:28.550
and also another vibration
would correspond to a graviton,

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.540
a quantum particle of gravity.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.130
So we don't know yet if
string theory is correct,

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:42.630
but research in string theory,
or a large branch of research,

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:45.120
is trying to address
these questions

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.230
of the thermal
properties of black holes

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:52.700
to have a deeper understanding
of what black holes are,

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.730
as well as to get evidence
that string theory is actually

00:58:55.730 --> 00:59:01.020
on the right track, and it
is the theory that unifies

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.100
quantum theory and gravity.

00:59:07.515 --> 00:59:08.890
So in tonight's
lecture, I wanted

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:11.210
to tell you several things.

00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:15.238
The first was that black
holes are really cool.

00:59:15.238 --> 00:59:19.990
They're structures in the
fabric of space and time itself.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.014
They have this
beautiful simplicity,

00:59:22.014 --> 00:59:24.430
and they really are amongst
the most extraordinary objects

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.840
that exist in the universe.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.370
Black holes are real.

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:31.260
We've had indirect
evidence that black holes

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.480
are real for a long
time, but we now

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.360
have this beautiful direct
detection of black holes

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.490
that was made by
the LIGO experiments

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:42.050
in 2015, and then
three times since then.

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:46.360
And this section of
gravitational waves

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.320
is presaging in a
new era of astronomy.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.060
This is not the end of a story.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:56.230
Like many developments in
physics, as one story ends,

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:57.610
a new one opens up.

00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.260
And the new one
that's opening up

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:04.109
is this new era of astronomy
using gravitational waves.

01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:06.400
For example, one of the things
that we're going to do--

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.330
we, I include humanity
in the we there--

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:15.060
is put satellites up in
space, and they're going to be

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.890
separated a million
kilometres apart,

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:21.790
and we're going to be looking
to the gravitational waves that

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:25.690
might change the length, that
million kilometres by 1,000th

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:29.330
of the size of the
diameter of a proton.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.790
It's breathtaking what we
are thinking about doing,

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.910
and it's being
planned to be done

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:37.700
in the next 20, 30, 40 years.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.450
So black holes are real,
and finally, black holes

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:44.000
are the way forward.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.640
By thinking about
quantum theory,

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.010
we know that there
are thermal objects.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.470
We know there are space-time
singularities, where

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.510
we need a quantum
theory of gravity

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:55.490
to tell us what's going on.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.710
And black holes, and thinking
about their properties,

01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.030
is the arena in which we
think that we can get the most

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:02.840
insight in that next step.

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:12.790
The last point I wanted to
make was a recurring theme

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.630
that's gone throughout the
talk is that, often, there's

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:20.770
very long time scales between
developments, both in theory--

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:26.670
development of fundamental
theoretical physics

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.450
over the scale of
hundreds of years.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:30.880
Sometimes it's punctuated
by rapid development,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.150
but often it's over the
scale of 100 years--

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.730
and also, experimental
verification.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.890
Predictions come up
with new theories,

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:41.300
but we sometimes have
to wait 10, 20, 30,

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.490
again, up to 100 years
before we get evidence

01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:48.070
and confirm the predictions.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:52.222
But that's the nature of the
activity we are undertaking.

01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:55.866
And even though the
progress can be slow,

01:01:55.866 --> 01:01:57.490
the clearest message
that comes through

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.820
is that progress does get made.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.390
We do make inexorable
progress in obtaining a deeper

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.970
understanding of the
fundamental laws of physics,

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:10.840
and I think that's surely
one of the great intellectual

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.040
and cultural achievements
of all of humanity.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.540
Thank you.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.990
So this is actually--
there'll be another talk--

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.850
it's actually another
of the deep clues

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:29.830
to how to unify quantum
theory and gravity.
