00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.536
Speaking
of cover-ups-- this guy?

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.339
This guy (bleep).

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.241
WOMAN: According to this
 just-released report

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.077
 in The New Yorker, 
 media company AMI,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.279
 which owns 
 the National Enquirer,

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:17.750
 paid a doorman, Dino Sajudin, 
 who worked at Trump Tower,

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.621
 $30,000 to sign
 a nondisclosure agreement

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.657
 after he offered the company
 a salacious story

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.961
 about the then-candidate Trump
 during the 2016 election.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.997
The story being that he knew

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.667
that Donald Trump had fathered
a child with a former employee.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.369
Oh, snap!

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.672
(chanting):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.707
Trump might have a secret kid?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.342
I bet everyone

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.645
who doesn't know their father
right now is panicking.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.447
(laughter)

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.848
Yeah, they're phoning
their moms like,

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.217
"Tell me it wasn't him, Mom!
Tell me it wasn't him!

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.418
"Tell me it was a crackhead!

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.520
Tell me
I have crackhead blood, Mama."

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.523
Every week we seem to find out
that someone else got money

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.525
to keep quiet
about one of Trump's affairs.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.594
Like, at this point,
it's almost like

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.063
his dong has its own economy,
you know?

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.299
Yeah, like, a GDP--
a gross domestic penis.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.967
That's what
it feels like right now.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.368
I mean, think about it.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.238
Everyone's getting paid--
doormen, porn stars, lawyers.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.606
At this point, I'm worried

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.508
that if Trump stops cheating
on Melania,

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:16.709
the stock market'll crash.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.311
There's gonna be
another recession.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.879
And now, everyone...
everyone in this story

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.581
is talking about
whether these payoffs

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.983
constitute illegal
campaign contributions.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.351
That's why it's big news.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.253
But for me,
there's a bigger story here.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.989
You realize if you were born
in the 1980s,

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:34.293
 you might be
Donald Trump's child. Yeah.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:38.564
You could be in line to inherit
billions of dollars in debt.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.566
(laughter)

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.536
Yeah, in fact, I-I was a child
born in the 1980s.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.204
Oh, my gosh!

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.306
It's me.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.408
(laughter)

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.344
Papa Donald?

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.546
(laughter)

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.115
I always felt... I always felt
like there was something,

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:59.118
something connecting
the two of us.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.420
So similar, folks.
Everyone said it.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.823
(speaking like Trump):
I can see it now.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:07.827
I'll show you
my birth certificate.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.829
But let's move on.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:12.799
(cheers and applause)

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.302
Let's move on
from the big news of the week

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.871
to how we all get the big news
of the week-- Facebook.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.107
In the wake of
the Cambridge Analytica scandal,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.441
Congress had questions

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.744
about how Facebook gathers
and shares user data,

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.913
and whether government
regulation might be needed

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.381
to keep them in check.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.216
So, they called in Facebook CEO

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.451
and less-charismatic Rain Man,
Mark Zuckerberg

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.453
for two days of hearings

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:37.456
involving 44 senators,
55 representatives

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.059
and a dazzling array
of facial expressions.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.794
Look at all those different
facial expressions.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:43.563
Look at that. So hu-man.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.998
And these long hearings
can be grueling,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.533
which is maybe why Zuckerberg

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.902
brought an extra cushion
with him to sit there.

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.271
Look at that.
That is so cute. Aw, man.

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:54.273
You got to protect
your Silicon Valley,

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:56.042
-you know what I mean?
-(laughter)

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.211
And now, and now,
some of the congresspeople

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.912
seem to have done
their homework,

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:03.015
but even when they did,
they still didn't seem to know

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:05.952
how to ask the right questions.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.621
What was Facemash?
And is it still up and running?

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:10.323
You put up pictures of two women

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.691
and decide which one
was the better...

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.259
more attractive of the two,
is that right?

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:17.763
I'm communicating with
my friends on Facebook and...

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:23.336
indicate that, uh... I love
a certain kind of chocolate.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.806
Let's say I'm e-mailing about
 Black Panther within WhatsApp,

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.409
do I get a WhatsA... do I get
a Black Panther banner ad?

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:33.779
Okay. First of all,
you don't e-mail in WhatsApp.

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.314
-(laughter)
-That's like saying,

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.717
"I'll DM you
from my fax machine."

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.186
Second of all, who's e-mailing
about Black Panther?

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:41.921
Like, what are you
writing about?

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:44.724
"To whom it may concern:
Is this your king?!

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.025
"Is this your king?!

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.727
Kind regards, Killmonger."

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.462
Now, to be fair, to be fair,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.631
some lawmakers did know
what questions to ask,

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.266
and that's when Zuckerberg

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.936
suddenly became the person who
didn't know how Facebook works.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.038
There have been reports
that Facebook can track

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.541
a user's Internet
browsing activity

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:08.014
even after that user has logged
off of the Facebook platform.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:12.418
Can you confirm whether or not
this is true?

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.086
Um, Senator...

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.088
I-I want to make sure
I get this accurate,

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:18.924
so it would probably be better
to have my team follow up...

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.226
So you don't know?

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.261
If they choose
to delete their account,

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:24.263
how long do you keep their data?

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.199
I don't know the answer to that
off the top of my head.

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.536
I do not have
that information... with me.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:31.537
Senator, I don't know.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.172
Congresswoman...
I don't remember

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.840
if we had a financial penalty.

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:36.375
You're the CEO of the company...

00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:39.712
I'm not... I'm not sure
of the answer to that question.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.914
Is it just me, or does
Mark Zuckerberg sound like

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:43.316
he was coached by Siri?

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.519
So like, "I'm sorry,
I don't know the answer to that.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:49.055
But here are five
Chinese restaurants nearby."

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.290
That's not what
I was searching for!

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.993
Like, I'm not saying
he should have the answer

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.295
to every question, but I think
it's a little strange

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:58.731
that the guy who bragged
for years about being a genius

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:01.000
suddenly doesn't know
where the "like" button is.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.868
You know? It's like Zuckerberg's
trying to pull

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.270
a reverse Keyser SÃ¶ze.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:06.238
He started out smart,
and then now he's in trouble,

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.840
and he's trying to limp
at the end.

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.343
It's like, "Dude, we saw you.
We know you're smart."

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.412
And while there are many things
Mark Zuckerberg didn't know,

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.948
there was one thing
he was sure about:

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:19.752
he was very, very sorry.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.721 line:0%
We didn't take
a broad enough view

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:25.624 line:0%
of our responsibility,
and that was a big mistake.

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:28.294 line:0%
It was my mistake,
and I'm sorry.

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.363 line:0%
It sounds like we made
a mistake there,

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.064 line:0%
and I apologize for that.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.566 line:0%
In retrospect, it was a mistake.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.534 line:0%
We have made a lot of mistakes
in running the company.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.870 line:0%
It was my mistake,
and I'm sorry.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:39.872
"I'm a human, and I'm sorry."

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:41.807
You know,
I just realized something.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.377
This is the first time in a year
we've seen a man apologizing

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.912
for something
and it wasn't sexual harassment.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:49.115
Yeah. Progress.
This is progress, people.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.584
-(cheering, applause)
-Look at you, Zuck.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.589
And now, if you started this
week thinking that Washington

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:59.725
was going to punish Facebook
for how they treated our data,

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.293
then I'm sorry--

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.963
because, by the looks of it,
even Congress doesn't believe

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.232
that they can take on Facebook.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.134
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.103
There are gonna be a whole bunch
of bills introduced...

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.072
to regulate Facebook.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:15.674
It's up to you
whether they pass or not.

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:18.811
You can go back home...

00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:22.515
uh, spend $10 million
on lobbyists and fight us,

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.718
or you can go back home...

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:28.421
and help us solve this problem.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:30.589
-What?
-(laughter)

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:33.492
So all it takes to beat Congress
is $10 million?

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:35.428
That's nothing.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.431
Mark Zuckerberg spends that
on his laughing lessons.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.099
He's like, "Moo"?

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:42.201
"No, it's 'ha-ha.'
Try again, Mark."

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:45.304
"Woof"?
"No, it's 'ha-ha.'"

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.506
What Senator Kenny...
Kennedy said there

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.142
is both depressing
and refreshingly honest

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:51.377
at the same time.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.913
Like, he knows
that lobbyists rule Washington,

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:55.915
and Facebook can afford
a shit-ton of lobbyists.

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.883
So all lawmakers
can really do is

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.519
just chastise Facebook publicly
and then ask them nicely

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.721
to go and think
about what they've done.

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.824
That's all they can do.
Basically, Congress has to deal

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.992
with big corporations
the way rich white people

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:09.028
punish their kids--
they just got to be like,

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.063
"Young man, there's gonna be
consequences for this.

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:13.265
"Now, you go
to one of your bedrooms

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:15.267
"and figure out what
the consequences should be!

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.670
"And give me your iPhone!
Here's the newer one.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.205
Go away."

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.440
So after ten hours
of questioning,

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:24.410
all Congress got was non-answers
and robo-sorries.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:26.979
And while those apologies
might have seemed worthless,

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:28.514
the stock market disagreed.

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.083
Because once it became clear
that Congress wasn't planning

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.818
to do anything
to regulate Facebook,

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:34.920
the company's stock
went up so much

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.790
that Zuckerberg's net worth
rose by $3 billion

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:40.292
in just the first day
of testimony.

00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:41.794
Yeah. $3 billion.

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:45.498
That works out to about
$10 million a minute.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.100
Just for testifying in Congress.

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:50.302
So I guess what I'm saying is,

00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:53.772
Congress, if you need me
to testify for some shit...

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:55.140
(laughter, applause)

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:57.906
...I don't know what I did,
but I'm sorry.
