00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.240
NARRATOR: London,
England, March 19, 2002.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.809
At 8:00 AM, the National
High Tech Crime Unit

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:13.746
arrives at the home of
34-year-old Scottish systems

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.816
administrator Gary McKinnon.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.520
They are there to arrest him
on behalf of the United States

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:24.157
Justice Department and NASA.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.394
For the past year, McKinnon has
been hacking into top secret

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:32.498
Pentagon and NASA computers.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.701
What he uncovered were
files that he claims

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.805
could provide undeniable
proof that the Majestic

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:43.443
12 and the Secret Space Program
it gave rise to truly exist.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.578
[music playing]

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.514
Among the things I found,
there was an Excel spreadsheet

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:51.651
entitled non-terrestrial
officers,

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.454
which I took to be a
space-going fleet made

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.457
of human personnel, not aliens.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.858
It did list their names.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.460
I couldn't find them on
the internet at the time.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.462
There was also a list of ships.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.663
I googled with the ship names.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.198
There were no matches.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.834
So I knew they weren't
ocean-going vessels.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:12.138
Interestingly, some of
the names of these ships

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:17.343
were people allegedly
involved in Majestic 12.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.479
If there was a
secret space program,

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.348
and if it has anything to
do with back engineering

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.853
crashed alien spacecraft,
then those MJ 12 people

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.555
are exactly the ones
you would expect to find

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:30.890
name checked in this way.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.558
[music playing]

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.161
NARRATOR: According to
McKinnon, the most shocking file

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:40.600
he came across was on a computer
at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.369
Within a folder
labeled Unfiltered,

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:46.706
he spotted a thumbnail
image of a high res NASA

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.176
satellite photo which
appeared to depict

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.579
an unusual spacecraft.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.381
I double clicked
on this image,

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:57.650
and it was coming
down very slowly.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:02.622
But I could see this tubular,
classic cigar-shaped UFO

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.857
with these kind
of geodesic domes,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.894
like half a golf ball stuck
on top and underneath.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.531
And I'm just amazed, because
I've found real evidence

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.933
of what I thought was
a UFO, but it could

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.202
have been a secret space ship.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.737
Who knows.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.206
But there it was in front of
me, coming down the screen.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.376
And then suddenly, I saw the
mouse move across the screen,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.345
right click the LAN icon
and choose disconnect.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:28.481
And lost the chance
to fully transfer

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.550
the photo to my machine.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:36.422
So it was a Eureka moment,
but also, ah, they got me.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.392
ROBERT WOOD: The secrecy
associated with MJ 12

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.929
in my judgment, has permitted
us to spend a huge amount

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.298
of money, trillions of dollars.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.833
My more recent conclusion is
that some of the trillions

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:52.572
of dollars of money have been
used to take the technology we

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:56.509
have discovered and build
gravity control devices that we

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.711
would see sometimes as UFOs.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:02.248
So if you look in the
sky now, in my opinion,

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.784
it's 50/50 chance that
it's ours versus theirs.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.653
[music playing]

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.655
NARRATOR: According
to Corey Goode,

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:12.992
what Gary McKinnon discovered
in the top secret Pentagon

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:19.599
and NASA files is in line
with his own experiences.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.468
Gary ended up being
the first person

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:25.805
to uncover tangible
proof of these programs

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.873
through his hacking.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.875
Interestingly enough,
the information

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:33.613
he obtained on the different
types of spacecraft,

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:38.551
the non-terrestrial officers,
fleet to fleet transfers,

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:43.623
all of this perfectly coincided
with Project Solar Warden.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.358
[music playing]

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.460
NARRATOR: Corey claims that
the Majestic 12 documents

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.495
from the 1950s--

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.364
which reveal that
interactions were

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.033
taking place between
government officials

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.502
and numerous alien species--

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:57.804
are accurate as well.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.842
Currently, in the
secret space programs,

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.644
we've been dealing
with approximately

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:09.448
60 different non-terrestrial
groups that have come here.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.350
And some of those
groups are interacting

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:13.452
with the governments
of the world right now.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.755
[music playing]

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:20.393
NARRATOR: If there really are
both alien and human factions

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:24.063
operating throughout
our solar system,

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:28.768
how much longer can it be
kept hidden from the public?

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.337
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.674
recent government statements
reveal that the truth

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.042
will soon be disclosed.
