Reviewer: Peter van de Ven

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.492
It's great to be here today.

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:27.591
I want to thank all the organizers
for the chance to be here today

00:00:27.591 --> 00:00:29.213
and particularly Kunal.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.774
You know, we tend to think
of advances in medicine

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:36.493
as being a new drug, a new laser,
something really high-tech and expensive,

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.333
and we often have a hard time believing
that the simple choices we make each day

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.772
can make such a powerful
difference, but they do.

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:46.880
And in our work, we're using high-tech,
expensive, state-of-the-art measures

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.212
to prove the power of these very simple
and low-tech and low-cost interventions.

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:54.822
And since this a conference on global
health, I wanted to begin with that.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:56.402
Many people don't know

00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:59.382
that more people are dying today
in most parts of the world

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:02.522
from heart disease, diabetes
and other chronic conditions

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:05.471
than AIDS, tuberculosis
and malaria combined,

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:08.741
and what's happening is it's drawing
and diverting a lot of resources

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:10.895
away from things
that really do need drugs,

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:12.741
like AIDS, TB and malaria,

00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.413
to things that can be
largely prevented and even reversed

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:18.279
through simply changing
diet and lifestyle.

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:22.313
And what's happening is that countries are
beginning to eat like us and live like us

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:24.221
and all too often die like us.

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:26.233
And the irony is that the diet we found

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:29.533
that can reverse and even prevent
most of these conditions

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.342
is the way that most of these countries
were eating before they began to copy us.

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:35.473
So this is still
the steep part of the curve,

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:37.864
so intervention now
can make a powerful difference.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.622
And what's personally sustainable
is globally sustainable;

00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.901
what's good for you is good
for the planet, and here's why.

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:47.982
You know, it's so easy to get overwhelmed
by all the crises that are facing us now:

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.394
the energy crisis,

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:52.001
the global-warming crisis

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.290
and the health-care crisis.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.561
It's like, what can I do as one person?

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.771
But something as simple
as what we choose to eat every day

00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.993
can make a difference.

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:01.825
In the energy crisis, for example,

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:05.793
20% of the fossil fuel
that we burn each day

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:08.112
goes to make processed foods,

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:10.990
which, themselves,
are not so great for us.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.892
It takes 10 times more energy
to eat higher on the food chain;

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:16.563
when you're eating meat
as opposed to a plant-based diet,

00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:20.344
it takes ten times more resources
to make that possible.

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:23.173
Michael Pollan calculated
that a quarter-pounder with cheese

00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:27.422
takes 26 ounces of petroleum
and leaves a 13-pound carbon footprint,

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:30.012
which is equivalent
to burning seven pounds of coal.

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:33.831
So the next time you're having a burger,
imagine you're eating 7 pounds of coal

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.589
in terms of its impact on the planet.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.241
So, does it mean
you should never eat meat? No.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.322
But even if you just have
a meatless Monday,

00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:43.322
know that it's investing
meaning in our actions,

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.046
as Adam was saying before,

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:48.764
is part of what makes them powerful
and makes them sustainable.

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:50.500
From a global-warming [perspective],

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.521
many people are surprised to learn
that livestock consumption

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:58.402
accounts for more global warming
than all forms of transportation combined.

00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:02.991
You know, it's responsible for 18% of
the total world greenhouse gas emissions

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:05.531
compared to the entire
global transportation system

00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.232
that's only responsible for 13% of that.

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:12.623
Livestock is responsible for even more
of the most toxic parts of the gases.

00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:14.751
Methane, for example, from cow farts

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:19.423
is 23 times more toxic to the ozone layer
than even carbon dioxide.

00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:25.123
And nitrous oxide is almost 300 times
more toxic to the ozone layer

00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:30.963
than - let me see if I can get
this slide back up - than CO2.

00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:33.552
So these simple changes
can make a powerful difference

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:36.803
in not only how long we live
but also how well we live.

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.202
From the standpoint of eating meat,

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:43.543
again, what's good
for the planet is good for you;

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:45.812
what's bad for the planet is bad for you.

00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:48.022
Eating meat - a number
of studies have come out

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:49.913
showing that red meat consumption

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:55.221
increases total cardiac mortality,
cancer mortality and all-cause mortality.

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:58.193
I like this cartoon - it's cows
going off to the slaughterhouse

00:03:58.193 --> 00:04:02.024
saying, "My only consolation is that
by eating us, they're killing themselves."

00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:03.464
(Laughter)

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:08.232
From a health crisis - you know,
three-quarters of the 2.8 trillion dollars

00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:11.224
that we spend each year
on healthcare costs,

00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:13.705
which are really, for
the most part, sick-care costs,

00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:17.113
are for chronic diseases that we can
largely prevent or even reverse

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:18.923
simply by changing diet and lifestyle.

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:22.331
This is just one of many studies
that showed in large numbers of people,

00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.221
walking a half-hour a day, not smoking,

00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.103
eating a reasonably healthy diet
and keeping a healthy weight

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:31.632
prevented 93% of diabetes,
81% of heart attacks and so on.

00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:34.961
And these are probably underestimations -
it's probably more than that.

00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.173
Well, how do we treat
heart disease in the USA?

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:40.143
Generally, with a lot of drugs
and surgery and money.

00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:43.702
We spend 60 billion dollars
on angioplasties and stents

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:46.103
in the last year we have data on them.

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:49.291
You say, "It's a lot of money,
but think of all the lives it saves."

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:50.422
Except that it doesn't.

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.964
The latest randomized trials - 
a total of 8 of them -

00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:55.773
were reviewed recently
in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:58.243
They found that unless
you're having a heart attack,

00:04:58.243 --> 00:05:01.072
which most people getting
angioplasties and stents are not,

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:04.711
they don't prolong life, prevent
heart attacks or even reduce angina.

00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:07.094
And so the same is true
for bypass surgery.

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:10.803
Unless you're the one or two percent
of people who has the most severe disease,

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:13.115
they don't prolong life
or prevent heart attacks.

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.462
That's 100 billion dollars
for two operations

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:19.252
that are dangerous, invasive,
expensive and largely ineffective.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.353
The cartoon says, "I can operate
or you can go on a strict diet."

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:26.364
He says, "Well, you better operate because
my insurance doesn't cover a strict diet."

00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:29.842
That's the problem; with all this talk
about evidence-based medicine,

00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:32.493
reimbursement is really
a much more powerful determinant

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:34.203
of how we practice medicine.

00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:36.813
Now, you find the same patterns
with prostrate cancer.

00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:39.534
The New England Journal of Medicine
had two major studies.

00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:41.302
They showed that only 1 out of 49 men

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:44.187
who was treated for prostate cancer
with surgery or radiation

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:46.233
actually lives longer because of it.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.513
The other 48 tend to become
either impotent or incontinent or both.

00:05:50.513 --> 00:05:53.804
So you take a guy who's often
in the prime of life, 50s or 60s,

00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:56.325
find out they have
early-stage prostate cancer,

00:05:56.325 --> 00:05:57.812
scare the hell out of them.

00:05:57.812 --> 00:06:00.720
They end up having an operation
that doesn't really help them,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.222
but it maims them
in the most personal ways -

00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:06.293
now they're wearing diapers
and can't have sex - for no benefit.

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:07.677
But the alternative is to say

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:10.695
let's just do watchful waiting,
under a sword of Damocles,

00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:12.214
for something bad to happen,

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:13.594
and that's not very good.

00:06:13.594 --> 00:06:15.604
So the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:19.193
recently recommended maybe we shouldn't
even screen them for prostate cancer

00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:23.162
because it's too hard to know that you
have it and "not do anything about it."

00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:26.062
But here again is a third alternative,
as I will show you,

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:27.991
when you change your diet and lifestyle,

00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:29.491
you can slow, stop or reverse

00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.658
the progression
of early-stage prostate cancer

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.206
without having to do that.

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:35.712
Now diabetes is another issue.

00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:40.243
Type II diabetes is a global
epidemic; it's a pandemic.

00:06:40.513 --> 00:06:43.974
Already, a third of Americans
are diabetic or prediabetic.

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:47.071
In the next eight years,
it's estimated to be half of Americans,

00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:49.912
at a cost of 3.3 trillion dollars -

00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:51.632
clearly not sustainable.

00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:54.181
Now, it turns out that lifestyle changes

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.721
are actually better than drugs
at preventing diabetes.

00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.142
This was a major study that was
in the New England Journal ten years ago.

00:07:00.142 --> 00:07:04.243
It showed that lifestyle actually worked
better than a drug to prevent diabetes.

00:07:04.243 --> 00:07:07.673
But lifestyle changes are also better
than drugs at treating diabetes.

00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:10.391
This was in the New England Journal
a year and a half ago.

00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.313
They had two drugs to lower blood sugar;

00:07:12.313 --> 00:07:16.149
they found it didn't work nearly as well
to prevent the complications of diabetes

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.583
as doing it through lifestyle.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:19.990
And the complications
of diabetes are pretty awful:

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.161
heart attacks, strokes, amputations,

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:24.543
blindness, kidney failure and so on.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.783
But if you get someone's blood sugar down
through diet and lifestyle,

00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:30.022
you can prevent all
of these complications,

00:07:30.022 --> 00:07:33.234
both the human cost
as well as the economic cost.

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:36.963
And my colleagues and I at the nonprofit
Preventive Medicine Research Institute

00:07:36.963 --> 00:07:40.123
have trained about 55 hospitals
and clinics around the country,

00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:43.313
including 24 in West Virginia,
Nebraska and Pennsylvania,

00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:46.165
and we've found that in looking
at large numbers of patients,

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.833
we could get their blood sugar down

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:50.843
to a level that we can prevent
all these costs and complications

00:07:50.843 --> 00:07:53.093
simply by changing diet and lifestyle

00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:54.813
and at a fraction of the cost,

00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:57.101
and the only side effects are good ones.

00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:58.224
So what are we doing?

00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:00.701
Well, it's what we eat,
how we respond to stress,

00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:03.940
how much we exercise we get -
just walking a half-hour every day -

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.759
and how much love and intimacy
and social support we have.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.302
But this really goes back
to a very radical concept -

00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:12.053
radical in the sense of getting
to the root of something -

00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:13.483
which is what is the cause?

00:08:13.483 --> 00:08:15.741
And we spend so much time in medicine

00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.312
mopping up the floor
around the sink that's overflowing

00:08:18.312 --> 00:08:20.302
without also turning off the faucet.

00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:22.701
And it's a simple idea,
but it's a powerful one.

00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.994
Because if we can treat
the cause, what we find -

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:26.123
the cause, by the way,

00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:29.281
are the lifestyle choices that we make
each day, for the most part.

00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:33.623
Otherwise the doctor says,
"Take these cholesterol-lowering drugs,

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:35.222
take these blood pressure pills,

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:40.202
take these pills
for lowering your blood sugar."

00:08:40.202 --> 00:08:42.815
"How long do I have
to take them?" "Forever."

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:45.844
It's like how long do I have
to mop up the floor? Well, forever.

00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:47.683
Why don't we just turn off the faucet?

00:08:47.683 --> 00:08:49.653
Why don't we treat the underlying cause,

00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:50.664
and when we do that,

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:53.873
we find that our bodies have
a remarkable capacity, in most cases,

00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:55.073
to begin healing,

00:08:55.073 --> 00:08:57.613
and much more quickly
than we had once realized

00:08:57.613 --> 00:08:59.311
because these biological mechanisms

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.101
are exquisitely sensitive
and highly dynamic.

00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:07.244
And it's not just lifestyle as prevention,
but it's also lifestyle as treatment.

00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:10.783
Now, I began doing this work 35 years ago
when I was a medical student,

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:13.211
and I took ten men and women
with bad heart disease,

00:09:13.211 --> 00:09:14.733
put them in a hotel for a month,

00:09:14.733 --> 00:09:18.273
and we used what was then a new test
called thallium to measure blood flow.

00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:21.801
And you can see around
ten o'clock there, in the upper left,

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:24.862
there's a black area where
their blood flow should be going.

00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:28.223
A month later, in the same patient
in the same area,

00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:31.383
you can see there's
much more blood going there.

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:33.833
But we only had ten patients,
no control group.

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.173
So I went back to school,
finished medical school,

00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:38.709
and before starting my internship,
did a second study.

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:41.472
This time we had a randomized
control group for comparison,

00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:44.434
and we found that the people
who made these changes got better;

00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:45.922
those who didn't got worse.

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:47.842
The differences were highly significant.

00:09:47.842 --> 00:09:49.954
We published it in the journal of the AMA.

00:09:49.954 --> 00:09:53.734
Went to Boston, finished medical training,
moved to San Francisco in 1984,

00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:55.580
began the lifestyle heart trial.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.463
We used quantitative arteriography
to measure the blockages.

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.640
In the upper left, where the arrow is,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.603
is a narrowing in a main artery
that feeds the heart,

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.802
because it's clogged.

00:10:04.802 --> 00:10:06.722
Just a year later, it's wider.

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:10.153
And because the blood flow is
a fourth-power function of the diameter,

00:10:10.153 --> 00:10:13.552
the actual blood to the heart
was increased by 200-300%,

00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:16.272
which we measured using
what are called cardiac PET scans.

00:10:16.272 --> 00:10:19.725
The lower left picture is the beginning:
blue and black is no blood flow.

00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:23.433
A year later, lower right - it's orange
and white - it's maximal blood flow.

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:25.344
You can see these are dramatic changes.

00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:28.363
And what we found overall
is that the control group,

00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:29.963
who made more moderate changes -

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.933
got worse after one year
and even worse after five years -

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.473
that's what usually happens.

00:10:34.473 --> 00:10:36.334
But instead of getting worse and worse,

00:10:36.354 --> 00:10:39.142
these patients actually showed
some reversal after one year

00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:40.861
and even more after five years.

00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.743
This is the first time that was shown.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:46.332
Now, to put a human face on this,
I just want to show you a one-minute clip

00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:48.754
from a new documentary
called "Escape Fire,"

00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:51.461
that came out last month
in theaters around the country.

00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:53.754
It's available on iTunes
and Amazon and so on.

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:56.433
And the filmmakers
want this to be to medicine

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:59.002
what "An Inconvenient Truth"
was to global warming.

00:10:59.002 --> 00:11:01.013
So, take a look.

00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:07.794
(Video) 25 years ago, I had
five restaurants in San Francisco.

00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:08.811
It was a great life.

00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:11.243
I smoked six cigars a day.

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:14.193
Ten cups of coffee.

00:11:14.953 --> 00:11:16.442
A lot of wine.

00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:19.543
It was wonderful.

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.242
And I had a massive heart attack.

00:11:28.213 --> 00:11:30.632
I was in the hospital for two weeks.

00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:35.318
I could hardly just about
walk three steps,

00:11:35.318 --> 00:11:38.085
and I'd have to stop and rest.

00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:41.842
I was popping 20 or 30 nitrols a day.

00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.972
But then Dean Ornish
was starting his program

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:49.932
to see if he could reverse heart disease
through lifestyle change.

00:11:49.932 --> 00:11:53.261
And he went to my doctor
and asked if he could approach me.

00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:55.741
He told Dean, "How long is the program?"

00:11:55.741 --> 00:11:57.831
He said it was a year.

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:01.292
And my doctor told him
he wouldn't recommend taking me,

00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:03.961
because he didn't think
I would live the year.

00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:08.753
So he figured I was going to die
because I was in such bad shape.

00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:15.832
And now, 25 years later,
and I'm in pretty good shape.

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:20.743
Dean Ornish: His doctor, unfortunately,
passed away in the meantime.

00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:22.304
(Laughter)

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:26.583
But you know, this is a guy
who hasn't had chest pain now in 25 years,

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.323
who couldn't walk across the street.

00:12:28.323 --> 00:12:30.332
It's why I'm so passionate
about this work;

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.431
it's the kind of thing 
we see all the time,

00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:34.353
in thousands and thousands of patients.

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:37.162
So we wondered if maybe
this could help prostate cancer too.

00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:39.872
So we did a study in collaboration
with Dr. Peter Carroll,

00:12:39.872 --> 00:12:41.940
the Chair of Urology here at UCSF,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.073
and the late Dr. Bill Fair,
who, at the time,

00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:46.710
was the Chair of Urology
at Sloan-Kettering in New York.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.571
And we took men who had
biopsy-proven prostate cancer

00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:52.821
but had elected not to be treated
for reasons unrelated to this study

00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:55.352
so that we could divide them
randomly into two groups,

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:58.662
ask one group to make these
lifestyle changes, but not the other,

00:12:58.662 --> 00:12:59.672
and see what happened

00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:03.022
without being confounded by the usual
chemo and radiation and surgery.

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:05.641
We found the PSA levels -
a marker for prostate cancer -

00:13:05.641 --> 00:13:07.769
went up or got worse
in the no-change group,

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:09.924
went down or got better
in the group that did.

00:13:09.924 --> 00:13:11.911
These differences were highly significant

00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:15.061
and were in direct proportion
to the degree of change in lifestyle,

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:19.040
the same we saw in heart disease: the more
people change, the more they improve.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.291
We looked at the effects
when adding their serum

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.542
to a standard line of prostate
tumor cells growing in tissue culture,

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:28.232
the tumor growth
was inhibited 70% versus 9%.

00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:29.864
And one of the coolest slides:

00:13:29.864 --> 00:13:32.940
the more people changed lifestyle,
the more it directly inhibited

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.563
the growth of prostate tumors
growing in tissue culture.

00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:37.128
Through John Kurhanewicz's lab,

00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:38.334
here at UCSF,

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:42.312
we did MR spectroscopy
showing the tumor activity, in red here,

00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:44.781
was diminishing
in this patient after a year

00:13:44.781 --> 00:13:46.593
as well as the PSA going down.

00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:49.972
So taken as a whole, this is the first,
and still only, randomized trial

00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:53.183
showing that the progression
of men with early-stage prostate cancer

00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:55.582
can be slowed and stopped
and often even reversed

00:13:55.582 --> 00:13:58.613
simply by making changes
in diet and lifestyle.

00:13:58.613 --> 00:14:01.942
So we wonder what some of the mechanisms
might be to help explain that.

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:04.912
And we found that gene expression
was changed in over 500 genes

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:06.282
in just three months.

00:14:06.282 --> 00:14:09.663
And in fact, turning on or up-regulating
the good genes that protect us,

00:14:09.663 --> 00:14:13.434
down-regulating the bad genes that cause
inflammation and oxidative stress

00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:17.301
and also the RAS oncogenes that promote
prostate, breast and colon cancer

00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:20.912
were down-regulated or turned off -
hundreds of them in just three months.

00:14:20.912 --> 00:14:22.562
This is what's called a heat map:

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:24.824
you can see on the right
are the oncogenes,

00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:26.353
and red is mostly turned on.

00:14:26.353 --> 00:14:28.712
Three months later,
green is mostly turned off.

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:30.463
It's amazingly powerful.

00:14:30.463 --> 00:14:32.623
We did a study with
Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn,

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:35.264
who won the Nobel Prize
for discovering telomerase,

00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:38.452
which is an enzyme that repairs
and lengthens damaged telomeres -

00:14:38.452 --> 00:14:41.232
the ends of our chromosomes
that control how long we live -

00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:44.182
and also Dr. Elissa Epel,
who'll be presenting later today.

00:14:44.182 --> 00:14:48.773
What we found was that the telomerase
could increase by 30% in just 3 months,

00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:50.503
and no study has shown that.

00:14:50.503 --> 00:14:52.842
And we're about to publish
the five-year follow up

00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:55.563
and show that the telomeres
themselves actually get longer

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:56.953
when you make these changes.

00:14:56.953 --> 00:14:59.014
It will be the first study
to show that too.

00:14:59.014 --> 00:15:01.783
If this was a new drug
that could lengthen your telomeres,

00:15:01.783 --> 00:15:04.213
it'd be a multi-billion drug overnight,

00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:07.069
but it's the same lifestyle changes
that do all these things.

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:10.463
It's not like there's one for diabetes,
one for heart disease and so on.

00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:14.113
And we found, again,
the more lifestyle changes people made,

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.054
the longer their telomeres got.

00:15:16.054 --> 00:15:18.102
We also found that angiogenesis changes.

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.883
This is the first study to show that.

00:15:19.883 --> 00:15:21.944
We found that we could down-regulate VEGF,

00:15:21.944 --> 00:15:25.881
which tumors secrete to cause
blood vessels to grow and feed them.

00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:28.582
Drugs like Avastin
and Nexavar inhibit VEGF,

00:15:28.582 --> 00:15:31.473
but they cost $100,000 a year,
per person, to take.

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.432
This is, again, for free;
it's just the same lifestyle changes.

00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:38.114
So, the more we look,
the more mechanisms we can invoke

00:15:38.114 --> 00:15:42.023
to explain why these changes are
so powerful and make such a difference.

00:15:42.023 --> 00:15:45.111
Our genes are our predisposition,
but our genes are not our fate.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.773
I found that very empowering.

00:15:46.773 --> 00:15:50.553
We also found that this was not only
medically effective but cost effective.

00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:54.794
Mutual of Omaha found they save
$30,000 per patient in the first year.

00:15:54.794 --> 00:15:59.262
Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield found they
could cut costs by 50% in the first year

00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:02.923
and by an additional 20 to 30%
in years two and three.

00:16:02.923 --> 00:16:06.266
And finally, a year and a half ago,
after 16 years of review,

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.702
Medicare agreed to cover our program,
which was a real game changer

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:10.713
because, again,

00:16:10.713 --> 00:16:13.732
reimbursement is such a primary
determinant of medical practice;

00:16:13.732 --> 00:16:17.415
you change reimbursement, you change
medical practice, even medical education.

00:16:17.415 --> 00:16:21.733
So we're in the process now of training
hospitals and clinics around the country.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:25.154
If you're interested in learning more
about our work, go to our website.

00:16:25.154 --> 00:16:27.433
Or if you're interested in being trained.

00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:31.312
Our role - our goal is to -
we train a team of six people:

00:16:31.312 --> 00:16:34.294
a doctor, a nurse,
a stress management specialist -

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.350
essentially a yoga-mediation teacher -

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.324
an exercise physiologist,
a dietitian and a psychologist

00:16:39.324 --> 00:16:43.392
who work together as a team
with the doctor as quarterback.

00:16:43.392 --> 00:16:48.843
And it enables us to reclaim our world
as healers and not simply as technicians.

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:53.842
Vinod Khosla, speaking later today,
was quoted on a controversial statement

00:16:53.842 --> 00:16:57.915
that we doctors are going to be replaced
by an iPhone app before too long.

00:16:57.915 --> 00:17:01.883
And if all we are are just a collection
of algorithms, then that's true.

00:17:01.883 --> 00:17:03.147
But we're more than that;

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.352
it allows us to get
re-enchanted with medicine

00:17:05.352 --> 00:17:08.632
and to reclaim our role
as healers and not just technicians.

00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:12.012
We train the St. Vincent de Paul
homeless shelter here in San Francisco.

00:17:12.012 --> 00:17:16.133
They're over 20,000 patients who've gone
through our clinic in the last 1.5 years,

00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:19.202
and now with the Medicare
reimbursement, it's financially stable,

00:17:19.202 --> 00:17:21.622
and we can now clone this
around the country

00:17:21.622 --> 00:17:24.733
without needing ongoing
philanthropy to support them.

00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:29.412
But the other big epidemic besides
heart disease, obesity and diabetes

00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:31.628
is depression and loneliness.

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:35.362
Study after study has shown
that people who feel lonely and depressed

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:38.290
are many times more likely
to get sick and die prematurely

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.251
than those who have a sense
of love, connection and community.

00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:43.504
We found we could cut
depressions scores in half

00:17:43.504 --> 00:17:45.383
simply by changing diet and lifestyle -

00:17:45.383 --> 00:17:48.443
comparable or even better
than what you get with antidepressants.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:51.863
And you know, because there's been
a breakdown of the social networks

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.532
that used to give us a sense
of connection and community;

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.734
many people don't have
a job that feels secure,

00:17:56.734 --> 00:17:59.981
a neighborhood with several
generations of neighbors living together,

00:17:59.981 --> 00:18:03.144
an extended family or even
a nuclear family that you see regularly.

00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:05.270
These things affect
the quality of our lives,

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.122
but they actually affect our survival.

00:18:07.122 --> 00:18:11.462
And Nick Christakis's work found that
these social networks were so powerful

00:18:11.462 --> 00:18:16.012
that if your friends are obese,
you're 45% more likely to be obese.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.102
If your friends' friends are obese, 25%.

00:18:18.102 --> 00:18:22.352
If your friends' friends' friends are
obese, 10%, even if you've never met them.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:26.173
And you can see this with other behaviors
as well; that's how powerful these are.

00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:30.202
The last thing I want to say is that
anything that creates a sense of trust

00:18:30.202 --> 00:18:32.693
leads to intimacy,
leads to healing and meaning.

00:18:32.693 --> 00:18:34.832
The word "healing" comes
from "to make whole."

00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:37.103
"Yoga" - "to yoke, to unite,
to bring together."

00:18:37.103 --> 00:18:39.562
These are old ideas
that we are rediscovering.

00:18:39.562 --> 00:18:42.114
And you find this as part
of all spiritual traditions:

00:18:42.114 --> 00:18:44.954
altruism, compassion,
forgiveness and love -

00:18:44.954 --> 00:18:47.782
not to get some external reward
in the next lifetime,

00:18:47.782 --> 00:18:49.033
but that's what frees us

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:53.623
from our isolation, and our depression
and our suffering here and now.

00:18:53.623 --> 00:18:55.462
My dad died a few months ago;

00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:58.892
my mom had a stroke,
a debilitating stroke, soon after;

00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:01.584
my dog of 14 years got bit
on the nose by a rattlesnake -

00:19:01.584 --> 00:19:04.034
all this in the last
few months - and died.

00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:06.293
You know, life is short
and life is precious.

00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:09.462
And what I'm most interested in
is not simply unclogging arteries

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:12.611
or showing all these kinds of things -
as interesting as they are.

00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:13.724
We're all going to die.

00:19:13.724 --> 00:19:17.372
The mortality rate is still 100%;
it's one per person.

00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:18.512
(Laughter)

00:19:18.512 --> 00:19:21.542
I got profoundly and suicidally
depressed when I was in college.

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:23.333
That was my doorway into this area.

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:26.012
For someone else, it might be
a heart attack or a stroke.

00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:28.680
But, you know, change is hard,
as Adam mentioned earlier.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.163
But when you're in enough pain,

00:19:30.163 --> 00:19:32.683
suddenly the idea of change
becomes more interesting.

00:19:32.683 --> 00:19:37.043
And what I find I'm most passionate about,
what I find most interesting

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:39.455
is how we can use
the experience of suffering

00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:43.453
as a doorway for transforming
our lives and finding meaning,

00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:46.874
and then we can often get curing,
but we can always get healing.

00:19:46.874 --> 00:19:48.263
Thank you so much.

00:19:48.263 --> 00:19:49.673
(Applause)
