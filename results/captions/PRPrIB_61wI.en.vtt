00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.110
North Korea carried out one of its most provocative
missile tests in recent years on the morning

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.820
of 27th August, hurling a ballistic missile
directly over Japan that prompted the government

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.820
in Tokyo to warn residents in its path to
take cover.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.660
The missile flew over the northern island
of Hokkaido and landed harmlessly in the sea,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.960
after a flight of nearly 1,700 miles.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.320
The missile was launched from a site near
Pyongyang’s international airport, not the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.230
usual launch site in the northeast.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.940
The test appeared to have been of a recently
developed intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.929
It is the same sort of missile that North
Korean threatened to fire on the US territory

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.339
of Guam.

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.659
Public television programs in Japan were interrupted
with a rare warning screen announcing the

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.890
missile’s flight over the country.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.390
Several bullet train lines were temporarily
halted, and the government spoke of the missile

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.420
in unusually dire terms.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.080
Shinzo Abe (Japan’s Prime Minister,) said:
“North Korea’s reckless action of launching

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.680
a missile that passed over Japan is an unprecedented,
serious and grave threat,”

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.760
The missile test rattled the region increasingly
concerned about North Korea’s fast-advancing

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.780
missile capabilities and its increasingly
bold way of demonstrating them.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.850
In this video, Defense Updates looks into
3 definitive reasons WHY US DID NOT SHOOT

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.960
DOWN THIS MISSILE FLYING OVER JAPAN?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.820
So, lets get started.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.280
US has stationed classified number of Arleigh
Burke class destroyers in the vicinity of

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.770
Korean Peninsula.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.170
The Arleigh Burke class of guided missile
destroyers is the United States Navy's first

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.360
class of destroyer built around the Aegis
Combat System.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.000
Currently Japan also has 6 Aegis-equipped
destroyers.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.560
The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System
is a United States DOD (Department of Defense)

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.349
Missile Defense Agency program developed to
provide missile defense against short to intermediate-range

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.920
ballistic missiles.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.349
Aegis BMD is designed to intercept ballistic
missiles post-boost phase and prior to reentry.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.209
It enables Arleigh Burke to shoot down enemy
ballistic missiles by expanding the Aegis

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.159
Combat System with the addition of the AN/SPY-1
radar and Standard missile technologies.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.040
Aegis BMD-equipped vessels can transmit their
target detection information to other systems

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.599
and, if needed, engage potential threats using
either the SM-2 or SM-3 missile.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.930
Just days after North Korea tested this intermediate
range ballistic missile that overflew Japan,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.409
the U.S. Navy intercepted a medium range ballistic
missile target on Aug 30 using a new Raytheon

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.189
Standard SM-6 missile.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.540
Here are 2 points to take note:

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.060
1. The interceptor missiles are supposed to fired
only when the trajectory of the incoming enemy

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.879
missile is found be heading towards Japan’s
landmass.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.110
In this case, it was clear that the North
Korean missile was heading towards sea with

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.260
no potential of causing any harm.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.440
2. Aegis BMD is effective when the missiles travel
within the defended area.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.310
The destroyers are obviously currently stationed
in positions so that they protect Japan and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.930
don’t cover the vast open waters.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.599
Positioning the Aegis vessels to counter North
Korean missile test is not a good idea, as

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.169
doing so would mean taking them away from
optimal positions to defend actual targets

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:01.900
on land.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.499
If US shoot down any North Korean missile
which actually has no threat potential, it

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:21.079
will give away some of the most crucial information
regarding the capabilities of Aegis BMD and

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.050
the deployment of Aegis enabled vessels.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.060
This will enable North Korea to choose a better
trajectory and optimize the other parameters

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.690
to evade the system when an actual missile
strike is initiated.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.050
It must also be noted that Aegis BMD is a
threat to China and Russia too and they are

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.889
also watching the movements in Korean peninsula
closely.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.699
Both of them are likely to mine as much as
data as possible to understand the abilities

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.639
of the system.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.990
A weapon is most effective if an ambiguity
about its capabilities is maintained before

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.789
the moment of actual use.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.240
US is doing exactly this.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.200
The United States and South Korea wrapped
up their annual joint military exercises on

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.449
28th August by flying some of their most powerful
warplanes in bombing drills in a show of force.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.430
Two B-1B supersonic bombers and four F-35
stealth fighter jets from the United States

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.830
Air Force and Marine Corps joined four South
Korean F-15 fighter jets in live-fire bombing

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.430
exercises over a military range in eastern
South Korea, officials said.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.020
South Korean F-15s conducted a similar bombing
drill over the same range.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.400
Whenever such joint exercises take place,
North Korea accuses the South and the United

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.550
States of preparing for an invasion and often
conducts its own military exercises and missile tests.

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:59.460
In this already tense situation, an interception
of North Korean missile will be a big embarrassment

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.720
for Kim Jong Un, and provoke the volatile
leader to do something nasty.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.949
It must be noted that Seoul, capital of South
Korea is within 35 miles of the border.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.800
Covering only about 12% of the country's area,
the Seoul Capital Area is home to more than

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.389
48.2% of the South Korea’s population, and
is the world's third largest urban area.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.900
Most of the North’s artillery pieces, numbering
in the thousands are aimed to strike this

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.520
area, which will leads to very high causality.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.680
Only twice before has the North fired projectiles
over Japanese territory: once in 1998, prompting

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.110
a minor diplomatic crisis in Asia, and once
again at the beginning of the Obama administration

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.759
in 2009.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.720
In both those cases, the North said the rockets
were carrying satellites into orbit.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.060
In this case, it made no such claim.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.620
While the missile did fly over Japan, it is
very likely that the missile test was not

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.190
designed to signal Japan that it is now higher
on the DPRK’s target list.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.580
It has more to do with geography than anything
else.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.810
North Korea needs to accurately test its missiles
to obtain a full measure of their capability

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.639
and firing them over Japan is the most obvious
choice.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:27.800
As the situation threatens to boil over, the
main stakeholders South Korea, Japan

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.200
and US need to come up with a more effective approach in dealing with North Korea.
