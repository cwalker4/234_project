00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:09.187

00:00:09.187 --> 00:00:11.937

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:24.511

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.261

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:43.679
- Yeah!

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.761
Happy Monday!

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.672
Thank you for watching our show!

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:52.740
Now say hello, to my one and only co-host

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.854
my studio audience, yes.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:58.230
(crowd cheering)

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.370
How you doin'?

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.440
- [Crowd] How you doin!

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.310
- I'm doin' alright, let'd get started.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.160
It's time for...

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.160
- [Crowd] Hot topic!

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:07.859
(crowd cheering)

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.692
(camera flashing)

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:32.760
- Well I hope you had a good weekend,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.100
you rested and stuff like that,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.770
your daylight savings and all that.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.810
You know what I missed
out on this weekend?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.820
Which is a pretty big
deal for a lot of people.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.290
Do you know this artist,
her name is Robyn?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.540
She's kinda like Madonna

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.440
only not as known as Madonna here.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.550
You know Robyn?

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.890
- [Man] I love Robyn.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.560
- I had tickets for Robyn,
Madison Square Garden

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.190
this weekend.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.023
Well.

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:55.543
- The hottest ticket in town.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.590
- Alas, the boy was home
still from spring break

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.500
so, I wanted to spend time with him.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.810
But, the crew of people, my friends

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.004
who wanted to bring me.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.440
They spent $300 for the tickets.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.840
So, I felt really bad, I
gave them the money back.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.890
But, I felt really bad

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.200
and I was like $300 tickets
for Madison Square Garden

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.704
that must be the front row, right?

00:02:14.704 --> 00:02:15.600
Wouldn't you think that?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.433
- Yeah.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.110
- It wasn't even front row,
the concert was sold out

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.860
and our tickets were on the floor

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.090
but, not that first
batch, the second batch.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.620
Somewhere in the middle.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.810
That's how hot of a ticket that was.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.670
Do you know who Robyn is?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.796
Clap if you know who Robyn is.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:32.090
(crowd claps)

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.923
Yeah,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.290
not quite as big as Madonna,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.610
but shes' got her own
thing, she's from Sweden.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.152
Anyway, so the next big
thing that we woke up to

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:44.700
over the weekend was Jennifer Lopez

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.463
is finally engaged to Alex Rodriguez.

00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:49.213
(crowd applause)

00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:51.899
J. Rodd

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:52.732
I like it.

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:54.290
I like it a whole lot.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.530
There are you know, a lot of people

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.040
who are hating on this relationship.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.960
I love the ring.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.833
They say it's flawless.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.970
I have no idea how many carats.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.530
It's gotta be somewhere between easily,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.860
like 12 and 18 carats.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.850
Its huge, depending on how big her hand is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.683
you know what I mean.

00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:13.200
She's got a small hand, I've shaken it.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.662
She's got a small hand.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.580
Good manicure with it and stuff.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.750
The say it's flawless, of
course why wouldn't it be.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.730
And they say he spent
someehere near $20,000,000

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.700
for the ring.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.995
Well, of course.

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:29.970
And he was the one who
dressed up I love you.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.310
And you can tell it was him.
'cause only a man wouldn't know

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.961
how to make a heart more perfect.

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:34.954
(crowd laughter)

00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:36.770
I think it's cute, you know.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.590
He didn't hire a decorator
and that it happened

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.000
in the Bahamas, they were on vacation.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.690
This is one of the five rings

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.982
that's shes' collected
over her romantical life.

00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:49.122
(crowd laughing)

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:51.100
(applause)

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.933
Now look.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.740
Remember Ojani Noa was her first husband.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.510
And, that's a pear shaped, that's cute.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.490
And, then Chris Judd,
the background dancer

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.860
who became her husband,
that's the emerald cut.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.410
And, then Ben Affleck

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.240
the only one that she gave back.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.760
Because, remember he broke up with her

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.816
four days before the actual wedding.

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:14.320
(crowd gasping)

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.220
I still wanna know more to that story.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.240
Anyway, so he broke up with her,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.710
and she ended up giving that ring back,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.890
she said it right here on Wendy.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.945
That was a six carat excuse me,

00:04:24.945 --> 00:04:28.740
a 2.5 excuse me, six carat pink diamond

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.880
worth $2,500,000 from Harry Winston.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580
She gave that back to him, though.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.940
As well, a girl should.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.680
Like I always feel like
give the rings back.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.920
Especially Ojani,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.890
why didn't you give
that man back his ring?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.303
Jennifer, now you know
he could use that money,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.433
Chris Judd too.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.190
She did not give Marc
Anthony the ring back

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.420
however, Marc Anthony and Jennifer

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.130
had the longest standing relationship

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.220
with two cute kids and the whole bit.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.160
This is a 8.5 carat
$4,000,000 blue Harry Winston,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.850
that Marc Anthony gave her.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.880
And then, hopefully her final ring.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.860
The final ring, from Alex.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.887
Just what a beautiful collection.

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:11.637
(crowd applause)

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.190
And, the reason that I like them together

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.980
is because, I feel like
you know as a jock,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.520
he's good looking, he's been
playing ball all of his life.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.650
You know, he's been around the women.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.600
He's been around, he's done his thing,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.940
he finally wanted to be meet somebody

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.250
who is smart, on his level,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.150
Clearly somebody who has her own money,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.400
not gonna steal his money,
somebody who is also busy.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.890
You know like, who wants
to marry a house wife

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.280
when your Alex Rodriguez and there's

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.440
somebody at home whining all the time.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.700
Because now, he's not working all the time

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.380
so he's home more and who
wants to hear that all day.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.030
Jennifer's busy traveling the world.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.853
She acts, she sings, she dances.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.380
Look, this is a good thing

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.380
and then for her, as sexy as she is

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.290
and as beautiful as she is

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.340
and as dynamic as it is on the outside.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.320
You know, does she wanna
really continue dating?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.150
It's a chore, it's like a part time job.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.830
Especially, when you get
to be a particular age

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.664
and you got your kids and
you're trying to moisturize.

00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:12.510
(crowd laughs)

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.193
And bengay at the same time.

00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:20.010
Do you think that she'll
try to have the super baby?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.990
It doesn't even matter to me.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.240
Like I hope she doesn't do that.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.870
You know, he has his kids.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.217
She has her kids.

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:28.310
This is a good thing.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.196
Congratulations, congratulations.

00:06:30.196 --> 00:06:32.830
(crowd applause)

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.920
Remember, do you remember?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.560
We saw this on the news here in New York

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.830
they played it locally.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.890
The first time that she ever
met him was with Marc Anthony.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.420
Marc had tickets for a Yankees game

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.190
and Marc was already friends with Alex

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.810
and Marc introduced Jennifer to Alex

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.590
and the cameras were right there.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.860
Well she gave him a
respectable look, this Alex.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.630
But me being the cynic I am,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.723
I was like ooh,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.130
and Alex was respectful
looking at her back.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.990
And then Marc and Jennifer went on

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.500
and they were married for many years

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.270
and then well, this all turned out.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.080
You know what? I guess everybody is happy,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.130
Marc's happy from them.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.967
I'm happy for them.

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:13.500
Are you happy for them?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.083
(crowd cheers)

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.853
Clap if you're not happy for them.

00:07:23.963 --> 00:07:25.342
(solo applause)

00:07:25.342 --> 00:07:26.460
(crowd laughs)

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.703
God'll get you Walter.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.760
So, alright.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.380
Here's this rapper, who
I had never heard of

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.590
except, through my son.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.522
His name is YBN Almighty Jay.

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:42.386
All the good names were taken.

00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:45.570
(crowd laughs)

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.680
Now we know him 'cause
he's the 18 year old

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.720
who at one point was
dating Kourtney Kardashian.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.070
Now you know who he is?

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.370
Uh, who?

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.660
Blac Chyna, Blac Chyna I'm
sorry, same difference.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.654
Yeah.

00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:57.170
(crowd laughs)

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.560
He's 18 he's dating a woman
with kids and what not.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.930
Alright, so this rapper YBN Almighty Jay

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.773
got beat up over the weekend.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.343
At Saks Fifth Avenue,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.303
the flagship store!

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.440
Honey, this is where you
and I are window shopping,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.590
we're inside, we're trying to pickup

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.600
a pair of sunglasses or something.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.360
Maybe we wanna go upstairs and have some

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.513
chicken livers at Freds,
wait that's Barneys.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.230
I just love Fifth Avenue shopping,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.753
and I just, it's unbelievable.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.073
Sorry.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.240
I get very comfortable talking to you.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.490
Look, this beautiful talented young man

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.290
and he is talented, he's from the south.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.330
He and his friends were at

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.530
Saks Fifth Avenue, the flagship
store over the weekend.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.120
And while they where inside the store

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.210
there was a scuttle, an argument,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.000
going on inside the store.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.860
You understand?

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.210
So the argument spilled to
the outside of the store,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.420
on the street.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.910
So, now you're still on Fifth Avenue.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.170
You're still right in front of Saks.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.750
People are lookin' like, what the heck.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.160
Later on that day, by the way they showed

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.170
YBN running from the fight
alone so, I don't know

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.567
where his boys were.

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:20.850
You know, he's not from New York.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.270
The person who attacked him

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.733
was a New York based rapper.

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:25.960
(crowd gasp)

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.540
This is all really, really bad.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.100
They attacked him also, either with

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.040
a box cutter or a bottle
of heavy duty brown juice.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.630
because, all that openness right here

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.333
that's like 300 stitches.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.260
That's a buck 50 twice, with no change.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.720
Yeah, all these stitches
for the rest of his life.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.320
He's gonna have to look at that.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.480
Well, they beat him up.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.940
I don't know what the argument was about,

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.980
they allegedly stole his
chain, wallet and sneakers.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.893
Childish.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.500
A picture was also posted on the internet

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.050
of somebody with his
chain, wallet and sneakers.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.344
You see what I'm sayin'.

00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:08.910
Like where are we going?

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.100
Where we going, you know
you kids, and I'm gonna

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.440
call you kids 'cause,
you're 18 and what not.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.620
You know you kids, there's enough

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.760
money and fame going around in hiphop

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.660
now more so than ever, more so than ever.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.950
There is money and fame,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.550
like why do you have to do this?

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.563
You know what?

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:29.400
You have made it bad for black people

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.790
everywhere just by doing this.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.777
Not just black men.

00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:34.593
(crowd cheers)

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:35.426
I'll tell you why.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.583
I'll tell you why.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.820
A sophisticate like me, I
like to shop Fifth Avenue

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.820
you know but not everybody
does not know I'm Wendy.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.320
You know, I feel the heat of security

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.540
following, oh yes still now!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.210
Still even now!

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.110
You know, you feel it.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.010
We're barely getting back into Barneys

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.831
after they tried to ban the black thing

00:10:56.831 --> 00:10:58.750
on Fifth Avenues Barneys.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.320
Now you go into Barneys
boy, they fall over you.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.880
If you're black and you go to Barneys.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.534
(gasp) Believe me, you

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.471
The treatment is superb.

00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:10.221
(crowd appluase)

00:11:12.863 --> 00:11:14.196
But, you know

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.350
when you all fight like this ,
what you do is you perpetuate

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.210
'cause, you know what some white people

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.940
already think about black people,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.430
particularly black men.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.440
So, now today my son, whose a decent kid

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.810
now has got to suffer
the rath of the stares

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.810
you know, from white
people because of this.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.280
My father, innocent 89,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.890
like what does he need for this,

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.030
but he's a black, he's a man.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.933
My husband, he's gonna get the stares.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.680
Look there're people who
came on before you all,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.350
who've tried to talk to you all.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.810
From the Puffies

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.963
and the Jay Zs and others.

00:11:56.018 --> 00:11:58.700
You might call them old men.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.310
You might think they're washed up.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.860
Oh no, no you're ruining
it for yourselves kids.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.269
You're ruining it for yourselves.

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:08.019
(crowd applauds)

00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:16.855
Do you remember who Heidi
Montag is, don't you?

00:12:16.855 --> 00:12:17.688
- [Crowd] Yes!

00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:20.170
- Heidi, well apparently
she's in hot water

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.023
from everybody but me.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.710
It was cute, you know alright.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.083
Everybody give her a break.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.283
She made a comment about diversity.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.180
Alright, now first let me set you up.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.070
Heidi starred on MTV show,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.110
the Hills one of the first reality shows

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.293
back in the day.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.310
She and Spencer, remember they dated

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.320
and now they've been married for 10 years,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.800
she and Spencer, and they
have a child together.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.420
So, it lasted.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.900
Well, now The Hills, because it was

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.040
so popular back in the day,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.140
and because the reboot of all

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.660
these other shows from back in the day

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.000
that have become successful.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.620
They're now rebooting The Hills

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.560
and Heidi was talking about the reboot.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.083
She did an interview recently by herself.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.950
Just sayin', 'cause maybe if someone

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.130
was with her, they would've
given her the elbow.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.580
You know, and saved her.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.380
But, there was nobody there.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.690
I like the picture of
Heidi and Spencer, cute.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.890
Clearly it's their house.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.920
Anyway, in a recent
interview Heidi was asked

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.880
if the show was going
to have more diversity

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.580
with the characters than
the original series?

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.453
And here's what poor Heidi said.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.490
- [Interviewer] Do you wish that there was

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.290
a little more diversity represented?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.610
- We don't all look the same

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.060
I mean Audrina has darker hair,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.303
I feel like Mischa has darker hair.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.440
But, yeah we're California girls.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.490
I have other very diverse friends,

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.767
that are not featured on the show.

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:50.330
(crowd laughs)

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.240
- She didn't mean it.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.310
She didn't, she didn't mean it.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.810
For those of you who
might be stuck like her,

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.960
they meant black people, Asian people,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.563
people other than white people.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.923
She didn't mean it, poor thing.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.390
I like Heidi and Spencer.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.570
And do I need diversity on The Hills, no.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.520
I hate it when shows try to push it down,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.120
you know they aired that black friend

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.760
or that Indian friend just
because we've been complaining.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.090
Cause that's what happened to Friends.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.620
Remember Ross got the girlfriend,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.473
and then you're like, oh boy here we go.

00:14:24.508 --> 00:14:26.670
I don't need to see black people

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.580
on Seinfeld all the time,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.380
one of the best sitcoms of all time.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.870
They have the laywer,
Jerrys' lawyer is black

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.883
but, he's not a regular character, what?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.060
Yeah, the lawyer is Black.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.460
Sex and the City who I watch
at ad nauseam as you know.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.510
They don't have any black people on there.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.750
Except, every once in a while.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.160
Remember when Samantha moved
to the meat packing district.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.110
andshe had the big gay party to celebrate

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.390
the LGBT community on her roof

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.300
and there's a bunch of
black queens up there

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.757
and everybody was
dancing and getting down.

00:14:59.757 --> 00:15:00.590
(crowd laughs)

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.870
Other than that you
don't see black people...

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.930
Oh! And Samantha dated the black guy

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.765
and then the black sister didn't like it

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:07.463
and then that was over.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.260
I feel as though, you don't have to do it.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.400
Just feel it in your heart.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.202
Just love diversity in your heart.

00:15:17.202 --> 00:15:18.857
(crowd applause)

00:15:18.857 --> 00:15:22.030
And show it when you can, don't
shove it down our throats.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.880
There are gonna be some
new characters though

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.933
on this new Hills.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.650
Mischa Barton is going to be on The Hills.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.290
She wasn't on the original
one, but she is from that era

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.063
so, we get where she probably fit in.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.170
Brody Jenner can't see enough of him

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.330
apparently it's not working out

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.700
with the Jenner Kardashian show.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.640
So, he's going back

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.750
to where he was making
his bones on this show.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.880
Brandon, Brandon Thomas Lee?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.921
Now Brandon Thomas Lee, who is that again?

00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:55.150
- Pamela Andersons' and Tommy Lees' son.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.190
- Right, when last we saw him

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.500
he was beating up Tommy Lee at the house

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.756
and set Tommy Lee up.

00:16:00.756 --> 00:16:01.816
(crowd gasp)

00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:04.210
Yeah, father son fight.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.900
Anyways, so the new Hills

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.920
the brand new one begins
sometime later this year on MTV.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.260
I'll be watching.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.060
I'll watch, why not?

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.992
Fun.

00:16:12.992 --> 00:16:15.742
(crowd applauds)

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.650
I wasn't really into the old Hills

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.700
but, Heidi and Spencer have been here

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.890
and Audrina has been
here before on our show.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.810
And so, because on the
account of knowing them

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.180
and then just wanting to check it out.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.130
I'll check out the new Hills

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.893
but, I don't really know the old Hills.

00:16:29.893 --> 00:16:33.041
I'll have a lot of catching up to do.

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.791
(crowd applause)

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.703
People are furious with Nick Minaj.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.350
Her fans are very, very upset

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.423
because, she canceled another
concert at the last minute.

00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:51.510
(crowd gasp)

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.243
When I say last minute, I
mean the stadium was packed.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.753
Everybody was inside, at their seats.

00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:01.418
Look at this place,

00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:03.503
this is in Bordeaux
France everyone, Bordeaux.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.380
They bought the tickets,
the arena was packed,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.300
and all of a sudden the show was canceled

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.180
due to technical difficulties.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.250
It was a voice over the loud speakers

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.540
that said it was due to
technical difficulties.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.401
Everybody left, people were so irate

00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:21.700
some people started chanting,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.774
Cardi B, Cardi B.

00:17:23.774 --> 00:17:26.524
(crowd applause)

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:33.178
Now that was unnecessary.

00:17:34.132 --> 00:17:37.230
This is the second show on this tour,

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.380
that Nicki is on right
now that she's canceled,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.220
she most recently also canceled a show,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.020
in Slovakia and it was two weeks ago

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.550
for the same reason,
technical difficulties.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.460
Well I don't know what
the technical difficulties

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.320
were in Slovakia but,
I got a little bit more

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.320
of a handle as to what happened in France

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.930
and apparently what there
saying, the electric you know?

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.730
You know what, maybe?

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.400
I mean that's a hot set.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.860
There are a lot of lights,
there's a lot of smoke,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.810
anything could happen at the last minute.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.180
But anyway, Nicki did go on social media

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.990
in full make up it look like
she was ready to perform

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.890
and this is what she said to her fans.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.240
- These two cities that
had technical issues

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.278
were cities that I have never been

00:18:20.278 --> 00:18:23.270
to before and we tried to add them

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.620
but, they just didn't have the power

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.650
and the building to facilitate my show.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.130
Every artist, every artist
has technical difficulties

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.880
and have to cancel shows.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.200
I want to tell you guys
that I love you dearly

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.513
and I really hope to make it up very soon.

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:44.220
(crowd mumbling)

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.780
- So here's the deal.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.410
The show was supposed
to be on Saturday night

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.830
and I know what you're saying well,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.220
why didn't she come out
on stage and do something.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.110
Me, only because I'm a people pleaser

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.960
I would've came out on stage.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.276
(crowd applauds)

00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:00.630
I wouldn't have performed.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.500
I would not have performed but,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.100
I would've came out with my
whole crew and everything.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.380
I would've come all the
way to the tip of the stage

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.670
so you could actually feel my sweat,

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.800
having to tell you, you
know that I can't perform

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.730
and I don't know what's
goin' on with this place

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.410
but, I do promise you
if you wanna full refund

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.210
get it now and if you wanna come back

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.230
to the show just let
me work up my schedule

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.110
and I will be back

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.517
and I will do it bigger
and better than ever.

00:19:25.517 --> 00:19:28.460
For me if I were Nicki, when I do

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.609
go back to Bordeaux and Slovakia

00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:33.950
I would try to bring "and friends."

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.707
You know, if "a and friends" pops up.

00:19:36.707 --> 00:19:37.770
"An and friend"

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.613
Whatever celebrity friend
or something like that.

00:19:39.613 --> 00:19:41.703
You know just do a really good show.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.130
She couldn't perform
on Saturday like I said

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.550
and no she couldn't make it up

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.300
to them on Sunday because on Monday,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.970
tonight she is in London

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.127
and generally speaking
artists need rest time

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.540
for their throats.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.410
So, she couldn't perform last night.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.860
That would not have been fair.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.220
They would've gotten a boring,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.340
less than show in Bordeaux

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.940
and then that would've passed it onto

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.070
a less than show in London.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.800
So, I think she did the right thing.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.030
She's still touring, so we'll be watching.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.680
Hopefully, this won't be
a habit because, habits

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.230
becomes something we start to say mmmmmmm.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.031
But, right now I believe her, that's it.

00:20:23.031 --> 00:20:25.781
(crowd applauds)

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.750
The thing about Jennifer's ring too

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.760
is that you don't have
to start out that big.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.660
Like girls really think starter rings

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.530
are really that important,

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.830
as a matter of fact, rings.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.930
Plenty of women don't,

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.175
I have a friend who doesn't wear her ring.

00:20:47.175 --> 00:20:48.444
Doesn't care, didn't ask for one.

00:20:48.444 --> 00:20:49.740
I have another friend who got a ring

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.971
a beautiful ring, doesn't wear it

00:20:50.971 --> 00:20:52.050
they've been married forever.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.178
A lot of guys don't wear rings,

00:20:53.178 --> 00:20:54.011
my husband doesn't wear his ring.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.972
I enjoy wearing my ring, I wear my ring.

00:20:56.972 --> 00:20:59.748
I will turn around go
back home to get my ring.

00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:00.581
But, it's not the ring that you get

00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:01.414
in the beginning, if you're a ring girl.

00:21:01.414 --> 00:21:02.247
I'm a ring girl.

00:21:02.247 --> 00:21:04.663
I will be like okay, alright.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.007
Well somebody's got to
work a little harder but,

00:21:09.007 --> 00:21:10.340
(crowd laughs)

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.940
but, I love you, I
certainly will not complain

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.500
and then somebody did
work look a little harder.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.111
Like my rings have skipped up,

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:21.280
jeez I think Kev did it
like, maybe three times

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.570
before, you know what I have

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.340
and I'm not showing it.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.804
Enough, of that Rambo.

00:21:27.804 --> 00:21:28.637
(crowd laughs)

00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:29.800
Enough of that.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.790
But, I'm a ring girl.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.760
If you're a ring girl, just
know you don't start out with

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.620
am ice cube on your ring,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.087
that's not realistic for most girls.

00:21:38.087 --> 00:21:38.920
(crowd applauds)

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.030
Oh, that's it for Hot Topics,

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.650
but we've got more great
show for you everybody!

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.719
A little louder!

00:21:44.719 --> 00:21:45.552
(crowd roaring)

00:21:45.552 --> 00:21:48.090
Cause I love Mondays, it's
all about the Hot Topics.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.140
We've got the inside scoop on the latest

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.860
going on with R. Kelly
and Jussie Smollett.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.565
So, grab a snack and come on back.

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:57.820
(crowd roaring)

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.987
(upbeat techno music)
