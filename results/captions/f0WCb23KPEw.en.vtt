00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.269
Hi everybody.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.660
I want to begin with a quick
little exercise if you will indulge me.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.329
I want you all to close your eyes -

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.740
don't worry, this is not
going to be a meditation -

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.598
just close your eyes for a few seconds.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.440
And I want you to picture
somebody that has dementia.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.781
Okay, what does the term
"dementia" evoke for you?

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:43.780
Maybe you have a relative
with the disease.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.779
Maybe you've seen a documentary recently.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.398
There's no right or wrong answer.

00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:49.999
Just get that image in your mind's eye.

00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:54.479
Now I want you to open your eyes,
and if the image you had in your head

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.770
looks something like the person you see
on the screen in front of you,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.540
I want you to raise your hand.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.820
Alright, that's quite a bit of people.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.973
Now I want you to raise your hand
if the image you had in your head

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:07.710
looks somebody like the person
that you see on screen now.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.820
Okay. Much less people.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.093
This is my mother.

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:13.231
And her name is Kathy,
and she has dementia,

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.918
and I love her very much.

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:17.028
And when I had to come
to terms with the fact

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:20.270
that my mom was showing
the initial signs of memory loss

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.010
in her 50s a couple of years ago,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.300
it was an incredibly traumatic
experience for me,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.869
and it's still, to this day,
incredibly heartbreaking

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.899
to have to acknowledge.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.087
But because I couldn't chalk up
what I was seeing in my mom

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:33.180
to typical aging -

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.030
clearly she's not the picture of a person
succumbing to the ravages of time -

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.290
I decided to learn
all that I possibly could

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.551
about the ways diet and lifestyle
mediate risk for neurological disease,

00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:48.260
brain health, and ultimately
brain function itself.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.099
Now, what I learned shook me to my core.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.250
You see, I thought, like you guys,
that dementia was an old person's disease.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.059
You see, not only is dementia
not a normal aspect of aging,

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:03.041
but it begins in the brain decades
before the first symptom of memory loss.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.409
If you make it to the age of 85,
you have a one in two chance

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.461
of being diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.723
That's 50 percent;
those odds are not very good.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.411
And unfortunately
for my generation, millennials,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.080
we're the first generation in history
that's going to reach the age of 90,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.701
according to the Stanford
Center on Longevity.

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:21.660
Now, I think I speak for many millennials

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.880
when I say that generally
we believe science has our back, right?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.609
Ninety is a long ways from now.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.051
By the time I get to that age,

00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:30.870
we're going to have
some kind of pharmaceutical cure -

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.141
ultimately, not something
I have to worry about.

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.000
Well, unfortunately,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.282
Alzheimer's drug trials
have a near 100 percent failure rate.

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:39.919
Let that figure sink in, okay?

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.690
That's worse than the failure rate
for cancer drugs.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.271
I mean, those are dismal statistics.

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.052
Therefore, unless
we can prevent this disease,

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:53.339
one in two millennials will have it,
which is pretty heartbreaking.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.350
For the past century,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.649
the conversation surrounding
Alzheimer's disease,

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.189
the most common form of dementia,
has been one dominated by doom and gloom.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.442
That's because since 1906,

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:03.851
when Alzheimer's disease
was first coined and named

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.829
by the physician Alois Alzheimer,

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.872
90 percent of what
we know about the disease

00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:10.027
has been discovered
only in the past 15 years.

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:12.979
So that is to say, this is
a rapidly evolving field of science.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.077
And while we don't yet
have all the answers -

00:03:15.077 --> 00:03:17.498
there's still no cure;
I wish we had a cure -

00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:19.731
we do have enough information
to say that today,

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:23.870
for a significant proportion of people,
it is a potentially preventable disease.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.830
Here we have a statement written in 2014

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.889
by 109 leading scientists
and clinicians around the globe

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.330
stating very plainly that in 2014,
we had enough evidence to say

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.140
that dementia and Alzheimer's disease
is a preventable disease.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.471
And just this year, for the first time,

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.611
at the Alzheimer's Association's
International Conference,

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:51.330
it was acknowledged that one third
of dementia cases may be preventable.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.791
Depending on what literature you review,
even more may be preventable as well.

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.563
This is just the statistic
that was most recently published

00:03:58.563 --> 00:03:59.651
in the journal Lancet,

00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.289
which is one of the top
medical journals in the world.

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.090
And here we have coverage
from that same event

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.521
alluding to the notion

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:11.129
that a field is now looking for hope
in an area once thought impossible.

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.340
Now, when it comes
to our diets and our lifestyles,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.928
and their impact on our health,

00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:24.419
it's been said that our genes load the gun
while our choices pull the trigger.

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.259
So I became obsessed

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.688
with trying to understand
what it is about the modern world

00:04:29.688 --> 00:04:32.610
that makes it so likely
for our choices to pull the trigger

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.910
on diseases like Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:37.778
So I did a deep dive into the literature.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.588
And I looked at parts of the world,
like in Ibadan, Nigeria,

00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:42.120
home of the Yoruba people.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.149
Now, there,

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:48.235
the most common and most well-defined
Alzheimer's disease risk gene,

00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:50.381
that in the United States puts somebody

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:55.109
at anywhere between a 2- and 14-fold
increased risk for developing the disease,

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:58.539
there, has little to no association
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.108
So in other words,
if you live in the United States,

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:04.289
and you are genetically at risk
for developing Alzheimer's disease,

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.491
you might move to Ibadan, Nigeria,
and see that risk disappear.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.370
So I started thinking
a lot about evolution

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.240
and the kinds of diets
that our ancestors might have consumed

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.111
during the time
in which our brains evolved -

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.340
the magnificent supercomputer
that each one of us is heir to,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.809
this incredible legacy -

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.111
and I realized that for two million years,

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:30.439
our ancestors ate in a way
that led to the evolution of our brains.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.980
That's pretty amazing.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.539
But then, 10,000 years ago,
something happened.

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.531
We turned our backs on that diet.

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:41.721
We went from being hunter-gatherers,
eating according to seasonal availability,

00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:42.981
the world was our buffet,

00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:46.281
we got our nutrients
from the 50,000 edible plant species

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:47.819
that there are around the world,

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.045
and we became settlers,

00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:50.361
essentially becoming slaves

00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:52.820
to the few crops
that we could domesticate.

00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:57.951
Over time, our brains lost the volumetric
equivalent of a tennis ball.

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.319
So let me just rephrase that
so you really get it.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.221
We ate a certain way for two million years
that led to the evolution of our brains,

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.059
then we turned our backs on that diet.

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.621
This ultimately paved the way
for the fact that today,

00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:11.902
60 percent of the calories
that we consume worldwide

00:06:11.902 --> 00:06:14.430
come from three plants.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.441
Three plants.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.201
Wheat, corn, and rice.

00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:22.015
Perhaps even worse, 50 years ago,

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:26.560
these crops became the basis
of our dietary guidelines,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.691
where for the first time in human history,
human beings were told how to eat.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.561
We were told to base our diets
on healthy whole grains.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.160
I mean, I grew up, the Food Pyramid -
which is now debunked - existed,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.180
telling me that if I wanted to be healthy,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.701
I needed to load up on anywhere
between 6-11 servings of grains per day.

00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.830
And today, the advice is still given

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.861
that to be healthy, we need
to incorporate grains in every meal.

00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:50.491
Well, when we look at research,

00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:52.769
like what was recently
published by Cochrane,

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:53.921
which is an organization

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.692
that has a partnership
with the World Health Organization

00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:00.590
and is known for their unbiased,
systematic reviews of medical research,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.270
we see that there is no evidence
to suggest that eating grains,

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.005
including whole grains,

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:08.000
improve our health.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.361
Now, in this research review,
they looked at a certain kind of a trial:

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.461
they looked at a randomized
controlled trial.

00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:15.041
Now, randomized controlled trials

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.170
are the only kinds of trials
that can show cause and effect,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.101
which is why this research
is so important.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:24.199
But perhaps the most insidious thing
about these three grains

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.511
is that today they're pulverized
and packaged and sold to us

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:31.850
in processed foods
that line our supermarket aisles.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.061
These ultraprocessed foods

00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:38.540
now make up 60 percent of the calories
that we consume worldwide.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.412
When we consume
these exact kinds of foods,

00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:44.798
they set off the equivalent
of a forest fire in the body.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.151
And the brain sits
directly downwind of that fire.

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.330
That fire that I'm talking about,
that's called inflammation.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.052
And inflammation directly
accelerates brain aging

00:07:55.052 --> 00:07:57.602
and worsens pre-existing disease states.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.890
Now, our bodies have an incredible
capacity to heal from inflammation.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.501
That's what's so great
about being a biological entity.

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.689
Our bodies are so smart.

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:07.370
But the problem is our bodies
need the proper ingredients

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.260
to be able to repair from inflammation.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.259
Unfortunately today,

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:13.891
90 percent of Americans are now deficient
in at least one vitamin or mineral.

00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:15.081
Why do you think that is?

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:17.090
Well, that's because
we're basing our diets

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.182
around not only
these ultra-processed foods,

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:21.449
but processed foods
made from these three crops,

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:23.920
which are pretty scarce
when it comes to nutrients.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.552
They're calorically dense,

00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:29.371
but they are not nutrient dense,
which is a key differentiator.

00:08:29.371 --> 00:08:31.451
Another thing that
these foods do very well

00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:34.701
is they send levels
of blood sugar through the roof.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.552
And when blood sugar is elevated,

00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:39.869
an ancestral hormone in our bodies
also becomes elevated.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:41.390
That hormone is called insulin,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.951
and insulin is the body's
chief fat-storage hormone.

00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:47.739
The fact that we're relying
so much on these kinds of foods

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:49.511
is why for the first time in history,

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:53.121
there are more overweight people
walking the earth than underweight.

00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.761
Now, the other thing
that insulin does really well

00:08:55.761 --> 00:08:57.229
is it turns your fat cells

00:08:57.229 --> 00:09:01.382
into the equivalent of a subway turnstile
in midtown Manhattan during rush hour.

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:04.802
Basically, calories can flow
into your fat cells,

00:09:04.802 --> 00:09:06.192
but they can't come out.

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:07.581
Now, this is very problematic

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.652
because there are certain
organs in our body

00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:12.299
that have evolved to use fat,

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.222
and use it remarkably well -
in particular, the brain.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.101
The brain loves to use fat for fuel.

00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:20.631
In fact, I call fat
our body's birthright fuel.

00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:22.227
You see, when we're born,

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:25.062
human babies come packaged
with an unusual amount of fat.

00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:28.409
Our fatness rivals that
of baby seals, actually.

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:31.169
We come packaged with a really
high percentage of body fat.

00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:33.900
I don't mean to make
any babies in the audience insecure.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.528
If there are any babies
in the audience, I apologize,

00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:38.000
but it's actually fascinating

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.840
why it's believed we come
packaged with so much fat.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.772
You see, the human baby is born
with a half-baked brain.

00:09:43.772 --> 00:09:46.140
We complete our development in the world.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.492
This is often referred to
as the fourth trimester.

00:09:48.492 --> 00:09:50.841
If we were born cognitively

00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:55.390
with the skills that some
of our simian ancestors are born with,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.171
our gestation would be twice as long.

00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:59.670
This is one of the reasons
human beings are so smart.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.623
We complete our development in the world.

00:10:01.623 --> 00:10:04.029
And it's thought the fat
that we come packaged with

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:06.520
serves as a sort of Mophie
for the developing brain.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.131
The developing brain
is incredibly energy hungry too.

00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:10.721
This is why that's so useful.

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:15.640
The newborn brain uses 90 percent
of the baby's metabolic rate.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.031
So that means that 90 percent

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:19.522
of the oxygen and calories
that the baby is consuming

00:10:19.522 --> 00:10:20.641
goes to fuel its brain.

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.002
But the baby couldn't possibly consume
enough calories to support that,

00:10:24.002 --> 00:10:25.001
therefore, fat.

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:28.290
In the human adult brain, the ability
to use fat for fuel is not lost.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.781
In fact, as adults,
our brains still love to use fat.

00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:32.691
It could almost be said - almost -

00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:36.032
that when the brain
is using fat for fuel, it's not aging.

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:40.119
And the fact that we constantly,
chronically deny the ability of the brain

00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:43.500
to use fat for fuel due to our chronically
high-carbohydrate diets,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.901
well, this might be one of the most
detrimental aspects of the modern diet.

00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.580
And this could, partly,
explain why it's thought

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.860
that 40 percent of Alzheimer's cases

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.380
may be attributable
to chronically elevated insulin alone.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.022
Again, insulin is the hormone

00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:01.281
that turns our cells
into that subway turnstile.

00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:04.578
And this was a figure published
in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,

00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:07.272
which is one of the leading
dementia journals worldwide.

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:11.102
So knowing what I know about the brain
and how to properly feed it,

00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:14.751
I've become obsessed
with what I like to describe

00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:16.931
as resetting my brain
to its factory settings.

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:22.001
So I like to spend more time with my body
and brain in a low insulin state.

00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:24.541
And the quickest way,
the best and most efficient way,

00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:28.081
of getting your body and brain
into a low insulin state is via fasting.

00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:29.992
Luckily, we all fast every single day.

00:11:29.992 --> 00:11:31.240
This is when we're asleep.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.621
So what I like to do
is I like to pad my sleep

00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:35.610
by two or three hours on each side

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.289
with an additional time frame
in which I'm not eating.

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:40.611
A lot of people call this
intermittent fasting.

00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:43.532
But essentially, one of the main goals
of intermittent fasting

00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:47.041
is to allow your body and brain
to spend more time in a low insulin state.

00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.971
When it's time for me to eat,
I opt for nutrient density,

00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.481
which describes foods

00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:55.791
that have a very high ratio
of nutrients to calories.

00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:57.560
And there's no better example of that

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.812
than dark, leafy greens,
like kale and spinach.

00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:02.480
They have tons of nutrients
that protect your brain cells

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.510
and help your brain cells create energy,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.041
and they have very few calories.

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.191
In fact, the consumption
of dark, leafy greens

00:12:08.191 --> 00:12:11.940
is associated with reduced aging
by up to 11 years.

00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:14.180
I eat lots of eggs.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.880
You see, I learned
that when an embryo is developing,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.680
the first structure to develop
is the nervous system,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.933
which includes the brain.

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:23.781
Therefore, an egg yolk
is literally designed by nature

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:25.800
to contain all
of the necessary ingredients

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.539
required to grow a healthy brain.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.082
I also eat two to three servings

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.530
of humanely-raised
grassfed red meat per week.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.687
If I was a pre-menopausal woman,
I would probably eat three to four

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:39.279
because red meat contains an abundance
of highly bioavailable micronutrients.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.930
And in fact, a lot of people today

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.401
say that there's no place for meat
in a healthy diet.

00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:47.750
But to that, I invoke a quote
from one of my heroes, Carl Sagan,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.672
who said that extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence.

00:12:51.672 --> 00:12:52.765
And researchers believe

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:55.789
that it's not just access to meat,
but cooked meat

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.618
that catalyzed the growth
of our brains during our evolution.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.328
I eat lots of fatty fish:

00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:05.209
salmon, wild salmon, and sardines.

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:07.130
And this is actually my perfect plate.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.880
It's half, if not more,
filled with colorful, fibrous vegetables

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.071
and a piece of protein
that's not just protein.

00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:15.779
It's got a ton
of essential micronutrients,

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:16.842
like DHA fat,

00:13:16.842 --> 00:13:20.489
which is one of the most important
structural building blocks of the brain.

00:13:20.489 --> 00:13:25.270
We now know that the adult brain
can grow new brain cells up until death.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.259
But the impetus there is
that we need to supply our brains

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:31.751
with the appropriate
building blocks to do so.

00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:34.981
I also eat tons of fruit.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.710
But not all fruits, okay?

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.440
I eat lots of avocados.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.070
Avocados have the highest percentage
of fat-protecting antioxidants

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.531
of any fruit or vegetable.

00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:47.612
This is really important
and really key for brain health

00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:50.039
because your brain is constructed of fat.

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:52.690
Sixty percent of the brain
by weight is fat,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.690
but it's a kind of fat
that is highly vulnerable

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.360
and prone to oxidation.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.971
We need to supply our bodies
with fat-soluble antioxidants

00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:03.039
like vitamin E -

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:05.472
I eat lots of avocados, an avocado a day.

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:10.991
And I avoid, for the most part,
modern, cultivated sweet fruit.

00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:12.772
I'm not going to stand up here, guys,

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:15.151
and tell you that the banana
on the right is toxic.

00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:16.172
It's not toxic!

00:14:16.172 --> 00:14:19.721
But today, our modern fruits are bred
to contain more starch and sugar

00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:23.022
than ever before in history
because we like the way it tastes.

00:14:23.022 --> 00:14:26.365
Compare the modern banana
to the wild banana on the left,

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.130
and you'll see the contrast is stark.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.598
And the research on fruit, okay,
might surprise you.

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:35.630
Published in the Journal
of the Alzheimer's Association,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.733
it was found when looking
at older adults

00:14:38.733 --> 00:14:43.240
that higher fruit consumption was
associated with shrinkage of the cortex,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.499
which is your brain's grey matter.

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:49.439
Now, researchers in this journal wrote -

00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:52.860
they compared that eating foods
with high glycemic load,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.911
whether as fruit
or highly refined carbohydrates,

00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.599
may have the same
detrimental effect on the brain.

00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.581
Now, this research is really fascinating

00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:04.191
because fruit is usually associated
with an overall healthy dietary pattern,

00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:07.792
but rather than just looking
at diets as a whole in this research,

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:10.422
they looked at individual
dietary components as well,

00:15:10.422 --> 00:15:13.071
where they came to this finding,
which is very striking.

00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:14.991
I also consume lots of fruit juice,

00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:16.580
but only one kind of fruit juice:

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.202
extra virgin olive oil,
which is actually a fruit juice.

00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:22.961
Extra virgin olive oil is a staple
of the Mediterranean diet.

00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:25.621
It's one of the main features
of the Mediterranean diet,

00:15:25.621 --> 00:15:28.920
adherence to which is associated
with a robust risk reduction

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.432
for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

00:15:31.762 --> 00:15:34.402
No talk about preventing
dementia and cognitive decline,

00:15:34.402 --> 00:15:36.791
which is the most important topic
I think there is,

00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:40.111
would be complete without
a little bit of a chat on exercise.

00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:42.451
So aerobic exercise is really important.

00:15:42.451 --> 00:15:45.691
I don't do my aerobic exercise in the gym,
I do it in the real world.

00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.550
I try to imbue my day
with as much movement as possible.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.801
I'm always walking, I take the stairs
whenever given the opportunity,

00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:53.280
and I bike-ride whenever I can.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.283
I know you guys in Venice
love bike-riding.

00:15:55.283 --> 00:15:57.041
The best thing about aerobic exercise

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:59.532
is that it boosts something
called BDNF in the brain.

00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:01.541
Remember this acronym;
it's very important.

00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:03.231
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:04.591
It's a guardian protein.

00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:05.740
It's a guardian molecule

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.930
that not only ensures the survival
of your existing neurons,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.970
but promotes the growth
of new ones as well.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.172
It's key for neuroplasticity.

00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:18.080
And aerobic exercise
is the best way to stimulate BDNF.

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.999
I also love to lift weights.

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:24.072
Aside from making me
look better naked, which it does,

00:16:25.812 --> 00:16:26.991
having stronger muscles

00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:30.359
is really important
for brain function and brain health.

00:16:30.359 --> 00:16:31.361
Why?

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:34.500
Because the same exact stimulus
required to grow your muscles

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.743
and make them stronger

00:16:35.743 --> 00:16:39.359
also acts on your brain cells
to make them more efficient.

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:41.892
So where is the research to show

00:16:41.892 --> 00:16:45.161
that making all of these changes
in your lifestyles and diets

00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:46.693
is going to be worth your time?

00:16:46.693 --> 00:16:48.491
Where's the hard data? Right?

00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:51.790
Well, to answer that question,
I refer to the incredible FINGER study,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.901
which was led by Dr. Miia Kivipelto

00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:56.200
at the Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.862
I had the pleasure of visiting
the Karolinska Institute

00:16:58.862 --> 00:17:01.001
and interviewing Miia Kivipelto,

00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:03.020
and what's so great about the FINGER trial

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:08.191
is that it's the world's first-ever
large population, long-term,

00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:10.132
randomized controlled trial.

00:17:10.132 --> 00:17:13.522
Randomized controlled trials, remember,
are the kinds of trials required

00:17:13.522 --> 00:17:15.231
to prove cause and effect.

00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:17.750
And what she found
in this incredible trial

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.553
was that in her older adult
at-risk population,

00:17:21.553 --> 00:17:24.831
that by adhering to a battery
of dietary and lifestyle interventions,

00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:26.681
many of which I've described already,

00:17:26.681 --> 00:17:32.103
she was able to improve executive function
in her subjects by 83 percent

00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:35.932
and improve processing speed
by 150 percent.

00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:37.111
Now, this is incredible,

00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:41.402
and it's also particularly poignant for me
in regards to executive function

00:17:41.402 --> 00:17:44.261
because my whole life
I've struggled with executive function.

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.833
Here's a letter written
by my guidance counselors

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.739
in elementary school,
in the days before e-mail, to my parents

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:53.482
suggesting that I see a psychologist
because I had a lot of trouble

00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:56.152
focusing my attention
and tuning out distraction.

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:58.481
And that's why all throughout
my academic career,

00:17:58.481 --> 00:17:59.742
my grades were never good.

00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:02.531
That's why I went into film
instead of going to med school,

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.631
which is actually
what I really wanted to do.

00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:06.641
If only I knew then what I know now.

00:18:06.641 --> 00:18:10.452
So in closing, thanks to research
performed by AARP,

00:18:10.452 --> 00:18:14.505
we know that brain health is important
to 93 percent of Americans.

00:18:14.505 --> 00:18:15.732
That is awesome.

00:18:15.732 --> 00:18:17.852
What's less awesome
is that very few people

00:18:17.852 --> 00:18:19.951
know how to maintain
or improve brain health.

00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:22.871
So I'm trying to fill
this knowledge gap for people.

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:28.211
Because every three seconds
a new dementia case is diagnosed.

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:29.243
Let that sink in.

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:30.992
I mean, that's, like, heartbreaking.

00:18:30.992 --> 00:18:33.073
In fact, since I began
speaking to you guys,

00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:36.541
400 people around the world
were diagnosed with dementia.

00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:40.082
But for me, this is not about statistics.

00:18:40.082 --> 00:18:42.143
This is about a person
who I love very much:

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:43.363
my mother.

00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:46.801
And truthfully, I would do anything
that I could to get her back

00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:51.300
into the state she was before the monster
that is dementia took over.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.312
But it's made me incredibly passionate
about spreading this message of prevention

00:18:55.312 --> 00:18:57.332
out to people of all ages.

00:18:57.802 --> 00:19:01.080
Our cognitive health
might be a choice that we make

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.602
with every bite that we take.

00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:06.453
And I want to be very clear
that there's no person walking the earth

00:19:06.453 --> 00:19:07.841
who's not at risk.

00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:09.661
The brain is highly delicate

00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:14.324
and vulnerable to the many insults
thrown at it by the modern world.

00:19:14.324 --> 00:19:17.742
You're never too young or too old
to make a brain-healthy choice.

00:19:17.742 --> 00:19:19.622
And our brains really make possible

00:19:19.622 --> 00:19:21.820
all that it is that we love
to do in the world.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.683
So for that reason, I hope
that you'll all agree with me

00:19:24.683 --> 00:19:26.500
when I say that it's worth protecting.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.581
Thank you.

00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:29.641
(Applause)
