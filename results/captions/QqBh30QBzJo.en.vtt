00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.018
Look, I'm here with
Jennifer Aniston everybody.

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:02.812
And we're on fire.

00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:05.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.540
We are friends, and I
know a lot about you,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.610
but there are still some
things I don't know.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.350
So we're going to take
care of that right

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.797
now by playing
Burning Questions.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:13.380
Are you ready?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.250
Uh-huh.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.760
OK.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.450
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.180
All you do is think of the
answer, the honest answer,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.680
and then you hit
[DING] that button.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.179
OK.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.460
[DING] What's the weirdest thing
you've ever done to make money?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.220
I cut hair in the eighth, ninth
grade and made $10 a haircut.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.760
[DING]

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.173
In the ninth grade?

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.490
Wow.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.840
I sold vacuum cleaners.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.700
[DING] Who was your
first celebrity crush?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.630
Shaun Cassidy.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.250
[DING]

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.680
Mine is a tie between Donny
Osmond and Michael Jackson.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.180
[DING]

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.966
Oh, yeah.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.090
And then I turned a corner.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.702
So then--

00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:59.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.660
--tell us a lie that
you've recently told.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.895
"You look great."

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:05.805
[DING]

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:09.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030
Now everybody you said that to--

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.110
Everybody's wondering who it is.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.610
Yeah.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.890
"She told me I look great."

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.390
What are three things that
you must do every day?

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.300
Brush my teeth.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.800
Mm-hmm.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.310
Good.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.180
Take a shower.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.260
Great.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.846
And pray.

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:25.318
Ah, that's sweet.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:25.818
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:30.679
[DING] [DING]

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:31.970
Those are pretty much mine too.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.670
K.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.480
What's the most rebellious
thing you did as a teenager?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.210
Sneaking out with my best
friend Dre to the Palladium

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.070
and danced on top
of those boxes,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.451
and we didn't tell our parents.

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:46.950
[DING]

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.700
Wow.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.980
How old were you?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.240
17?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.050
17?

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.950
17.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.120
That's not bad at all.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.630
That's--

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.580
I know, and we didn't
even drink or anything.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.131
Yeah, wow.

00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:57.630
Nothing.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.094
Just to dance--

00:01:58.094 --> 00:01:58.590
Just dance on boxes.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.882
--dance, dance on boxes.

00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:00.757
Besides making love--

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:02.441
I did look like a
police officer though.

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:02.940
What?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.770
I was dressed like
a police officer.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.280
Why?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.510
I don't know.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.170
I don't know.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.699
It was the '80s.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.340
It's just what I did.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.100
I thought I was crazy.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.810
Rebellious.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.390
Rebellious.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.850
Besides making love,
showering, or swimming

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.240
what is something else
you've enjoyed doing naked?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.980
Watch TV.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.040
You watch TV naked?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.960
Yeah.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.050
Is that weird?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.600
I mean, at night, you get
into bed, and you watch TV.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.321
Oh, sure.

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:33.820
OK.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.600
All right.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.280
I thought you'd say like
sunbathing or something

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.780
like that.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.330
Oh, that too.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.890
All right.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.090
What really gets you--

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.690
[DING] What really gets you
[DING] in the holiday spirit?

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.960
This show.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.290
Vodka!

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.680
[DING] [DING]

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.180
Check out Jen's new
movie, Dumplin'.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.547
It's available on Netflix now.

00:02:58.547 --> 00:02:59.380
We'll be right back.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.140
Jen Aniston.
