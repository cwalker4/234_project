00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.866
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, MAYBE
YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS STORY.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.033
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY
FOUND $20

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.700
IN THE PARKING LOT
OF A RESTAURANT IN TOLEDO, OHIO,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.033
AND WHEN HE SAW A SOLDIER

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.700
HAVING LUNCH WITH HIS FAMILY
INSIDE,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.033
HE GAVE IT TO HIM
AS A THANK-YOU FOR HIS SERVICE.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.266
PLEASE WELCOME
MYLES ECKERT.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266
HI, MYLES.
I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.266
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.
I LOVE YOUR BOOTS.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.933
I LOVE YOUR TIE.
- [sighs]

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.066
- LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.
- OKAY.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.066
- OKAY.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.433
[laughter]

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.633
LISTEN,

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.366
YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU DID SOMETHING

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.533
REALLY, REALLY SWEET.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.533
YOU FOUND $20,
AND, OF COURSE, $20,

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.200
YOU COULD DO STUFF WITH THAT,
RIGHT?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.533
DID YOU THINK TO YOURSELF,

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.533
"HEY, I'M GONNA BUY..."
LIKE, WHAT?

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.866
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU COULD BUY?

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.366
- UH,
THE LEGO MOVIE VIDEO GAME.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.033
- THE LEGO MOVIE VIDEO GAME.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.366
INSTEAD, YOU SAW A MAN
SITTING INSIDE THE RESTAURANT,

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.866
WHO IS IN THE AIR FORCE,
RIGHT?

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.366
AND YOU WROTE A NOTE
AND WRAPPED UP THE $20.

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.366
AND CAN I READ PEOPLE
WHAT YOU WROTE IN THIS NOTE?

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.533
- YES.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.866
- "DEAR SOLDIER,
MY DAD WAS A SOLDIER.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.433
"HE'S IN HEAVEN NOW.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.766
"I FOUND THIS $20
IN THE PARKING LOT

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.433
"WHEN WE GOT HERE.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.433
"WE WOULD LIKE TO PAY IT FORWARD
IN MY FAMILY.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:08.600
"IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.233
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE."

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.300
AND GAVE IT TO HIM.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
[cheers and applause]

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.200
I MEAN...

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.066
THAT'S--
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.233
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
EIGHT?

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.400
- YES.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
I'M GOING TO BE NINE
IN A FEW WEEKS.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.566
- NINE IN A FEW WEEKS.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.066
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING
TO DO THAT.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.733
AND YOU SAY
YOUR DAD IS IN HEAVEN NOW.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.400
HE WAS A SOLDIER.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.100
I BET YOUR DAD
IS VERY PROUD OF YOU.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.266
I BET YOUR DAD THINKS--

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.500
[cheers and applause]

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.433
THE SOLDIER
THAT YOU GAVE THE MONEY TO

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:45.600
IS HERE TODAY.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.933
I'D LIKE HIM TO COME OUT
RIGHT NOW.

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.600
FRANK DAILEY, COME ON OUT.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
[cheers and applause]

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.266
- NICE TO MEET YOU, ELLEN.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.166
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.500
- MYLES, MY MAN.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.766
- SO LOOK AT THIS.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.766
SO OBVIOUSLY,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:08.933
- NO.
- HE JUST CAME UP TO YOU.

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.266
YOU'RE COLONEL FRANK DAILEY.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.433
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN--

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:12.766
IT'S THE AIR FORCE,
AM I RIGHT?

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.600
- IT'S THE AIR FORCE.
AIR NATIONAL GUARD NOW.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.633
- UH-HUH.
- YES.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:16.966
- HOW LONG?

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:18.633
- NEXT MONTH,
IT'LL BE 27 YEARS.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:19.933
- 27 YEARS.

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.266
[cheers and applause]

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.766
SO...

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:26.266
SO HE FIRST WALKS UP TO YOU,

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:27.933
AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.366
WHY HE WAS WALKING UP
TO YOU,

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.533
AND WHEN YOU READ THAT NOTE,
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.366
- I WAS BLOWN OVER
WHEN I READ THAT NOTE.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.533
OBVIOUSLY, YOU COULD SEE
THE REACTION FROM THE AUDIENCE.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.533
JUST, UH, HEART-TUGGING.
- YEAH.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.033
- YOU KNOW, LISTEN,
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.866
OR MILITARY INGRAINED IN ME,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.700
BUT MY EMOTIONAL PENDULUM
JUST DOESN'T SWING

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.533
BACK AND FORTH
VERY WILDLY.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.200
WELL, IT DID THAT DAY.
- YEAH.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.866
- AND, LISTEN,

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:56.366
IT TOOK
JUST A COUPLE ATTEMPTS

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.200
JUST TO GET THROUGH
THE NOTE,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.933
AND I HAD TO STOP
TO GAIN MY COMPOSURE,

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:06.066
AND MY WIFE, LISA, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S DOING ONE OF THESE.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.233
[laughter]

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:08.900
YOU KNOW, AND PLAYING
WITH OUR GRANDSON

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.233
SO, YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE,
YOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT CRYING.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.966
- YEAH.
- AND--OH.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:15.066
- AMAZING.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:16.733
I MEAN, IT REALLY,
REALLY IS AMAZING.

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.233
AND I KNOW--
IT'S TIFFANY, RIGHT?

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.033
MYLES' MOM IS IN THE AUDIENCE.
HI, TIFFANY.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.366
- HI.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:24.766
- I MEAN, REALLY,
WHAT AN AMAZING YOUNG MAN HE IS,

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:25.766
THAT HE SOUGHT TO DO--

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:26.766
- I'M SO PROUD.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:27.966
- YOU HAVE TO BE SO PROUD
OF HIM.

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:29.966
- I AM.
I'M SO PROUD.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.633
- AND SO--
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:35.133
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE $20?

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.800
- WELL, I TOOK
THE ORIGINAL $20 BILL,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800
AND I MADE COPIES--
SEVERAL COPIES, ACTUALLY--

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.300
OF THE NOTE ITSELF.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.133
SO I TOOK ONE OF THE COPIES.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.300
I GAVE IT TO A LOCAL CHARITY,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.133
BUT ON THE PIECE OF PAPER,

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:52.600
I WROTE A FURTHER EXPLANATION
OF WHAT IT WAS ABOUT

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.433
AND I WAS TAKING
MYLES' INSPIRATION--

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:01.333
"WE'RE PAYING IT FORWARD,
SO HERE IS THE $20,

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:05.666
AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT
BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY."

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.000
ANONYMOUSLY.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.666
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S SO ANONYMOUS ANYMORE.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.000
- NOT ANYMORE.
- NO.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.500
- BUT--SO YOU PAID IT FORWARD.
YOU PAID IT FORWARD.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.333
AND NOW, TIFFANY,
YOU'RE STARTING A--EXPLAIN.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.166
IT'S, UH, SNOWBALL EXPRESS,
RIGHT?

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:18.400
- YEAH, SNOWBALL EXPRESS

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.100
IS A PROGRAM
FOR OTHER GOLD STAR CHILDREN

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.600
LIKE MYLES
AND MY DAUGHTER MARLEE.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.766
[laughs]

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.266
IT'S A--
ONE TIME A YEAR,

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:26.766
THESE KIDS ALL COME TOGETHER
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.266
AND WE USUALLY MEET
IN TEXAS.

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:29.766
THEY GIVE THEM
FIVE DAYS OF FUN.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:30.933
THEY LOAD THEM UP ON SUGAR.

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:32.500
THEY GET TO HANG OUT
WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.833
THAT ARE JUST LIKE THEM--

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.333
ALL KILLED IN ACTION,
ALL SERVICE-RELATED DEATHS.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:39.500
SO IN AN ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE
THIS ORGANIC MASS CHAOS

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.333
THAT HAS TRANSPIRED
AS A RESULT

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.833
OF MYLES JUST BEING MYLES,

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.666
WE'RE TRYING TO HIT A GOAL
OF RAISING $10,000

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.166
FOR OUR OTHER FRIENDS,

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.666
TAKING THIS PAY-IT-FORWARD

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.166
TO PAY IT FORWARD
BACK TO OUR FRIENDS.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.066
AND I'M JUST--
MYLES, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.833
I ALWAYS TELL THE KIDS,
"KINDNESS ALWAYS WINS."

00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.833
AND YOU GET BETTER,
NOT BITTER.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.966
AND THIS JUST SHOWS THAT
YOU'RE LISTENING.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:02.966
I LOVE YOU.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.966
[applause]

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.500
- SO...

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A GIFT,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.666
BECAUSE KINDNESS
DOES PAY OFF,

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:18.333
AND SOMETIMES
IT DOESN'T PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY,

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.066
BUT IT REALLY ALWAYS COMES BACK
TO YOU.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:22.900
SO HERE
IS YOUR LEGO MOVIE GAME.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.900
- OH.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.733
- SO THAT IS YOUR FIRST PRESENT.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:30.900
AND THEN WHENEVER YOU WANT
TO COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.400
YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO LEGOLAND

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.733
AND HAVE ALL THE FUN
YOU WANT TO HAVE.

00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:37.100
ALL RIGHT?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.100
[cheers and applause]

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.933
AND, TIFFANY,
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:43.133
TO HELP SNOWBALL EXPRESS,

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.700
SO OUR PARTNERS AT SHUTTERFLY,
WHO LOVE

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.200
HELPING PEOPLE SHARE
THEIR STORIES THROUGH PHOTOS,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.866
ARE GIVING SNOWBALL EXPRESS
A CHECK FOR $20,000.

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:53.033
[cheers and applause]

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:54.700
- THANK YOU!

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.200
- WE'LL BE BACK!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.533
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE BACK WITH MYLES

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.133
AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
FRANK DAILEY.

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:01.600
AND WE WERE TALKING
DURING THE BREAK

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.400
AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS
TO SHARE THIS STORY,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.966
BECAUSE HOPEFULLY,
IT INSPIRES SOME OTHER KID

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.466
OR ANYONE TO PAY IT FORWARD
AND TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS,

00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:10.800
'CAUSE IT REALLY--IT--

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.466
YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:15.466
BY ONE PERSON
DOING A KIND GESTURE.

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:17.633
SO WE--YOU PROBABLY
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:18.966
TO GO ON A VACATION
FOR A WHILE--

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.533
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD--
WITH YOUR WIFE.

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:22.333
SO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:26.000
AND EXPEDIA.COM
IS PAYING IT FORWARD TO YOU

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.166
BY GIVING YOU A SIX-NIGHT TRIP
TO HAWAII.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.833
YOU'RE GONNA STAY
IN A FOUR-STAR HOTEL.

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:33.000
- [speaks indistinctly]

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.333
- YOU'RE GONNA RELAX
ON THE BEACH

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.166
IN HONOLULU, OAHU.

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.000
[cheers and applause]

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.500
I WANT TO THANK GEORGE LOPEZ,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.833
LUKE BRYAN,
AND JESSE METCALFE.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.833
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:43.666
BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER.
BYE-BYE.
