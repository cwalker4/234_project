00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:18.268
Hello, everyone.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.361
It's late in the day,
so I'm going to start with a test.

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.681
(Laughter)

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:26.081
How many planets do we have
in our solar system?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.468
Can't hear you.

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:29.456
(Audience) Eight.

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:32.112
Eight. Wasn't it nine?

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:34.432
What was the ninth one?

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:35.515
What happened?

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:36.786
Pluto, yes.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:40.403
So I'm going to talk about
some of the research that I'm doing,

00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:44.098
in particular, some new evidence
that's going to tell us

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:47.697
that there actually might be
the ninth planet in our solar system,

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:49.024
which is not Pluto.

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:50.998
So I'll describe how that goes.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.528
You can see the planets behind me.

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:57.480
There are eight of them as you see
and you answer the question correctly.

00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:58.726
Very good.

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:03.862
The first six which includes our Earth
have been known for a very long time.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.675
Humans have been around
for maybe about a million years.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:09.865
They probably saw it up in the sky.

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:12.441
They are visible with the naked eye.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.903
The seventh and the eighth planet
are not so simple.

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:20.700
Uranus, for example,
can be barely seen with the naked eye.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.988
If you go into a very dark place

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:25.394
and you stare at the sky
for a very long time,

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:27.795
you might be able to spot it.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.958
Neptune is totally invisible to your eye.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.163
Let me start with a little bit
of the history of what we know

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:36.471
about our solar system.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:39.920
Like I said, the first six
have been known for a long time.

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:41.860
The seventh one, Uranus,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.420
this one was the first planet
to be discovered using a telescope.

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:52.278
The telescope that was maybe this big,
fits on the size of your desk.

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:54.685
We now know that it orbits around the Sun

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:58.253
at an average distance
of about 19 astronomical units.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.604
One astronomical unit
is the average distance

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:03.042
between the Sun and the Earth.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:08.397
The eighth one, Neptune,
this has a very interesting story.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:12.371
This planet was actually
predicted to exist

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.638
before it was discovered.

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:16.804
After Uranus' discovery,

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:21.605
physicists, astronomers were putting
Newton's law of gravity to the test.

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:23.836
They tried to make predictions -

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:28.535
very precise predictions
of where Uranus would be on the sky,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.112
and they tried to compare that
with the actual observations.

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.089
And they found
that it did not exactly match

00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:36.929
where Uranus was supposed to be

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.091
according to Newtonian gravity.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.188
Half the people said:
''Oh, Isaac Newton is wrong,"

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:45.066
half the people said:
"Maybe there's something out there.''

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.254
It took some time,

00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:52.225
but it was actually finally predicted,
through lots of hard work,

00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:56.311
that one night Neptune will appear
in this part of the sky,

00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:59.605
and so astronomers should go
and look at that spot.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.241
And lo and behold, within one degree,

00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:07.899
which is about the size of your fingertip
at the distance of your arm,

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.206
it was found within 1 degree.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.785
Now, Neptune is what we consider
the outermost planet in our solar system.

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.746
It orbits around the Sun,

00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:21.232
at an average distance
of about 30 astronomical units.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:24.680
Now, I have to say something about Pluto,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.395
since Pluto was once a planet.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.545
When I was in elementary school,

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:32.853
I did learn that Pluto
was in fact the ninth planet.

00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:38.360
But in 2006, it was demoted down
to what we now know: a dwarf planet.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.743
It's not quite a planet,
but maybe close enough.

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:44.819
Now, the person who demoted Pluto,

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.314
his name is Mike Brown,
a professor at Caltech,

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:52.908
he is not very popular
for obvious reasons,

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.533
but he and his colleague at Caltech,
Konstantin Batygin,

00:03:57.538 --> 00:04:02.970
predicted that there might actually be
a true giant ninth planet

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.691
in the outskirts of our solar system.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.947
Now, how do you look for things
in our solar system?

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:16.005
Well, if you look at the sky
and if you take a telescope

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.876
and measure, say, a portion of the sky,

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:23.419
a solar system object
looks just like a star; it's a dot.

00:04:23.717 --> 00:04:26.917
The way to distinguish
a solar system object from a star

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:28.627
is through its motion.

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:32.376
The Earth goes around the Sun once a year.

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:36.474
The object is also moving around the Sun.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:41.189
So as the Earth goes
around the Sun once a year,

00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:45.509
a solar system object
would appear to wobble in the sky.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.749
So if you look at the actual motion
of, say, Pluto over a 10-year period,

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.562
it looks like this - that yellow coil
that you see in the back.

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.535
It takes exactly a year
to complete one loop.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:02.705
It loops every year.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.850
But at the same time, Pluto
is moving around the Sun,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.306
and so you have a combined motion
of a circular motion

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:12.342
and a drift in one direction.

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:15.905
This is how you look
for solar system objects.

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.596
Now, let me tell you how Mike Brown
and his colleague at Caltech predicted

00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:27.260
that there might actually be
a ninth planet in our solar system.

00:05:27.484 --> 00:05:31.037
So these are the terrestrial planets,
which includes our own Earth.

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:35.844
Zoom out - those are our gas giants:

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:39.029
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

00:05:39.764 --> 00:05:44.147
Now, if you'd zoom out even more,
there are a bunch of objects

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.397
but there are six in particular

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:51.107
that go way out to the outskirts
of the solar system,

00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:56.189
to about maybe 400-500 times
the astronomical unit.

00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.185
Now, you look at this, and say,

00:05:58.185 --> 00:06:00.544
"Whoa, okay, there
are six of these things.''

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:02.375
Do you see a pattern?

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:05.255
They're all pointed in this direction.

00:06:05.693 --> 00:06:09.747
Now, if these were just random objects
orbiting around the Sun,

00:06:09.747 --> 00:06:14.865
you would expect these elliptical orbits
to point in random directions.

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:18.059
The random chance of this occurring,

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.546
the fact that six are pointed
in the same direction,

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.851
and if you actually tilt this figure,

00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:26.758
they are actually orbiting
close to a similar plane.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.392
And so Mike Brown
and Konstantin Batygin said,

00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:33.244
"Well, this is weird.
You can't explain this.

00:06:33.657 --> 00:06:36.242
There's got to be something out there

00:06:36.242 --> 00:06:41.130
that is possibly shepherding the orbits
into a particular direction."

00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:44.294
And after a lot of hard work,
they came to the conclusion

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:48.974
that, yes, you can actually do this
if there's, in fact, a giant planet

00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:50.698
they called Planet Nine

00:06:50.698 --> 00:06:55.316
with an orbit that is anti-aligned
with the really extended orbits.

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.244
So this is what we're trying
to do at Penn.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.185
Penn is part of a large
international collaboration,

00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.503
it's called the Dark Energy Survey.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.071
We built this camera
and mount it on a telescope down in Chile.

00:07:09.238 --> 00:07:11.719
You see the big shiny dome behind me,

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:15.459
that is the Blanco telescope,
a four-meter telescope down in Chile -

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.018
we built a camera
that's literally this big,

00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:20.171
as tall as me, weighs about a ton,

00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:22.602
and mount it
on the top end of the telescope.

00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:26.147
What's special about this camera
is that it's huge.

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:30.994
In one shot, you can take
a very nice, crisp, deep picture

00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:33.312
of a big part of the sky,

00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:36.541
which is not something
that every telescope can do.

00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:41.074
Now, this camera was built
for actually a different reason.

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:44.139
As the name suggests,
it's called the Dark Energy Survey.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.368
We built this camera to try to study
the evolution of the universe.

00:07:48.576 --> 00:07:50.174
How did the universe begin?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.019
How is it expanding?

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.323
What is the ultimate fate of the universe?

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.228
That's what the other 200 astronomers
in our collaboration are doing.

00:07:58.414 --> 00:08:01.643
But me and my colleague here,
Professor Gary Bernstein,

00:08:01.992 --> 00:08:03.050
saw this and said,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.102
"Well, this is a very good camera
which takes very good data.

00:08:07.102 --> 00:08:12.386
You can actually use the same data
to find objects in our solar system."

00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:17.862
This is a picture - one exposure
taken on our camera.

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:21.304
You can see the size
of the old camera in comparison,

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.192
which can fit the full moon.

00:08:23.192 --> 00:08:25.764
We can fit many full moons in one shot.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:29.476
It's half a billion pixels,
costs about 80 million dollars.

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:31.758
It's a very expensive instrument.

00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:35.008
We're taking pictures every night,

00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:37.697
and we're taking many,
many pictures every night,

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:41.227
and trying to look for things
that move across the sky.

00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:43.783
Now, most of the objects
are stars and galaxies.

00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:47.250
Stars move a little bit;
galaxies don't move at all;

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.420
solar system objects move quite a bit.

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:56.375
I'm showing you here about 0.05 percent
of the data that we have.

00:08:56.896 --> 00:09:01.270
Each star that appear and disappear
are actual new things

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.610
that we discovered in this particular part
of the sky that were not present before.

00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:07.681
There's a lot of them.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.343
If you'd combine all
of the data that we have,

00:09:10.343 --> 00:09:13.476
we'd have tens of millions
of new detections.

00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:17.036
Most of them are asteroids,
main belt asteroids,

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:21.642
that orbit around the Sun,
between Mars and Jupiter,

00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:25.488
but a small, tiny fraction of these
are things in our solar system

00:09:25.488 --> 00:09:27.479
that are way out there.

00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:30.250
So we take these detections,
millions of detections,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.672
and try to connect the dots,
because like I said earlier,

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:35.935
solar system objects move.

00:09:35.935 --> 00:09:40.111
They move in a very particular way
according to Newtonian gravity.

00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:44.093
So we take these detections,
take many, many computers,

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:47.928
and try to find
the few objects that match up,

00:09:47.928 --> 00:09:52.473
that correspond to the same object
in the outskirts of our solar system.

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.165
So what happens is something
that looks like this.

00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:00.675
I'm not showing you
all of the detections here.

00:10:00.675 --> 00:10:02.364
I'm only showing you the detections

00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:06.881
that correspond to actual solar
system objects that are way out there

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:08.958
beyond the orbit of Pluto.

00:10:09.162 --> 00:10:12.387
In this small area, you can see
three camera pointings over here,

00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:15.924
which adds up to
about 0.15 percent of our data,

00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:17.949
we found 15 objects.

00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:22.551
Now, try doing that with
a bunch of undergraduate students here.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:26.977
Students here are absolutely great,
but if I tell them to do this manually,

00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:30.689
connect a million dots and try to find
the ones that match up,

00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.612
you really need a computer.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.618
Now, I have to confess

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:38.417
that despite all the hard work
that we have done so far,

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:41.076
we have not yet found Planet Nine.

00:10:42.134 --> 00:10:45.058
I probably wouldn't be here
if I had discovered it,

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:46.170
(Laughter)

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:51.224
but we did find at least
one interesting object that is rare.

00:10:51.224 --> 00:10:55.836
And you look at this picture.
It's insignificant; it's that little dot -

00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:57.849
of course it doesn't come with the arrow -

00:10:57.849 --> 00:10:59.755
it's that little dot that we discovered.

00:10:59.755 --> 00:11:01.616
It looks like nothing,

00:11:01.616 --> 00:11:05.134
but this turns out to be a distant
dwarf planet that we discovered.

00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:06.748
It's just like Pluto.

00:11:06.748 --> 00:11:08.009
It's way out there.

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:11.532
It's slightly smaller than Pluto,
but this is the technology that we have -

00:11:11.532 --> 00:11:15.820
we can see these things
out to very large distances.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.039
Now, we've done
a lot of follow-up work on this

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:21.463
and try to identify its nature.

00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:24.944
We now know that it has an orbit
that looks like that

00:11:25.271 --> 00:11:27.713
in comparison to the orbit of Neptune.

00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:31.467
And you can see how the dots
move across three different nights.

00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:36.538
Again, it's insignificant,
but computers are able to detect this.

00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:40.768
Now this name DeeDee
comes from distant dwarf.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:45.257
It's an acronym for distant dwarf,
and we put in the vowels in between.

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:50.147
We now know that it has a size
of about 600 kilometers -

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:52.039
it's a little bigger than Pennsylvania.

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:55.867
But this thing currently
sits at 92 astronomical units.

00:11:56.005 --> 00:11:58.744
You have this ball of rock

00:11:58.744 --> 00:12:02.094
that is roughly as big as Pennsylvania,

00:12:02.094 --> 00:12:07.150
92 astronomical units,
and we are capable of detecting it.

00:12:07.472 --> 00:12:10.336
In terms of its brightness,
its current brightness,

00:12:10.336 --> 00:12:13.407
it's comparable to taking a candlestick

00:12:13.407 --> 00:12:15.847
and putting it
at the distance of the moon,

00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:18.476
and we are able to detect that.

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:22.991
Now, like I said,
we haven't found Planet Nine yet.

00:12:23.185 --> 00:12:25.655
We have looked at about half of our data.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.738
We're actively sifting through the rest
of the data that we have now.

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:32.915
Does it exist?

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.660
I don't know.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.146
But if it's in our images,
we'll definitely find it.

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:40.850
And like Stephen Hawking said

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.262
that we should all look up at the sky
and not down to your feet,

00:12:45.262 --> 00:12:46.315
I'm trying to do that.

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.940
I'm trying to look up at the stars

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.862
with the hope of maybe
sometime in the future

00:12:50.862 --> 00:12:54.094
finding this and understanding
more about our solar system.

00:12:54.096 --> 00:12:55.590
Thanks for your time.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.526
(Applause)
