00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.800
This simulation crash is made with x-plane 11 flight simulator [XP11]

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.500
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, THIS IS ONLY A SIMULATED FLIGHT CRASH FOR ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ET302.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.820
THIS STORY IS BASED ON REAL HAPPENING:

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.300
Again a tragic plane crash with b737 max 8 plane, from Ethiopia Airlines.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.740
This time it happend in Ethiopia.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.240
The plane b737 max started the flight from Addis Ababa airport (HOOB airport code) with 157 people onboard.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.340
For this flight the flightnumber was ET302.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.320
At the day and time when the plane took off, the weather seems turbulent

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.340
and a few clouds around Addis Ababa airport.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.520
This flight started in early morning.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.120
The plane was pushed back by a pushback tow.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.640
The registration of this aircraft was ET-AVJ

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.360
When the pushback was finished, the pushback tow released the plane, and the plane was ready for taxi to runway 07L.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.680
The pilots are preparing for takeoff and deploying the flaps to 5 degrees.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.040
After some cockpit preparation, they starting to taxi to runway 07L

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.400
Etiopian Ailrines b737 max on the taxiway at Addis Ababa airport.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.760
Plane is at holding point runway 07L and making backtrack on the runway to taxi to 07L.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.860
The plane is on the final turn, they are ready to line up and take off from Addis Ababa airport runway 07L.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.060
b737 max plane is on the takeoff

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.640
Wing view from b737 max

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.280
The plane took off from Bole airport runway 07L at 08:38 a.m. local time.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.480
It is very shaky in the sky and the plane has getting difficult to climb, because the airport elevation and the plane load.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.920
Right wing view of the b737 max plane.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.880
From the cockpit view of a b737 max plane.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:20.600
6 minutes After takeoff the pilots reporting tecnical difficulties and asked for clearance to return.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.720
At 08:44 a.m. local time flight ET302 went down near Bishoftu, southeast of Addis Ababa airport.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.380
At the time that the plane went down you can hear people onboard screaming,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.500
this sound is added while editing, so this is not implemented from the simulator.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.340
All 157 people aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed soon after taking off from Addis Ababa have been killed.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.400
The pilot was a senior Ethiopian Airlines pilot who had flown more than 8,000 hours. He had an "excellent flying record.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.080
I wish a lot of strength for the families of the victims. Hopefully b737 max will not fly for ever!
