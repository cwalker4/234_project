00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:22.341
&gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS WISCONSIN, WE

00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:23.909
WON'T FORGET ABOUT YOU THIS

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.209
TIME.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.278
CLEARLY WISCONSIN IS ONE OF THE

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:28.414
STATES THAT HILLARY CLINTON DID

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:30.383
NOT VISIT, DID NOT CAMPAIGN IN

00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:33.786
IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE 2016

00:03:33.787 --> 00:03:34.453
CAMPAIGN BECAUSE DEMOCRATS

00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:37.323
THOUGHT THEY HAD IT IN THE BAG

00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:39.458
AND DONALD TRUMP, OF COURSE,

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.093
STUNNED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BY

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:42.762
THEN WINNING PENNSYLVANIA AND

00:03:42.763 --> 00:03:43.562
THEN ADDING WISCONSIN AND

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:45.331
MICHIGAN FOR GOOD MEASURE.

00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:50.770
AND CLEARLY THIS

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.171
THEY MESSED UP ON THAT AND IT

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:54.974
WAS NOT JUST THE LACK OF APPEAL

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:55.508
OF HILLARY CLINTON.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.443
IT WAS ALSO THAT THE PARTY WAS

00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.545
NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:00.613
THE INDUSTRIAL UPPER MIDWEST.

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:02.949
&gt;&gt; Bill: IT'S A GOOD TOWN.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.051
HOPE THEY COME TO FOX, TOO, BY

00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:06.452
THE WAY FOR THE LONG-AWAITED

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:08.288
DEBATE.
