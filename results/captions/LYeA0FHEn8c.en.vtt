00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.340
GUEST: My grandparents picked it up.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.679
They traveled a lot in China.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.190
APPRAISER: And when were they in China?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.190
GUEST: Probably the early part of the century.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.190
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.009
Where have you had this since then?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.940
GUEST: My mother's had it in her house, and
then I inherited it and brought it West.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.940
APPRAISER: Good.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.940
GUEST: She lives near Boston.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.940
APPRAISER: You've had other people look at
this, and what have they told you?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.930
GUEST: Well, some years ago, she knew someone
who knew about Chinese art, and he looked

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.890
at it, and he said it was from the Ming Dynasty,
he thought, and priceless, and that's all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.890
I know.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.070
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.390
Well, I'll start out by saying when this came
up, I could barely...

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.520
GUEST: I could tell.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.680
APPRAISER: It's fantastic.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.740
This is truly...

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.870
I'm sorry, I'm all worked up.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.730
This is among the finest examples of Chinese
art that we have seen on the ROADSHOW.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.760
The carving is beautiful.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.670
The workmanship is stunning.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.000
The carver who did this was truly a master.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.040
You can see the muscles rippling under the
surface.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040
It's marble.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.489
It's the finest quality marble you can get.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.570
It's truly magnificent.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.360
And as you look at this, any way you look
at it, it's fantastic.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
It's wonderful.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360
It's breathtaking.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.310
I see little, tiny versions of these that
come in for sale, but never does one see one

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.390
that's like this.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.390
GUEST: Wow.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.869
APPRAISER: Now, one of the things he was wrong
about is, it's not Ming Dynasty.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.869
GUEST: Huh.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.510
APPRAISER: This dates from the Golden Period
of Chinese art, which is called the Tang Dynasty,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.820
between the sixth century and the ninth century.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.820
GUEST: Wow.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.270
APPRAISER: Your grandparents bought something
when they were on their trip that you can't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.240
get now.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.280
You can see examples like this in museums.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
GUEST: Wow.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.760
APPRAISER: Um, occasionally, they come up
at auction.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.200
You know, it's wonderful.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.550
GUEST: Oh, I don't plan to pass it on.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.550
APPRAISER: It's wonderful.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.020
Now, one of the ways that I can tell you that
it's what it's supposed to be, not only just

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.619
from the artistic aspects of it, because that
tells us clearly that this was done by a masterwork,

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.560
as a master carver.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.649
But when you look at it underneath, you can
see that there's every indication of great

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.649
age--

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.649
GUEST: Uh-huh.

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:16.090
APPRAISER: --from the chisel work that's taken
place to the sort of sandy surface, which

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.230
is fantastic.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.610
That gives you the kind of patina that you
want to see.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.430
It's something that's been handled, and it's
been around for a while.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.450
It's a great thing.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.670
GUEST: The artist didn't sign it.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.010
APPRAISER: No, these were never signed.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, I was with my colleagues, Dessa Goddard
and Jim Callahan, both of whom work in the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
auction business.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.220
We've all been in the business for 20, 30
years.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.160
And we were each trying to figure out what
the value of this would be.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And I'm sure...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
I'm sure you want to know.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.120
GUEST: Well, I mean, that's not important
to me, particularly, but I'd be curious, yes.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.379
APPRAISER: Okay, okay.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.379
Um...

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.700
I would feel pretty confident that one could
get between $120,000-$180,000 for it.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.950
GUEST: Wow.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.360
Not that I'd sell it but yeah.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.709
APPRAISER: I mean it's a fantastic, fantastic
thing.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.709
I think, you know, if you had come to me ten
years ago with this, I would have gotten $300,000

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.709
to $400,000 for it.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.709
GUEST: Wow.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.709
APPRAISER: The market has shifted; it's changed.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.709
Uh, there are a lot of great examples of Chinese
sculpture that have come on the market since

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.709
then.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.709
Now, the value I gave you is an auction estimate
value.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.709
GUEST: Mm-hmm.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.709
APPRAISER: That's what you could sell it for.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.709
GUEST: Uh-huh.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.709
APPRAISER: If you wanted to keep this, which
is what you said you want to do, I would say

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.560
that an insurance figure on this would be
somewhere between, you know, $150,000 and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
$250,000.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560
Probably toward the high end.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560
I would say around $250,000--

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
GUEST: Wow.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560
APPRAISER: --for insurance purposes.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.780
GUEST: I'm just really pleased.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.849
APPRAISER: So it was worth lugging it in here.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.370
GUEST: Yeah, it's... it's wonderful.
