00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.929
a few years ago we got this crazy idea to
build a bedroom for each of the kids

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.900
after a few decisions about what type of
building method both alternative and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.080
traditional, we decided on the one that was
the most abundant to us

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.840
Dirt

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.220
all of us kids have

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.980
gotten an earth bag bedroom except for
Shae

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:38.180
[music]

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.320
[music]

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.140
we started this six, seven years ago

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.690
we
decided we were just gonna build a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.600
bedroom for each of the kids and off we
went

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.100
starting off with a Bree with great
aspirations

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.980
oh yeah

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.300
we were going to bang these out like boom boom boom boom

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.020
Mommy

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.320
did you catch that on video?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.020
what?

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.700
He took the saw and he was trying to cut it and he went, zzzzzzzzzz

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.360
to the dirt bags

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.480
Bree's room, she was interested
in a drum space

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.420
that's were my bed goes

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.220
that's going to be my closet

00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:13.200
that's going to be my drum area

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.640
then you got different

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.460
financial things - we run out of
bags and we don't know where to buy the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.320
bag

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.210
there's just different stresses that
happen through the years that were

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.400
putting these together

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.420
each one got a
little bit more elaborate

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.009
well, you know grrr grrr grrr

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.769
each one had its own style, its own
purpose, its own theme

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:30.960
each one was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.460
designed by the kids

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880
and then Garen had this a castle look

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.759
and then we

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060
experimented with his exterior a little
bit

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.570
we were into the paper bags on

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.580
Garen's room

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.530
it's kind of like the hula hoop, we go

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.180
through these little stages I guess

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.429
Bryson, at one time, was really into the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.860
stars and that's why he had that patio
to put the telescope on

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.580
not everything's all hunky-dory and roses
right

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.789
I mean there's stresses and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.080
time commitments

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.000
there were times when some of us had to be away

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120
this stuff is really cool

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.440
I'm helping you out Dad

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.780
thanks Honey

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.280
you don't think about the time that you're
gonna be spending with the kids, working

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
side-by-side and you get to see them in
stressful situations and happy

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.150
situations and all of - the whole
gamut and it helps you as a parent to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.380
be able to address some of the issues
that come up and help the kids through

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.280
things and they helped us probably more than we help them

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.780
that we need to be patient and it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.680
turned out to be just a really
wonderful experience and more than just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.580
building buildings don't you think?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.460
oh absolutely

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.520
Sometimes it was

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.760
more, what do I do here

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.500
I know that this
should look like that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.960
the kids and everybody's working on it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.560
do I leave it or do I go back and change it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.460
and usually I just left it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.239
I thought, you
know it's better for me for them to have

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.660
that sense of accomplishment

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.080
it's not
hurting anything

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.930
that's the look and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.917
that is just the way it's gonna be and
I learned through that

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:55.750
it's organic that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.520
was our saying

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.960
it's organic

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.440
I've had a lot of time to think about
what I want for my room but as I was

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.660
designing it, I realized it was a heart
shape

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.360
design can sometimes just happen

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.910
accidentally and I didn't intend to have
this this perfect third idea and it just

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.930
seemed that two hearts, one going
one way and one going the other way

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.040
came out that way

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.980
we're going down
one yardstick

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.840
this is gonna be the one

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.400
circle is gonna be three-foot lower than
the other circle

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.910
how's it going guys?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.120
it's going beautiful

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.580
the dogs were such a ginormous
help

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.917
they moved dirt and moved sticks

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:37.720
if they

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.900
were able to actually get the dirt out
of the hole, that would be a lot more

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200
productive rather than just moving it
from one place to another

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.830
he's watching

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.540
you dig and he goes, I can do that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.300
gettin
deep

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.360
the root of our problems right there

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.220
Root-pert

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.840
[music]

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.800
we  cut out with the pressure washer,
then we break out the chunks

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.880
it worked

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.340
surprisingly well

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.340
[laughter]

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.980
I'm really bummed about that shovel though

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.440
that was your favorite?

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640
yeah

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.305
this wimpy one will have to be my
favorite from now on

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:34.190
I'm gonna go put a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.280
quick shield on it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.800
it worked really good

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.500
I gotta try it now

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.880
[music]

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.460
we needed a couple
railroad ties so we looked online and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.120
there were some people who wanted to get
rid of theirs

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.000
we went and helped them

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.509
dig them out, out of their property and if
you're willing to go and dig up some

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.380
railroad ties for someone then if it makes them happy it makes us happy

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.200
it's a deal

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.500
[drum music]

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.895
a lot of times we'll just be
able to bury our posts

00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:18.500
when there long

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.000
enough

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.920
we have shorter posts

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.940
we got to add a

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.760
little extra so we can get them up in
the air

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.400
kisses

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.300
hugs

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.380
blah

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.660
you just want my bottle

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.660
that's what you want

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.260
first bag

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.400
[music]

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.840
we put together the foundation just
like typical

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.150
we do have some pretty nice

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.060
ground out here

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.080
we drop it in
two or three different rows down so we

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.510
get kind of a foundation that's placed
in and then we start building on top of

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.300
that and kind of gauging in where that
floor is gonna set

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.240
[music]

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.440
look at that

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.120
beautifully leveled pole

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.040
it's gorgeous

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.140
Bullet, look, I got a stick

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.220
ready - go get it

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.100
yes you've got that stick

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.120
it's just a process

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.880
do a layer

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.100
tamp it on
the top

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.060
tamp it on the side and so forth

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:37.660
[music]

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.720
one side or the other

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.020
[music]

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.060
Hi Dad

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.520
hey

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.300
no, no, no don't ruin it

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.592
these buildings are so organic
and just different

00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:54.900
you don't really ever

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.080
know what they're gonna turn out like
until they're done

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.850
no matter how much

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.350
time I spend there looking at it and
planning, it doesn't turn out exactly what's in my head

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.380
but it's even better normally

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.540
I am a human stabilizer

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.820
are you growing your hair out?

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:16.340
[music]

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.620
there's gonna be a post in the center of
my bedroom

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.700
and I really didn't want it to be a
railroad tie

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.280
that's the beginning

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.740
Garen suggested we used some of the old
mesquite trunks that we have

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.080
they're real thick wood and I really like that
idea

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.370
dad has found our center post and

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.420
he's been working on that and getting
that ready

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.040
gonna be a little bit more

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.800
artistic

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.580
it's a shapely kind of a post

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.469
scraping it all down

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:44.180
there's a lot of

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.280
bugs so it's gonna take a little bit of
time to chase those worms out

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.940
you want to

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.660
look at this dad just double-check

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.400
your good at it

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.500
unless something is not right and you hate it because your roof won't fit

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.680
my roof doesn't matter there

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.440
ummm hummm

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.960
[music]

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.560
[music]

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.220
Shae and I, we headed over

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.580
to the hoop barn to see what windows
were available over there

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.160
I found these candy jars so we're gonna use those aren't we Shae?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.080
yeah

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.520
those are definitely gonna work

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.080
yeah I've always
thought it would be cool to put

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.660
something in there

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.160
okay

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.857
little jars

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:26.330
it's nice to kind of map things out now

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.620
so that we know where everything's gonna
go

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.238
there's windows, hangers

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:30.979
we're gonna

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.400
do some bottle lights

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.780
I want them by my bed

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:43.300
[music]

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.720
before we start the day, we usually cut our
bags to length, lay the barbed wire and

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.780
then start

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.280
[music]

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.620
[music]

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.580
nice

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.620
It took quite a bit of work, doing some
sanding and taking down all these rough

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.779
edges and stuff but for the most part I
think I've got it shaped the way I

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:10.500
want shaped

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.310
one of the things we told the
kids was whoever got the first, which of

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.640
course the oldest, Bree, got the first
building

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.120
the benefit is is she gets the

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.490
building first but the benefits of the
last being Shae is that she will then

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.820
get hopefully, the best building because
we've learned from all the other

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.380
buildings

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.140
when I was designing this
one, I had a lot of time

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.360
I got to experience
everyone's building and seeing what they

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.079
like, what they don't like so I combined
what I liked about all the buildings

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:38.360
into mine

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:56.740
[music]

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.440
clearly, I was not made for
this job

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.320
ahhhh

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.769
okay, we're doing this differently now

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.130
so that they're

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:05.980
already

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.420
try this again

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.260
alright, what do you think of that snapple?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.000
we have smaller
windows this time

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240
the actual that wall sticks

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.620
out of the ground is a little shorter
than our usual buildings

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.269
it's dog level

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:19.340
Diesel

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.520
hi

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.780
except they'll be a window

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.820
oh my
gosh, you're gonna have all kinds of nose

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.080
windows

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.780
oh no

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:35.480
[music]

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.399
we're going with the two by
12 instead of a two by ten to try and

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.560
get a little bit wider of a window box

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.660
that way it covers more of the bag

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.420
[drum music]

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.020
Garen savage in his natural environment

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.840
[drum music]

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.340
it's

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.769
just four two by twelves and then just
squaring it up, nailing it together

00:10:55.769 --> 00:10:57.520
nothing too complex

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:09.440
[drum music]

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.600
because the windows are smaller, I don't
think we're gonna brace them off

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.080
we may end up bracing them later depending on
how it goes

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.130
but I think for now, we're

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.100
just gonna set them on there and level them

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:33.180
[music]

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.340
today we're gonna go ahead and get the
posts installed

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:42.960
[drum music]

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.060
is this is gonna be a window?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.940
yes siree

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.360
shoot

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.100
it's going to have a big window [German accent]

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.560
big big windows

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.480
big window

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.440
big window

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.800
yes

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.520
[music]

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.045
hey, Shelly, where is this window going?

00:12:04.045 --> 00:12:06.020
it's too tall now

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.760
and that roof slopes back

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.940
this is damp enough still

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.740
[music]

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.120
my room is gonna be boss

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.560
you know that's true

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.360
want to help me Bry?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.100
[music]

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.300
alright

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.060
hey, it's not tamp-orary

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.760
[laughter]

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.080
I'm stabilizing it

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.860
so what are you up to?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.140
right now we're putting the level of
the beam to set across the post

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.840
I like that

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.500
can you pull the post this way a little bit?

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.980
okay

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.680
that's a nice fit right there

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.820
you're not going to have this much stuff piled in here

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.680
you can't get to the bottom

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.220
I agree

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.680
so I guess we are going to put them in like this

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.960
it is beautiful

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.460
[music]

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.124
what's up

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:11.624
no

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.600
it's all dirty Mom

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.620
oh no, it's dirty

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:21.880
[music]

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.180
a little bit over

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.805
bagging up to it and then I think once
we get around here

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:27.940
then we'll take

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.020
the tire out right?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.160
yeah, then we pull the tire out

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.500
it's just a frame

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.340
a tire mold

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.090
we saw
somebody doing that on YouTube didn't we?

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.800
we did

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.060
youtube

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.460
youtube for the win man

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.100
let's go take a peek at it

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.320
[music]

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:42.840

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.040
I like it, wow

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.060
it has some issues

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.960
what's that for?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.000
the beam going across here

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.720
crazy dogs

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.800
[drum music]

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.620
this is what happens every time we go to

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.320
record

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.620
they go crazy

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.050
it's like they want to take all the attention

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.040
from the camera

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.160
you are the instigator

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.080
the light still comes through

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.580
it

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.700
like if you stick your head in there

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.260
it's still lit

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.440
mom's experimenting [giggling]

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.658
you can see a little pinpoint

00:14:40.658 --> 00:14:42.440
oh yeah, I see a little pinpoint

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.430
you guys look

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.580
ridiculous

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.250
we'll wait till it dries and then we'll

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.300
take off that tape

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.060
are you admiring my
beautiful handiwork

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.600
yes I am

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.300
I was admiring it

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:59.800
[sneaky music]

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.960
oh yeah, a dung beetle

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:32.500
[music]

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.760
we have to stop

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.170
at this point in the building, we

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.240
have so many things going in

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.910
it's so
hard to keep track of it and it's

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.900
slowing us down really bad because

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.870
doing
prep work after prep work and we're not

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.200
can't just get in and bag which makes it

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.520
makes this part really slow and crazy

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.900
I'm getting the window boxes level and plumb

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.460
you're getting them plumb level

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.520
after the window frames nailed in, that whole
wall just gets tied together really

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.080
nicely

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.900
you notice a big difference after
the window frame is put in

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.680
[yell]

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.770
are you okay?

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.620
I found a stick bug

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.860
and he's so cute

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.560
look at him

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.540
I just feel like maybe we should

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.880
put him on the tree or something

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.040
he's
kind of panicky

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.100
hey dude

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.600
come here

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.540
there we go

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.760
he's going up

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.380
on a Tuesday

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.880
are
you ready

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.440
are you ready?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.060
thank you Bree

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.900
thank you

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.980
I'll kiss it for good luck

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.380
that's what I'm talking about

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.620
that's true grit

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.260
here, it fell out of your head

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.320
oh, that fell out of my head again?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.260
oh wait no, it's mine

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.880
alright, let's get this over with

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.700
you have to get his rolling shot or he

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.820
won't be able to sleep tonight

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.520
whoa

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.880
she did a good job on this, didn't she?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.260
ya, she did a really good job

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.720
these babies go in here

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.440
they're like a mini window

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.459
let's do it

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:02.500
keep them all the same

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.100
okay

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.800
huh, that look good?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.180
it looks like a kowawi wall

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:08.900
it's even got a smiley face

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.180
eyes, nose

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.520
it's a happy room

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.060
it is a happy room

[music]

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.540
is it moving at all?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.800
this is boarding

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:25.720
whoa

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.760
the stakes are high

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.380
couldn't be any

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.120
lower because this is not coming out easily

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.580
you did it

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.360
this is a killer deal

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:36.870
we're

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.260
always looking ahead for deals on
building materials because every time we

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.159
can find something used, it just helps
cut on the cost of these buildings

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:48.390
tremendously and we don't typically find
wood but we did come across some 3/4

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.380
inch plywood

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.240
it's a little weathered but
it's in good condition

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.520
[drum music]

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860
the wheelbarrow was just sitting right there

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.080
I just mixed it

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.600
dad stole it I bet

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.159
it's the same person
that steals our socks but only

00:18:05.159 --> 00:18:05.980
the left ones

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:06.840
what's up with that?

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.090
now we have to go see because the mystery

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.100
must be solved

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.600
Gary do you have are wheelbarrow?

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.880
oh my gosh, he goes

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.147
you took our dirt

00:18:14.147 --> 00:18:15.060
it's still there

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.220
It doesn't seem practical dad

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.760
I'm glad you didn't use the other wheelbarrow

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.120
because the other wheelbarrow was empty

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.140
thank you

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.100
it's missing

[music]

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.580
don't mind us dad, we'll just navigate around your bricks

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.400
they really hold everything down

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.700

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.500

hold this and make yourself useful

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.440
instead of ornamental

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.800
why don't you set it down somewhere

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.180
I did - I set it down in your hands

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.626

I can't seem to get him going

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.700

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.680

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.440
yeah

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.800

yourself

every single
person is a species to you

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.000
once you guys got just even one bag in

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.400
between these joists, they just tightened
this floor up so much

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.480
amazing

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.140
a little bit longer bag this time Mom

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.134

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.600
wait a minute

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.040
we don't have Swedish tacos

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.260
we are part Swedish so we can say that

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.680
you can say that

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.120
I don't have any Swede me

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.120
that comes from your mama's side

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.100
dad has been
working on his sarcasm

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.590
I don't believe

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.340
in sarcasm

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.760
does that mean your sarcasm
experience is not going very well?

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.520
there's no such thing as sarcasm

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.420
it's a filament of your in-gig-nation

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:34.980
the family

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.000
is really good at sarcasm

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
it's one of
the ways that they express humor and

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.380
it's so funny to see their reactions to
me practicing with this idea sarcasm

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.430
because well I'm not so good at it and
anyway I've been playing with this idea

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.960
and trying but it keeps coming
out snarky and, and I just don't have the

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.780
hang of it yet

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.540
I don't practice it anymore

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.360
you've quit it cold turkey?

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.780
I'm a cold turkey quitter

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.220
you were making vast
improvements

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.440
we were so impressed

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.460
people make fun of me

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.300
everybody keeps laughing at me for my
sarcasm but I think it's for the wrong

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.340
reasons

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.880

Hey, Mom do you want me to cut that?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.900
did I not cut it right last time?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.860
[giggles]

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.580

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.460
[laughter]

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.600
I was going to let you cut it because you looked like you wanted to cut it

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.720
wait a second, maybe there's a

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.040
reason he politely said that

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.100
alright, I can take a hint

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.280
especially when you tell me straight out

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.480
I don't
think we need it

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.960
really, it's gonna fit?

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.680
I never really had a learning curve

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.360
you had to teach yourself to glue

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.280
yeah, exactly

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.080
but you did awesome

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.900
yeah

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.260
it looks good up here Bry

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.680

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.380
and now the sun is setting as you can clearly see

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.160
it feels

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.540
like the sun should be setting

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.860
no, I don't mean to

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.880
correct you though because I know you
know everything

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.620
I do know everything

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.700

just want to look at it

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.080
want to tease me?

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.580
no

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.260
you want to mock my pain

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.440
I'm smiling but you cannot see it

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.400
right there?

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.020

do you want to get two sides set up?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.740
then we'll just tip it up

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.800
and move it to where we want it

woah! woah!

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.460
did you move it slightly more than a
touch and they freaked out Shae?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.220
yah

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.220
Shae, can you grab the hammer and throw it at my face

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.560
yah, sure thing

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.960
sounds a little violent

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.140
that actually

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.340
holds itself up, doesn't it?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.780
a little bit

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.240
hand me the level

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.400
let me level with you

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.220
this level is holding up this roof right now

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.760
[giggles]

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.370
hey, could somebody get the lad a

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.420
tape measure?

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.080
hey Bryson, can we have that
one now?

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.380
anywhere but here

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.620
alright, I'll take it to the other side of the property

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.660
now can we have it?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.980
[laughter]

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.680
I did my duty

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.500
they are probably going to call on me in the next two minutes

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.000
Bryson

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.060
can you come over here?

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.220
a little bit, in little bursts,
very far apart

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:33.260
[music]

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.320
Oh here

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.820
because we need two and a half
inches up

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.860
that gives us a little wiggle room

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.420
that's five and a half for the two
by six

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:59.960
[music]

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.080
we have a new addition to the family

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.840
say "hi"

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.960
are you getting tired?

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:12.760
[music]

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.260
that is the most adorable thing I have ever seen

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.880
come meet your new family

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.100
hey, you

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.300

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.420

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.300

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.520

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.860
Pug G, the pugster

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.340
I knick named him Skahiggle Boody

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.140

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.780

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.020
skwiggle walking

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.480
or Gizbert

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.960
for short

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.040
he's so sweet

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.980
hello

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.300
puny mortal

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.260
my, my how far down you are

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.480
I don't have a come back to that one

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.580
I wish I did

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.860
puny mortal

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.220
you're getting our good side peasant

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.480
the forehead?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.000
where you're balding?

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.560
[giggles]

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.640
this mortal is wounded

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.520
alright Dad

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.320
I'm expecting great things from you

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.840
alright then

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.080
the second half of the
roof hangs over more

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.600
we didn't know exactly how it was gonna work out

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.799
we have two-by-six on the first half

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:33.320
where it's all shorter spans

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.730
now we're
gonna move to a two-by-eight for the

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.309
longer spans and we don't have any two-by-eights so we're gonna

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:40.420
stop for the day, go into town and get
some two-by-eights

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:46.240
[music]

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.380
go get 'em Max

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.560
grouchy old man

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.980
he is a grouchy old man

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.020
he's it totally "get off my lawn" kind of guy

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.280
if had had a lawn, he'd be screaming at people to get off it all the time

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.140
what are you guys up to?

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.820
making some stucco

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.960
got a one puppy over here

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.880
I got another puppy over here

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.853
he's like, "oh my gosh, you guys keep bringing
those things home

00:31:09.853 --> 00:31:11.060
this is the fourth one

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.480
you guys need to stop!"

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.150
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
let down your hair

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.160
this I think is a pretty good batch

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.840
she's getting some water to wet down the walls

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.380
for connection

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.460
oh yeah, that is perfect

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.320
how good is your aim?

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.580
it's excellent

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.820
you say dribbling on my puppy

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.920
you got to get a pattern to this

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.360
I'm not sure who Pink is

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.420
she's a pop singer

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:44.240
hey now I'm still a rock star. I got my
rock moves and I don't need you [singing]

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.880
I love how you sing that like mom will
know what that song is

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.580
let's see, what's

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.590
another one?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.216
"I'm coming out so you bet.."

00:31:50.216 --> 00:31:50.880
yah, okay

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.450
she's funny

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.380
even wet this stuff is
better than the last stuff

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.920
what did we decide?

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.860
like a 2 to 1

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.720
2 to 1 ratio

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:15.680
[music]

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.980
we're ready to go?

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.420
ready to cut it, stick
it up

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:31.780
[music]

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.660
look it that

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.840
is that not the coolest

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.680
thing

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.280
perfect

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.330
my span was a bit more than what a
2x6 could handle so we went for 2x8

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.040
for three of the rafters

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.700
[music]

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.520
we're getting the windows installed here

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.640
this one looks

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.480
like it has a trim around it

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.120
am I upside down?

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.084
ut oh

00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:54.300
I'm in upside down

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.020
[laugher]

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.540
okay, now press in the center

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.120
[music]

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.440
now it's time for trim

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.520
asuming I didn't put the window on backwards

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.660
that looks nice

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.680
oh, I love it with that

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.400
trim

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.700
cute, isn't it?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.580
yeah

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.680
that gonna
hold you or are you gonna fall through?

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.500
yes

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.320
yes to if it is going to hold you or to you're going to fall through?

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:24.840
yes

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.340
it's gonna hold me!

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.340
it's awesome

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.440
now you want me to gracefully come down

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.880
or just come down like normal?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.660
just jump

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:42.580
[music]

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.200
he's eating the stucco, Mom

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.160
ut oh

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:51.320
[music]

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.240
thank you

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.880
now he's pulling oh your shirt

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.200
[growling]

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.660
[music]

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.940
your face is so dusty

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.940
oh my goodness

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.260
[music]

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.180
you're the reason for the crookedness in my roof [singing]

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.500
oh my gosh

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.600
I got it

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.940
alright, two down

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.840
eight to go?

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.340
that is solid enough

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:28.920
ish

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.660
I honestly thought carpenters put carpet in

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.040
that would be a logical thing to call carpenters

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.960
exactly

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.920
we have eight boards, all

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.540
sitting on each other and all supporting
each other

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.860
the more weight you put on

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.040
them, the tighter everything gets

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.212
it's a
little bit different

00:34:44.212 --> 00:34:44.820
we've taken an

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.690
octagon in the middle and created kind
of a compression ring that we can attach

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.700
everything to

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.000
plus, we've also done the
lap over to get the idea of a reciprocal

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.620
roof

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.300
[music]

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.600
we'll cut the fascia

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.580
I mean at least it would of been longer

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.560
I got back from my little trip that I had
to take for a work and we had to do a

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.520
little bit of re-leveling for some of
the rafters

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.550
it's kind of a tricky thing

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.750
getting everything all level and the
proper distance away from the building

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.780
that's looking better

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.560
so that the roof
has the proper amount of hips that

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.460
set off at the top of this reciprocal roof

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.660
got it?

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.760
[music]

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.200
what are you covered in?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.260
are you Sawdust Diesel?

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.660
that looks perfect coming down the center of this one

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.500
get your nail gun

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.000
right now

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.400
we're putting on the fascia for our roof

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.360
put your angle thing on that and see what that is

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.140
this side?

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.050
when you

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.520
do some type of octagon, it is tough

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.420
all
those angles are so different and then

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.110
you add the complexity of a reciprocal
roof which doesn't come out from the

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.500
center of the building, it comes out at
an angle

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.460
then you compound it even more

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.800
and then I cut it at a 14, if I would of cut it at 15 I would have been right

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.380
yes

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.260
I would agree

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:13.180
[music]

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.960
you got a little something on your face there Diesel

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.460
we're just bagging up

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.640
to this so it's flat

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.600
trying to make this
flat so that our sheeting will go up to it

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.140
and then that will kind of act like the
bird block that you would typically put

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:26.800
in a house

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.710
[cutting noise]

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.180
have you gotten rid of your nemesis?

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.520
now I'll hit it here

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.400
[laughter]

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.340
my head's caved in

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.040
let's see?

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.200
my wife wouldn't let me cut that branch off

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.640
[laugher]

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.340
you cut that branch off?

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.420
uuhhhh

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.340
you cut that branch off?

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.240
Dad, that was my favorite part of the roof

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.000
oh well

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.080
[music]

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.480
there's one right underneath there

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.040
[music]

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.580
this is too short Dad, by about 2 inches

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.450
everything is so complicated on

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.840
bevels and angles and links, I was
constantly off

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.710
I had cut this thing like

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.640
two maybe three times to get it to
fit correctly

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.460
how did we get two inches off though?

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.300
I never make a two inch mistake

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.620
I cut it twice and it was
still too short

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.460
it's too short Dad

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.480
what?

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.718
again?

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.420
what am I doing?

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:30.640
I was

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.970
teasing Dad because he kept making the
wrong cuts and it was exactly an inch

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.840
and a half short, every time he cut it

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.640
an inch and a half

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.490
inch and a half?

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.240
what do you keep doing Dad?

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.740
I don't know

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.120
we'll just just throw a 2x4 in there

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.360
it's not going to show

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.950
if you don't want to do it the right way

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.740
that's between you and the roof

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.600
I think you guys have reversed roles

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.600
use your gun and pin a new one in

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.480
yah

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.100
[music]

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.640
that groan is important

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.780
I need a short one

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.434
are you ready?

00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:15.520
let me lick it first

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.260
please do

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:18.940
it's almost a

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.100
full sheet for one area

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.260
very efficient

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.980
I was just like man

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.380
Papa's a beast

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.540
as long as it goes my way

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.420
I just hope this roof  stays together

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.160
I have complete confidence,
faith in the builders

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.980
doesn't sound

00:38:38.989 --> 00:38:41.584
like you do Mom

00:38:41.584 --> 00:38:42.680
I actually do

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.440
Oh, barb wire down

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.520
I got you

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.840
thank you Honey

00:38:48.940 --> 00:39:19.620
[music]

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.860
it's a lot of fun to take a weird shape
and add a roof to it and make it look

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.680
like art

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.040
I'm really happy with the way
this thing is turning out

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.260
so Mom

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.780
yeah

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.080
why are we getting the sand here instead
of buying it?

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.890
we started using this stuff

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.340
out here until we could get to the sand
place because they weren't open

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.940
I think

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.680
it's got some clay content in it

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.690
it's
working so good that I don't know if we

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.820
want to go buy it now

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.280
here comes the
crew

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.400
they don't want to miss out

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.600
no they don't

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.320
like what y'all doing up in here?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.360
you got
anything to eat?

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:19.320
[music]

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.040
you guys are obnoxious

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.080
do you know that?

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.820
the four pugstatiers

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:35.280
[music]

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.420
this is not good

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.388
success

00:40:39.388 --> 00:40:40.260
yes

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.140
that's what talking

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.900
about

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.020
take note because that's a story of preserverance there

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.800
trying  to scare it in

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.860
it's a start

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.975
the window of opportunity

00:40:51.975 --> 00:40:53.260
thank you very much

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.280
anytime, I'll be here all week

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.640
can I take your order please?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.760
I'll take a hamburger, fries, a steak...

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.800
a steak?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.240
what kind of fast food restaurant is this?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.440
it's a fancy one

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:10.100
this is our makeshift window that we are going to put in here

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.080
I can't decide if I want it this way or this

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.920
I like the
other way

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.320
me too, it feels like the glass

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.300
is half-full

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.260
hello

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.420
so we're gonna cement it in
today

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.840
sweet

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.330
try building up the sides a little

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.160
bit

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.160
what side do we want there

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.180
I like
that

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.260
[music]

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.760
beautiful

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.019
so we have our dirt bike tire and our

00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:43.160
glass end tabletop

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.920
we're ready to put it
all together

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.100
seal it up

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.100
make it look good

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.480
we're
ready to take this out and I want to

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.720
kick it free because that's how I feel
about it

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.780
kick it free Obi-Wan

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.080
I'm happy now

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.460
is it gonna hold?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.140
I'm gonna say yes

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.400
if not, I'm in trouble

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.980
it looks like a hobbit hole

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.820
doesn't it?

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.079
about as small as a hobbit hole

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.720
it's so cute

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.480
it's the circle of life

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.119
there's no food

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:17.320
so he doesn't like it

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.000
he eats everything

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.540
whatever's edible

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.760
just lift it right up into

00:42:23.769 --> 00:42:26.660
place and then wedge it in with shims

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.599
Dad did some adjustments to make sure

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:29.680
everything fits

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.620
I have it in backwards [whispers]

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.880
uuhhhh

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.620
bummmmmerrrrr

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.560
tap a roo

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.160
uuhhhh

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.020
that's not scary at all

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.980
I didn't think you'd be scared

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.540
so Dad, how

00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:47.760
are you gonna secure the window in?

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.180
magic

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.500
the best form of securing things is

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.400
magic

00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:05.280
[music]

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.620
so this turned out really good

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.340
nice and solid

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.630
just perfect

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.660
we'll just clean it up and stick it in the hole

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.180
they're hooked into other

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.580
little wooden things

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.710
the window was a
little small for the hole so he got some

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.200
little wood to secure the window

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.440
[music]

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.080
use the wood to help connect

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.720
this is our first tire window we've ever
put in

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.030
never done a tire window before

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.340
I really like it

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.760
it looks so good

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.050
it's in there really pretty steady too

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.040
once the stucco gets in,
it really holds it very well

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.400
look how cute

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.600
that is

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.620
turned out really nice

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.580
[music]

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.060
we're putting in the threshold for the door which is gonna set the

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.940
grade of what we're gonna have for our
flooring

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.340
get him Gizzy

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.340
there we go

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.160
that's what I'm talking about

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.660
found some material here that I

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:29.060
can bend and use for a round
corner since we're doing rounds a lot

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.980
and make this a nice little step
here so that's the goal

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.690
[music]

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.600
he's got little ones

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.060
you want lots of little
ones?

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.640
it looks like that's what you are getting

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.760
[music]

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.100
I can hear the ocean

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:59.080
[music]

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.840
are you happy with that?

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.640
yes

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.200
for now?

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.220
yes

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.780
how about now?

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.280
now?

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:04.800
how about now?

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.340
is now good?

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:05.980
no

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.720
now that it's permanent, can we
move it?

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.420
you want to help us out?

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.740
give us a hand?

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.100
give us a paw?

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.660
hmm, I'm not happy with this

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.060
not happy Bob

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.860
not happy

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.200
Oh

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.580
why did you stick that there for?

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.260
because I figured we'd be putting more

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.680
blocks right there

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.600
you know where he's
gonna put glue in two seconds

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.600
why did you

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:31.880
put your hand in that for?

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.500
because you stuck it there

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.900
[music]

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.480
we realize he's annoying

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.300
he's enduring like that

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.200
huh Gizbert

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.220
look at that walk

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:42.860
he's got a

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.080
sassy walk

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.740
[music]

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.800
it makes for the funnest little room

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.660
all those windows on that

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.180
side and that downstairs

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.080
just fun

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.140
day one of the official cobbing of the inside

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.080
we did a batch here

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.220
I'm just trying to
smooth it out the best I can

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.620
make sure everything looks purty

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.900
Shae and I have been
working on this and she had to run off

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.300
and do a couple things

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.800
I have to say, it's really fun working with Shae

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.350
it seems like you have all
these opportunities to discuss things

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.520
it's kind of been our motto all through
the kid's lives is just to work

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:27.770
side by side with them and I think it 
really pays off in our closeness and our

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.540
ability to just talk about whatever's on our heart

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.000
I recommend it

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.120
okay, in that case

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:43.580
[music]

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.940
we're digging a trench here

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.020
we're going to  fill it with concrete

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.290
make a footer out of it or

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.580
foundation piece

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.910
right now
we have our poles in and they're fun

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.980
they're all shaped and twisted and it's
a lot of fun

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.220
now it's time to move onto the

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.120
concrete phase

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:07.540
[music]

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.780
so cool

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.240
look at how pretty that is

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.100
the coolest

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.300
so far in this
building, we have stressed the flatness

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.020
of walls

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.280
who has stressed the flatness?

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.780
I have

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.400
thank you

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.860
and mom has put this

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.720
beautiful, pointy lump

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.920
[giggles]

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.570
with not a bulbous bag no, because that's unfixable

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.060
with the piece of wood

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:29.820
sticking out

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.480
right there

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.660
something we could of cut off

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.360
I'm fixing it

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.960
[music]

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.960
is it like a dream come true?

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.460
yes

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.410
what I'm wondering is if the wall is

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.940
flat enough for your majesty

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.800
it is not

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.460
we have a plan though don't we?

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.640
we do

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.660
it might actually hurt

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:05.900
[music]

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.240
looks so cool

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.580
like that one wall that needs to
be done

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:18.680
[music]

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.680
we've got all of these paints

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.469
I would rather use what I have then run
down and spend a hundred bucks on a

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.040
five-gallon bucket of paint

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.380
Shae likes these colors

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.160
you can make a maroon color

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.779
it's a combination of violet and
red which is really just a lot of red

00:48:31.779 --> 00:48:34.120
and then maybe 25% blue

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.480
I'm going to see
what I have

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.609
I doubt I have any red paint

00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:40.029
but I'm gonna take a look and see if I
can make a paint that's either close to

00:48:40.029 --> 00:48:42.400
these or something that we at least can
live with

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.449
it's definitely a lighter

00:48:43.449 --> 00:48:45.420
version of what I wanted

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.520
it's kind of a plum

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.829
I'll have to see what

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:49.280
Shae thinks of that color

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.340
Shae is going to have a pink room?

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:52.940
no

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.460
look it's not pink

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.280
it's purple

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.500
purple

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.700
this is dry

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.120
yeah, see it's purple

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.000
it's not pink

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.320
when we first started putting it
up on the wall, I was scared because it

00:49:04.329 --> 00:49:08.140
looked like it was coming out
pink and I knew that that was the one

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.840
color that Shae did not want

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.720
I'm sorry

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.009
you think it's too pink?

00:49:12.009 --> 00:49:14.600
I really, really don't want pink

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.969
it's a really nice kind of

00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:17.140
purpley color

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.360
it's my tongue color

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.179
that'll be no doubt

00:49:19.179 --> 00:49:21.039
that a chick lives here that's for
certain

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:22.100
don't look

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.100
don't look at it

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.220
Bullet, why don't you tell us what you've done?

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.540
I think you have a confession to make

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:33.120
Bullet, you can't drop your ball here

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.800
look at that

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.040
no no

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.940
what am I going to do with that?

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:39.580
I'll tell Bryson

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.500
it's his dog

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.740
yep

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.380
Bryson, you dog did something

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.920
you need to come clean it up

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.400
what did he do?

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.293
that

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:50.640
how do you feel

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.680
on the matter?

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.480
observe, his chin, pink

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.540
and earlier
I'm pretty sure I saw him eating

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.320
something that he shouldn't have been
eating

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.240
it is cool

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.440
it's really cool

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.980
oh I love it

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.820
do you love it?

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.540
yah

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.860
[music]

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.980
I like it

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.660
it's a little purple

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.000
it's a good purple though it's uh, it's good

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.220
it doesn't look pink at all

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.380
perfect for Shae's room

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.220
[music]

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.500
I'm making happy little trees

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.700
we're gonna put one...

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.160
oh that's daring

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.480
remember Bob Ross?

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.360
oh it

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:33.940
kind of matches this tree

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.140
that's hilarious

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.941
I think I'm done

00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:39.420
my cold hands are done

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.880
I'm lovin it

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.940
alright, Shae

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.940
all right, I'm trying to
figure out what I want so we have this

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.240
which is finger painting

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.200
that's just the
little droplets or we can do something

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.940
like that

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.840
it all looks like smudges to me

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.820
hey now

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.640
what do you think Mom?

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.160
I'm thinking

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.040
that looks more cherry blossomish

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.940
do you think we should do this in the

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.400
background with a green?

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.240
I'm trusting in you Bree

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.500
it does, from a distance

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.840
you know, like when it is a dot

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.080
you zoom out enough

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.440
everything looks good

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.900
it's got character

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.040
oh Shae, I'm loving that

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:23.760

hey Skoobie, who can't get down once you've got up

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.580
are you going to come down?

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.320
no

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.460
I can't

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.640
I just sit up there and whine

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.500
are you sure you are suppose to be up here?

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:11.260

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.260
how is it looking?

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.440
I'm putting a layer one of the blossoms

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.180
looks like you got your hands full there

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:20.960
know that it's

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.080
also on the tip of my fingers

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:25.760
cute

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.220
time for a color change

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:30.839
and you can see

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.740
that there's more clusters around the
branch

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.380
so do you think that's good?

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.680
is that enough?

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.260
yeah, I think it's very cute

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.200
we'll see when it dries

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.560
what are you doing up here huh Scoobie Doo?

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.080
Hey, look what's going in

oh how exciting is that

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.200
they are getting closer huh Mom

hi buddy

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.330
Gizbert's house is

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:04.400
almost finished

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.600
come on buddy

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.700
he's doing it

hi

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.420
he's learning

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.680
he did it

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.300
you're getting so good at that

2 1/2 inches?

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.780
a couple different ways to
do the panel's

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.560
we have found that the

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.520
easiest way is just lay the panel in
place, nail it down

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.140
yeah there

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.300
that's probably good

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.140
and then trim it at the joints where
it meets and butts up to another one and

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.280
then we put the ridge cap over the top of that

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.750
then we can cut that corner

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:43.900
off it fits right there

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.480
yah, I think it will

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.900
[growling noise]

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.540

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:51.260
like chill

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.580

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.560
it works out pretty good

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.340
these land right on those ridges and covers up that

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:19.000
spot there

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.980
all the water runs down correctly

give me a nail quick

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.020

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.580
got some cobwebs on it baby

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.100
we've had them for a while

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.660
we'll dust them off

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.440
look how cute that's gonna look Mom

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.140
yeah

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.660
gorgeous

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.170
this is the last of three doors that

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.740
he purchased on a Craigslist ad

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.980
Shae gets the last one

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:47.780
oh yeah we picked up

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.320
this frame for what?

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.620
five bucks for that frame

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.660
five bucks for the frame too

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:53.040
it's a metal frame

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.840
it actually fits the dimensions

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:59.960
we were going to be amazing and finish stucco-ing this

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.600
are you impressed?

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.240
we were

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:08.030
so optimistic at being able to get this
room done in the beginning of the week

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.440
oh yeah your room is definitely going to be done

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.540
we'll have it done soon

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:16.880
and we didn't get as much done
as we thought we'd be able to do but

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.880
Shae and I are gonna be extremely
happy to be done stucco-ing

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.280
whenever

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.040
that may be

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:23.740
is that what you said?

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.380
yeah

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.200
you're motivated to do nothing

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.300
I like it

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.140
wanted to share my genious with you

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:44.960
[music]

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.560
woooooo

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.880
put down 30 pound felt

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.770
put all the
flashing around it and then I use a six

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:01.425
inch seam called seam flashing and I
do all my seams

00:56:01.425 --> 00:56:02.690
glue all that down

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.700
with this white snow roof

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:08.030
common out here in the southwest to have snow roofs

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.280
so we use that same material to glue all
this down

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.240
probably end up put three or

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.100
four coats

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.760
[music]

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:44.140
[music]

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.860
got this first coat on

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.260
we're gonna put a couple more coats on I think

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.240
darken this up just a little bit more

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.680
[music]

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.410
we like to complete things within the
 day or a week or possibly two

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:01.500
weeks but that's usually getting out
there for us so these projects being

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:07.530
such huge projects have really taught us
something very valuable and that is a

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.280
little bit everyday

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.780
stucco, even if you
do an hour a day, you may only put two

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.300
batches on the wall and that's only a
section so it takes a long time

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.880
and we find that within six months to a year
those big projects that seems so huge at

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.760
the beginning, get completed

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.190
we got some
sheetrock mud down at the local hardware

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.940
store

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.530
I'm gonna put it all over the
walls but you can already see it's way

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:35.400
smoother and then we'll sand it out and
then we'll put another coat on and then

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.046
this is just going to be as smooth as it
could possibly be

00:57:39.046 --> 00:57:40.240
it's been really

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.420
a fun challenge

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.880
and flat walls -
I don't think we're really

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.600
gonna meet the goal of flat

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.920
[sad music]

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.580
oops

00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:55.020
oh I was just talking about how fun it was

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.760
do we have more of those?

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.860
no

00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:59.380
sad face

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.940
it just flew off the handle

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:04.040
get a handle on that mom

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.060
alright, I'll leave you guys

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.120
to handle this

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.240

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:13.980
[music]

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.460
Shae decided to go with the red oak

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.180
I'm putting that on

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:17.920
here now

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.460
Shae had to take off and take
Gizzy in to get him neutered

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.400
they should

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.480
be back here soon

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.380
[music]

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.080
Mr. Coneman

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.860
are you a little cone head?

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.840
[music]

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.080
whoops

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.300
weird isn't it

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.040
[music]

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.960
[puppy snorts]

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.180
it looks lumpy but those lumps
will all settle down

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.320
it did that on mine

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.220
when I did my roof

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.860
we had huge lumps

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.340
for whatever reason, it does that but

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:56.740
then in just a little bit, you give it a
week or so or whatever, and it will flatten

00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:09.440
[music]

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.900
I think I can probably work with that

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:18.420
[music]

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.720
are you doing anything fun in here?

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.680
you guys are already working?

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.810
alright, I'll go get

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.440
dressed and come out

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.880
we're doing the soil cement floor

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.440
wooooo

[laughter]

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.280
it's so dusty

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.320
the dust is flying everywhere

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.120
I regularly dust it

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.820
[music]

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.500
I dust dry it

00:59:48.500 --> 01:00:01.400

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.100

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.560
that's not too bad

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.600
[music]

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.660
it's kinda nice and soft
huh

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.240
here, put your hand down there

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:27.540
[music]

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.420
what are you doing?

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.840
there's some glue on there

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.940
I was fixing it

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.580
because that's just

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.700
what I do

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.760
[music]

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.340
oh yeah, very happy

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:43.940
[music]

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.580
that's goop

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.320
goopy on the sponge?

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.110
goopy on the sponge

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.040
let's just pick a spot we know

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.020
like this spot here

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.130
instead of trying to sand it all

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.760
in

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.390
we really try to think of things
outside the box when we work around here

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:00.110
we like to use those of building
materials which are traditional as well

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:01.580
as those which are alternative

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:04.540
[singing] it's a never ending job

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.870
I don't think it's that bad

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.340
it really isn't

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.180
it's pretty fast

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.000
we've been here three hours

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.550
wait, three

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:11.380
hours really?

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.480
I don't know, I'm making stuff up at this point

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:22.780
[music]

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:30.480
[music]

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.760
all right, got our paint

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.620
see if it works
out with the chair and look at that

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.360
perfect

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.940
I don't like this at all

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.840
you don't?

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.340
what?

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:43.900
no

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.960
that was not what I was expecting

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.930
I love all three of the colors but I

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:49.540
don't like them in that way

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.600
we can do it with section by section though

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.500
color that gray or yellow

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.360
purple, yellow, gray?

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.120
yeah

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:56.980
okay

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.280
let's do it

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.620
[music]

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.600
I think the blocking looks super cool

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.260
I just think it looks awesome

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.060
it actually

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.640
is a gradients in itself

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.020
a little bit because it's got the light here and then

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.840
it goes to this really bright yellow and
then the darker down in the smaller

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.080
it's cool

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.400
I love that

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:25.020
[music]

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:28.420
Bryson is starting on the ceiling
down there

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.000
we used laminate flooring in

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:32.700
my room

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.660
the first boards of goodness

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.280
we can use

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.920
laminate flooring for Shae's room

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.240
the first boards of boardish goodness

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.320
and the

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.400
insulation

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.240
the way we do this is just putting the floor in but reverse on

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.350
the ceiling and it's kind of weird but
it's basically the same thing as you put

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.040
in a laminate flooring

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.460
[music]

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.120
you just pop
in the boards

01:02:59.120 --> 01:02:59.980
pop them up there

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.460
except the only thing different, is we use a
nail gun to nail it up

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.500
we also put

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.920
insulation up there for insulation

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.280
we're gonna be building the curb for the

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.640
skylight that's gonna be put up there

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.000
eight pieces

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.200
sixteen pieces actually to

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.960
cut here for a curb

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.680
it's about three and
a half inches tall

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.480
[music]

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.060
I'll be using this

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:24.900
flashing here to go around the edges to
keep the water out, give ourselves a

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.500
little more waterproofing in there and
this is easy

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.660
I need 8 of these

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.900
the flashing

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.480
here is gonna go down and eight pieces

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.950
all the way around and then once we have

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:38.670
it all down, we'll pin down the
corners and that'll give us our flashing

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:39.760
to keep water out

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.860
gotta make three rings with it so make

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.480
it last

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.500
and then I have a double stack
of two by sixes that'll go here for three

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.800
inches fixed for our curb

01:03:50.800 --> 01:04:02.389
[music]

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:09.920
got Mr. Gizzy here and I'm attempting to
remove the tape on his head thing

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.180
are you okay Gizzy?

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.620
you okay in there?

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.780
just about free

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.520
ooooohhhhhh

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.800
dirt

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.820
ooh

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.520
feeda

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.980
that was gross Giz

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.840
oh you're sitting

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.660
waiting

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.820
he's waiting for his breakfast

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.060
this glass, I picked up at a garage sale

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.710
and the guy had like 50 of them that he
had sold over the course of time and he

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:39.760
said that the ones that had broken had
stayed together all in one piece so we

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.580
feel pretty confident that's a nice
piece of glass for up above

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.620
and the

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.380
glass is set right on top of the curb

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.200
it'll all be glued together

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.440
get the

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.060
hammer and bang a little bit

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:58.020
[music]

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.160
how you doing Shae?

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.240
I'm thinking

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.080
[music]

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.040
this is the sketch

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:33.960
[music]

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.499
so you &amp; dad were able to find the right
stuff?

01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:40.060
I hope so Bryson

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:40.860
let's take a look

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.900
set this up here

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.180
very delicately

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:45.720
dun

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.840
da-dun

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.640
da-dun

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.340
da-dun

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:48.840
dun

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.380
oohhh

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.540
same color

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.000
so there is hope?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:54.560
yes

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.400
[music]

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.059
in this room here, we went with the R-30
because we have 2x10 rafters that

01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:02.620
go down here on the flat roof

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.049
over in this other area, though, we have a two by

01:06:05.049 --> 01:06:07.500
sixes and needed to go with the R-19

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.400
on this upper roof, we're gonna use the

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.720
burlap so we can see her cool roof
design

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.600
I got this burlap at a garage sale for

01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:16.480
free

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.280
you know what, that's gonna be wide
enough for right there isn't it?

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.480
are they all strips like that?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.720
I can't believe it

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.180
the perfect size for this

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.100
oh yeah

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.960
nice

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.460
okay

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.020
so the plan is a work in progress

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.989
things have been so

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:35.340
crazy around here, we split up
and did some different things

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.140
Garen took on the interior stairs

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.000
Shae!

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.580
Hi

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.520
ice cream for breakfast, yummy

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.950
we build a little platform

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.040
here and then do you want your stairs going down this side or that side?

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.200
that side I think

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.000
that's some lightage there

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.360
he's
focused

01:06:51.369 --> 01:06:52.840
he can't respond

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.680
betcha he can now

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.320
but he's choosing not to

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.460
what?

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.160
okay, there you go

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:07.020
[music]

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:07.940
something is wrong

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.540
that is not going to work

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:19.880
[music]

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.820
too cute

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.140
you're too cute to be in here

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:22.980
that's what it is

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.170
Garen doesn't want you to steal his spotlight

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.200
come on troublemakers, out you go

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:28.840
come on

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:48.540
[music]

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:49.040
wow

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.600
that thing is never falling

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:56.182
I wanted to see the shape of
the reciprocal roofing

01:07:56.182 --> 01:07:58.960
a way that we can do it, is -

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.809
we've been taking burlap
and stapling it up between all of the

01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:05.940
rafters so you can see all of the actual
main rafters there

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.059
to put

01:08:07.059 --> 01:08:10.359
the burlap up there, is we just cut out
pieces, and they don't have to be precise

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:15.730
we just fold it under and put a staple
in it and boom the insulation it held

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.540
up there

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.220
what do you think Shae?

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.080
this looks so good

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:36.300
[music]

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.640
you're a little too fat huh?

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.600
no, you're too muscular that's what it is

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.380
ut oh

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.780
he made it through

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.860
[music]

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.940
that's awesome

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:52.100
[music]

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.080
hey, Pug G

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.620
[music]

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.620
this L bracket it's just from old bed
frames

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.900
we pick them up at garage sales

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.000
whenever we see them because they're so useful for building things

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.620
nine times out of ten, I find that you

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.080
can just go over to our hoop barn

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.859
we got a lot of building materials that we've

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:12.840
stored over time

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.250
you can walk over there
and find exactly what you need or

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:18.260
something that'll work and stuff always
turns out a whole lot cooler

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.520
just like this the staircase here

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.170
we were going to
go out and buy a bunch of two by twelves

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:26.380
which would have looked nice too but we were
able to go over there, find this nice oak

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.020
plank this just -

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.340
really turns out nice

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.720
can I step on it?

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.040
yep

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.820
be the first test

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.920
its creaking

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.720
it's going to stop as soon as we get the legs secure

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.140
that was scary

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.300
it's moving because it's not secured to anything yet

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.960
but welds are gonna hold up

01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.460
look at that

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.920
it's all done

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.760
that looks amazing

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.420
is it gonna have any railing or no?

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.060
no, it's only a three foot drop so you're
just gonna break a hip or something if

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.700
you fall

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:20.340
[music]

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.100
I put this trim on

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.800
I'm not really a trim putter onner

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.420
but you can see

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.920
look how crooky it is

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.000
it's organic

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.100
if you hold your head crooked, it looks perfect

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.780
nice

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.300
oh yeah

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.420
love it

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.200
then when you make your first step up

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.420
a little high but not bad

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.580
those are light fixtures?

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.240
I mean whatever they are called

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.340
outlet covers

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.100
but look it's tan and white

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.320
because that is how cool we are

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.400
shhhhh, don't tell Shae

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.920
what?

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.720
[music]

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.960
oh yeah, perfect

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
why did you let the dog in?

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.140
[laughing] he's right in the way

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.920
ooh, we are backing up

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:21.520
[music]

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.780
how much clay do we
use?

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.100
better to have too much than too

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.340
little because it's gonna be a real bummer
to have to stop

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:31.090
the soil cement is kind of brittle so as you walk

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:33.160
on it, it's all broken up

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.060
you can see underneath, it's hard

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.120
we're sweeping it down to the hard stuff

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.240
so we can put the cob down

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.120
and then that will be the finished floor

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.780
this bottom came out nice

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.240
we'll clean it

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.420
awwww

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.780
it's just dust

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.020
noooooo

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.800
we've got our staging

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:56.890
areas all set up and gathered and now we
are getting ready to begin the process

01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:02.290
of starting the floor so I have mixed
the first batch and they're just about

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:04.120
ready, I think, to start laying it down

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.480
let's do this

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:16.020
[music]

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.820
I would dry mix everything

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.340
you would wet
mix everything and pour

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.400
get the assembly line going

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.760
I'm mixing it dry

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:24.040
he's mixing it wet

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.199
we were inspired by
Henry Ford's assembly line in the making

01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:29.940
of our assembly line

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.900
our dirt, mud, sand, cob and it worked really well

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.820
got the expert Levellers in there

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.060
getting the
floor down

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.760
[music]

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.820
you're doing great on the

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.320
ratios

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.320
they like it

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.320
okay, perfect

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.720
they are trying to keep up with these guys in here

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.000
and you guys are the expert levelers

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.980
Bree and Bryson have this thing where they
always think they can beat us and they

01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.580
really can't in anything

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.100
wouldn't you like to skunk them?

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.200
I would

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:15.440
[music]

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.940
I think our assembly line idea worked really well

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.060
we got to a point where they couldn't keep up

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.020
we not only kept up with them, they had
to tell us to stop several times

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.200
are you happy with it Shae so far?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.700
I am very
happy with it and I think that Pug G

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:33.260
wants to go down and play with Garen

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.969
ordinarily that job would have been the

01:13:34.969 --> 01:13:35.660
slower job

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.020
you'd always be waiting on
mud to come in so that was why we were

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.620
very set on not only keeping up, but
beating them

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.960
and we're beating you and we

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.580
have the slower job

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.400
the floor did look
beautiful though

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.860
they must of taken extra time on it

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.220
because it really was
beautiful

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.960
Bree was amazing on how fast

01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:54.460
she was working

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:57.700
lots of times she
was done before I was even there

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.900
she's not doing the hard part now is she

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.800
ah

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.300
ooooohhhhh

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.540
[laughter]

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.400
I'm just teasing

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.540
what?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
that is not true at all

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.600
ah, you ruined the volcano we made

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.240
making volcanos?

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:18.140
yeah, cuz we got all this time on our hands

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.520
we got slow poke partners

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.620
am I waiting on them right now?

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.400
am I seriously waiting on them?

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.300
all that smack talk

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.700
what did I say about shoddy work

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.680
and then they think they can smack talk with us

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.110
that was a bad decision

01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:35.940
again another mistake, they lost there too

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.550
just tallying up the score here and

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:38.860
right now we're looking at 2-0

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.720
and we've been talking what?

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.500
thirty Seconds

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.220
get your bucket

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.960
you guys need a bucket?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.540
Gizzy's got a bucket for you

01:14:48.740 --> 01:15:02.020
[music]

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.719
it makes it really fun when we are
working to make things into a little bit

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:08.780
of a rivalry, a competition

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.360
time goes by
faster when it's a game

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.800
because me and Bree win all the time

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:13.486
pound it

01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:13.986
one

01:15:13.986 --> 01:15:14.580
crushed it

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.120
us

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:15.840
awesome

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.960
we all get a participation trophy

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.820
but the
first-place trophy goes to me and Shae

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.460
there's actually another first-place
trophy that comes before you two

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.360
that's called a second place trophy

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.320
looks so good

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.180
what do you think?

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.700
it looks like a complete room in there doesn't it?

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.660
I've been far far away in a galaxy

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:44.600
unknown to other people except for other
people that live there and now it's time

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.880
to go take a look at the floor that everyone worked on while

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:48.760
I was away

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.640
[music]

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.060
that looks awesome

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.560
look at that

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.780
so cool

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.720
working on the location of my next one

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.220
thinking it out?

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.300
yeah

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:04.820
we have two

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.620
objectives for the patio railing

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.280
we want
it to be done quickly and inexpensive

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.550
we start with the old faithful, the scrap
pile, and lo and behold dad found

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:15.520
something he could use for the stairway

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:22.719
[music]

01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:24.880
starting down here at the base

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.980
screw in
at the bottom with some screws

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:58.200
[music]

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.780
what's the hole right there for?

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.820
a big hole

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.560
it's to put your finger in it

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.020
it's like a dike

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.840
water comes splashing out of it

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.680
hey, Gary I got a light bulb for you

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.920
all right

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.420
that's so cute

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.600
that's epic Dad

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.200
oh yeah

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:26.460
[music]

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.340
we got
looking around in the animal area and we

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.940
found a whole bunch of pool fencing

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.750
it's free and it's here

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.280
so we're gonna give it a try

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.100
might as well

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.780
I like that height a lot

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.467
you and your 3d glasses

01:17:39.467 --> 01:17:39.980
I think

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.060
they're fantastic eyewear

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.780
it's my

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.920
eye protection

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.720
we have to make a special cut in that one

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.480
we could not figure out those cuts

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.160
I don't know what was wrong

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.620
we couldn't figure it out

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.120
we start turning them around, we know we have to cut them at a

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.400
angle so they come in

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.920
we know the angles
like 22 and 1/2

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.460
yeah

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.070
where is that

01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:03.020
special cut?

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.680
cuz it looks like it's gonna
fit to me

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.210
no matter what we do, it's

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:06.820
wrong

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:11.820
if Gary was here or Garen, they
seem to be able to visualize that

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.620
for some reason -

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.740
we got the two people who don't
visualize too well

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.980
that is the most painful thing I've

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.820
ever seen in my life

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.740
I don't have the strength

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.020
I just have to pin it and Bryson will save me

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:26.860
okay

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.239
one
more screw left and the drill battery

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:28.760
dies

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.600
[giggles]

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.420
we have all these gaps now so I'm going to
have to go through and patch them all up

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.060
why don't we just cut the chunk out
of the center

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.680
2.5 this way

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.180
and then

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:43.060
you flip it around

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.420
go to that same
measurement, 22.5 this way and it makes

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420
this V

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.700
you cut that V out of the metal

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.290
here's the magic of these nice little

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:51.200
slits here

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.260
there's our angle

01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.300
awesome

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.340
you got this

01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:21.020
[music]

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:28.840
[ harp music]

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.880
it ties it all together so nicely going up and I think
it looks good

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.200
as a matter of fact, we like it

01:19:36.219 --> 01:19:39.120
so well we're going to put it on Brysons

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.080
which I'm excited for

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:40.773
and it was quick

01:19:40.773 --> 01:19:41.980
quick and easy to put up

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.860
I really like the security of that

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.480
it doesn't invade the space

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.020
I'm surprised
at how well I like the look of it

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:48.960
looks very nice

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.230
[music]

01:19:52.230 --> 01:19:54.100
and so it begins

01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.100
yep

01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:06.880
[music]

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.120
I'm putting on the first coat

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800
isn't it fun?

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.520
yeah it is

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.980
it uses the most - the
first one, you'll use like half that

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.480
bucket

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.560
all the coats after that take
less and less

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.600
shouldn't you do that far end first?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.730
she's gonna trap herself in

01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:22.820
she learned that from me

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.840
how many coats
did you get on it?

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.980
three on that one

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.380
this is the second coat

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.120
put some more on tomorrow huh?

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.420
yep yep yep

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.540
Gizzy wants in but we have a trap to keep him

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.140
out

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.840
yes, we're trapping you out cuz you're a
monkey

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.760
hey what y'all up to?

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.740
putting on the fifth coat

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.400
I love the shoes

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.599
these shoes are a new fashion
statement for anyone working on Earth

01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:50.440
bags

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.560
they're all the trend

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.940
you really have that fashion in the bag

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.060
so do you see this table?

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.260
of course you
see this table

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.740
this is all the things

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:02.740
that we want to get done

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.760
it's right here

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.780
this is all of

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:06.660
our loose ends that we wish to -

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.580
all done

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.180
yes!

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.880
[music]

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.580
our $5 door frame didn't come with
weatherstripping?

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.620
no

01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.400
it's just wrong

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:29.840
[music]

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.220
it looks gorgeous

01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.800
of course

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.060
I only do the most professional
work

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:34.780
oh you do?

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.280
yeah

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.380
that's good to know

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.080
I don't get hired for a reason

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.320
you're hired

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.440
no, he said I don't get hired

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.400
[laughter]

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.460
I like it

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:55.460
[music]

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.100
that's fancy

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.920
is that going to go right there?

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.500
probably hang down a little bit huh?

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.240
yeah

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.580
Mom, I love that little light you got

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.980
it's so cute

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:14.600
[music]

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.600
don't these always just kind of look a little
unfinished?

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:21.820
we have an alternative

01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:22.800
entrance

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.420
you know you're a redneck when...

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:27.340
[music]

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.260
does this go right up here?

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:29.920
yah

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:36.220
[music]

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.000
I really like the look of this

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.480
maybe just do like a small out thing

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.340
yeah

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:46.420
like a big cement step or even a
circle - a half circle

01:22:46.420 --> 01:23:03.280
[music]

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:03.940
no!

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.540
oh my, my, my

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:24.840
[music]

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:32.320
[music]

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.960
it's done

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.140
it's completed and finished

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.680
dad peeping through the window behind us

01:23:37.699 --> 01:23:39.960
there and the little brown, beautiful
window

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.199
this is my room and we've been

01:23:42.199 --> 01:23:45.440
working for several months now to get
this place done

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.610
it has several really

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:52.219
cool features like our bottle window
which you can tell it's a bottle only if

01:23:52.219 --> 01:23:53.420
you're looking like this

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.820
some artwork in
the process

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.380
still going, don't look at that

01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:01.220
there's lots of little features to this
room that I really like

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.030
like this space

01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.760
up here

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.880
oh yeah, like a plant would
work pretty good up there

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.020
our center

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.740
post

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.120
I love this post

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:11.980
[laughter]

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.600
I'm a meme now

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.620
these over the top

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.380
so they can all close

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.170
that is so cute

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.900
[music]

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.060
and up here is going to be my workspace

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.699
so I want to put my art stuff in this

01:24:25.699 --> 01:24:26.900
section here

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.720
my computer and desk all in
that area

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.460
we have some amazing stairs that

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.440
Garen put together

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.090
he worked on this
really hard and then just came out

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:36.020
beautiful

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:41.960
so the lower circle is where
my bed, dresser, shelves here

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.160
I was thinking either books or who knows

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.320
here, I'm gonna have a door

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.660
oh wait, there is already a door

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.900
what do you know

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.710
I'm very

01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:52.880
happy with it, yes

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.620
[music]

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.560
two things that were special about this
room

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.660
the sunken in circle and this

01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:03.580
balcony deck type thing up here

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.739
a few chairs up here to sit and

01:25:06.739 --> 01:25:08.220
watch the sunset

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:11.659
I was thinking about putting a bed up here and

01:25:11.659 --> 01:25:14.090
then sleep out at night and be able to
see the stars

01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:19.020
I absolutely love the wood, metal combo that
we did on the steps here

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:19.720
she just looks

01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:20.500
beautiful

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.240
it's fun to walk down

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.600
it's fun to touch and everything

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.580
it's all shiney

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.960
shiney

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.130
the first step we

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:31.580
put in, is this cement
piece here and then I wanted a little bit

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:36.889
of a patio so we put in this little
swirly - it's just very fun

01:25:36.889 --> 01:25:38.800
fun little patio

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.179
Gary I made a
commitment to get these rooms done for

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:43.680
the kids and I wanted to see it through
all the way to the end

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:44.420
I feel really

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:48.260
good now because we're done with that
commitment and finishing the commitment

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.660
was really important to me

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.230
I actually
feel a little sense of relief

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:52.560
now this last one's done

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.500
oh yes there's a
sense of relief

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.460
but there's also

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:56.980
that sense of - what's next?

01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:04.280
[music]

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.040
Gizzy is excited to get a new home

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.580
our family moved from the city to the
country

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.160
thanks for taking part in our

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:20.980
adventure

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.260
behold evil caterpillar

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:38.200
lurking just lurking

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.790
look so innocent, you just

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:40.733
want to pet him

01:26:40.733 --> 01:26:42.120
I have battle wounds

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.440
completely peppered in blisters

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.200
vicious, vicious caterpillars

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.500
it's been a month

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.020
and the caterpillars

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.880
have taken over

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.920
the entire courtyard

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.240
it's not safe up there anymore

01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:59.580
I'm running out of

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.420
provisions

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:05.520
I think the best course of
action, is to try and blend in

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.200
I think they know it's me

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.240
they're falling from the trees

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
Oh gosh

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.680
their beautiful, furry flesh burns

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.420
there's no escape

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.500
here we go

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.360
three times in a row

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.620
we don't even need cans

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.820
you could just sit here shooting

01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:25.880
dirt things

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.480
go go go go

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.800
no, no, no, bad idea

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.800
ready, here we go

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.720
no way

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.440
what have you got there?

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.440
what is it?

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.180
what is it?

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.400
get it

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.040
get it Diesel

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.140
oh you got it off

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.580
they're everywhere

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.920
it was worth the trip

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.640
to go

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:07.240
I'm going to go in for the double dip

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.260
ewwww

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:13.120
I wouldn't even do that and it's my own ear

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:16.660
okay

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.420
woo

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.300
ewww

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.160
I grossed myself out

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.200
I got to go wash my hands

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.040
moving in will be a big, big, big

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.600
huge task

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.840
that is a big job

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.620
we had a name for our team

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.793
it's called B &amp; B

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.340
and then I joined and it was B &amp; BS

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:44.440
[laughter]

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.600
let's get close

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.100
okay

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:47.180
pretend like we like each other

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.060
we do

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:52.260
