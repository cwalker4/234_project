00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.050
1.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.009
The Graduation that Never Was

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.120
Thomas Bartlett, living in Sugar Land Texas
was a privileged and pompous teenager who

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.860
was showered in luxury and love by his affluent
parents.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.619
He attended Clements High school but was expelled
after committing a series of burglaries.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.019
As part of the expulsion process he was evaluated
by a mental health professional who stated

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.980
Thomas was suffering from “ clinical symptoms
of delusional paranoid disorder”.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.050
Ignoring the clinicians diagnosis, Thomas’s
parents spared no expense in giving him a

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.360
lifestyle of opulence.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.500
Staunch supporters of their son, the Whitakers
purchased Thomas a lakeside home in Texas

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.609
to live rent free so he could attend the college
nearby.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.019
Gifting him multiple luxury vehicles and paying
the steep university tuition, the Whitakers

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.839
were not immune to Thomas’s charm and perchance
for crafting tales of success.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.860
Thomas told them he was doing extremely well
in college and would be graduating on time.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.750
On the day of his “graduation” they presented
him with a brand new $4000 Rolex watch as

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690
a “graduation present.”

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.840
The catch?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.550
He never graduated.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.300
He was never even enrolled at the college.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.020
And hours after receiving this luxury Rolex
he would come to kill the very people who

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.790
gifted to him the world.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.970
On December 10, 2003 Thomas falsely boasted
to his parents that he just finished his final

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.290
exams and was looking forward to graduating.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.330
To celebrate they drove to the Pappadeaux
restaurant with Thomas and enjoyed what, unbeknownst

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.460
to them, would be their last meal.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.820
What the Whitakers didn’t know was that
her son had been living a lie.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820
He was not about to graduate college.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.040
He wasn’t even enrolled in college.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.630
And his lies were so deeply embedded into
his world that he couldn’t bear the idea

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.090
of his parents finding out the truth.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.030
So he sought out the help of Christopher Brashear
and Steven Champagne to make sure that the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.350
truth would never come out.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.920
While the Whitakers were enjoying a family
meal, accomplice Christopher Brashear let

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.560
himself in to the Whitaker family home and,
following Thomas’s instructions, helped

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.440
himself to the husband’s gun and bullets
from a safe box in his bedroom.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.490
He ransacked the house to make it appear as
if a burglary had taken place, and then lay

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.670
in wait for the fated family to return home.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.450
Meanwhile Steven Champagne tailed the family
home where he waited as a getaway car.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.820
When the family arrived, Thomas said that
he had to grab his cell phone from his parked

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.120
car and separated momentarily from the rest
of the family.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.040
The family entered the house, with the younger
brother Kevin, 19, leading the way.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.850
When Kevin initially saw the masked intruder
he thought it was a prank being told off by

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.709
one of Thomases friends in honor of his graduation.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.290
But when he was shot once in the chest and
collapsed to the floor his mother, Patricia

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.990
screamed out “Oh God No” and all pretenses
of a light hearted prank flew out the window.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.500
Can’t, Patricia‘s husband of 26 years
ran inside and was subsequently shot in the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.500
shoulder.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.190
Thomas, returning from his car, then ran into
the house and pretended to struggle with the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.870
gunman, getting shot himself in his left arm
as a way to stage his innocence.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.160
The gunman then ran out the back door and
hopped over the fence and jumped into the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.620
getaway car.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.990
Kevin, the little brother, died almost instantly
and his mother, Patricia, died while being

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.490
airlifted to the nearby hospital.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.319
The father, Kent, was also airlifted to the
hospital and survive the murder attempt.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.630
Thomas, an an attempt to divert suspicion,
initially told officers that their attacker

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.630
was African-American.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:13.010
Kent, Thomases father, initially vowed to
forgive whomever murdered his family but his

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.190
face was shaken when it was revealed that
his precious son, who had been living and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.689
recovering with Kent before fleeing to Mexico
upon hearing that he was going to soon be

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:26.320
arrested, was actually the murderer.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.810
Thomas hid in Mexico under the assumed name
of Rudy Rios for almost a year until, in September

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.960
of 2005, Mexican authorities delivered him
back to the US to face trial.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.659
During the trial Christopher Breshear claimed
Thomas promised a cut of the million dollar

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:51.240
insurance policy taken out on his parents,
but it was revealed no such policy existed.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.509
In actuality, Thomas committed murders out
of shame and cowardice- he was terrified of

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.560
the truth coming out.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.900
Nevertheless Kent Whitaker stuck by his son
side and believed him when he blamed his mental

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.979
illness for the evil deeds.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.639
Thomas, ever the master manipulator, even
went so far as to claim that his death penalty

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.939
conviction would further victimize his father
as he would lose his only remaining son.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:24.689
Shockingly, Kent, his father, stayed by his
side and testified repeatedly that he had

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.139
forgiven his son.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:32.530
Originally Thomas’s execution date was set
for early 2018 but upon his fathers ferocious

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.699
fighting his sentence was changed from “death”
to life in prison without the possibility

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.509
of parole.

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.169
2.

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.789
W.H.O is Jean Claude Romand (get it?

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.550
World Health Organization- W.H.O?!)

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.729
Born in Lons-le-Saunier, Jean Claude Romand
was not the studious type.

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.060
After graduating high school he signed up
for college classes at the Lucee du Parc,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.190
but, unable to handle the grueling academics
he dropped out after only one semester.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.870
He reenrolled as a medical student but still
couldn’t handle the workload.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.400
His lies began when he told his family that
he had passed a second-year Final exam that

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.900
would enable him to begin the process of becoming
a doctor.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.120
The problem was, he never took the exam.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.389
That lie would catapult into a full-blown
second life in which he was a successful doctor

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.590
for the world health organization researching
the hardening and thickening of arteries and

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.610
had very prestigious academic and political
connections.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.969
He kept this highly specific lie up for 18
years.

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:44.860
In all actuality Romand would spend his days
at the world health organization, however

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.180
he would simply wander the building and use
their free informational services to learn

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.180
more about medicine.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.289
Occasionally he would invent a work conference
that would supposedly take him to far-flung

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:00.879
places in the world but he actually would
only travel to the airport and sleep in a

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.840
motel close by.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.550
In the airport motel he would research new
medical technologies and various tourism information

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.259
about whatever country he was supposedly visiting,
that way he would come home full of new information

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:19.509
both medical and travel centered to keep up
the lies to his family.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.279
In order to keep up appearances and make ends
meet, he would take money from relatives and

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:30.020
close acquaintances promising that he was
investing the money in hedge funds and international

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.229
endeavors.

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:36.230
His wife also worked full-time and during
this tenure of lies Romand took up with a

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:42.490
wealthy mistress who loaned him 900,000 francs
(about 930,000 dollars).

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.759
His lies had become unbearable and tenuous
however and instead of admitting that he was

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:54.800
jobless and a fraud he decided to cover his
lies with actions far more sinister.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.939
On 9 January 1993 he took out 2000 francs
from his joint account with his wife and borrowed

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.810
a gun from his father.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:09.749
He purchased a suppressor for that gun, a
.22 Long rifle carbine, and at the ammunition

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:13.099
shop also purchased tear gas canisters.

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:18.960
That evening he used a rolling pen to brutally
murder his wife, leaving her body in the bed

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.330
all night.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.990
The next morning he woke his children , and
set them up with breakfast and cartoons as

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.110
normal.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.509
Covering up their mothers absence with another
lie, he waited they were sleep until that

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:34.440
night and used the gun to kill each as they
dreamt.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.800
His next victim would be his own parents where,
after having a meal with them he use the gun

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.009
on both his mother and his father, as well
as their dog.

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:50.350
His last victim was intended to be his well-off
ex-lover, someone had been having an affair

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.319
with in the prior years.

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:56.860
He picked her up under the guise of attending
a high-class dinner with one of his political

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.889
connections, but instead he drove her to a
quiet road, and, pretending he was lost, asked

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:06.089
her to get out to look for street signs.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:11.040
As she got out of the car he tried to strangle
her and then sprayed to tear gas at her face.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.110
But she would not stop fighting back and eventually
he acquiesced and apologized, and after swearing

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.329
her to secrecy he drove her back home.

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:24.850
Romand then went back to his own residence
where the bodies of his wife and children

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.459
still lay.

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:32.150
After watching television he poured gasoline
all over the house and set it ablaze.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.500
He then took some expired sleeping pills which
police thought he had hoped would kill him,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.579
but were actually just a cover-up to explain
how he did not rescue his wife and children

00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:44.690
in the fire.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:50.120
As if he wanted to kill himself he had access
to far more potent and powerful drugs that

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.670
were not expired .

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:57.060
Initially his lack of cooperation with police
was attributed to him being traumatized at

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:10.060
the loss of his family but soon a more sinister
motive surfaced.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.440
In 1996 Romand was sentenced to life in prison
with no possibility of parole, while in prison

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.519
he was clinically diagnosed with narcissistic
personality disorder, which came as no surprise

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:26.069
to anyone who had come in contact with him.

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:28.310
3.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.990
The Tiger Child

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:36.220
Jennifer Pan is the daughter of Vietnamese-
born immigrants, Bich (bik) and Hann who settled

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.380
down in Toronto, Canada.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:43.370
Because of her parents’ Vietnamese upbringing
they had a very specific parenting style known

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.380
today as “tiger parenting”, where strict
rules are enforced, expectations are high,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.570
and very little praise is given to children
no matter what their achievements.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.670
Bich and Hann Pak were hardworking and thrifty
citizens who used their earnings from an auto

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:05.060
part factory both worked at were able to buy
themselves a large house and nice cars.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.959
They built a life that they wanted their children
to emulate and therefore set very high goals

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.930
for Jennifer and her younger brother Felix.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:19.149
Made to learn piano at the age of four, Jennifer
was constantly being pushed by her father

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:21.060
to learn new skills.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.430
She was an acclaimed figure skater and flute
player and her friends recall her fathers

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:31.290
stern and watchful gaze as he monitored her
each and every practice.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.330
At her fathers insistent she never dated nor
did she attend any social gatherings and,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.800
by the age of 22, recalls a friend, “she
had never gone to a club been drunk visited

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.920
a friends cottage or gone on vacation without
her family”.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.050
Despite her father‘s insistence that practice
makes perfect, Jennifer did not receive outstanding

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.199
marks in high school academics and routinely
forged her straight A- report cards to cover

00:11:57.199 --> 00:12:00.589
up her actual grades of C’s and D’s.

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:07.170
By senior year her lies were in surmountable
and, after failing a calculus class she had

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.180
her early admission rescinded from Ryerson
University.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.209
Jennifer, too ashamed to admit to her parents
what had actually happened, pretended that

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:20.779
she was given many scholarships in order to
go to the university for free.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:24.769
While her parents thought she was sitting
in college classes she was actually working

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:28.819
at local cafés and is a private piano instructor.

00:12:28.819 --> 00:12:34.149
Jennifer kept up the lie so specifically that
she even purchased used textbooks and watch

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.439
Videos related to her area of study.

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:41.920
She then continued to deceive when she told
her parents that she was accepted and given

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.120
free tuition at pharmacology program at the
University of Toronto.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.430
She then and got permission from them to live
near the college during the week.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.600
In all actuality though, she was staying with
a boy, Daniel Wong, her secret high-school

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.720
lover.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.350
Her lies became too bold and too specific
however when she told her parents that she

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.529
was working as a volunteer at the well known
and world-renowned Toronto Hospital for Sick

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:09.069
Children.

00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:13.720
Her parents started questioning her story
and became suspicious when they noticed she

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.579
did not have any sort of uniform or even a
hospital ID badge.

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:23.189
Wanting to know the truth Jennifer’s mother
secretly followed her daughter into “work”

00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:26.200
and soon learned it was all a farce.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.110
Upon this realization, Jennifer’s father
wanted to kick her out of the house but, persuaded

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.100
by Jennifer’s mother, the girl who lied
was allowed to stay.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.079
Through much turmoil and fighting Jennifer‘s
parents eventually learned that she had not

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:42.060
even completed high school.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.319
But while they certainly weren’t understanding,
they did help and encourage her to take the

00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:53.940
necessary classes to get her high school diploma
so that she could apply to actual universities.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.779
However their forgiveness did not mean their
kindness, and Jennifer was very much a prisoner

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:04.339
in her own home,not allowed to contact her
boyfriend under any circumstances.

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:09.439
Resorting to secret telephone calls to Daniel
Jennifer soon became worried as Daniel was

00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:14.990
not as interested in her anymore due to her
extreme social restrictions.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.750
Jennifer soon found out that he was dating
another woman and that he was falling for

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.449
that girl fast.

00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:25.829
To combat Daniels straying eye, Jennifer concocted
a story of a brutal break- in and subsequent

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:26.829
attack.

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:31.740
She also fabricated a story about a bullet
being mailed to her from Wong’s current

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.740
girlfriend.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.880
Her fantastic stories seemed to be effective
and they all came to a head when Jennifer

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.749
convinced Daniel to help her hire a professional
hitman for $10,000 to kill her parents.

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:49.160
She told Daniel that the death of her parents
would lead her to inherit over $500,000 and

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.569
that they could then move in together and
live happily ever after.

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:58.769
On November 8, 2010 Jennifer, after successfully
putting the hit out on her parents, left the

00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:02.860
door to the family home unlocked before she
went to bed.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.430
Under the cover of darkness the three hitman
entered the large home and demanded all the

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.850
money in the house from Jennifer‘s parents.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.189
They then took Jennifer’s parents to the
basement where they were each shot several

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:15.189
times.

00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:18.970
Jennifer’s brother was luckily not living
with his parents by them.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:25.180
Jennifer‘s mother was killed but Jennifer‘s
father would shockingly survived the attack.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:31.740
The three men fled, having taken many of the
houses valuables as well as $2000 cash from

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.230
Jennifer herself.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.829
During the attack Jennifer claims she was
tied up but that she was able to overcome

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:40.629
her bondage and call 911.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:46.480
The investigation quickly focused on Jennifer
as a suspect as she was the only one unscathed.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.680
Detectives commented that it was an atypical
scenario in a home invasion to attempt to

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.209
kill two of the occupants but leave one eyewitness
unharmed.

00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:01.020
Computer analysis of Jennifers testimony to
the police also revealed inconsistencies with

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.790
her statement and once her father was able
to be interviewed by police his story varied

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.819
drastically from Jennifer’s.

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:13.339
Jennifer, Daniel, and the three hitman were
arrested and all given life sentences with

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:17.920
possibility of parole after 25 years served.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.639
4.

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:21.980
Fake Beard Bandit

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.310
Known as the “Fake Beard Bandit” Brett
Ryan was no stranger to a life of crime.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.680
He had committed a string of bank robberies
while dressed as an elderly man in order to

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.170
pay off his nearly 36,000 dollar debt.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.720
Telling the judge at sentencing that he had
suffered an extreme manic episode as a result

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.339
of a depressive spell and his recent break
up with a girlfriend, the judge gave him a

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:48.660
light sentence of only 3 years and nine months.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.939
In prison he had good behavior and was released
on “day parole” which allowed him to only

00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:56.529
come back to prison to sleep.

00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:02.319
When he got out for good, he got engaged to
Kristen Baxter, a woman he met presumably

00:17:02.319 --> 00:17:04.500
while on day patrol.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.350
He was upfront about his criminal past as
a bank robber but told her he had changed.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.250
He said he was a college graduate and
had a good paying job.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.590
He lied.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:20.380
His mother knew he was leading Kristen Baxter
on, and she threatened to not only tell Kristin

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.839
but also to withdraw her own financial support
of Brett.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.850
With the wedding only weeks away, Brett decided
to take extreme actions to avoid the truth

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.300
coming out.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.750
With only three weeks until his wedding, Brett
took matters into his own hands.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.581
Using the arrow from a crossbow he had stored
in his mother’s garage, he stabbed his mother

00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:45.680
in the chest and then proceeded to strangle
her in her garage.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.400
His younger brother Christopher heard the
struggle and came running.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.610
Aiming the cross bow at Christopher, Brett
show him in the neck with the arrow, and then

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.930
hid his body under a tarp, along with their
mother’s body.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.950
Hearing the altercation, the eldest brother
Leigh came to investigate and was summarily

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.580
attacked as well, but he managed to outrun
Brett and took refuge at a neighboring house

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.060
where he was able to call the police.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:17.920
In the meantime, Brett’s older brother Alexander
then came over for unrelated reasons and was

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.110
promptly stabbed in the driveway by one of
the crossbows arrows.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.530
He was found lying in the driveway when police
arrived.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.670
Brett tried to cover his tracks by creating
an electronic footprint at his house miles

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.750
away.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.840
He attached a wooden cooking spoon onto a
string tied to the ceiling fan which would

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.900
spin so that the spoon tapped the enter button
on the keyboard of his laptop, prompting the

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.780
playing of various YouTube videos.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.860
He also pre-programmed his email to send various
messages from his home computer to make it

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.750
appear as if he were home, and not killing
his entire family at their house.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.340
The technological alibi didn’t work and
Brett was arrested outside of his mothers

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.340
home.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.510
He was charged with first-degree murder for
killing his brother Christopher, and two counts

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.800
of second-degree murder for killing his mother
and their younger brother Alexander; he was

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.410
also convicted of attempted murder of his
older brother Leigh.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:19.530
He received three concurrent life sentences,
with mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.660
until
He can apply for parole.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.890
Needless to say he never got married.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:26.890
5.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.790
Impress or Perish

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:35.550
In a low level position at a children's psychiatric
unit of a Salt Lake City hospital, Mark Hacking

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.240
always secretly idolized the doctors he worked
under.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.720
He wanted to be just like them, and through
a carefully constructed set of lies he was

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.780
able to get everyone around him to believe
he was on the path to medical school.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.860
His family, including his wife Lori, believed
he had graduated with a bachelors degree from

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.320
the University of Utah, but in actuality he
had dropped out.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.830
There had been hints of Marks lies for years,
though the Hackings never connected the dots.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.200
Three years prior to her death, Lori received
a voicemail from Marks mother, confused, stating

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.180
how she had just attempted to pay Mark’s
undergraduate tuition but when she called

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.880
the college they said he was not registered
as a student.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.720
Mark brushed it off saying he had just forgotten
to cross a few tees and for a few “i’s”

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.670
in the registration process and that it was
all fixed now.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:31.270
His family believed he has worked it all out
and was a full time student who eventually

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.780
graduated with honors, going to the fact that
his mother had helped him with his term papers

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.670
and allowed him to keep his old textbooks
at her house.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.370
One year later he began an elaborate process
to make it look like he was applying to medical

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.330
school after he seemingly received his undergraduate
degree.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.800
He would speak of the application process
and interviews extensively, even going so

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.690
far as having his family members drive him
to prestigious Ivy League schools for so-called

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.530
interviews.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.390
He flew to Manhattan where he stayed with
his cousin under the pretense of having an

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.970
interview at the University of Columbia medical
school.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.540
Afterwards talking at length about how he
felt the interview went.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.710
Eventually Mark Told everyone he had been
accepted to the University of North Carolina

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:21.090
medical school, and he and his wife Laurie
procured housing in North Carolina and prepared

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.170
to embark on the cross-country move.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.610
Lori had quit her job at Wells Fargo and had
packed all their possessions in preparation

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.280
for the upcoming relocation.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.080
During this time Lori found out that she was
pregnant.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:41.470
On the 15th of July 2004, Lori emailed Her
and Marks family their new address in Chapel

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:47.720
Hill, NC, (whether the house was actually
there is or was another part of Mark’s lie

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.090
is unknown as they would never move in).

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.470
On 16 July Lori received a phone call from
the University of North Carolina which caused

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:04.270
her to leave work early, crying and obviously
distraught.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:10.700
In the early hours of July 19th Mark called
police to report his wife as missing; he said

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.280
she had left for an early morning jog and
never returned.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.120
The case garnered almost instant media tension
and Mark could be seen on live television

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.080
making a plea for any information on his wife’s
whereabouts and thanking the search and rescue

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.890
workers for doing their jobs.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:32.650
But in the days succeeding, Police quickly
became suspicious when his financial history

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:39.040
revealed he bought a new bedroom mattress
in the minutes prior to making the 911 call.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.210
On July 20th Mark was reported by a nearby
hotel for walking in public naked with only

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.880
his shoes on.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.250
He was checked into a psychiatric hospital
by his family, although many people thought

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:56.490
him to be faking as experts pointed out that
had he truly gone crazy he would not have

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.020
kept his shoes on.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.830
As the investigation continued to turn up
startling fax his family was notified that

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.950
his life has been a lie.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:10.090
This led Mark‘s father to confronting him
and Mark admitted to brutally killing Lori

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.940
while she slept and puttin her body in a dumpster.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.140
Police would find her badly decomposed body
buried under almost 2,000 pounds of garbage

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.190
on October 1st in a landfill.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.650
Lori’s parents have memories of their daughter
all over the house.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:31.110
Thy have done their best to preserve all the
years of Lori’s life, up until her death.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.970
In the days following the news that Mark had
killed her, a digital photography company,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:42.000
Orem, offered to digitally erase Marc from
all of the family photos for free and Lori’s

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.140
headstone has no mention of the Hacking name.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.870
Mark received 6 years to life, A sentence
that sound shocking and inspired a new law,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.880
Called Lori’s Law to make the mandatory
minimum for murder 15 years.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:02.800
Mark will be eligible for parole in 2035,
A sentence many believe is far too short.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.090
The worst part of it all says lawyers brother
is that none of this was necessary.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.420
He believes that Lori would’ve loved him
no matter what as long as he was trying his

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:18.650
best, and that this elaborate lie Mark lead
was for him and not for her.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:23.620
The University of Utah has a Lori Hacking
scholarship in which every year two years

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:29.630
of tuition are given to women who have overcome
adversity and startling circumstances to get

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.740
where they are today.
