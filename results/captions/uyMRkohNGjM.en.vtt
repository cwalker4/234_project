00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.010
The President:  Wow.
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.370
So, we’re coming in
and we’re landing and I say,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.410
“You know, I have a choice:
I can stay on the plane

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.900
and relax as we fuel up, right?
As we fuel up.”

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.390
Or, I said, “How good
are they out there?”

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140
Somebody looked at me and said,
“They’re the best.”

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.080
You’re supposed
to the best, right?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.330
You’re right on the front.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.580
(applause)

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.160
I said, “All right,
so let’s go.”

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.910
Put on the tie.
Put on the shirt.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.960
But I wanted to be with you.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.030
And it’s an honor to be
with you, I have to tell you.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.370
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson,
right now, at ease.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.690
Let’s have a little fun, right?

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.900
Audience:  Hooah!

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.190
The President:  We’ll have
a little fun.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.050
Listen to you.
You are something.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.330
Well, I want to thank
General Tom Bussiere

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.470
for the introduction,
and done a really great job.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.490
Highly respected man.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.220
I know the ones
that are highly respected

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.590
and I know we have some others.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490
But usually when you get to
general, you’re right up there.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.930
But he’s done a fantastic job.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.550
And, General,
thank you very much.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.660
Appreciate it very much
for the introduction.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.100
And also, I want to thank
all of the folks with the NORAD.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.010
And when we talk NORAD,
we’re talking about big stuff.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.420
I learned so much about NORAD
so many years ago,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.340
studying different things.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.320
You know, I love —
I love this world.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.460
And, actually, over here,
my grandfather was up in Alaska

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.250
for a long time.
He was looking for gold.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.420
He was searching for gold.
He didn’t find it,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.340
but he started
opening up little hotels

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.880
for those looking for gold,
and it worked out.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.110
But he was up in —
and maybe that’s why

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
I’ve always had a very special
place in my heart for Alaska.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.320
And when election time
came along,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.310
somehow the people of Alaska
knew that

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.430
and they voted very, very —

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.470
it wasn’t even
a little bit close.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.640
So I just really appreciated
that always.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.690
And, you know,
it’s a very special place.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.610
And I don’t know
if some of the folks —

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.270
the military folks care
about this,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.030
but the people of Alaska
really care about it.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.030
I just approved, recently —

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.900
and almost one of my earlier
acts in office,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.740
ANWR,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.190
which is one of the largest
deposits anywhere in the world.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.250
And for many, many years they’ve
been trying to get it approved,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.790
since before Ronald Reagan.
And they couldn’t get it done.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.190
And we were just talking
to your great governor.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.350
He is doing a very special job.
And he said,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.990
“We really appreciate
that you got that done.”

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.500
And we got some other things
done for Alaska too.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.720
But when you look at that,
ANWR is one of —

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.050
if you’re in the oil industry
you know a lot about ANWR.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.590
One of the most important
finds anywhere.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.430
They just couldn’t do anything
about it, but now we can.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.260
So that’s going to be great.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.500
But I also — and I mentioned
Mike Dunleavy.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.550
I just want to say he has been
an incredible warrior.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.560
He ran an incredible campaign.
He won easily.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.980
He’s not only one of the best
governors in the United States;

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.040
he’s definitely the largest.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.440
Where is Mike? Look at that man.
He’s all man. Look at him.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.690
Congratulations, Mike,
and thank you for being here.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.820
He heard I was going to stop,
and he got on a plane

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.660
and he was able to get here.
And that’s a great honor.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.560
It’s always nice though —
when you endorse somebody,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.280
it’s always nice
when they want to be there

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.960
when you make a speech, right?
And he’s always there.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.590
He’s there anyway and he’s done
an incredible job for Alaska.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.050
And I will tell you, in front
of all of these great troops,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.070
I’ll say: Mike, anytime you have
a problem, you call me.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.530
You know that, okay? And we’ll
take care of it for Alaska.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.630
Right?
You know that.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.050
As you know, I’m on my way
back from Vietnam.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.050
I wanted to stop here
to share my gratitude

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.660
to every brave soldier,
sailor, airman,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.130
Marine, Coast Guardsman,
and National Guardsman

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.660
who serves in the
“Land of the Midnight Sun.”

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.100
What a beautiful term.
It’s what it is, too.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.840
It’s great to be standing in
this hangar with an F-22 Raptor,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.370
the mighty sound
of American freedom.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.490
That’s pretty good stuff, huh?

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.780
(applause)

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.870
That’s pretty good stuff.
I’ll tell you, look at it.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.150
Even your fire engine
looks pretty good, right?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.480
(laughter)

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.430
Well, the fact is,
we’ve increased your budget

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.270
from not too much
to $700 billion.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.650
And then, from $700 billion,
we went up to $716 billion.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.310
And I won’t tell you
this year’s surprise,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.120
but the generals are going to be
very happy when they hear

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.420
because it’s going up yet again,
because we have no choice.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.670
You know, I’m a cost cutter
but we have no choice.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.270
Without a military,
what do we have?

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.970
We have to have
a great military.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.780
And you notice your equipment
has been getting better

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.880
and better, newer and newer?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.990
When I got in here,
you were having jet fighters

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.810
that were so old —
you know, you heard the story —

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.800
the grandfather flew
some of the planes —

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.160
some of the bombers.
The grandfather, then the son,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.290
then the grandchild
is here with us now.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.900
And I don’t like that.
I don’t like that.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.870
So we’ve ordered massive numbers
of new planes

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.390
and new everything.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.560
It’s just an honor to come by
the joint base and be with you.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.180
I guess we call —
we say “J-Bear,” right?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.520
J-Bear.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.730
(applause)

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.430
That’s what — that’s what
we want to do — J-Bear.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.070
In 2017, our wonderful
First Lady visited J-Bear

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.020
and met with the children
of deployed service members,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.910
and had a fantastic time.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.250
When she hear
I was going to be here,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.910
she said, “Say hello.”

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.160
And she’s been a really
fantastic First Lady.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.020
Our military families
are a true national treasure.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.030
And without all of the people
backing you brave men and women,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.060
you know, it wouldn’t work
so well for you.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.810
Your life would be
a lot more difficult.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.300
It wouldn’t be the same.
You all know that.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.620
Maybe we should give them
a round of applause, right?

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.910
Come on.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.430
(applause)

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.110
It’s true.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.850
There are many
incredible patriots

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.250
to recognize here today,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.370
beginning with the outstanding
Airmen of the 11th Air Force.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.630
Give yourselves a hand.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.740
(applause)

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.500
The Airmen of the 3rd Wing,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.480
and their Commander,
Colonel Bob Davis.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.350
Bob, thank you.
Thank you, Bob. Great.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.020
(applause)

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.650
Is he doing a good job? Huh?
Yes. They’re all saying “yes.”

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.970
(laughter)

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.340
The 673rd Air Base Wing

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.170
and your Base Commander,
Colonel Patricia Chank.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.420
(applause)

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.740
Thank you, Patricia.
Thank you very much.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.550
The soldiers
from U.S. Army Alaska,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.770
and their Commander,
Major General Mark O’Neil.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.530
Mark. Thank you, Mark.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.280
(applause)

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.710
And the paratroopers of the 4-25

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.560
Airborne Brigade Combat Team,
the “Spartan Brigade,”

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.710
and their Commander,
Colonel Jason Jones.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.910
(applause)

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.380
Colonel, thank you.
Thank you, Jason.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.140
Thank you as well
to every warrior —

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.410
and that’s what you are;

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.340
you’re warriors — in the Navy,
Marines, and Coast Guard.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.040
Finally, I want to thank
all of the members

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.060
of the Alaska National Guard

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.260
who defend our nation
against missile attack,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.230
and their Adjutant General,
Brigadier General Torrence Saks.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.530
(applause)

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.170
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, General.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.880
As well as Brigadier General
Darrin Slayten —

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.210
(applause)

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.910
— Darren — thank you,
Darren —

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.330
Commander of the 176th
Wing Alaska Air National Guard.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.660
Great job.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.590
The men and women who serve at
J-Bear share one vital mission:

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.900
to serve in our country’s
“Last Frontier”

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.890
as America’s
first line of defense.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.610
Since the Second World War,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.180
our intrepid service
members in Alaska

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.260
have proudly stood at the
“top cover for North America.”

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.580
You are a powerful warning
to the world

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.630
to never strike American soil.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.830
You are a warning
that everybody knows about

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.460
and nobody wants to play with.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.730
Here with us today

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.190
are paratroopers
of the Spartan Brigade

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.410
who wear the maroon beret.
Where are they? Where are they?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.410
(applause)

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.630
They look pretty good.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.580
Should I wear
one of those things? Huh?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.239
It’s good when it’s windy out,
I’ll tell you. It’s good.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.360
They recently returned
from the Brigade’s

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.590
third deployment to Afghanistan.
And they’ve seen a lot.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.780
I’ve actually spoken
to a couple,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.990
and I know how they feel.
It’s going on for 19 years.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.030
Made a lot of progress,
but 19 years.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.810
We just took over — you know,
you kept hearing

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.950
it was 90 percent, 92 percent —
the caliphate in Syria.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.090
Now it’s 100 percent.
We just took over.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.610
A hundred percent caliphate.
That means the area of the land.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.740
We just have 100 percent,
so that’s good.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.520
We did that in a much
shorter period of time

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.120
than it was supposed to be.
It was supposed to take —

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.940
I won’t tell you
what a certain general told me.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.630
But I went and met a couple
of other generals, and I said,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.530
“How long do you think
it can take, General?”

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.810
“One week, sir.” I said,
“One week? I heard two years.”

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.280
“One week, sir. Let us do it
the way we want to do it.”

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.230
I said, “General, do it.”
And you saw what happened.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.700
Right? Everybody saw.
We have the whole thing.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.550
Among those with us
is Sergeant Sean Rogers,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.760
who, a few weeks ago, received
the Bronze Star for Valor.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.890
Where is Sean?
Where is Sean?

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.620
Sergeant Sean,
around here someplace.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.350
Where are you, handsome devil?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.790
(applause)

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.740
Come up here. Come up.
Should I bring him up?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.500
I won’t bring the generals.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.360
(applause)

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.459
I won’t bring the generals up,
but come on, Sean, get up here.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.630
Don’t worry
about Secret Service.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.120
You can take them, Sean.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.330
(laughter)

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.970
Secret Service immediately
runs up.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.360
(laughter)

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.600
Sergeant Rogers:  
Thank you, sir.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.910
The President:  You want to say
something? Come on.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.890
Sergeant Rogers:  No,
I’m fine, sir.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.090
(Laughs.)
(laughter)

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.930
The President:  Listen, come on.
Maybe he’s a natural politician.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.570
Sergeant Rogers:  Just
thank you, I guess.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.990
(Laughs.)

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.270
The President:  Good job, right?
Sergeant Rogers:  Yes, sir.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.470
(applause)

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.890
Thank you, sir.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.590
The President:  Thank you.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.320
That was a good response,
(inaudible).

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.600
(laughter)

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.880
Brave guy.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.190
While he was in Afghanistan,
Sean and his team

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.180
occupied a rooftop and provided
cover for a Special Forces team.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.190
Sean rushed into the enemy fire
to rescue a member of his team,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.340
Specialist Gabriel Condy.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.280
Now, I don’t know, is —
let’s see, who else is here

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.350
from that area,
from that part, Sean?

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.240
Anybody with you? Anybody else?
Yeah. Okay.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.500
Tragically, Specialist Condy
did not make it alive.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.250
And, today, we remember
the heroic sacrifice

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.060
of this incredible
American hero.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.110
We are eternally grateful
in his debt.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.540
And, Sean, I want to thank you
and everybody else involved.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.600
But that’s really —
really something.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.480
And we pay great respect.
You know that.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.420
To everyone here today
who fights for our flag

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.920
across the globe:

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.660
Thank you for bravely facing
down the danger to protect —

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.440
and have such danger
out there —

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.550
the lives and liberty
of all Americans.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.160
Our country is stronger now
maybe than it’s ever been.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.140
Our military is being rebuilt
at a rapid pace.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.450
Our economy is powerful.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.390
Our economy is probably as good
as it’s ever been, or better.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.830
Unemployment numbers
are historic.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.170
You’ve been seeing
black unemployment,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.920
African American
unemployment —

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.540
lowest levels in the history
of our country.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.540
Hispanic unemployment —

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.420
lowest levels in the history
of our country.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.880
Lowest levels.
Best they’ve ever been.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.180
Women — lowest in 61 years.
Sixty-one years.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.090
Asian unemployment —

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.800
lowest in history,
history of our country.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.870
And we’re just doing great.
We’re setting records.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.530
The stock market is, right now,
almost at an all-time high.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.020
I have about 18 records.
It then went down a little bit

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.930
because we had to
a couple of trade deals,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.270
and people didn’t understand.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.620
Now they’re starting to say,
“You know, that was pretty good.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.800
That’s good what he is doing.”

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.320
We’re negotiating now with China
and others — Mexico, Canada.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.580
We’ve done those deals.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.940
They have to get approved
by Congress.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.270
We’ll see what happens.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.069
Dealing with Congress
is never easy.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.800
I don’t think
they like me too much.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.150
(laughter)

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.330
But they have to do —
ultimately,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.070
they have to do
what’s right.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.300
But I will say that
you’re looking at a country now

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.800
that’s doing better than ever.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.160
And there’s something —
it has to be —

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.340
you’re protecting our country.
You’re protecting us.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.840
And I would think
it must feel good to know

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.070
that the country
is doing really well,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.490
as opposed to really badly,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.180
like it has done
not so long ago.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.150
So you’re protecting something
that’s very special.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.830
All over the world,
they’re talking about us.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.000
I go and I meet the prime
ministers and presidents,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.550
and kings and queens,
and they all say,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.590
“Mr. President, congratulations
on your economy —

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.500
especially on your economy.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.100
We’re trying to copy it,
and it’s not working.”

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.820
It’s just not working
for other countries.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.050
Other countries
are not doing well.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.890
And I want them to do well.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.930
But China is way down.
The EU is down.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.660
A lot of countries
are very much down.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.720
Most of them.
And we’re hitting new highs.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.550
So we’re doing
a lot of things right,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.170
and you folks are
a big reason for it.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.470
Also with us today
are the amazing people

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.240
and airmen of the 673rd
Air Base Wing.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.560
In the wake of
a 7.0 magnitude earthquake,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.620
which was just recent,
and I remember seeing it.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.840
I said, “Boy, oh, boy.
That’s a big one — 7.0.”

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.530
Took place in November.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.760
They successfully
restored airfield operations

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.830
here at J-Bear
in under one hour.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.580
That’s pretty quick.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.280
Did you —
what did you do to do that?

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.100
That’s — well, number one,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.030
I gave you good equipment,
right? Huh?

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.400
(laughter)

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.550
Safeguarding NORAD’s vital
homeland security mission.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.650
Thank you for your incredible
work. That’s incredible.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.960
I heard that you were up
and running in about an hour.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.870
And it was pretty —
you were hit hard.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.870
Alaska hosts the largest
combined training area

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.850
for American air, ground,
and maritime forces.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.600
You know the best way to
Keep America

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.550
safe is to keep America strong.
And the stronger we get,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.700
the less likely it is that
we’ll have to use that strength.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.920
Right, generals?
It’s an incredible —

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.570
it’s an incredible —
we learned that in high school,

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.160
we learned that way
before high school.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.470
But the stronger you are,
the stronger you can be,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.830
the less likely it is
you’ll have to use that strength

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.460
and that power.
And that’s what we’re doing.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.150
We’re making you so strong.
And soon, I can honestly say,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.470
strong like we’ve never
been strong before.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.650
That’s why,
in the last two years,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.040
I’ve spent —
when you think about it —

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:55.820
over $1.5 trillion.
Next year, the 11th Air Force,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.930
headquartered
right here at J-Bear,

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:04.370
will receive the first of
54 brand-new —

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.650
never used before —
F-35 fighter jets.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.860
You like them?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.380
(applause)

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.760
Well, for the pilots — you know,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.890
I’ve seen a lot of the pilots
throughout the country

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.560
when I stop at different places,
and I say,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.250
“How do you like the F-35?”
“We love it, sir.”

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.640
“Well, how good is it compared
to the enemy aircraft?”

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.120
“Well, sir, you can’t see it.”

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.440
I said, “Explain that to me.”
“You know, it’s stealth.”

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.090
It’s the stealthiest plane,
by far, in the world.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.020
So they say, “Well, when we have
battles, you can’t see it.”

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.470
I said, “Huh,
that would be tough.”

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.620
Wouldn’t it be tough if you have
somebody and you can’t see it?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.710
So all I say is this:&nbsp;You get 54
brand new ones.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.180
I won’t tell you what they cost
because it’s too much.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.460
(laughter)

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.320
But it’s a lot of money.
But they’re very special

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.940
and you’re getting
very special planes,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.510
and you’re getting
a lot of them — 54.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.409
So they’ll be
arriving here very soon.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.480
And all of the generals,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.770
I hope you’re going to give them
all to the best pilots,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.140
and you’re going to take
good care of those planes

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.760
and good care of those pilots.
Right?

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.270
Okay?
It’s really an honor.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.260
But you’re getting a big,
big number.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.090
We’ll also deploy 20 more
ground-based interceptors

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.310
to Fort Greeley,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.340
which will further strengthen
our missile defense system.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.290
So important.
Missile defense system

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.240
is also being rebuilt
very substantially.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.060
And we’re going to have
the latest and the greatest.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.290
Unfortunately,
as soon as you have it,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.680
you have to redo it because,
after about six months,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.740
everything becomes
obsolete in this world.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.150
Right?
We do that, they do this.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.290
We do that, they do this.
It’s never ending.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.339
But that’s the way it goes.
It’s a cycle.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.660
Our goal is very simple: 
to ensure that we can

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.860
monitor, detect,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.880
and destroy any missile launched
against the United States,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.929
no matter what speed
we’re talking about.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.920
Any missile.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.710
We’re spending a tremendous
amount of money

00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:00.970
now on missile technology and
also missile defense technology,

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.670
at my very strong urging.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.770
And what they’re able
to do now is incredible.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.800
It’s like shooting
a needle in the haystack.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.290
It’s incredible
technology they have.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.170
And I said, “Upgrade it further
and further. Advance it.”

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.080
America
does not seek conflict,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.290
but if we are forced
to defend ourselves,

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.180
we will fight and we will win
in an overwhelming fashion.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.100
That’s where we are.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.900
We will forever be grateful for
your service and your sacrifice.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.800
And we will always ensure
that you have the tools,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.330
resources, and support you need
to defeat our nation’s enemies

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.350
and safeguard the freedoms
given to us by Almighty God.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.150
To everyone at J-Bear: 
We salute you.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.030
We thank you
for your incredible service.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.890
We love you.
God bless you.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:01.150
And God bless the men
and women of the armed forces.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.140
God bless America.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.570
And thank you for doing
such a fantastic job.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.010
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.660
