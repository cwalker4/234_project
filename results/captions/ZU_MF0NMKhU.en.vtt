00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.380
The placing on this list is based off of a
poll where over 11,000 people voted for their

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.500
favorite sith lord.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.710
At number 10, with 350 votes, is Vitiate,
better yet known simply as the Sith Emperor.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.980
He was born over 5,000 years before the clone
wars.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.990
By the moment he was born, Vitiate was as
power hungry and evil as you can get.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.540
At just the young age of 6, he had already
taken someone’s life.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.850
His stepfather's life, after witnessing him
beat his mother.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.530
But Vitiate didn’t kill him out of kindness,
as afterwards he went on to torture his own

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.780
mother for months with the force before finally
ending her life too.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.079
The pain and anger produced from these killings
fed him power and fueled his ambitions.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.530
After killing his mother, he went on a rampage
and slaughtered countless inhabitants on the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.879
planet he was on, forcing those who were strong
enough to serve him.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.109
By the time he was only 13 years old, he had
conquered his entire homeworld on his own.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.359
His lust for power didn’t end there.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.379
When he was older he went on to trick 8,000
sith lords to participate in a ritual that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.010
resulted in their deaths, with all of their
life forces being consumed by Vitiate which

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.830
gave him immeasurable amounts of power and
made him immortal.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.510
After the ritual, he probably became the most
powerful sith lord to ever live at that point

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.510
in history.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.910
He was so powerful that he even defeated the
renowned Jedi Revan and Malak, turning them

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.480
both to the dark side.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.780
He then secretly constructed a new sith empire,
emerging from the shadows of the galaxy and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.610
waging war on the republic and taking over
half of the galaxy.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.270
Although he was onset on taking over the galaxy,
his end goal wasn’t to rule it, but rather

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.160
to destroy it and consume every living being’s
life force, which would have gave him eternal

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.190
life and the ability to do anything he pleased.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.550
He basically would have become a god at that
point had he succeeded.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.580
Anyway he was killed multiple times over the
course of a few centuries.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.430
Multiples times, in that he was able to transfer
his consciousness through the force into other

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.390
bodies and cheat death.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.230
During his time as the Sith Emperor he was
secretly constructing another galactic empire

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.420
known as the eternal empire, to which he began
to later rule and was then known as Valkorion.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.080
But at that point he wasn’t exactly a sith
lord, but rather just a dark side user, so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.220
we’ll end the summary here.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.980
From your guys’ comments, most of you voted
for Vitiate due to his incredible force powers

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.120
and the fact that he achieved immortality,
as well as for his very evil and cold hearted

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.780
personality.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.410
At number 9, with 374 votes, is Darth Plagueis.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.950
A wealthy Muun banker to the public eye, Plagueis
was in reality a hidden sith lord who is best

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.190
known for being the master of Palpatine and
for his manipulations of midichlorians.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.040
Like most Sith, Plagueis strived to achieve
immortality, except he took it a bit to the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.230
extreme, especially in his later years.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.360
He experimented with the force and manipulated
the midichlorians to create life, believing

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.400
that was the path to success.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.860
He was somewhat successful, being able to
keep his loved ones alive and even resurrect

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.860
others.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.870
It is also believed that Plagueis indirectly
created Anakin Skywalker, by accidently conceiving

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.670
him through the force with his manipulations
of the midichlorians.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.780
Which means Plagues is technically Anakin’s
father.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.440
Anyway, as we know through Palpatine’s tale,
Plagueis was ultimately betrayed by his own

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.440
apprentice, aka the guy telling the story.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.040
Plagueis was killed in his sleep after Palpatine
cemented his rise to chancellorship, viewing

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.660
his former master as nothing more but a loose
end at that point.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.900
Although his apprentice was a psychopathic
monster, Plagueis himself was actually really

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.410
reasonable and kind of nice, well for a sith
that is.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.080
He came to view Palpatine as an equal despite
him being his apprentice and he even trusted

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.099
him with his life, which was a fatal mistake
as Palpatine betrayed him the moment he had

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.150
the chance.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.430
Many people voted for Plagueis due to his
calm and intelligent personality, and for

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.239
the fact that he laid the groundwork for the
Sith’s takeover of the galaxy.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.920
And also because some people believe him to
be Snoke.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.160
At number 8, with 396 votes, is Darth Bane.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.230
Born about 1,000 years before the clone wars,
the soon to be Darth Bane was at first a simple

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.200
miner who was only known as Dessel.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.700
After a heated game of Sabacc, Dessel killed
an angry Republic officer in self defense,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.400
after the officer attacked him over losing
the game.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.060
Desperate in avoiding the authorities, Dessel
smuggled himself out of Republic territory

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.850
and into the Sith Empire.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.950
He quickly became a footsoldier within the
Sith army, but was then taken out of it when

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.410
it was discovered that he was force sensitive.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.300
He was sent to the Sith academy on Korriban
for training and became known as Bane afterwards.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.010
Although he became an excellent warrior, he
soon lost his faith to the group running the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.400
place, viewing the brotherhood of darkness
as cowards.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.310
Bane went on to study Darth Revan’s sith
holocron on the planet Lehon.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.530
With this new knowledge, Bane destroyed the
brotherhood of darkness and created his own

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.530
Sith Order.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.970
In his order he instituted the rule of two:
which stated that there can only be two sith

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.660
at any given time, a master and an apprentice.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.750
This was to prevent the endless infighting
among sith seen in past sith orders.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.280
Bane later picked the young girl Zannah to
be his apprentice and the one he would pass

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.910
his knowledge down to.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.750
A decade passed, and Bane’s existence was
discovered by the Jedi.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.370
The Jedi sent a strike team to kill him and
his apprentice.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.669
Despite being outnumbered, Bane and Zannah
were able to defeat them but at the cost of

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.320
Bane sustaining an injury.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.070
They both went into hiding, during which Bane
healed himself.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.139
A decade later and Bane’s rule of two was
put to a test.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.020
Believing she was ready to surpass her master,
Zennah instigated a duel with Bane seeking

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.210
to replace him.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.920
The first duel between ended with a draw,
with Bane escaping.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.160
Shortly after a second duel was fought between
them, in which Darth Bane was finally defeated.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.710
His apprentice continued his rule of two by
taking on her own apprentice Darth Cognus.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.169
This same cycle continued on for centuries
in the shadows with it finally building up

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:10.220
to Darth Sidious who went on to destroy the
Jedi Order through deception and manipulation.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.229
Most people who voted for Darth Bane seemed
to vote for him because he created the rule

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.660
of two which paved the path for the sith to
eventually take over the galaxy.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.350
At number 7, with 406 votes, is Darth Talon.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.590
Born over 100 years after the clone wars,
this rare red colored twi'lek was brought

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.300
up under Darth Crate’s Sith Empire.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.340
She quickly rose through the ranks after killing
her master, Darth Ruyn, and she later achieved

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.730
the high rank of becoming a Hand of Darth
Crate’s order.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.710
She was given a mission to capture Cade Skywalker
and to convert him to the dark side.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.150
During her time with Cade, they developed
a relationship with each other.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.949
But it didn’t last long, with Cade eventually
injuring her in a fight.

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.560
After Darth Crate was defeated by Cade Skywalker,
Darth Talon and all the other remaining Sith

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.590
of the order went into hiding.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.720
Her ultimate fate is left unknown.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720
Many people voted for her because of her unending
loyalty to her master and also because of

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.250
how she looks.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.660
At number 6, with 444 votes, is Darth Tyranus.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.190
Originally a long devoted Jedi, Dooku became
very disaffected with the Jedi Order and the

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.960
Republic they were serving, viewing both as
corrupt institutions that have lost their

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960
ways.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.199
Being regarded as one of the greatest Jedi
at the time, Dooku’s departure was a major

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.080
blow to the Order and the Masters who knew
him.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.470
The Jedi eventually created a bust in his
name and viewed his departure as a failure

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.940
in their own ways.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.539
Dooku eventually fell to the dark side and
became Palpatine’s apprentice, taking the

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:40.770
name of Darth Tyranus.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.080
Together they schemed the ultimate sith plot
on destroying the Jedi and taking over the

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080
galaxy.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.509
They did this by starting the Clone Wars and
tricking the Jedi into accepting an army whose

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.590
sole purpose was to betray and destroy them.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.120
Unfortunately for Dooku, he was betrayed by
Palpatine once he was defeated by Anakin Skywalker,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.780
who went on to replace him as Palpatine’s
new apprentice.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.610
Many people voted for Count Dooku because
he was played by Christopher Lee and for his

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.850
very elegant lightsaber fighting style.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.240
At number 5, with 698 votes, is Darth Sidious.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.720
Born to a wealthy family on the planet of
Naboo, Sheev Palpatine sought power from a

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.320
very young age.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.990
Viewed and treated as an outcast by his family,
Palpatine eventually got his revenge by secretly

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.600
killing them when he was a young adult.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.140
He was later taken in as an apprentice to
Darth Plagueis and was trained in the dark

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.140
side.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.740
Along with his Sith teachings, Palpatine was
groomed to become an influential politician

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.280
who would spear head the Sith plot by becoming
the supreme chancellor, as in Plagueis’

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.240
opinion only a Human could become Supreme
Chancellor within the Republic at that point.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
And seeing the recent history of the chancellorship,
it seemed he wasn’t wrong.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.970
Anyway, once Palpatine cemented his rise to
becoming the Supreme Chancellor, he killed

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.520
Plagueis in his sleep, as he viewed him as
nothing more but a nuisance at that point.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.640
As Chancellor.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.430
Palpatine manipulated the galaxy throughout
the galaxy, staging crises that allowed him

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.760
to extend his terms and eventually gain emergency
powers once the clone wars erupted.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.320
After the Jedi were destroyed from Order 66,
Palpatine declared himself emperor of his

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.050
new galactic empire.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.740
He ruled with an iron fist for the next 2
decades before finally being betrayed and

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.810
killed by Darth Vader.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.700
But his story didn’t end there.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.230
In Legends, Palpatine came back to life through
transferring his consciousness into clone

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.210
bodies he had stored on secret worlds across
the galaxy.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.170
Once ready, he wrecked havoc in the galaxy
and forced the emerging New Republic back

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.830
into a full out war.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.779
He finally was defeated after Han Solo killed
his last clone body and when a Jedi named

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:45.900
Brand consumed Palpatine’s spirit and trapped
him along with every other deceased Jedi in

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.090
the force itself.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.880
Most of his votes came from people who enjoyed
his manipulative personality which allowed

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.100
him to trick the Jedi into their own destruction
and cementing himself to becoming Emperor

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.760
of the galaxy.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.970
At number 4, with 967 votes, is Darth Nihilus.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:09.010
He is another sith from the Old Republic era,
being active almost 4,000 years before the

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.470
clone wars.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.040
Losing everything as a young man during the
Mandalorian Wars, the soon to be Nihilus was

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.140
consumed with immense pain that later developed
into a strange hunger for relief through the

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.270
force.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.630
This hunger could only be cured by stealing
the force energies of living beings.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.430
But the relief only lasted for a short time,
as the hunger came back worse than ever before

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.510
demanding Nihilus to continue draining his
prey.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.589
He soon became a slave to this hunger, committing
all of his time to feeding on people’s force

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:39.589
energies.

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:44.279
He continued to do this until he was taken
in by Darth Traya, a former Jedi turned Sith

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.860
who wished to make him into her student so
she could hone his abilities and make him

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.770
into her powerful servant.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.639
She eventually granted him Darth Nihilus and
the title Lord of Hunger.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:11:00.279
With all the training he had received, Nihilus
was able to drain entire planets for all of

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:04.760
their life forces, making him one of the most
powerful Sith to ever live.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.670
Unfortunately for Traya, she was betrayed
by Nihilus and a few other students.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.019
Doing pretty much his own thing now, Nihilus
continued to force drain as many beings as

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:18.920
he possibly could, eventually destroying his
physical body as it could no longer contain

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.050
all the energies he had consumed.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.670
This forced him to use the force to encase
himself into a mask and robe.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.890
He later took on an apprentice named Visas
Marr, a survivor from one of the planets he

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.870
consumed to destruction.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.410
Marr would eventually betray her master and
team up with Jedi Master Meetra Surik and

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.980
the current Mandalore to defeat Nihilus.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.490
Although he was defeated his force spirit
remained alive and later became a force ghost

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.830
on the planet Korriban.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.730
Many people voted for Darth Nihilus due to
how uniquely powerful he was and for his ability

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:57.320
to destroy all life on planets, and also because
many people like the design of his mask.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.290
At number 3, with 1,350 votes, is Darth Maul.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.920
Originally only supposed to act as a Sith
assassin for both Palpatine and Plagueis,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.410
Maul become a full blown Sith Lord once Palpatine
betrayed his own master and made him his apprentice.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.100
Though this apprenticeship was short lived
once Maul was defeated at the hands of Obi

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.010
Wan when he was cut down.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.490
Believed to be dead, Maul was soon replaced
by Dooku as Palpatine’s new apprentice.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.040
But he wasn’t dead and he continued to live
on a junk planet for the next 10 years where

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.110
he went insane over his failures and defeat
at the hands of Obi Wan.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.410
He finally came to when his brother Savage
Opress brought him back to Dathomir and had

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.750
nightsister magic make him sane again.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.760
Now back and seeking revenge, Maul wrecked
havoc across the outer rim, trying to lure

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.630
out Obi Wan in an attempt to destroy him and
later attempting to take over the galaxy by

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.530
taking power over Mandalore and crime syndicates.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:56.080
But his plans were crushed when Palpatine
discovered his existence and took care of

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.620
him, capturing his former apprentice and bringing
him to Stygeon Prime where he was tortured.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.350
Palpatine’s ultimate plan was not to kill
Maul, but rather to use him as bait in order

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.990
to lure out Mother Talzin and to kill her
once and for all.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.019
Maul fell for this trap eventually leading
Palpatine and his henchmen to Talzin and having

00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:16.430
her get killed.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.460
After witnessing his own mother get killed,
Maul went into hiding and pretty much became

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.610
a shadow of his former self.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.670
He reappeared almost 2 decades later and he
tried to turn Ezra to the dark side and make

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.630
him his apprentice, but he has currently found
no success in doing so.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.740
Maul gained many votes for his persistence
in staying alive and unending rage that’s

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.970
been motivating him in getting his revenge
on Obi Wan.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.760
He also gained many votes for his tattoos
and double bladed lightsaber.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.779
At number 2, with 2,741 votes, is Darth Vader.

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:55.370
Probably the most iconic villain in not only
Star Wars but in all of cinema, Darth Vader

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.980
made his first menacing appearance in a New
Hope and he returned back again in last years

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.730
Rogue One where he proved once again to audiences
that he is a force to be feared.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.540
He was the emperor’s main enforcer and was
typically found spearheading operations, from

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.079
hunting down Jedi to chasing down rebels.

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.630
Although his injuries limited his ability
to perform some force powers, like force lightning,

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.110
he was still a monster in lightsaber combat.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:26.089
His strikes were so strong and heavy hitting,
that he was able to overpower most low level

00:14:26.089 --> 00:14:30.890
Jedi with just a few hits, knocking their
lightsabers out of their hands and then landing

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.330
a killing blow on them.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.910
Although he at first was pretty much completely
loyal to his master, this loyalty quickly

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.769
slipped once Vader discovered he had a son.

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:44.279
While he was unable to convince his son to
join him and rule the galaxy at his side,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:50.230
he did eventually save Luke’s life by sacrificing
his life in killing Emperor Palpatine.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.160
People voted for Vader for multiple reasons,
from his iconic voice and suit to his character

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.970
development of a broken man who was corrupted
and twisted both mentally and physically by

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.630
Palpatine but was able to ultimately overcome
this and take down the man who had kept him

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.170
in chains for decades.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.110
Before we mention number 1, we have a few
honorable mentions.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.610
First is Darth Crate, for getting 11th place
with 185 votes.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.470
He was the creator of the Rule of One and
the main antagonist of the star wars Legacy

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.880
series.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.300
Second is Darth Malgus for getting the most
write in votes.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.560
He was a prominent warrior for the Sith Empire
and was the one who led the sacking of Coruscant

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.750
during the Great Galactic War.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.190
And finally a shout out to the 12 people who
mistook this star wars poll for a fast food

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.019
drive through.

00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:43.820
At number one, with 2,942 votes, is Darth
Revan.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.949
Originally a prominent Jedi who led the republic
in the Mandalorian wars, Revan turned to the

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:53.680
dark side when he and his friend Malak confronted
the Sith Emperor known as Vitiate.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.149
As a sith lord, Darth Revan started the Jedi
civil war and killed multiple Jedi.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:02.190
He was eventually betrayed by his friend,
Darth Malak, and he was believed to have been

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.190
dead.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.880
But he survived and he eventually recovered
but with no memory of who he was.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.430
Knowing how powerful he was and wishing to
exploit his powers for themselves, the Jedi

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.430
decided to retrain him in the Jedi ways again
so they could later use him.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.940
Once retrained as a Jedi, Revan was sent to
kill his former friend, Darth Malak.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.329
He succeeded.

00:16:22.329 --> 00:16:25.800
After a while, the memories of his past life
started to reappear.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.900
This caused him to search for answers, and
during this search he was captured by the

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.019
sith and kept as a prisoner.

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:36.040
As a prisoner, he was constantly tortured
by the Sith Emperor, eventually causing his

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.950
mind to split into two halves, the light and
the dark.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.380
The dark side of Revan sought to destroy the
Sith Emperor once and for all through extreme

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.380
methods.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.449
But before he was able to accomplish this,
he was defeated by the republic and the light

00:16:49.449 --> 00:16:50.860
side of Revan.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.380
After everything, Revan finally was able to
go out in peace as he became one with the

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.840
force.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.700
Many people voted for Revan because of how
he went out of his way to do what he believed

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.209
was right, even if it meant going against
the wishes of the Jedi.

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:08.750
His struggle between the light and the dark
was also a reason people voted for him.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.220
