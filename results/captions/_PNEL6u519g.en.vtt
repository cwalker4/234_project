00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:04.287
(country acoustic guitar music)

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.360
- I'm driving around Midland, Texas.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.380
I think I'm the only guy in
town not wearing cowboy boots.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.900
We met a gentlemen the other day at lunch

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.630
who just happened to,
"Is that your Woody?"

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.750
I said, "Yeah."

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.430
I said, "Is that your Model T Bucket?"

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.000
He said, "Yeah," so we started talking.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.387
I told him what we're
looking for, and he said,

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:28.220
"I don't really know anybody,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.940
"but give me your phone number
and I'll think about it."

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.110
So, he went home and went
through his phone book.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.590
Son of a gun, he turned us on

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.610
to at least four different
people that turned out to be

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.610
an amazing source of contacts
for old cars, Barn Find cars.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.083
So, we're going to another one
right now, Roland's Mustangs.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.850
A guy who had a Mustang
rebuilding business,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.890
a restoration business, a parts business.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.230
But he's since closed it down

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.720
and now just messes around
with cars on his own.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.710
So, I'm told he's got some inventory

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.160
that he wants to get rid of.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.620
So, that's what we're gonna
go check out right now.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.158
He said be there at 10:00,
it's 10 after 10:00.

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:12.491
So, we'll see what he's got.

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:15.167
Here we are at Roland's.

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.810
Now interesting, the Volkswagen

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.173
that was at the gate
yesterday is not there today.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.510
So, a Roland, Morgan Roland

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.910
he said, "Follow me, my
dad's over at the shop."

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.617
This dog's saying, "I've never
seen a wooden car before."

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.970
Oh yeah, this is gonna be a good day.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.121
Oh, look at this thing,
what are you kidding me?

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:55.993
(laughs) Oh man.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.450
What a good morning, and
it hasn't even started yet.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.930
Well anyway, here we are.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.913
I guess is it called Roland's Mustangs?

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:11.070
- Yeah, Roland's Custom
Paint, Roland's Mustang.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.860
The body shop and the Mustang store

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.810
were kind of separate deals, but.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.180
- So, there's no more Mustang business.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.670
- No, we kind of changed
it to Roland's Custom now.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.230
So, we've got a little antique store

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.190
that we're putting together,
and we buy and sell.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130
Our dealer's license is Roland's Mustang.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.963
- Okay, okay.

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:31.330
- So, anything that we
buy and sell to the public

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.960
goes out on the Roland's Mustang ticket.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.970
- [Tom] So, I'm looking
right now at a fire truck,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.270
an airplane, a school bus.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.780
You're into radical stuff here.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.310
- Well, I got a lot of kids,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.940
and I want them to be
able to play on anything.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.230
- A caboose.
- Yep.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.063
- Holy mackerel.

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:47.990
Well, if you could show us around.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.823
- Yeah.

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:51.210
- What a great morning this is gonna be.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.380
- [Roland] I have like
I said, I got nine kids.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.300
- [Tom] Yeah yeah yeah, so
how many boys and girls?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.133
What do you got?

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.505
- [Roland] I got seven boys and two girls.

00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:58.380
- [Tom] Wow, man.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.680
- So, my first five are all grown.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.010
But they're all kinda into cars.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.720
- So, are these cars for sale?
- Everything is for sale.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.830
- Everything's for sale,
you heard it here first.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.490
- They can find us on
Roland's Custom on Facebook.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.950
- Okay, so you've got
a '55 two-door wagon.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.180
'55 Chevy two-door wagon.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.210
- Yeah.
- Wow, that's a rare one.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.600
It's not a Nomad.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.760
- [Roland] No, it's just
a, what do they call those?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.720
- A Handyman or something?
- Handyman, yeah.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.565
- [Tom] And so it's got a louvered hood.

00:03:25.565 --> 00:03:28.040
- [Roland] Yeah, somebody did
a decent job on the louvers.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.910
- Three on a tree.
- That one's pretty well bare.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.740
- [Tom] Now, it's an
automatic on a column.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.220
So, is this a 150?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.900
It's got a very standard wheel.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.350
The 150s only had one
sun visor, this has two.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.830
So, no it's not.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.810
So, what would you ask
for something like that?

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.740
- [Roland] That I'd like
to get $5,500 out of it.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.760
- $5,500.
- Yeah.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.300
- [Tom] Is it a pretty solid car?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.310
- [Roland] It's decent,
floors are a little rusty,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.370
but not like a lot of the stuff we see

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.610
that comes from up north.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.870
- [Tom] Oh no kidding, you
got guys coming from up north

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.860
down here to buy cars?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.800
- [Roland] Oh yeah, yeah we send stuff

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.090
back up that way pretty regular.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.400
- [Tom] Now is this like a '54 Ford Panel?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.273
- [Roland] That is, yeah, it's a '54 or 5.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.380
I think it belonged to the
newspaper in San Angelo.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.180
- [Tom] It's a six cylinder?

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.203
- [Roland] No, I think this one's a V8.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.540
- Oh yeah, it's a Y-block,
so it'll probably be a 272

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.690
or something like that.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.730
No, it's okay, oh you got it.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.563
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:30.740
- [Tom] So, I guess that
was the original color.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.573
Look at that.

00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:33.860
- [Roland] Yeah, it would've
been a deep turquoise truck.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.160
- [Tom] Yeah, wow.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.100
So, what would you ask for this?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.920
I'm just asking because
somebody watching this

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.030
is gonna wanna--
- Now, this one.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.030
I mean I'd like to get
5 or $6,000 out of that.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.720
- Now, if we stop and
talk about every car,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.850
we're not gonna get through this.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.850
- [Roland] No doubt.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.080
- [Tom] Now I saw that huge fire truck.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.730
Diamond T or something.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.060
- That is.
- It looks like a caricature.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.263
- Yeah, that is a 1939 American LaFrance.

00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.096
- [Tom] Man.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.029
- That's Midland's number three.

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.862
- [Tom] No kidding.

00:05:00.862 --> 00:05:03.860
- So, number one and number
two are in the museum downtown.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.850
- So, this is the fire engine
we'll be talking about.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.103
So, tell me about what, '39?

00:05:08.103 --> 00:05:10.510
- It's a '39 American LaFrance.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.945
- It looks bigger than life.
- It's a beast, yeah.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.060
It's just amazing how big it is.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.780
It's got a V12, it's
got 9,000 miles on it.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.970
- [Tom] 9,000, all over this town.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.980
- [Roland] Yeah, it never moved.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.500
It's just hard, you just gotta pull at it.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.880
- [Tom] Look at the size of that door.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.900
- Isn't that a beast?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.900
This old man had it, and he
had it in an old junkyard

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.633
on Rankin Highway about
two miles east of here.

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:40.870
And he had a whole bunch of old cars.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.820
Well, he died.
- Oh wow.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.720
- So, his kid gives me a
call, and we go out there

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.980
and we buy all the '50s stuff.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.210
And finally talked him into
selling me the fire truck.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.077
That was the last car that
we drug out of that yard.

00:05:57.077 --> 00:05:59.300
- [Tom] So, '39 is the
same year as my Woody.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.550
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.623
- [Tom] All right, so
if somebody wanted this,

00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:04.560
what would you ask for it?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.370
- [Roland] That one I
got priced at $15,000.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.207
- 15,000 bucks.
- Yeah.

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:10.580
- Now, it's got a V12?
- Yeah.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.890
- Is that like a Packard
motor or something?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.113
- I don't know, it's
like a big long motor.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.865
- [Tom] So, that's a purpose
built motor, look at that.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:30.500
- [Roland] Isn't that a
V12, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.900
- [Tom] Well, it's two
spark plugs per cylinder.

00:06:33.952 --> 00:06:34.785
So, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:35.760
- [Roland] So, there's six on each side.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.650
- Six on each side.
- That'd be 12.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.830
- [Tom] I wonder how, I guess
the pistons go vertically?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.320
Man, it's not a V I don't think.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.980
- [Roland] No, you're
right, maybe it ain't a V.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.610
- [Tom] Wow.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.633
- [Roland] Maybe it's a
straight six, I don't know.

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.110
(Tom and Roland laugh)

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.020
I don't have any idea.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.470
I know it's got more spark
plugs than I wanna buy.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.280
- It's got a Delco Remy
voltage regulator up there.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.902
And looks like a Stromberg carburetor.

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:06.800
- Great big carburetor.
- Yeah.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.950
Isn't that something, I have no idea.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.893
I'm gonna have to do some research now.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.397
So, I can't see, it
says American LaFrance,

00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:16.780
and I can't see where it was made.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.060
I'm gonna go home and do
some research tonight.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.380
This is one of the most spectacular
vehicles I've ever seen.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.870
- Ain't that cool?
- Yeah.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.280
So, these gauges are from New York.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.000
I don't know who made the
gauges, they say New York.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.350
So, you've had it 10 years?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.403
- [Roland] It took me 10 years to get it.

00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:33.350
- [Tom] Oh, it took
you 10 years to get it?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.600
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.477
- [Roland] I can't remember
how many years we've had it.

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:39.163
But probably going on 10 years.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.343
- I love it, man.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.860
There's patent right there, yeah I see it.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.000
- [Roland] How about that stainless dash?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.240
- New York.
- Yeah, New York.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.490
- [Tom] What's on the
left side there, Elmira?

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.680
- [Roland] Yeah, Elmira,
engineered and manufacturers.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.500
Look at that ladder comes
right up into the cab.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.243
- Yeah, I see that, yep.

00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:08.960
So, $15,000 for this.
- Yeah, yeah this year.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.546
I mean it might go up a little next year.

00:08:11.546 --> 00:08:13.830
- (laughs) They don't go down?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.560
- No, they quit going
down a long time ago.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.570
- So, is that an Anglia back there?

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.540
- That is a Prefect.
- Prefect.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.830
Let's go take a look at that.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.791
So, this is a kind of car that drag racers

00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:25.624
in the '60s would've driven.

00:08:25.624 --> 00:08:27.780
- The Anglias they--
- Oh yeah.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.270
So, that's complete with
hubcaps and everything.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.450
- It had that little bit of
damage when it was wrecked,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.740
and that's when it went
to the wrecking yard.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.420
And the old man that had it died,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.420
and we bought about probably
60 cars at that auction.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.761
All of them Mustangs except this one.

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.600
- Wow.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.440
- [Roland] And yeah,
we just stole this one.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.110
- So, 1.17 liters.
- Yeah, it's a big one.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.793
- Look at how tiny that motor is.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.833
So, it's a little flathead.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.323
Just over one liter.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.140
So, it'd be, let's see two
liters is 122 cubic inches.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.710
So, that's 60 cubic inches.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.233
- [Roland] Yeah, like three coffee cups.

00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:11.140
(Tom and Roland laugh)

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.830
- Yeah, but this is the
kinda car that drag racers

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.470
back in the day would put Hemis in

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.810
like all the way back here,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.890
and the driver would
be sitting back there.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.080
- [Roland] Yeah.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.230
- But this has got four hubcaps on it.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.690
What an unusual car to find in Texas.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.440
- [Roland] Yeah, it was
kind of a rare piece

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.800
even in his yard.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.800
- Yep, so this has got 54,000
miles or kilometers maybe.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.940
No, probably miles 'cause the
steering wheel's on the right.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.100
But this is a Ford that
if you were in England

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.420
and wanted to buy a Ford,
this was one of the options.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.240
The cars that Ford made in
England were smaller cars.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.510
So, it kinda looks like a '37
Ford, but it's probably later.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.890
It's probably a '46 or
something like that.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.680
All right so, if I wanted to buy this,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.690
what would you charge me?

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.120
- [Roland] I'd have to think on that one.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.953
- [Tom] Really, okay.

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.780
- [Roland] I just I've
never seen another one.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.010
I don't have any idea
what it would be worth.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.243
- They're not worth much,
but they're very unusual.

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:14.030
- (laughs) Nothing's worth much.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.313
- Yeah.

00:10:15.313 --> 00:10:18.164
- [Roland] But if there's only
one of them that you know of

00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:19.560
might as well price it high.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.840
- [Tom] Oh yeah, okay.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.372
So, that's a...

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.090
- [Roland] That's a '67, that's
a pretty strange little car.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.920
That's the first car I bought.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.930
I got that when I was 16.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.910
It was wrecked real hard on the front.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.200
I put a front clip, aprons, core support.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.430
Back when I was still gas
welding stuff together.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:42.300
Drove it for a couple years,
sold it, traded for it back,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.640
fixed the transmission the
kid had broke, sold it again,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.620
and my brother traded
for it and gave it to me.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.564
- [Tom] Wow.

00:10:50.564 --> 00:10:52.000
- [Roland] And it's been
sitting here ever since.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.320
But this car, power
steering, power disc brakes,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.010
air conditioning, I mean it
was loaded up for a coupe.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.403
Upper and lower consoles.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.490
Yeah, it was a neat neat car.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.873
- So, it's still got a 289.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:09.665
- Yeah, and I'm not 100% sure
that that didn't get changed.

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:11.310
- [Tom] So, it's an air conditioned car.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.580
- [Roland] Yeah, it was air conditioned.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.830
- So, two-barrel, power
steering, power brakes,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.280
air conditioning, wow.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.113
Let's see what else you got.

00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:20.990
I just wanna point out
maybe a couple more.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.823
- [Roland] Sure.

00:11:21.823 --> 00:11:23.540
- Oh so yeah, you got a Bronco, huh?

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.650
- [Roland] Oh yeah, there's
a couple of Broncos in here.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.840
- [Tom] That doesn't look too rough to me.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.750
- [Roland] Well, I mean
relatively speaking

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.400
to some of the stuff you find up north.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.400
- [Tom] Yeah, see I'm
from New York originally.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.410
- [Roland] Yeah.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.130
- [Tom] So, it's a Bronco Sport.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.480
I'm not sure what that means.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.630
Okay, you got no doors in there, but.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.760
Oh, the doors are inside.
- Yeah, they're inside.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.660
- [Tom] Is this a complete
vehicle, it's got an engine?

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.390
- [Roland] No, motors
gone, tranny's there.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.430
- [Tom] Tranny's there,
so that's automatic.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.863
It's got a torque converter.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.720
It looks like it had air
condition, doesn't it?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.780
- [Roland] Yeah, it looks
like it was aftermarket.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.820
- Okay, originally blue, yeah
it looks like it was blue.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.400
- Yeah, dark blue.
- Yeah.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.010
- [Roland] That would've
been a pretty one.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.210
- So, there's doors, these
don't look to be the doors

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.580
for this because they're
a different color.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.420
- Yeah.
- But they're doors anyway.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.600
Missing a windshield.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.310
- [Roland] Seems like we
had a kid come from Austin

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.284
or San Antonio looking for a Bronco.

00:12:17.284 --> 00:12:18.410
And we had four or five of them,

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.410
and so we let him pick and
then the one that he picked

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.720
probably needed the windshield
frame and the doors.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.530
- [Tom] Well, this would be
a good restoration candidate.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.670
For sure.
- Oh yeah.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.741
- All right so, this one,
I wanna buy this one.

00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:34.163
What would you say?

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.580
- Probably $2,500.
- $2,500.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.120
- [Roland] Yeah, the
little Broncos down here

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.953
are kinda silly.

00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.330
- [Tom] Yeah, silly all
over the country now.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.163
- Are they?
- Yeah.

00:12:42.163 --> 00:12:43.510
- Well, there you go.
- Yeah.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.832
- Maybe it'll be 35 next time.
- No no no no no.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.180
(Roland laughs)

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.050
Okay, so where is this
K-Code, you have any idea?

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.190
Just so I can point out where the...

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.690
And I always gotta be sensitive to people.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.340
They say, "Why didn't you
talk about the Pontiac."

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.878
Or, "Why didn't you talk about the Chevy."

00:12:56.878 --> 00:12:59.870
- It's all just cars to me anymore.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.060
- Yeah.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.940
All right, let me explain what this is.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.867
If you're into Mustangs,
you'll know this already.

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.110
I'm gonna educate everybody else.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.743
Here's the serial number: 6RO7K.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.440
1, 2, 3, 4, the fifth numeral is a K.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.600
That means it was a K-Code,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.610
which means it had a high performance 289.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.620
So, a standard 289 with a four-barrel

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.300
I think was 225-horsepower,
does that sound right?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.133
- [Roland] Yeah.

00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:35.040
- But a K-Code was 271-horsepower.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.040
It had solid lifters,
different valve springs.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.100
The same motor they put in an AC Cobra.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.260
It was the same motor that
they started out putting

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.860
in GT-350 Mustang Shelby Mustangs,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.800
but Shelby did additional
work to the heads,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.500
put a high rise aluminum manifold
with a Holley carburetor,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.700
and they got 306-horsepower
out of the same motor.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.410
But 289 Cobras, that's
exactly the motor in a Cobra.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.170
So, this car was a K-Code which
means it had dual exhausts.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.480
Most of them came with stick shifts.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.300
This one seems to have had an automatic.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.380
Now we don't know if the
K-Code motor's still in here.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.213
- No.

00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:16.546
- But the heads are off, and
that's the only way I can tell

00:14:16.546 --> 00:14:18.790
is with the spring bosses.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.690
- And you know that's one of the myths

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.730
that went around for the
last probably three decades.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.563
- What's that?

00:14:27.563 --> 00:14:31.680
- Is every person that came out here

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.600
wanted to have a car like
their buddies in high school

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.230
'cause he had a Hi-Po 289.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.280
I've had, I don't know, a thousand

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.950
and maybe had two of these.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.783
- [Tom] Is that right?

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:46.890
- Maybe I've seen 10 in my lifetime.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.800
You know there just weren't
that many Hi-Po 289s.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.730
- Has anybody come along

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.980
and wanted to buy that serial number?

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.070
- [Roland] No, not yet,
there are very few people.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.450
I mean, you're only about the third guy

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.180
that knows it's here. (laughs)

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.100
- Well, that's cool, wow.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.660
Well, now another million
people are gonna watch.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.360
- Well, yeah.
- (laughs) Well, that's cool.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.940
Here's an unusual car, I'm not
sure if I've ever seen one.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.350
It's a '58 Ford, '58
Ford was the first year

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.070
they went to dual
headlights and these kind of

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.093
odd rectangular dual taillights.

00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:18.890
What's unusual about this
is it's a two-door wagon.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.350
So, this was kind of the
equivalent of a Chevy Nomad

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.850
that Ford would've made.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.440
This one must have had an interesting life

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.740
because as I look inside here,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.280
I see it's got a tachometer
on the steering column.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.870
It's got a floor shift,
so it's a stick shift.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.090
It's got a clutch pedal.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.860
I see a big four-barrel manifold,

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.470
so this was a hot rod at
one point in its life.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.720
It says here premium sound
performance engineered by Brown.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.363
This car probably did
some quarter mile times.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.440
Probably burned rubber
at some traffic lights

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.120
earlier in its life.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.450
The shape of it, the
body looks pretty good.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.253
These fenders look like garbage.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.740
But this is certainly
worthy of restoration.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.350
By the way, you can see
there's black fuzzy interior

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.580
it had at one time.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.560
It's got like those old
vans back in the '70s

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.030
with shag carpet all in the inside.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.123
The whole headliner's done
in black shag carpet, yee.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.480
Well, here's an old Land Rover

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.920
that I didn't see the
first time through here.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.640
These are interesting
vehicles in that they have

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.220
an aluminum body, so the
body's never gonna rust.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.390
The issue though is the
chassis is made of steel,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.180
and that does rust.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.860
This has no engine, but
it's got a transmission.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.930
Depending on the shape
of the undercarriage,

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.363
the chassis, and the supporting steel,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.841
this could be a worthy candidate to fix up

00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:48.370
or maybe just drop in a small block Chevy

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.843
and keep it kinda ratty looking like this.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.093
Spotlight.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.440
Roof, this is that, I forget
what they call this roof.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.890
Maybe a safari roof, that
air can blow underneath here

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.330
and get in the interior
to cool occupants off,

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.240
but it won't allow rain in there.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.660
It's got these windows on the side.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.210
So, I guess if you were on
safari, you could look out there.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.840
So, that's worthy of consideration.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.767
And I wanna show you another one over here

00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:18.210
that's interesting.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.670
He has quite a few VWs.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.420
But the VWs that I'm attracted to

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.020
are the ones with the small taillights,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.640
which makes it 1960 or earlier.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.760
This one has a flat steering wheel,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.760
so I say this car is
probably a 1958 or '59.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.700
And it's got 49,000 miles.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.113
Which means that's a 36-horsepower motor.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.980
Which means the block
is made of magnesium.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.420
The 40-horsepower VWs had aluminum blocks,

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.550
but these earlier ones
had magnesium blocks

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.020
if it is in fact a 36
which it may very well me.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.550
It should've had.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.450
And this has got the ragtop.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.600
Yeah, probably the floor's rotted out.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.410
It probably is not worth restoring.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.590
But it's complete, so if you
were restoring an old VW,

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.690
this would be worth buying just for parts.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.860
As the Barn Find Hunter
host, I feel guilty

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.450
walking past cars like this Gremlin.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.160
That's probably a, I don't
know, '53 or a '54 Chevy

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.000
which is complete down to the
hubcaps, every piece of trim.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.320
I'm walking right by it.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.930
If that were in somebody's yard,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.300
I would spend 20 minutes
looking at that car.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.470
But the problem is there
are hundreds of cars here.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.540
I just can't spend enough time

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.410
talking about this Ford Panel truck

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.910
and these Ford pickup
trucks, another Panel truck.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.640
You know this show would go on for hours.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.580
So, I apologize, I just
can't spend enough time

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.763
to satisfy everybody, so
I just have to do my best.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.350
So, did you build this?
- Yeah.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.670
We built it for a Halloween
project at church.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.070
They have a trunk of treats.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.050
We always do something
a little over-the-top.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.800
And so, we walked
through the yard one day,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.730
and I told the kids....

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.880
You know they're kind of
everything's rat rod now.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.140
You know everybody's all wound up.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.130
And I said they wanted to build a rat rod,

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.963
so we walked through the yard

00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:18.360
and we looked at some them old four-doors.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.980
You know the old '37
Plymouth and stuff like that.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.420
And I said the only problem

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.530
we build one of these little cars

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.760
you know it's only three
of you get to ride in it.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.390
And I said, "Or we could
build that old bus."

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.160
And it was just a box sitting
over there on the ground.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.290
- [Tom] Now what year is that box from?

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.140
- We think it's '29.
- Wow.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.247
- '27, 8, 9 somewhere in there.

00:19:38.247 --> 00:19:39.810
- So, no chassis, no engine.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.180
- No nothing, I mean it
didn't have a cowl on it.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.702
We stole that cowl off an
old Chevrolet over there.

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:47.450
(Tom and Roland laugh)
No windshield.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.873
The nice thing was the
doors were still there.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.730
So, we had to weld them up

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.515
'cause they wouldn't fold anymore.

00:19:54.515 --> 00:19:55.348
- [Tom] Oh yeah.

00:19:55.348 --> 00:19:56.810
- But we pulled it in there.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.473
And I had an old oilfield truck.

00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:05.380
A '94 F700, so it's sitting
on a three-ton truck

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.110
that we cut the frame and
dropped it in the middle.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.020
- [Tom] So, that engine
was already in the frame?

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.340
- [Roland] Yeah, that's all '94 Ford.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.173
- [Tom] Diesel.

00:20:13.173 --> 00:20:14.750
- You can drive it anywhere.
- Yeah, wow.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.233
- [Roland] We built it in 30 days.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.030
And we went to church for
the trunk of treats deal,

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.400
and you know we had kids
hanging all out of it.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.650
Just had a blast.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.040
Well, I think we had the
driver's seat bolted down

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.480
and the windshield in and nothing else.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.780
And my older boys, the ones
that helped me with it,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.327
said, "We need to go to SEMA."

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.720
And I was like, "Oh yeah,
we can probably do that."

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.826
You know we hadn't drove
it out of the yard yet.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:45.820
(Tom laughs)

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.498
So, we're all talking about going to SEMA,

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:51.423
and we looked on the
calendar one day at lunch

00:20:51.423 --> 00:20:54.110
and SEMA's like the 1st
through the 4th of November.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.390
It's like the day after Halloween.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.517
I'm like there ain't no
way, and they're like,

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:00.600
"Oh, we can get it down."

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.500
And my second son and the one
that works for me, my fifth,

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:06.660
they're like, "Yeah, we'll get it done."

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.493
- [Tom] What a great attitude.

00:21:07.493 --> 00:21:09.570
- So, I mean they're
over here till 1:00, 2:00

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.130
in the morning every night
working on this thing.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:17.503
And we did it, we got it
done, we brought it back.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.470
Halloween was on Monday.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.923
So, they did the church
deal on Sunday afternoon.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.110
So, we brought it back and Sunday night

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.930
we worked all night and
Monday we worked all day.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.860
And we left Tuesday morning for Vegas.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.590
And it was a little sketchy,

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.937
but we got to El Paso and
balanced the front tires.

00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:40.070
(Tom and Roland laugh)

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.940
We got to Tucson and put a U-joint in it.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.640
But we got to Vegas and just had a blast.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.850
Drove it home, and since
then it's been to Lubbock

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.920
and Dallas and went to
the Round Up in Austin.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.220
- [Tom] How far is Vegas from here?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.043
- [Roland] A long way, it's...

00:21:56.043 --> 00:21:57.040
- [Tom] 1,000?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.630
- [Roland] It's 1,000, I think
it's 1,000 miles exactly.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.260
- [Tom] The maiden voyage was 1,000 miles.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.310
- [Roland] Maiden voyage was
about six miles into town.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:10.310
And then the gas station
stop and off to Vegas.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.400
- [Tom] So, what do you
haul in the trailer?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.040
- [Roland] So, we built
this, we found this trailer

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.680
on the way back from Pate last year.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.970
A buddy of mine, we thought
there wasn't nothing left of it.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.330
The bottom was all rotted off.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.586
- [Tom] But it's still got
yellow on here like a school bus.

00:22:24.586 --> 00:22:27.900
- [Roland] It was same vintage.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.450
And so, we thought we build
a trailer out of that,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.283
that'd be kinda cool.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:33.630
So, it sat here for about I
don't know, six, eight months.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.830
They have this art walk in Alpine.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.813
It's just an art deal.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.120
Somebody saw the bus on
the way back from El Paso,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.047
and called us and said,

00:22:46.047 --> 00:22:49.147
"Man, if you'll bring that bus
to El Paso to the art walk,

00:22:49.147 --> 00:22:53.633
"we'll pay your fuel, we'll
buy your motel, just show up."

00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:54.900
And we're like, "Yeah, I could do that."

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.330
So, I told a friend of
mine that did the lettering

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.830
on the bus, he's an artist.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.817
I told a friend of mine I said,

00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:03.443
"Hey, this guy's having a..."

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.420
He's an old Alpine guy,
just an old desert rat.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.450
But he's an artist, and
he's the featured artist.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.520
He said so this year
they're gonna give him

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.520
the whole half of the city
to invite his buddies.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.220
So, he's gonna have this
display Art in the Hood

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.570
is what it was called.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.860
And so, he come up here and we pulled off,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.380
I don't know, two dozen
hoods off them old junk cars

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.980
and took them down and he passed them out

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.068
to all his artist friends--

00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:34.551
- To paint.
- To paint on.

00:23:34.551 --> 00:23:35.384
- [Tom] Brilliant.

00:23:35.384 --> 00:23:37.820
- [Roland] And then he took
a bunch to the high school.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.086
So, there was one street
that just had a row

00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:44.320
of car hoods painted on.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.680
And this friend of mine painted four.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.880
And so, we thought well we
can't just go down there.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.963
So, we built the bus or the
trailer in about a week.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.650
- [Tom] So, you built
the trailer from scratch

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.483
when you built the frame?

00:23:57.483 --> 00:23:59.040
- No, we actually had the old trailer,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.511
so we sandblasted it and mounted the box.

00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:06.740
And then we had this
real shiny nice bottom,

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.750
and so the boy that works for me, Morgan,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.290
he's got that internet figured out.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.410
So, he gets on the internet and gets the--

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.470
- [Tom] How to rust things?

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.600
- The ingredients to rust that sucker.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.280
And he got out here with a spray bottle,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.500
and in about 20 minutes we left for Alpine

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.490
and that thing was brown like
it'd been there for 40 years.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.180
- So, are you gonna make a
camper out of this or something?

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.950
- You know we put a little stove in there

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.020
so we can hang out, we can haul stuff.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.170
- Oh, look at the back.

00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.560
Geez.
(Roland laughs)

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.410
- Yeah, we get a little carried away.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.060
- That is a blast.
- Ain't that cool?

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.840
- Yeah, whose idea was that?

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.943
- Oh, that was mine.
- Man.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.700
- People get a little too
attached to their cars.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.073
So, I don't mind cutting them up.

00:24:54.073 --> 00:24:55.640
I mean, I like cars a lot,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.590
but they're more fun if
you get to play with them.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.710
- Yeah yeah yeah.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.010
So, you built this in a week.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.000
So, was it the right width for the front?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.460
- [Roland] Yeah yeah, we found a trailer

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.228
that was just the right.

00:25:07.228 --> 00:25:10.850
We had some old school buses
that we were gonna crush.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.030
So, we had to break all
those panels along the bottom

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.350
on the outside.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.530
So, we cut them to fit and then broke them

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.917
on a sheet metal brake and fit them.

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:23.163
And that's where the boy that
does the welding comes in.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.690
We get started, there's
no limit, he doesn't care.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.950
I mean, we'll make it work.
- Wow.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.490
- It's usually 2 o'clock
in the morning, but.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.440
Yeah so, it's a lot of fun.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.050
So, I'm gonna build a couple of rat bikes.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.970
- Motorcycles?
- Yeah, just to.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.590
I bought that Harley this
weekend at the auction.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.933
So, that's what that's
for, just silliness.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.730
- I've gotta see the helicopter.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.810
- Yeah.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.410
- Well, this has been a, let me see.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.320
We got here at, an hour and a half.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.153
- [Roland] Yeah.

00:25:53.153 --> 00:25:55.221
- It's been an amazing hour and a half.

00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:58.800
So, we met Jeff and through
him we met his family,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.210
nine kids, who all seem to
have an amazing sense of humor

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.230
with school buses, a helicopter,
a caboose, an airplane,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.450
and more cars than you
can shake a stick at.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.210
Thank you so much for spending
the morning with us, man.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.651
This has been a blast.
- Good time.

00:26:13.651 --> 00:26:15.915
- Thank you, thank you.
- You bet.

00:26:15.915 --> 00:26:18.748
(engine whirring)

00:26:24.488 --> 00:26:27.821
(chatting indistinctly)

00:26:28.937 --> 00:26:31.770
(engine whirring)
