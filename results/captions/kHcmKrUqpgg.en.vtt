00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.710
so recently I made a video called why
false prophets are so dangerous and this

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
video was inspired by an alleged
prophecy by the popular televangelist TV

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.519
Joshua
according to his ministry's YouTube

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.470
channel TV Joshua was said to predict
the death of 94 year-old George HW Bush

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
now I had my criticisms to the ledge
prophecy and so the conclusion that I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
drew from it was this either this guy is
the most suitable and the most obvious

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
false prophet of our generation and he's
deceiving people and leading them astray

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
as the Bible predicted and actually got
right or this guy wasn't talking about

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
bush and in that case and this video
shouldn't be floating around anyway so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.239
the conclusion that I drew from the
short video that was put out by TV

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
Joshua's ministry was that he's either a
false prophet or the prophecy was not

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.730
about Bush and if the prophecy wasn't
about Bush then his ministry should pull

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.399
down the video from their YouTube
channel so I think that that conclusion

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.640
was perfectly reasonable however most of
his followers thought I concluded

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.770
something else and they responded in
kind

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
soon after I posted the video I got
hundreds and hundreds of comments saying

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.750
that in that short video I concluded
that TB Joshua was a false prophet I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740
didn't I never even said he was a false
prophet but I can understand how that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.070
seemed implied so given the large amount
of comments that said that if I just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.890
watched his sermons on his videos I
would see that he's a true prophet of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.520
God and given the fact that I haven't
heard of him prior to that video I was

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.030
genuinely curious the reasons that his
followers said that he was a true

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.150
prophet so I spent the next several days
watching several of his videos and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.840
several of his sermons and I read every
single comment posted on my video

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.880
leading up until the day and as of today
there's around 1,500 comments or so so I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.850
read every single one of them and I
responded to several of them I really

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.119
wanted to get a better idea of why so
many of his followers said that he was a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.140
true prophet so without a doubt by far
the most common comments that I got was

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.820
that I was obviously evil I obviously
serve Satan it was full of demons simply

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.840
because I did not believe that TB Joshua
was a true prophet the largest reason

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.070
that people gave me 4y TB Joshua was a
true prophet was because they claimed

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
that he prophesied he cast out demons he
performed miracles and healings and so

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.659
on to get an idea of some of the
comments here's just a few of them and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.390
just a quick disclaimer most of the
commentators first language was not

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.750
English so I did my best to try to read
their comments in the way that they

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.870
intended it to be but I still put the
comment on the screen so that way you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.910
can
read the comments for yourself so many

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.209
thousands were Hills saved and received
miracles through the Prophet TB Joshua

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.590
he is a true prophet shut your mouth and
go to hell you look sick

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.489
obviously you're evil cuz he steals so
many and perform many miracles what have

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.000
you done except hate you are not
thinking correct you are controlled by

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.690
Satan you are evil I'm sure you're
making a video about TB Joshua's name

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.050
because you're looking for members to
sign up to your channel here on YouTube

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.080
be careful how you run that stupid mouth
concerning him

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.410
I'm sure if you would have come across
people who have been delivered through

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.069
him they would beat you to death
you are just an attention seeker this

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.269
retarded weed smoking program African
American has the audacity to call TB

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.230
Joshua a false prophet stop all that
foolish talk and go experience God

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.819
yourself like I went there and changed
my life and stopped that black on black

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.260
hating and foolish talking you're nobody
and you're sent by demons to be known

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.180
shut the F up and disappear you'll never
progress in life unless you repent now

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.030
there's hundreds and hundreds of
comments like that and if you want to go

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.720
read them feel free the link to the
first video is in the description now my

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.620
point is not to bash these people or to
demonize them I don't hold any grudges

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.400
towards any of these people nor do I
wish them harm in any kind of way I want

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.299
nothing more but for them and myself to
continue to grow in the Grace and the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.680
knowledge of our true Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ the point is if you search

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.820
any video critiquing people like Benny
Han or Kenneth Copeland or anybody that

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.120
they would consider a false prophet
you're gonna see the same lines of

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.840
argument being put forth by those
peoples followers so I did a really

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.739
quick youtube search and the first video
that I found criticizing Benny Hinn I

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.680
looked at the comments and here are some
of the comments that I found from his

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.180
followers I got healed in the name of
Jesus watching his program on TV I don't

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.370
care if anybody is judging them height
of shamelessness in this world possibie

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.410
negan is not a false prophet he's a true
man of God that Jesus and the God that

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.489
he serves saves hills and sets men and
women free I don't know why this stupid

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.900
negative video was posted on YouTube
don't knock him unless you get to know

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.340
him this man of God is real the
anointing of God is on him I rebuke

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.269
every negative comment in Jesus name I
went to three separate Benny Han

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.409
gatherings in Texas during the 1990s
what I observed and experienced I could

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.180
only do
five is supernatural you are mad and

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.539
deceived you're lying
Benny Hinn is a wonderful man of God and

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.310
was born in Israel you are obviously not
a Christian I myself was healed from an

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.020
illness I had for 27 years so as you can
see people are testing two miracles and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.160
they believe that anybody who disagrees
and criticizes Benny Hinn is obviously

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.970
evil on the first video that I could
find fatiguing Kenneth Copeland this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.650
Rick guy the one who created the video
is another one of those Satanists always

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.190
finds fault with God's anointed anyone
who has spiritual revelation of God's

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.240
Word would know that Kenneth Copeland is
on the right track like I said the blind

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.240
and lost don't know the Word of God or
even know how to operate in the spirit

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.289
so it's no wonder that they don't
understand it try getting reborn first

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.340
quit trying to worry about whether
someone is falsifying anything once you

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.400
line yourself up with the true Word of
God you will understand the words of

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.160
Kenneth Copeland now there's plenty more
but you get the point

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.090
the followers of these men and anybody
that you would consider a false prophet

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.990
are going to be defended by their
followers in the exact same way they're

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.740
gonna say that these people perform
miracles and are anointed and are

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.039
healing people and so on so at this
point we should be asking ourselves are

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.729
all of these teachers and prophets men
of God but the problem here is that all

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.270
of their views contradict in
incompatible ways for example Kenneth

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.320
Copeland says that God is about six-two
six-three weighs a couple hundred pounds

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.370
and has a hand span of about nine inches
because all of the different views

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.229
contradict in incompatible ways how do
we know who's right and who's wrong well

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.949
as Christians I hope we all agree that
our ultimate authority concerning

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.729
prophets should be found first and
foremost in Holy Scripture we should

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.210
trust the scriptures to a much higher
degree than any self-proclaimed prophet

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.539
if the miracles that they do are
supposed to attest to the truth of the

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.889
word of God then at minimum what they do
and say should line up with the Word of

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.580
God if what they doin say does not line
up with the Word of God then they're

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.060
really no different than all of the
gurus the shamans and the cult leaders

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.020
whose followers say that they perform
miracles sooo so I hope that we can all

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.789
agree so far so now the obvious question
is what do the scriptures say well first

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.120
there's warnings of false prophets all
over the Bible and second Thessalonians

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.289
we read how the Antichrist would use all
sorts of displays of power and signs and

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.680
wonders to serve the lie we also read in
the book of Revelation and many other

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.970
play
in the Bible how Satan and the

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.449
Antichrist would use size in miracles to
deceive people

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.360
Jesus himself warned about false
prophets and how they will deceive

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.150
people
he says for false Christ's and false

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.800
prophets will rise and show great signs
and wonders to deceive if possible even

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.449
the elect in Matthew 7 when Jesus is
talking about false prophets he gets to

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.340
a point where he says many will say to
me on that day Lord Lord did we not

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.300
prophesy in your name and in your name
cast out demons and in your name perform

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.910
many miracles and then I will declare to
them I never knew you depart from me you

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.139
who practice lawlessness so if there's
one thing that's clear from this is that

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.479
we cannot judge a true man of God based
off of things like prophecy healings

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.740
casting out demons and miracles on the
contrary the Bible actually tells us

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.190
that people are deceived by those things
those are the things that the Bible

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.320
warns over and over and over that false
prophets were use to deceive many

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.610
but many of TV's followers and
apparently TV himself seem to argue the

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.229
exact opposite and response of people
saying that he's using evil forces TB is

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:49.400
quoted saying it is not possible for a
single person to be working outstanding

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.630
miracles signs and wonders which
millions of other Nigerians cannot do

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.099
and for such a person to be an agent of
Satan but the Bible says the literal

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:02.930
opposite it says that people can and
will be deceived by these signs and

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.219
miracles I just can't stress that enough
why it's so important that we go back to

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:09.229
Scripture is because looks can be
deceiving

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:13.400
even Satan and the Antichrist will come
as Angels of Light it's not as though

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.659
Satan's gonna come looking evil and
being outwardly obvious of course not we

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:21.650
would expect for Satan to be charming
and smooth and to not look evil that's

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.370
the entire point sometimes we can know
from externally bad behavior but not

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.500
always like even take the Pharisees to
men they look outwardly righteous this

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.909
is why false prophets are said to be
wolves who look and act like sheep so if

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.539
we can't determine if a man is the true
prophet of God by looking at things like

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:42.589
signs and wonders and miracles and that
sort of thing then how does scriptures

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:46.640
say that we can tell if a man is a true
prophet of God one of the places that's

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.790
the most clear and the most
straightforward is found in Deuteronomy

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.810
18 starting at verse 20 we read but
the Prophet who speaks a word

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.500
presumptuously and my name which I have
not commanded him to speak or which he

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.270
speaks in the name of other gods that
prophet shall die so what we have here

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.649
is that the Israelites were required to
pump false prophets to death based off

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:11.970
of one false prophecy so for those of
TV's followers who told me that it's not

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.880
that big of a deal
he gets some prophesies wrong but he

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.870
gets a lot of them right well it seems
that God takes it a bit more seriously

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.260
than they do in the next verse the
question is raised you may say in your

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.330
heart how will we know the word which
the Lord has not spoken verse 22 when a

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.020
prophet speaks in the name of the Lord
if that thing does not come about or

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.790
come true that is the thing which the
Lord has not spoken the prophet has

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.170
spoken it presumptuously you shall not
be afraid of him so it's clear that if a

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.589
prophecy does not come true then it's
not from the Lord and you shouldn't be

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:48.180
afraid to call them out on it so now the
final question is has TB Joshua ever

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.140
uttered a false prophecy during the u.s
election between Donald Trump and

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.260
Hillary Clinton TV Joshua prophesied
that a woman was going to win the u.s.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:03.390
2016 election on November 6 he wrote ten
days ago I saw the new president of

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.170
America with an arrow win the new
president will be facing several

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.240
challenges over many issues including
passing bills attempt to possibly pass a

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.140
vote of no-confidence on the new
president the boat of the new president

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.610
will be rocked by the way in order not
to keep you in suspense what I frankly

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.839
saw is a woman now this was just a few
days before the election when the polls

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:29.550
convinced everybody that Hillary Clinton
was going to win but on November 9 2016

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.190
Hillary Clinton did not win Donald Trump
did so how did Joshua respond after the

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.279
news came in that Hillary Clinton did
not win the internet went crazy there

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:41.970
were thousands and thousands of tweets
talking about TB Joshua filled prophecy

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.170
at a point when the criticism was at a
high point the post that TV Joshua made

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.730
was somehow deleted but of course after
that the criticism kept climbing and

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.610
people began to criticize him about the
leading but so later that the leader

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.790
post has actually reposted and his
ministry said that it was a mistakenly

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.779
removed and was reposted since that's
not their policy the next week at

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:02.800
Ashurst service he responded and I've
include

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.709
that video in the description as well if
you want to watch that and hear for

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:09.190
yourself in the video he basically
starts off by saying that the reason why

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.760
people thought he had a false prophecy
is because you have to have spiritual

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.540
eyes in order to understand spiritual
things he then proceeded to say that the

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.459
prophecy was actually about the popular
vote he says we have seen the outcome of

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:25.089
the election in America having read you
will notice that it's all about the

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:30.010
popular vote the vote of the majority of
Americans now this is significant and

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.120
the reason why is because by saying this
he's affirming that the prophecy did

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.170
come to pass and the prophecy was a true
prophecy but does that sound right to

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.430
you his prophecy was out the new
president and the new presidents duties

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.709
right but clearly even if someone does
win the popular vote they still did not

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:51.790
become president nor do they have all of
the duties that are given to the

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.990
president and the duties that he
mentioned that he saw in his prophecy

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.490
and later he gave you at another
response he says thousands of people

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.600
that heard my prophecy prayed to God
they fasted and prayed that God should

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.040
change the prophecy that a prophecy was
disclosed and did not come to pass does

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.899
not mean that it is not authentic hmm so
now he's saying that the prophecy did

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:17.709
not come to pass because it was changed
by the prayers of the American people

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:21.760
but the problem with that is now he's
actually affirming that the prophecy did

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.980
not come true but his previous excuse
said that the prophecy did come true and

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.820
you needed spiritual eyes to discern
that it was all about the polls so which

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.410
one is it did the prophecy come true or
did the prophecy not come true think

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.690
about it Joshua had a 50-50 chance and
he still got the prophecy wrong and now

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.200
some of his followers are saying that
the prophecy still did come true while

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.589
the rest of them are saying that God
changed the prophecy so now we have his

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:52.120
followers holding two different views
that are mutually exclusive so if you're

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.029
one of those that are aware of this
prophecy and you still believe that TB

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:59.740
Joshua is a true prophet of God I just
want to ask how could God or anybody

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.300
else possibly show you that he is indeed
a false prophet if Scripture is clear

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.779
about how we can determine a false
prophet and we refuse to accept that

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:12.100
criteria then the only conclusion is
that we have more faith in men than we

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.840
do scripture is our unwavering faith in
Scripture or is it in men like TV Joshua

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.040
after the failed prophecy we saw a lot
of people who echoed the same kind of

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.090
thing that this Commodore did here this
Commodore says the TV Joshua I will

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.330
always believe in your prophecies
through thick and thin this is why the

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.540
Bible says the scripture is not only
good for teaching preaching and

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.670
encouragement but it's also good for
correcting and rebuking our faith on our

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.630
trust should be grounded first and
foremost not in these other signs not in

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.160
these miracles not in these men not in
these alleged prophets but only in the

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.000
gospel that's found in the Holy
Scripture in a nutshell the true gospel

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.650
says that none of us are perfect and we
cannot be perfect on our own so God took

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.790
on human flesh and came into the world
to pay for our wrongdoings and this is a

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.730
free gift of grace for all who will cept
his offer

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.960
bounine our trust in Christ allows us to
be rightly related to God so that way

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.650
when God sees us he doesn't see our
righteousness our righteousness is

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.750
filthy rags every single one of us
besides Jesus but instead God sees

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.000
crisis' righteousness in us so why is it
in so many of the churches is that not

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.850
the center of the message that you hear
and if there's one thing that I found

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.520
that's common in all of these churches
where people believe that they're under

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.760
the teachings of a true prophet is that
they believed that they couldn't

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.930
possibly be deceived now I for one I
honestly don't doubt their sincerity in

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.760
the slightest but sincerity is not a
safeguard against the seat all of these

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.850
people believe that everybody else is
wrong and they're right based off of

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:45.160
their own internal subjective experience
however they could or could not be right

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.140
but the only way to know is to go off of
the source and the foundation of all of

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.610
this that we believe and that's the Holy
Scriptures God knew just how easy it was

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.930
for us to be deceived which is why he
punched warnings over and over and over

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.330
and over and over in the scriptures for
us to be on guard against false Gospels

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.190
and false teachings as the Scriptures
make perfectly clear all of us attempted

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.000
to drift away and go after something
else that distracts us from the true

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.440
heart of the gospel one of the main
other criticisms that I got in my video

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.060
was that I ought to be afraid because I
critiqued the man of God but as we

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.480
already saw many of TV Joshua's
followers believe that if I could take

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.560
TV Joshua I was therefore rejecting God
and I was

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.580
evil and our worship Satan in other
words if you reject TB Joshua I think

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.940
you're rejecting Jesus Christ I got
hundreds of comments warning me that the

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.440
Bible says not to touch God's anointed
and because I talked about TB Joshua I'm

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.120
touching God's anointed and therefore
I'm falling under God's wrath and curse

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.650
but not surprisingly this scripture has
been used in defense of every single

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.400
false prophet of our generation but
let's go ahead and talk about that in

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.400
the next video so the next time that
someone tells you that they know someone

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.580
is a true prophet because they're
performing miracles and healings and so

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:17.870
on what are you gonna say bro what do
you mean
