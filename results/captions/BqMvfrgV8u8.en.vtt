00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.750
A few weeks ago, our next guest
had his family's last name

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.964
legally changed to
match his stepdad's.

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.130
And here's what happened
when his stepdad found out.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.016
Very cool.

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:10.345
I'll tell you what it says.

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:11.240
That's pretty cool.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.740
Tell me.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.821
"Madison Marie Watson."

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.660
You going to tell Papa why?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.430
Tell them what we did today.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.850
We went in front of
a judge for my name

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.365
to be changed to Watson.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:25.808
Yeah?

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:27.232
You did?

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:27.732
Yeah.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:28.680
Are you serious?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.180
Yeah.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.560
It's official.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.014
Oh my goodness!

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.870
That's just--

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.248
Oh man, that just made my life.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:40.880
[LAUGHS]

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.380
Get out of here.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.880
Wow!

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.372
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:47.848
Wow!

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.292
Oh my goodness,
that-- you know what?

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:59.660
GG and [INAUDIBLE]
already knew about it.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.930
The video has over
15 million views.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.450
From Whitehall, Pennsylvania,
please welcome the Watsons,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.950
Paul, Marcus, and Madison.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.150
Well, hi, y'all.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.734
Hi.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.400
That was a beautiful
moment right there.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.820
Thank you.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.320
Hi, Madison.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.121
You look beautiful.

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:11.620
Thank you.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.350
That's a pretty dress.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.890
It's a really pretty dress.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.590
OK, so was that
fun for you to do?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.570
And you gave him
something, right?

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.780
What did it say on it?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.030
It said our new last names.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.990
Madison Marie Watson.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.110
And Marcus Watson.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.890
Right.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.690
That was-- and you
like your new name?

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.190
Yes.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.720
Yeah.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.060
OK, so when did you
come into Marcus's life?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.270
When did this happen?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.040
Marcus was a year old, and his
mother and I started dating.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:48.920
And she invited me to his
second birthday party.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.032
So I went to the
second birthday party.

00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:53.240
And we stayed dating, you
know, throughout that time.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.480
And we celebrated
his life, two years.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.070
And then I knew that I was going
to continue to be in his life.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.480
And I just wanted to give
him stability and a future.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.000
Because your biological dad
was not really in the picture,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.810
right?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.889
No, he wasn't.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.630
For a brief period
of time, he was.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.500
But it was his choice, you know.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.624
We went on without him.

00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:17.540
And I had everything I
already needed at home.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.400
So it was an OK deal for me.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.900
Yeah.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.020
Yeah, you sure did.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.950
Thank you.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.590
So when did you first
start calling him "Dad?"

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.090
Dad?

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.475
I was young.

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:31.550
Dad can tell the story.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.390
Go ahead.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.670
Yeah, he called me
"Paul" for a long time.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.165
Three years.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:39.790
Called me Paul.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.415
He would ask me little questions
with this little voice, "Paul,

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:43.000
Paul."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.910
And I just, you know.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.320
And then one day, we
put him on the bus

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.150
to go to school for his first
year, seeing him off to school.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.070
And then he was coming back,
the bus was driving toward us.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.980
I was standing on
the side of the road.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.010
And him and his little
friend were waving.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.760
And he was like, "Dad, Dad.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.880
There's my dad."

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.630
And the little
kid looked at him.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.340
He looked at me.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.270
He said, is that your dad?

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.463
He said, yep, that's my dad.

00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:11.963
Sure is.

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:12.830
Sure is.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.650
And it's been that
way ever since.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.310
And I know that you're a huge
Kansas City Chiefs fans, right?

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.840
Oh, yeah.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.340
Huge.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.553
Big time.

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:20.320
Yeah.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.180
Look at that screen right there.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.990
Hey, Ellen.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.310
Hey, Watson family.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.490
This is Alex Smith, quarterback
for the Kansas City Chiefs.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.000
We heard you're
huge Chiefs fans,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600
and we want to invite
you all out to a game.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.390
Marcus, thank you for your
service to our country.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.580
And Paul, thank you for
being an amazing dad.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.330
See you guys soon.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:45.266
Get out of town!

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.754
Oh my goodness.

00:03:46.754 --> 00:03:47.746
Thank you.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:48.480
Thank you.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.950
So you're getting four
club-level tickets,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.980
you're getting sideline
passes, a tour of the stadium.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.650
And Madison, you're
going to meet--

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.500
all of you, you're going
to meet the Chiefs mascot.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.770
And this is going to be
exciting, I think, right?

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.330
Now she seems more
excited than any--

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.500
She's a Chiefs fan.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.340
She's a Chiefs fan?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.060
Yeah.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.720
All right.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.570
And I got something for
you so that you can--

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.460
Aw, thank you.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.460
What do you say, Maddie?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.360
And they all say "Watson."

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.860
What?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.010
Thank you, guys.
