00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.500
last time we saw the old 350 rallye

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.020
engine Nick was just about ready to move

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.390
the freshly rebuilt small-block over to

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.680
his dyno room for final testing now we

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.720
stop back in for an update after he

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.900
spent his whole friday working with the golden v8

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.700
we finished putting the whole

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.860
engine together and this morning we ended up putting it

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.629
on the dyno and then we ran

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.550
for 20 minutes to  break  in the

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.070
camshaft get all the testing will check

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.520
for a vacuum leaks oil leaks, everything

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.280
went fine then my customer came in then we

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.720
said okay let's that's the for horse power

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.640
and torque and we started getting HP

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.450
like 350 360 370 but we're far away

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.940
from 400 but from the factory this thing

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.130
did 310 horsepower and there's not many

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.350
modifications on this motor we

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.880
maybe brought the compression up a little

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.280
bit but a little cam we did some port work

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.500
and that's about it but we're really

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.259
looking for 400 HP, so we tried

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.360
everything we can all day now after a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.780
Now, after a long friday spent  working on the engine.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700
we find Nick and the 350 still in the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.140
dyno past closing time

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.760
he's tried a big double pumper carb he experimented with

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.340
different spacers bolted on bigger

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.139
headers but kept falling just short of

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.950
his clients goal. and we're stuck with

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.649
391 horsepower and now my customer left

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.939
the dyno room

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.039
I guess we're giving up on it and that's

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.869
it but i have the customer bringing the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.520
intake manifold the original piece

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.990
because here we got the aluminum one

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.060
from the Edlebrock I needed a fitting

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.189
so I can continue putting the fittings on

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.510
their engine.  he brought it in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.060
and what a surprise,  i look at this  ...

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.940
and i'm impressed i realized that this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.680
intake manifold seems a little bit

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.490
different from the Edelbrock. the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.200
carb seems to be sitting a little bit

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.240
higher the runners are a little bit

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.910
wider so I said maybe this one could

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.000
make the extra horsepower we're looking fir

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.470
so now i was thinking like okay let's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.600
try on the motor, so I called my

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.190
customer and asked what do you think it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.200
was Nick, whatever it takes to make

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.510
400 HP let's give it a shot

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.260
we've done everything we can to get 400

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.120
horsepower but after seeing that intake

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.190
manifold , hmm.. it looks impressive

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.900
it looks like it might do the job

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.820
I might get ten HP out of it .. here it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.800
is friday night everybody's gone home

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.670
clients and all and now i'm curious i'm

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.870
gonna remove this is intake manifold here

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.120
tonight just to see what we got

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.360
Nick's passion for power has kept him working

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.810
late to plenty of times but he's also

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.670
got plenty of good people who lend a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.850
hand tonight it's his brother George who

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.980
stopped by after a day in the parts store

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.960
and is ready to pitch in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.150
nick has been wrenching on engines with

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.100
his brothers since before the ink was

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.000
dry on his first driver's license

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.090
he's got more room in his shop now than

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.800
he did back in the basement of the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.860
family home but this is still what he

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.760
loves doing best.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.320
This is really old school.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.320
this is backyard style with the key.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800
no ratchet, no air tools, nothing.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680
it's time consuming, but you know what, it still

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.240
get's the job done.   back in the early seventies,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.080
this is what we did.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.200
Pretty soon, Nick has got the aluminum intake off and his

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.700
hunch would seem to be confirmed the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.680
runners are measurably larger on the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.600
original cast iron part.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600
here we go, we will start with the edelbrock.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.850
it's a snug fit fits in pretty snug

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.250
tight and now we're going to go to the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.420
cast iron and here we go we see almost an

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.489
eighth of an inch that's on the width.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.510
let's try it over here same thing now let's

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.400
go back to edelbrock here we go

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.020
snug tight, snug tight.  now let's try

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.020
overall height here we go

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.620
now go for the edelbrock, see that...

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.560
Now, we go here again we have almost an

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.220
eighth  of a  gap as you can see

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.320
we might get our goal, ten HP.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.380
Might put us in the 400 range.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600
It's promising, but Nick knows that

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.840
there's lots more to getting horsepower

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.960
than one quick measurement he's going to

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.150
have to dyno test to see if his theory

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.200
holds water so the next morning

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.850
he's got Vasilis bolting on the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.130
freshly cleaned original cast iron

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.920
intake manifold

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.720
Nick wants me to put the holley carburetor

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.160
on that intake,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.280
That intake was designed for a Rochester carburetor

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.760
which has a square bore flange

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.430
you see, the the bolt patterns are not the same

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.500
it's a little bit off there so we're going to need an adapter

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.440
it is the weekend, so everything is closed.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.560
we can't order one, but I know exactly where i can find one.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.900
so we can make the engine run today.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.120
this 72 cuda has got a late 440 in it now

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.760
he can borrow the part he needs while this

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.440
car is in the shop in order a new one on monday

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.710
the 440s came with the spread bore intake

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.259
and that's the adapter plate so we

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.210
can put from spread bore to square bore.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.880
in the oldsmobile, so we can use our holley carburetor.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.530
that should  work

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.260
Nick doesn't like the apparent

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.390
restriction this chunk of iron in the

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.730
middle of the intake might cause but

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.530
he's not willing to start carving up an

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.830
original piece just yet so he leaves it

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.230
as it is for the purposes of the test

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.309
Here I am,  I got the cast iron intake manifold

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:23.039
installed and ready to make a test and i

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.349
hope we make that 400  horsepower and

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.480
then let's get started and see what we can do.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.200
Nick wants to make a few pulls, dial in

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:38.729
the air-fuel ratio and find out what

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:40.920
he's making with this setup

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.800
we need to richen the carburetor. ok we're going to go up 2 jets.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.280
you want it in  the 12s?

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.120
Yeah, I want mid 12s, high 12's at full throttle.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.350
at 13.5 it's running too lean.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.600
Let's richen it out Vasilis,  change the jets, go ahead.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.960
this olds 350 has seen a lot more

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.899
testing than the average motor that Nick

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:26.760
puts on his dyno... but he doesn't mind a bit.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.160
As long as  I got the energy and my health,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.199
I could do it,  and I will do it, forever

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.400
why not, I enjoy this...This is what I love.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.440
between 12 and 12.9..  A little richer? go up...

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.360
2 jets, so it can go down in the middle.  two more up, yeah.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.400
12 and a half to 13... thats good.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.400
let's see what we got.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.440
did it change anything?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.120
384 back there again.  That motor is stuck at 384-385

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.840
it's not the result Nick was hoping for

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.960
but this is why he keeps the dyno in his shop

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.440
so you can do real tests and get real answers

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.790
if this was his own motor, he'd  keep

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.970
trying but it belongs to a client and

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.380
the client has already said that he's

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.360
happy with the other set-up.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.680
here we are , we overlapped our two tests cast iron vs edelbrock.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.020
the dotted line is the edelbrock manifold.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.260
we did that before... vs that cast iron

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.680
we put on today is a solid line so what

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.840
you see here is that the edelbrock

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.700
is the way to go

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.160
the aftermarket intake does seem to be

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.640
wider open up top and Nick would love to

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.010
try modifying the original to see if he

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.630
could get more air and fuel to the

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.720
cylinders but it's the client who's

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.600
calling the shots on this engine and

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.040
this is as far as he wants to go... for now

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.120
a few days later the 350 is still on the

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:55.759
dyno this time with the edelbrock

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:59.440
performer intake back on

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.750
it's being started up for one more pull

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.210
and there's quite the audience here to

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.620
see and hear for themselves

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.960
Nick's client Tony and three generations

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.850
of his family are celebrating the

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.830
rebirth of the motor for a car that

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.390
means a lot to all of them

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.390
that's the thing about what Nick does...

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.750
he doesn't just build engines... he's building

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.920
people's dreams

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:49.279
and this dream isn't over yet

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:51.290
you know Nick isn't going to be happy

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.660
until he gets 400 horses out of the

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.620
rocket v8

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.380
when he does you'll be along for the

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.470
ride
