00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.360
Christians and other Bible scholars often
use some or all of these 12 points

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.120
to make the argument that the rapture cannot
happen yet:

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.920
1. They say the Gospel must be preached in every
town of the whole earth and it hasn’t.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.040
2. They are waiting for Jerusalem to be surrounded
by armies.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.220
3. They are waiting for the Final Beast, or Revived
Roman Empire to devour the whole earth.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.020
4. They say the Falling Away has not occurred
yet.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.620
5. They are waiting for a third Temple to be rebuilt so a man can sit in it and proclaim himself God.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.720
6. They are waiting for the Abomination of Desolation
to be set up in that Temple.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.320
7. They say the Great Tribulation has not started
and must come to an end before the rapture.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.280
8. They believe the King of the North has not
yet set up his tabernacle between the seas.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.680
9. They are waiting for a Seven year Peace Treaty
with Israel.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.960
10. They are waiting for an Antichrist to rise
up.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.980
11. They say the 7 seals must be broken prior
to the Rapture and none have broken yet.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.420
12. They believe the Scattering of the Power of
the Holy People has not yet occurred.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.050
In this video, I will prove using Bible scripture

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.660
that all twelve of these points have already
been fulfilled!

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.160
Number 1: In Matthew 24:14 Jesus said the
gospel of the Kingdom

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.730
shall be preached in all the world and then
the end will come.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.230
Many Christians argue that this has not happened
yet

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.590
because there are still small communities
in remote parts of the world

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.490
that do not contain Christians.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.130
Other groups, such as the Joshua Project imply
that

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.060
the acceptance and domination of Christianity
must occur in every region of the world.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.280
However, that is not what Jesus said.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.120
He said the gospel will be preached in all
the world.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.570
Never did he mention Christianity.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.010
Never did he mention acceptance or domination.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.851
If he meant that it would be accepted and
dominate every single community of the world

00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.079
he would have said that, but he didn’t.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.900
He also did not say that it would be preached
in every village of the world.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.219
He said it would be preached in all the world
and this has happened.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.000
Even in the countries where it is illegal
to be Christian it has occurred.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.360
If the gospel had not been preached in those
areas, then there would be no laws against it.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.939
Also notice Jesus did not say the gospel has
to be preached by people alive today.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.640
The gospel is not Christianity.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.519
It is certain books within the Bible itself.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.459
That means the preaching or teaching occurs
within the books themselves!

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.780
So the preaching of the gospel is not only
found in religious organizations,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.709
there are many people studying these books
independently including on the internet (map)

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.370
and thus learning or being preached or taught
by the books themselves.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.139
Therefore, wherever the Bible has been published
is sufficient evidence

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.540
that the gospel has reached that area.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.000
This chart shows how many different languages
the Bible has been translated into.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.810
641 languages in Africa, 570 in Asia, 405
in the Pacific Islands, 203 in Europe,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.709
73 in North America, and 392 in Central and
South America.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.520
This shows that the gospel has been published
in all populated regions of the Earth;

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360
all of the inhabited continents.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.040
Even if one were to argue that it must be
published in every language,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.900
the Denver Post recently pointed out that
this may be complete by 2025.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.870
But again, Jesus did not say the gospel must
reach every language of the Earth,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.909
just like he did not say it must reach every
single community of Earth.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.529
Just All the Earth.

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:55.909
The Whole Earth.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.980
And I think it is obvious that has happened.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.780
Every major area of the Earth has been reached.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.379
Not every place has accepted the gospel or
converted to Christianity,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.840
but Number 1 is complete: the gospel has reached
the whole world.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.639
Number 2: In Luke 21:20 it says And when you
shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies…

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.360
then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.030
Luke 21 runs parallel to Matthew 24 and Mark
13.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.620
All three chapters give a timeline of events,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.530
however, each differs slightly.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.580
Jesus said in Luke 12:37,38 that there will
be three watches

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.319
and that we will not know which watch he will
come in; the first, the second, or the third.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.920
In Matthew 24 Jesus lists three things that
watchers should see:

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.900
First, in verses 1 and 2 he said they will
see the Jerusalem Temple be destroyed.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.879
Next, in verse 15 he says they will see the
Abomination of Desolation,

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:13.020
and third, in verse 30 he says everyone will
see the coming of the Son of Man in the clouds.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.150
Mark 13 lists these same 3 events to specifically
watch for;

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.380
things Jesus specifically says to see.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.940
But you will notice a slight difference in
Luke 21.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.569
Luke 21:20 says to watch for Jerusalem compassed
with armies

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.539
instead of the Abomination of Desolation that
both Mark 13 and Matthew 24

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.150
say to watch for.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.610
This is because Luke 21:1-24 is specifically talking
about the first watch!

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.319
It doesn’t list three things to see because
it is not talking about three watches

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.900
it is only talking about one watch; the first
watch!

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.599
This can be verified by the writings of Josephus

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.169
which describe in detail the events that occurred

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.900
when Jerusalem was surrounded by the Roman
armies in 70 CE.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.320
The events he described are perfectly replicated
in Luke 21 and

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.580
in Luke 21:20 it makes clear that it is referring
to the destruction of Jerusalem.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.300
Therefore, Luke 21:1-24 is not referring to the
final watch.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.349
It refers to the first watch which was the
destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.120
That is when Jerusalem was surrounded by armies,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.020
so it is not necessary for this to happen
again.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.949
It happened at the first watch.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.710
So Number 2 is complete:

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.230
Jerusalem was surrounded by armies in 70 CE
during the first watch.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.860
For more information on that, see the link
here or the playlist at the end of this video.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.380
Number 3: In Daniel 7 verses 7 and 23 it describes

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.139
the final Beast that will devour the whole
earth.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.820
This Beast is described in more detail in
Revelation 13:1,2

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.200
It is like a Leopard, has the feet of a Bear,
and the mouth of a Lion.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.860
This means it is a combination of the first
three Beasts in Daniel 7.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.250
The first three Beasts are well known to be
the ancient Babylonian Empire,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.800
the First Persian Empire, and the Greek Empire.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.050
The fourth Beast is well known to be the Roman
Empire.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.180
Revelation 13:3 tells us one of the seven
heads of the Beast will be wounded

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.430
as if it were dead, but then be healed.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.710
This wounding occurred with the dissolution
of the Holy Roman Empire;

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.229
in 1870.

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.039
It appeared that the Roman Empire was dead
at that point.

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.039
However, it rose again in 1920, in the name
of Peace.

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.969
There are several reasons we know the League
of Nations and the United Nations

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:52.580
are the Final Beast.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.349
First, Revelation 17:8-10 puts forth a riddle:

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.800
The Beast that you saw Was, and is Not, Yet is…

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.740
…the seven heads are seven mountains…and
there are seven kings…

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:09.389
…five are fallen, and one is, and the other
is not yet come…

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.979
and when he comes he must continue a short
space…

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:17.419
and the Beast that Was, and is Not, even he
is the eighth…

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:21.110
and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.310
The five that had fallen were:

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.620
the Babylonian Empire, the Persian Empire,
the Greek Empire,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.110
the Western Roman Empire, and the Eastern
Roman Empire.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.589
The one that is, it already told us: was,
is not, yet is.

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:44.430
In other words, the one that is refers to the head that was wounded and then healed (Revelation 13:3).

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.779
That was the Sixth King; the Holy Roman Empire.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:52.560
Remember, the Kings are not the same as the
Heads, they are slightly different in this verse.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.750
The Holy Roman Empire was the Seventh Head
but the Sixth King.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.079
The one that had not yet come at the time
of the Holy Roman Empire

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:05.980
was the League of Nations, which only existed
a short time; 25 years.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.100
That was the Seventh King,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.640
and the Eighth King is the United Nations,
which is the same as the Seventh King, it says.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.360
The United Nations was the renewed League
of Nations.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.550
So the seventh and eighth Kings are the same
organization, as it says.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.980
The other reason we know this, is in Daniel
8:23-25

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.520
we are told the King of Fierce Countenance
will rise when the transgressions

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:34.360
of the four horns of the Goat have come to
the full.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.570
The four horns of the Goat correspond to the
Four Heads of the Leopard.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:44.420
The Four Heads of Leopard all corresponded
to major Empires at different times in history:

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.920
The Seleucid Empire corresponded to the ancient
Neo-Assyrian Empire (Mesopotamia).

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.810
That was when it reached its full potential.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:59.150
The Ptolemaic Dynasty corresponded to the
ancient Egyptian Empire; its full potential,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.010
and the Antigonid Dynasty reached its full potential as
the ancient Greek Empire.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.950
The only Empire that did not reach its full
potential by Daniel’s time

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.230
was the Attalid Dynasty (Anatolia), which corresponds to the modern country of Turkey.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.610
This area reached its full potential as the
Turkish Empire

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.910
and it came to its end in 1923.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.180
Daniel 8:23-25 says in the Latter Time of
their Kingdom

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.180
A King of Fierce Countenance will stand up

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.370
and …by peace shall destroy many.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.350
The League of Nations rose up in 1920 at the
latter end of the Turkish Empire

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.450
and it rose by the stated motive of maintaining
Peace!

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.180
The League of Nations only existed a short
time

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.060
until the United Nations took over.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.410
The United Nations is, therefore, the eighth
King; the Final Beast,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.220
which the prophecy tells us is a combination
of all of Daniel’s Beasts.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.121
The United Nations does, in fact, include
the nations associated with Daniel’s first

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.121
three Beasts;

00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:09.480
but it does more than that: it includes every
country on the planet except four!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.180
It literally has devoured the whole earth!

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.990
In 1968, the same politicians and United Nations
bureaucrats founded the Club of Rome.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:26.279
In 1972, the Club of Rome, as a UN subsidiary,
published Limits to Growth

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.200
which eventually distinguished Ten World Regions.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.190
What’s more, in 1991, the Club of Rome published
The First Global Revolution

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.000
which alarmingly, states that Humanity is
their Enemy!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.840
In 2009 they published A New Path for World
Development

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.420
which further accentuated the Ten World Regions
published earlier in 1972.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:55.259
These Ten Regions are the Ten Kings, and the
year of their publishing; 2009,

00:11:55.259 --> 00:12:00.110
also included a major fulfillment of Daniel
9, which we will talk about later.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.910
So the Final Beast; the King of Fierce Countenance,
has already risen,

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.009
and the Ten Kings have been appointed.

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:09.889
But there have also now been a total of Ten
Kings

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:12.560
since the start of Daniel’s Timeline;

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.200
1. Babylon

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.820
2. Persia

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.440
3. Assyria

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.980
4. Greece

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.520
5. Egypt

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.420
6. Turkey

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.720
7, 8, and 9: the Western, Eastern, and Holy
Roman Empires,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.540
and 10. The Final King; the United Nations.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.720
So Number 3 has been fulfilled:

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.170
The Beast, which Revelation 13 tells us includes
all the Kings since Babylon,

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:46.839
has already risen, devoured the whole world,
and has all Ten of its Horns as of now.

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:51.870
Numbers 4 and 5 concern 2 Thessalonians 2:1-4
which says

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.810
that concerning the coming of Jesus…

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.529
…let no man deceive you…

00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:59.100
for that day shall not come except there come
a falling away first…

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.209
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition…

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:06.800
who opposes and exalts himself above all that
is called God or that is worshipped

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.190
so that he as God sits in the Temple of God,
showing himself that he is God.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:17.509
Then notice in verse 7 it adds that this mystery
of iniquity does already work.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:22.400
In other words, when 2 Thessalonians was written,
around 51-52 CE,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.139
the iniquity spoken of in these verses had
already started.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:31.589
Then it adds in verses 10-12 that after this
man of sin declares himself God

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:35.940
there will be a strong delusion and many will
be deceived.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.450
So here is the timeline.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:43.930
2 Thessalonians tells us the iniquity had
already started in 51-52 CE.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.290
That was at the first rising of the Roman
Empire.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:53.459
By 1512, the Popes were already being called Gods (Christopher Marcellus).

00:13:53.459 --> 00:14:00.819
Notice the word translated as Temple in 2
Thessalonians 2:4, word number 3485,

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:04.670
means any heathen temple or shrine.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.800
The Vatican Temple was built from 1506 to
1626.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.040
In 1517, the falling away began with the Protestant
Reformation.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.759
Then in 1894 Pope Leo the thirteenth proclaimed
himself God

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:23.190
while sitting in the completed Temple.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:28.990
The Strong Delusion is the Church System stemming
out of the Holy Roman Empire;

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.430
the Seventh Head of the Beast and the Sixth
King of Revelation 17.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.400
Click on the link here or the playlist at
the end of this video for more details on that.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.240
So Number 4 is complete: The falling away
has already occurred.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.300
The Temple in 2 Thessalonians refers to any
heathen Temple or Shrine

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.890
which applies to the Vatican Temple.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.290
But in Ezekiel 40-43 there are measurements
for another Temple

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.740
that many believe will be built in Jerusalem
before the Tribulation.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:07.040
However, the Ezekiel Temple is a Temple built
by God; the Temple in Revelation 21.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.140
In Ezekiel 47:1 it says waters will rush forth
out of the Temple.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:18.790
In Revelation 21:1,2 we are told that after
Armageddon there will be no sea on the Earth

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.029
and the Holy City will come down out of Heaven.

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:23.921
Then it gives the measurements of the Holy
city

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:28.660
and in verse 17 it says the wall is 144 cubits.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:37.390
In Ezekiel 43:16, the alter is measured as
12 x 12 cubits which equals 144 cubits.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:42.649
In Ezekiel 48:29-35 it actually says this
Temple is a City

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:47.170
and it has 12 Gates named after the 12 Tribes
of Israel.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:54.060
In Revelation 21:10-13 it says the Holy City
that will come down from heaven in the end

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.920
has 12 Gates named after the 12 Tribes of
Israel.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.480
So it seems clear by comparison of these verses
that the Temple in Ezekiel

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.690
is not a man-built Temple, but a Temple built
by God

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.500
that will come down to Earth after Armageddon.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.910
This is confirmed in Hebrews 8:2, which says
the True Tabernacle is built by God, not Humans.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.829
So the Ezekiel Temple is not the Temple that
the man of sin sat in.

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:26.829
The Ezekiel Temple is a Temple built by God

00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:30.399
that comes down out of heaven after Armageddon,

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:36.170
and the Temple in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is any
heathen Temple or Shrine.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.829
The word translated as God in that verse is
the Greek word Theos

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:41.380
which literally means:

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.180
1. A God or Goddess

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.019
and 4. Whatever can in any respect be likened to
God

00:16:48.019 --> 00:16:51.069
for example, God’s Representative, it says.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:53.889
So the second half of verse 4 reads:

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:58.879
…so that he as a God’s Representative
sits in the Temple of a God…

00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:02.720
showing himself that he is God’s Representative (meaning of Pope's Title: Vicar of Christ).

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.720
So numbers 4 and 5 have already happened:

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.390
The Falling Away started over 500 years ago

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:17.699
and the Man of Sin has already sat in the
Temple and declared himself God’s Representative.

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:26.110
The Strong Delusion that came after that involves the false belief that the timeline looks like this or this

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.860
or this.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:35.740
All of these have been proven invalid in the
playlist linked here or at the end of this video.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.740
Number 6: In Matthew 24:15,16 it says

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.820
When you see the Abomination of Desolation
spoken of by Daniel, stand in the Holy Place

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.660
then those in Judea will flee into the mountains,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.679
and verse 21: For then shall be Great Tribulation.

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:59.300
This Abomination of Desolation is spoken of
in detail in Daniel 11 and 12.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.220
In Daniel 11:31 it says that Arms will stand
on his part

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.710
and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.260
and shall take away the Daily sacrifice,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.690
and they shall place the Abomination that
makes Desolate.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.100
Daniel 11 is a very detailed timeline of events.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:24.780
In order for Verse 31 to truly be fulfilled
it has to match the timeline in that chapter exactly.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:32.000
This timeline ends in 685 CE when the Dome
of the Rock was built on the Temple mount.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.289
The Dome of the Rock was built using

00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:38.460
the same measurements as the Catholic Church
of the Holy Sepulchre.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.930
It is a Roman Temple.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.700
Daniel 11 explains how the Roman Empire created
the Muslim religion

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.570
in order to conquer Persia.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.049
This is explained in detail at the link here
or in the playlist at the end of this video.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:19:00.670
The other part concerning the Abomination
of Desolation is found in Daniel 12:11,12;

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.230
The 1290 Days and the 1335 Days.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:11.090
Days can also represent years in the prophecy
and this fulfillment occurred in years.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.640
The 1290 Years from the first ceasing of the
Daily in 606 BC

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.640
until 685 CE when the Dome of the Rock was
set up in Jerusalem.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.860
Then 1335 years from 685 lands in the year
2020!

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.650
So Number 6 has been completed.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:36.300
The Abomination of Desolation was set up in
Jerusalem in 685 CE.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:41.200
Notice neither Jesus nor Daniel said it would
be set up in a Temple.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:48.280
It does not say that in Daniel 11 or 12 and
it does not say that in Matthew 24:15.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.600
It says it would be set up in a Holy Place.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.570
Jerusalem was the Holy Place.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:00.720
The Overspreading of Abominations in Daniel 9 are something different which we will get to later.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.580
Number 7: The Great Tribulation is the “Tribulation
of Days”

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.610
as explained in Matthew 24:29.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:15.630
This Tribulation of Days refers to the 1260
Days in Revelation 11 and 12.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:22.460
Revelation 12:6 tells us the Woman fled into
the Wilderness for 1260 Days.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.840
This Woman refers to Judea in Matthew 24:16.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:33.409
Matthew 24 tells us the Abomination stands
before this fleeing

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:38.800
and Revelation 12 tells us the Sign in Heaven
appears before this fleeing.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.059
The sign occurred in 686 CE while the Dome
of the Rock was being built.

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:50.290
For more on that see the link here or in the
playlist at the end of this video.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:57.169
This 1260 day period is a 1260 year period
since Days refer to Years

00:20:57.169 --> 00:21:00.800
in Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.300
In Revelation 11 we are told the rain of fire
and brimstone will not fall during this time.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:15.420
This is because Matthew 24:29 tells us the
Stars will fall immediately after the Tribulation.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.539
Waters represent people according to Revelation
17:15

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:27.390
so the waters turn to blood because many people
were murdered during this 1260 year period.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.650
This is also the time when the Two Witnesses
walk the Great City.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.720
The Great city, according to Revelation 17:18
is Babylon the Great.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.570
The Two Witnesses are the Two Candlesticks,

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.700
in other words, Two Churches walking Babylon
the Great.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.470
They are Christianity and Judaism.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.780
For more on that see the video linked here
or in the playlist at the end of this video.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.400
The 1260 years of Tribulation has also involved
the murder and persecution

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.260
of those who will not worship the Beast.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.780
The Great Tribulation started, according to
ancient scholars,

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.830
between 754-758 CE.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.179
This is when the Holy Roman Empire began to
grow.

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:16.350
The end of this Tribulation, therefore, is
literally about to happen now.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:22.590
Matthew 24:29 says the Stars Fall Immediately
after the Tribulation

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:29.620
and that starts the final time of trouble
of 3.5 years according to Revelation 11 and 12.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.160
The rapture occurs when the Stars Fall.

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:38.179
This means the rapture occurs immediately
after the 1260 years

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:42.429
at the start of the final 3.5 years of Darkness!

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:46.990
This is the flying of the Woman in Revelation
12:14.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:52.570
The Woman, at this point, represents the Great
Multitude of all Tribes and Nations

00:22:52.570 --> 00:23:01.640
in Revelation 7:9, they are the Multitude
walking the Holy City for 42 months in Revelation 11:2.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.660
The word translated as Gentiles there also means
Multitude.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:13.140
This 42 months is the 3.5 years; the Final
Time of Trouble after the Tribulation of the Days.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.900
So Number 7 has been fulfilled:

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:24.100
The Great Tribulation of the Days started
1260 years ago and is ending now.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.480
Number 8: The Timeline in Daniel 11 continues

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.360
after the Abomination of Desolation is set
up in verse 31.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.539
Verses 32 through 35 refer to Justinian II
and Pope John V.

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:45.180
Verses 36-39 refer to Pope Stephen II and
the Donation of Pepin.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.419
And Verses 40-45 refer to the discovery of
America,

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:52.520
the subsequent invasion by the Holy Roman
Empire,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.200
and the placement of the Vatican Temple in
the United States:

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.730
between the two seas; the Atlantic and Pacific.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.530
So number 8 was fulfilled in 1866.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:10.299
For more details on that, see the link here
or in the playlist at the end of this video.

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:13.299
Number 9: Daniel 9:27 says:

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:16.990
“And he shall confirm the covenant with
many for one week

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.320
and in the midst of the week he shall cause
the sacrifice and the oblation to cease

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.970
and for the overspreading of abominations
he shall make it desolate…”

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.370
The word translated as Week literally means
Seven.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.120
So what many, if not most Christians believe,
is that

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.140
the antichrist will make a seven year Peace
Treaty with Israel

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.870
and then three and a half years later, break
the Treaty.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.919
However, the verse does not say that!

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:46.049
First of all, there is no mention of the Little
Horn in these verses.

00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:51.890
Second, Daniel 9 does not talk about a specific
placing of one Abomination

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.340
it talks about the overspreading of many abominations.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.669
Third, it does not say the covenant is a peace
covenant,

00:24:58.669 --> 00:25:02.140
and fourth it does not say the covenant is
with Israel.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.070
So, while we do know that

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:09.750
the King of Fierce Countenance in Daniel 8:23-25
will destroy by Peace,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.980
it does not say in Daniel 9:27 that the covenant
is a Peace covenant with Israel.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.950
It says it is a Covenant with Many.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.510
As it turned out, when these fulfillments
happened,

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.120
the covenant was a Treaty between the King
of Fierce Countenance

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.970
and the Whole World.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.760
The man called Messiah was Obama, who won
the World Peace Prize

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.200
for confirming that covenant in 2009.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.029
But after Obama was cut off, the Prince that
shall come; President Trump,

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:42.850
also confirmed the covenant, along with every
other President in the past 50 years.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:48.190
The covenant is the Worldwide Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.760
otherwise known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty
or NPT.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.790
This is a Treaty put forth by the Final Beast;
the United Nations.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.140
A Treaty with Many; A Treaty with almost every
country on the Planet.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.679
The Daniel 9 prophecy is very complex

00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:08.880
and for details on the recent fulfillments
you can see this link here

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.399
or in the playlist at the end of the video.

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:16.580
In short, everything in verses 24-27 have
been completed except

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:22.320
the flood, the end, the battle, the gift on
the wing, and the end of sins.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.640
This is an alternate translation; the meanings
of the words have been shown in other videos,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.640
and I’ve highlighted in Red those things
that have not occurred yet.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.860
The yellow highlights the Seventy Seven that
are determined to make an end of sins,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.960
from the Going forth of the commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.659
This started in 1947-48 at the UN commandment
and declaration of Israel.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:53.840
So the Seventy Seven, it indicates, will end
in 2024 or 25.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.080
Highlighted in blue is the appearance of the
man called Messiah:

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.920
the Seven, seven, and 62 Shavuots from 1948:

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:07.520
1961 birth of Obama and 2009 first year as
President.

00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:10.029
After this, it says, Messiah was cut off.

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:12.090
That happened in 2016.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.100
The next part says: Leader come in, perhaps
to go to ruin.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.470
This occurred when Trump took office in 2017.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.390
The red part is what has not occurred yet:

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.840
City sacredness end, Flood, End, Battle, Desolated,
Cut.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:37.860
Strong covenant many, one seven, half seven
cease, sacrifice, gift on the wing,

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:45.080
detested thing desolated, even complete, cut,
pour forth, desolated.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.059
Not a single word has been omitted or inserted
here.

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:53.940
This is literally what the ancient words say
in these verses.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.830
The Strong covenant with Many is already in
effect.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:03.640
It has been in effect since 1968, between
the Final Beast and the whole world.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.830
So number 9; the covenant with Many, has been
fulfilled.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.200
Number 10: What people call the Antichrist

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.400
actually refers to the Little Horn described
by Daniel.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.540
There are at least 17 points concerning the
Little Horn so we will go through these quickly.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:28.260
Daniel 7:8, 20 tell us the Little Horn comes
out of the Beast

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.240
and rises among the Ten Horns of the Beast.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.289
The word translated as After in Daniel 7:24
also means In the Future

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:40.539
and the word Them is not in the Lexicon.

00:28:40.539 --> 00:28:44.659
So the Little Horn doesn’t have to rise
after the Ten Horns,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:51.020
its simply saying it will rise in the Future
and its different from the Ten Horns.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.720
Whether the Ten Horns are the Ten Regions
of the World put forth by the United Nations

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.510
or whether they are all the Kings since Babylon,

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.030
the Little Country of Israel came out of them.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.470
It was the Eighth King; the Beast who created
the country of Israel;

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:10.309
The United Nations put forth the commandment
in November 1947.

00:29:10.309 --> 00:29:13.220
And Israel is different from the Ten Horns:

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.720
It is a country and the Ten Horns are not
countries

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.940
but instead are regions designated by the
Beast.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.230
In Daniel 7:8 it says in the Little Horn were
Eyes like the Eyes of a man

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.559
and a mouth speaking great things.

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:32.740
But notice the Little Horn does not have a
face.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.670
Contrary to popular belief, the Little Horn
is not a man.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.090
It has the Eyes and the Mouth of humans, but
it is not a human.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.620
Zechariah 4:2-10 and Revelation 1:20 tell
us that

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.750
the Eyes are the Churches of YHWH throughout
the Whole Earth,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:56.830
and Revelation 13:2 tells us the Mouth is
the Lion, which Daniel 7 explains is Babylon.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:01.490
Hosea 13 and Revelation 13 tell us that YHWH
is the Beast.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.920
The Beast is both YHWH and the World Government
because

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.760
Deuteronomy 32 tells us the Government created
YHWH.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:16.580
YHWH is the name the Mouth Babylon published
and ascribed to YHWH

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.450
the greatness of the Elohiym, who created
the Earth in Genesis 1.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:26.480
So the Beast and YHWH are one and the same
according to the Bible.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.080
The government tried to make itself God long
ago at the start of Daniel’s timeline.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.450
but they didn’t admit that until the 1800s.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:41.040
Even now, those who worship YHWH are worshipping
the Lord the government created.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.130
Its not the true God, it is the Beast according
to the Bible itself.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.710
And this worship is the Great Delusion:

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:53.960
The belief that YHWH is God despite the superior
evidence in the Bible

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.710
telling us that YHWH is, in fact, the Beast.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:03.559
In Revelation 17:3 we are told Babylon, the
Mouth, sits on the Beast

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:08.320
and Revelation 17:15 says Babylon also sits
on People.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.620
If it sits on the Beast and it also sits on
People, then it is sitting on the People of the Beast.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.040
In other words, Babylon sits on the People
who worship the Beast.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.780
The Beast is YHWH, so Babylon sits on the
People who worship YHWH:

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:28.560
The Abrahamic Religions highlighted in Pink
on this map.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.669
The Beast devours the Whole World, Babylon
sits on the Beast,

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:39.669
so Babylon sits on the whole world; all seven
continents.

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:44.010
The Eyes of the Beast are the Churches of
YHWH throughout the Earth

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.260
and the Mouth of the Beast is Babylon

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.899
who sits on the Churches of YHWH throughout
the Earth.

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:55.799
The Little Horn is part of the Beast, therefore
the Eyes and Mouth of the Beast

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:59.070
are the Eyes and Mouth of the Little Horn.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:05.020
The Little Horn is the Little Country of Israel
that was created by the Beast 70 years ago.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:11.360
Therefore the Eyes and Mouth of Israel are
the Churches of YHWH throughout the whole Earth.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.820
Jesus told us True Israel represents the Whole
Earth,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.040
so the country in the middle east is not True
Israel.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.070
It is the Little Horn of the Beast.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:30.760
Daniel 7:8,24 also say there will be three
Kings that are plucked up before the Little Horn

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.700
These three kings were France, Brittain, and
Russia

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.399
who moved in and occupied the middle East
toward the end of the Turkish Empire

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:44.549
with the area around Jerusalem taken by the
League of Nations.

00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:48.289
The League of Nations then transformed to
the United Nations

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:53.580
and created the Country of Israel, which pushed
Britain out of that region in 1948

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.090
along with France and Russia.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.690
Daniel 7:25 says the Little Horn will change
the Times and the Laws

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.690
and have the Saints in its hand for a time,
times, and half a time.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.950
This can refer to 3.5 years, but it can also
refer to 70 years.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:16.370
One Time being 20 years, Times being 40, and
half a Time being 10 years.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:24.240
If this is true, then this time period may
refer to the 70 year period beginning in 1947/48,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:31.540
but it may also refer to the final 3.5 years;
the final Time of Trouble after the Asteroid Impact.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.940
Daniel 8:8,9 say the Little Horn will come
out of the Four Horns of the Goat.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.159
The Four Horns of the Goat are the Four Heads
of the Leopard:

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:44.880
The fourth being the Turkish Empire, which
was taken over in the middle east

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.539
by three Kings at its end

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:52.510
and then those three were pushed out when
the United Nations created Israel.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:57.570
Daniel 8:11 tells us the Daily will taken
Away by the Little Horn.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.669
This connects to Daniel 12:11,12.

00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:07.850
The Abomination of Desolation was placed in
685 CE according to both Daniel 11 and 12.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.460
However, there was another fulfillment of
those scriptures in 2012.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:18.230
The key in understanding this one is in the
actual definitions of the words themselves.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:24.600
The word translated as Daily, number 8548,
also means Continual Employment.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.670
Employment that is continual would be called
a Job or Position in our modern society.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:36.130
The word translated as Taken Away, number
5493, also means depose

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.060
which means to Take an Oath.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.580
So it is saying that from the time the Position
shall be Taken Oath

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.920
until the Abomination of Desolation is set
up shall be 1290 days.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.040
This was fulfilled from the day the man called Messiah took the Oath of Office to the placement of his steel beam in the One World Trade Center.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.980
This was a secondary fulfillment of Daniel
12,

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:03.600
but this fulfillment gave us a very important
clue about Daniel 8:11

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.440
which says that the Daily will be Taken Away
by the Little Horn.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.470
Now that we know the end-time Daily is the
Position of the President of the United States

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:18.920
and the deposing of that Daily is the Taking
of the Oath of the President of the United States,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.460
then this verse is telling us that By the
Little Horn the Presidency of the United States

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.650
will be taken Oath.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.660
Since the Little Horn is the Horn of the United
Nations

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.770
then it seems clear that Daniel 8:11 is telling
us the United Nations

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:39.030
has usurped the Presidency of the United States.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.680
Not only is the UN headquarters in the United
States,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.200
but it is also seems to be running the country
at this point,

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.860
which it was able to achieve by the use of
its Little Horn; Israel.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.760
Verse 12 adds to that: A Host, in other words,
an Army will be given to him

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.090
by reason of transgression.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.780
This has already proven true: Not only is
the United States

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.580
providing Israel an Army with weapons

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.300
but the United Nations has an army in the
USA!

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.380
That is what this is saying!

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:18.940
This army, however, does not come into its
full force until after the asteroid hits.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:26.630
This is explained in the next part of Daniel
8:13,14 which talks about the 2300 Days.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:32.100
It says concerning the Daily, in other words,
concerning the Position of the Presidency,

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.580
the sanctuary will be trodden down for 2300
Days

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:41.740
which is also translated as 2300 Evenings
and Mornings.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:47.550
The word translated as Sanctuary, number 6944,
means Hallowed Things.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:53.490
So the Hallowed Things, it says, will be trodden
down for 2300 evenings and mornings.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:59.690
Those 2300 evenings and mornings correspond
to 1150 complete days

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.140
which is roughly 3 years.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.510
So the 2300 days of the trodding down of the
Hallowed Things in the United States

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:13.730
will last roughly 3 years and that corresponds
to the final Time of Trouble.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.850
This connects back to the location of the
asteroid impact.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:24.780
The Seat of the Beast will be in darkness
it says in Revelation 16:10.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.880
The Beast is the United Nations and its Seat,
or Headquarters, is in New York City.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.350
Therefore, this is telling us that New York
City will be dark

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.400
during the pouring out of the fifth vial.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.670
The 7 vials or plagues occur simultaneously
with the 7 Trumpets:

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.090
in not only one day, but in one hour!

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.460
As explained in Revelation 18:8-10.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.280
It refers to the asteroid impact.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:58.640
So it appears the prophecy is telling us the
asteroid(s) will hit not only the Atlantic Ocean

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.200
but also somewhere in the United States,

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.280
and afterward, the United Nations will take
over for 3.5 years.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.460
So both the Beast and the Little Horn; YHWH
and Israel,

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.140
are literally being worshipped throughout
the world right now!

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.080
In addition to YHWH, many are also worshipping
the United Nations,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:24.360
but the prophecy tells us they are one and
the same entity; the Beast.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.880
The Little Horn is what many call the antichrist,

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.370
but the Little Horn is not a man, it is a
King, which Daniel tells us is a Country.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:37.300
So Number 10 has been fulfilled.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.850
The Beast created the Little Horn 70 years
ago.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:46.860
For more on this click on the link here or
the playlist at the end of this video.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:52.560
Number 11: Revelation 6-8 describe seven seals
that will be broken,

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.290
and the final seal obviously describes the
final event,

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.760
which is a star that falls from heaven.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.840
In short, the first seal was broken in 312
CE

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.040
when Constantine began conquering using the
symbol of the cross.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.910
This event is memorialized in the Vatican
Temple itself,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.070
with Constantine displayed on a White Horse.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.100
That was the beginning of the religious empire
that still reigns today

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.180
as Babylon the Great.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.360
Seal 2 was broken in 1914 with World Wars
1 and 2;

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.640
the Red Horse of War.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.930
Seal 3; the Black Horse; Financial Collapse,

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:35.270
was broken in 1929 at the Worldwide Great
Depression,

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:43.570
and Seal 4; the Pale Horse; Death in one fourth
of the Earth, started in 1948

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.600
when war broke out in the middle east because
of the occupation of the Little Horn

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:54.140
and also when disease and starvation started
to ravage Africa.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.320
Seals 5, 6, and 7 occur in close proximity
to each other.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.520
Seal 5 is the Multitude standing in heaven
in White Robes resting.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.330
This is the escape of the Bride that occurs
at the end of the 1260 years

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.110
and at the start of the final three and a
half years.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.470
It occurs at the asteroid.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:19.080
And Seal 6 and 7: The Wrath, and the Hail,
when the Sun and Moon go dark,

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.990
will be broken at the Asteroid Impact as well,
and last for 3.5 years

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.610
during the final time of trouble.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.610
So Number 11 has been fulfilled:

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.730
Seals 1-4 have already been broken

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:40.650
and Seals 5-7 will be broken at the Escape
(Rapture) when the Asteroid hits.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:44.430
Number 12: In Daniel 12 it talks about the
Tribulation

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.880
and it says in verse 7 that: …when he shall
have accomplished

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.580
to scatter the power of the Holy People, all
these things shall be finished.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:58.100
The word translated as Power is 3027 which
also means Strength.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:04.620
The word translated as Holy is 6944 which
also means Set Apartness.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:09.790
So its saying that someone will scatter the
Strength of the Set Apart People.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.160
It doesn’t clarify who exactly the Set Apart
People are in this verse,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.480
but Jesus said in Matthew 25:31-33 that when
the Son of Man comes

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.200
the nations will be separated into two groups
represented as Sheep and Goats.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.130
These Two Groups are also represented as the
Blessed and the Woe’d

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:34.000
partially explained in Luke 6:20-26,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
and notice verse 22 says that the Blessed
will be separated

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.650
from the company of some people.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:45.520
The Blessed represent the Sheep, so this means
the Sheep will be separated

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.910
from the company of the Goats.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:54.540
These Two Groups are also represented as Wheat
and Tares in Matthew 13:24-30,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.100
and verse 30 clarifies when the separation
will occur:

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.240
It says in the time of Harvest

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.330
the Tares will first be bound together in
bundles in order to be burned.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.370
They are not burned first.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.960
They are bound together in bundles first.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.850
The burning is the asteroid impact.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.490
It is the final Time of Trouble.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.900
The Tares go through that time of trouble

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.920
because they do not escape.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.880
Luke 17:29-37 explains this.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.240
It says in the day the Son of Man is revealed,
when it rains Fire and Brimstone from heaven,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.090
in that day or night, depending where one
is at that time, one will be taken and the

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.520
other left.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.790
The ones taken are the Blessed.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.020
This is clear in Revelation 8.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.620
The three Woes occur during the seventh seal
when the Seven Trumpets sound.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:50.370
In other videos we looked at how we know the
Seven Trumpets sound simultaneously;

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.920
They sound at the falling of the asteroid,

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.470
and in verse 13 it says “…woe, woe, woe
to the inhabiters of the Earth…”

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:03.810
The three Woes represent the three years of
darkness that the Tares go through.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:09.020
Revelation 9:1-12 explains that the first
Woe is the asteroid impact.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.730
Revelation 12:12 also confirms that those
in heaven will be rejoicing

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.670
and the Woe’d will be on the Earth when
the Dragon is on the Earth.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:22.570
The Revelation 12 timeline is explained in
more detail in the link here or at the end

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.570
of this video,

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:29.670
but in short, the Dragon fell to earth between
1945 - 1947

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.860
and that is when the Short Time began.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.440
The Woman in verse 14 is the Multitude that
is being persecuted now.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.260
They are the ones that will fly to safety
when the asteroid hits.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.900
At that point, those left behind will be hunted
by the Dragon.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.950
That is why Revelation 12 says Woe to them.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.290
They are the Woe’d.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.020
In other words, they are the Tares.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.040
Revelation 12 confirms they are the Remnant
who have the Testimony,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.240
which Revelation 11 confirms are the Two Witnesses;
the Christians and Jews.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.310
Not all, but most, as stated by Jesus in Matthew
22:1-14.

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:14.150
The Wheat escape at the asteroid and the Tares
are left behind.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:20.080
So in Matthew 13:30 where it says the Tares
will be gathered first and bound in bundles

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.580
it is talking about a time period prior to
the asteroid because

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.550
the burning is the asteroid impact.

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:33.200
That is explained in Daniel 2:34,35 and 7:8-11, Revelation 8:8-12, and 18.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:39.860
The Stone will break the Feet and the Burning
Flame will destroy the Final Beast.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:45.520
This is the Burning Stone which is a Burning
Star that will fall from heaven.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.550
The asteroid impact will burn the Beast and
those who worship the Beast.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.170
However, Revelation 13:4,5 tell us that

00:44:54.170 --> 00:45:00.640
the Beast is given 42 months to continue before
it is completely destroyed.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.310
That is the final 3.5 years.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:09.130
So the burning of the Tares is the burning
of Babylon the Great at the asteroid impact

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.490
and the final 3.5 year period where they will
be hunted

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.790
by the Dragon and the Beast.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:20.060
But prior to the asteroid, the Tares are being
bound together in bundles

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:24.350
and they are separating the Wheat from their
company.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:28.610
So it is the Wheat that are separated right
now.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:35.120
They are the Set Apart People who are scattered
in Daniel 12:7.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.000
They are Set Apart

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.160
Because they are not bound together in bundles.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:47.220
They are the Woman in Revelation 12:14 who
is being persecuted now.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:53.140
They are the Multitude of All Tribes and Nations
that will escape at the asteroid impact.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.900
Number 12 has been fulfilled.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.460
The strength of the Wheat has already been
scattered.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:05.260
There are people all over the world going
through the persecution and separation right now.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.400
It is not one nation or country that goes
through this.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:15.280
Revelation 7:9 says it is a multitude of all
nations and languages.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:21.280
It is people all over the world, scattered
among the Tares.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.520
So, hopefully, you can see that all 12 of
these points have been fulfilled.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.900
The only event left for the Multitude is the
Escape,

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:37.190
and for the Remnant it is the Asteroid and
subsequent 3.5 Years of Darkness.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:41.420
