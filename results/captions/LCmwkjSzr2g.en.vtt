00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.369
MS. WINFREY: Hi, everybody!

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.473
(applause)

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:09.676
We are here for the
United State of Women!

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.677
(applause)

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:18.118
Mrs. Obama: Now, I know you
all have had a busy, packed,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.987
full day -- very
inspiring, right?

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.055
(applause)

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.158
And hopefully, our
conversation will live up to

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.694
the hype.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.563
But before we begin, of
course, I want to take a

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:38.505
moment to just acknowledge
what has happened in Orlando

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.775
-- that even as we gather
here today and we talk about

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.912
the challenges that women
face, we have to remember

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:50.417
those that we lost in
Orlando, as well as those

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.920
who were injured, and all of
their loves ones, and know

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.589
that we will all continue to
keep them in our thoughts

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.258
and prayers.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.460
But the one thing I just
want us all to know -- that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.397
in tragic times like these,
in this country, it's time

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:08.435
for us to come together, to
love each other, to support

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.137
each other and not
tear each other down.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.173
(applause)

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:17.644
So I hope that that is one
of the many takeaways that

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.746
we move forward with.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:25.718
And I just love you all for
the work -- the amazing work

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:29.556
you all have done today and
that you do every single day.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.691
So I'm going to turn
it over to Oprah.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.826
MS. WINFREY: Hello.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.694
Mrs. Obama: We have
Oprah Winfrey here.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.198
(applause)

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:46.339
MS. WINFREY: And our First
Lady of the United States.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.873
(applause)

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.807
Mrs. Obama: Of America.

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.676
MS. WINFREY: Of America,
not just of women, yes.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.778
(laughter)

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.582
So I think that the fact
that -- I've been watching

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.785
this being streamed all day,
and the fact that there are

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:03.256
men here, women here of
all ages -- young women,

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:08.628
maturing women -- and all
walks of life is a move in

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.897
the right direction,
would you not say?

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.632
Mrs. Obama: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.101
I'm just proud of all the
work that's been done here.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.102
So I agree.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:20.740
MS. WINFREY: Well, I wanted
to start with the issue of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.476
self-value and self-worth.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:27.247
Because over the years, I've
interviewed thousands of

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:32.218
people, most of them women,
and I would say that the

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.122
root of every dysfunction
I've ever encountered, every

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:41.427
problem has been some sense
of a lacking of self-value

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.531
or of self-worth.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:48.401
And I know that we all know
that we live in a world

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:53.206
where you are constantly
being bombarded by images

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:57.877
that encourage you to
be liked, literally.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.879
And it's a lot
to live up to.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.617
And I wonder, particularly
you, who have had to face

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:12.325
this as your own woman and
as a candidate's wife, the

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.595
pressure of other people's
expectations -- and what can

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:19.966
you share with our audience
here and online that would

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:25.572
help us stand more inside
ourselves and own that space?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.574
Mrs. Obama: Very
good question.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.611
Well, one of the things
that I always -- I tell my

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:35.214
mentees, I tell my daughters
is that our first job in

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:39.619
life as women, I think, is
to get to know ourselves.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.656
And I think a lot of
times we don't do that.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:47.560
We spend our time pleasing,
satisfying, looking out into

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.331
the world to define who we
are -- listening to the

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.367
messages, the images, the
limited definitions that

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.235
people have of who we are.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:59.505
And that's true for
women of color for sure.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.742
There is a limited box that
we are put in, and if we

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:08.615
live by that limited
definition we miss out on a

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.616
lot of who we are.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:14.153
But it takes taking the time
to know who you are to be

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:19.926
able to deal with the
onslaught of negative

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.428
messages that
you're bound to get.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:27.100
So for me, I came into this
with a pretty clear

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.102
sense of myself.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.104
And some of that
comes with age.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.106
Some of that comes
with experience.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.308
Some of that comes from
being fortunate enough to

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.545
have been raised by a loving
mother, strong, focused, and

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.048
a father who
loved me dearly.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:47.320
So I fortunately came into
this situation with a really

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.455
clear sense of who I was.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:54.127
So when you hear the
smack-talking from outside

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.864
the world, it's easy to
sort of brush that off.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.866
Because I know who I am.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.035
(applause)

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:05.471
MS. WINFREY: But when yo
came in, there were the

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:10.877
world's expectations, there
were other expectations.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.478
What did you really expect?

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.915
Mrs. Obama: It'
interesting, I really tried

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.086
not to limit myself
by expectations.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.255
MS. WINFREY: Because nobody
grows up thinking "I'm going

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.256
to be a First Lady."

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.324
Mrs. Obama: Absolutely not.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:26.693
And as you all know, when
Barack was talking about

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.362
running, I was
like, are you crazy?

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.664
I mean, would you just,
like, chill out and do

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.466
something else
with your life?

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.434
(laughter)

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:36.836
So I was working hard to try
to get him to do the other

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.738
thing, so --
whatever that was.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.374
So, yeah, absolutely, it
wasn't something that I

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.343
could have planned for,
could have expected from myself.

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.679
But one of the things I knew
-- because people asked all

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.315
throughout the campaign what
are your issues going to be,

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.617
what are you going to be
like as First Lady, and I

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:55.288
said, I have to wait until I
get there to figure out what

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.356
that's going to
feel like for me.

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:03.096
I specifically did not read
other First Ladies' books,

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.566
because I didn't want to
be influenced by how they

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.101
defined the role.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.837
I knew that I would have
to find this role --

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:12.405
(applause)

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.674
-- very uniquely and
specifically to me and

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.275
who I was.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:21.247
So I came in thinking about
who I wanted to be in this

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:26.285
position and who I needed to
be for my girls, first of all.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:29.722
So you remember, Malia
and Sasha were little

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.824
itty-bitties when
we came into office.

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:35.528
I mean, it still moves me
to tears to think about the

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:38.231
first day I put them in
the car with their Secret

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.567
Service agents to go to
their first day of school.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.837
And I saw them leaving and I
thought, what on Earth am I

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.539
doing to these babies?

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.309
So I knew right then and
there my first job was to

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.247
make sure they were going
to be whole and normal and

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.216
cared for in the midst
of all this craziness.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.384
(applause)

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:02.421
And then I started to
understand that if I was

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.258
going to protect them, I
had to, number one, protect

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.194
myself and protect my time.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:11.364
So I knew going into this
role that I didn't want to

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:14.000
waste any time; that any
time I spent away from my

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.904
kids -- and I actually took
this on even before I became

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:20.373
First Lady, even as a
lawyer, as a vice president

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.541
at a hospital.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.477
One of the things I realized
is that if you do not take

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.246
control over your time and
your life, other people will

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.681
gobble it up.

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:32.118
If you don't prioritize
yourself, you constantly

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.054
start falling lower and
lower on your list, your

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:37.056
kids fall lower and
lower on your list.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.493
MS. WINFREY: So by the time
you got here you knew how to

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:41.060
do that.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.861
Mrs. Obama: I knew
how to do that.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.362
MS. WINFREY: I think that's
one of the number-one issues

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.299
with women.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.301
I never, in all my years
of interviewing, have ever

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.336
heard a man say, you know, I
just don't have the time, I

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.638
just don't, I don't
find a way to balance.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:53.873
Mrs. Obama: You know why?

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.474
Because they don't have
to balance anything.

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.609
Sorry.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:57.844
(laughter and applause)

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:01.380
And I hope that that is
changing, but so many men

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.648
don't have to do it all.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:05.117
MS. WINFREY: So how
did you figure it out?

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.119
I've read the story -- I'm
sure many of you have heard

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.857
the story of early on,
you were going to a job

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.059
interview and you took Sasha
with you to interview.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.060
Mrs. Obama: Oh, yeah.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.962
MS. WINFREY: We never heard,
did you get that job?

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:16.796
Mrs. Obama: I did.

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:17.463
I did.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:18.097
MS. WINFREY: Okay.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.332
Mrs. Obama: I was the vice
president of community

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.435
outreach for the University
of Chicago Hospital.

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.102
(applause)

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:28.708
And I got that job because
I didn't compromise.

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.978
Because before getting --
working at that job, I was

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.479
working as an
associate dean.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.048
I had had Malia,
Barack was in the U.S.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:40.786
Senate, so I was basically
mothering part time on my

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.155
own, having -- I
had a full-time job.

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:47.326
So I tried part time -- I've
talked about this before --

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:49.595
I tried part time because I
thought, I have to figure

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:51.864
this out, I have to be able
to pick the kids up, I've

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.065
got to be able
to do all this.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.767
So I tried part time.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.169
So the only thing I found
out from part time was that

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.738
you just get paid part time.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:01.040
(applause)

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.408
Because I was still
doing a full-time job --

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:03.643
MS. WINFREY:
Everything, yeah.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.544
Mrs. Obama: -- I was just
cramming it all into the few

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:08.648
hours that I was there
and driving myself crazy.

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.417
So I had vowed that if I
continued to work, that I

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:13.419
would never settle
for part time.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:16.822
I knew what my time
and energy was worth.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.325
So when I went into that --
the president's office to

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.395
interview for that job, I
thought, I have a little

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.965
baby, I don't have
babysitting, so here we go,

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.468
we're all going to go in to
see the president because

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.171
this is who I am.

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:33.005
(laughter)

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.875
And I said, and if I take
this job, I need flexibility

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.210
and I need full pay.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.214
So if you want me to leave
my baby and my kids, then

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:44.550
you're going to have to pay
me, because I'm going to do

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.752
the job -- that was
never a question.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.088
I could deliver.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:52.725
But I knew then I wasn't
going to sell myself short.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.828
And I had the leverage,
at the time, to make

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:56.829
that decision.

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.831
MS. WINFREY: Well, that
comes from a sense of -- and

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.833
you said you arrived here
knowing who you were.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.369
I think that is the journey.

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:04.937
That is the journey.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:09.642
And there is a question
from FarmFreshGal.

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.444
Mrs. Obama: FarmFreshGal.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.212
MS. WINFREY: She must
have her own garden.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.013
Mrs. Obama: I hope.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.183
MS. WINFREY:
Like we do, yes.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:18.684
And FarmFreshGal says,
"As a woman leader in the

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:23.756
corporate world, I feel like
I have to be brave a lot,"

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.192
-- and what you just
described was brave -- "any

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:28.561
advice or tips on bravery?"

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:32.198
Mrs. Obama: That's
a good question.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.065
Gosh, I don't know.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:36.535
If I ever -- I don't
ever view it as bravery.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:38.004
MS. WINFREY: You didn't
think that was brave?

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:40.406
Saying, look, I'm going
to be paid full time?

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:41.107
Mrs. Obama: Right.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.375
MS. WINFREY: I
think that's brave.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.710
Mrs. Obama: I just viewed it
as I'm not going to be taken

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.312
advantage of.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.213
(applause)

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.749
I am just not going to
keep selling myself --

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:52.284
MS. WINFREY: You
knew your value.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:53.252
Mrs. Obama: Value.

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:53.953
That's absolutely right.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:54.954
MS. WINFREY: You
knew your value.

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:59.125
I was just saying that
to a friend recently.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.127
Mrs. Obama: And that goes
back to knowing who you are.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:03.462
And I think as women and
young girls, we have to

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:06.932
invest that time in getting
to understand who we are and

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:08.601
liking who we are.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:09.301
(applause)

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.269
Because I like me.

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.538
I've liked me for
a very long time.

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:13.506
(applause)

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.475
So for a long time I've had
a very good relationship

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:17.476
with myself.

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:18.477
MS. WINFREY: I know.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.514
Mrs. Obama: And we like --
we all like ourselves in here.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:24.050
But you've got to work
to get to that place.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.685
And if you're going out into
the world as a professional

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.687
and you don't know who you
are, you don't know what you

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:31.323
want, you don't know how
much you're worth, then you

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:33.025
have to be brave.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:37.530
And then you have to count
on the kindness and goodness

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.866
of others to bestow that
goodness on you when you

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.903
should be working to
get it on your own.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:44.904
Because you deserve it.

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.906
MS. WINFREY: Because you
know your own value.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.874
Mrs. Obama: Know
your own value.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:49.875
Absolutely.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:50.876
MS. WINFREY: Okay.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.878
So when you're saying "I
know who I am" -- and I'm

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.880
telling you, it's the
thread that runs

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.881
through everything.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.883
It's the thing that allows
you to stand in your own truth.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:01.087
And one of the things for
years that Maya Angelou used

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:04.557
to say to me, is "Baby, you
need to know that you are

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:08.594
alone are enough.

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:09.428
You alone are enough."

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.497
(applause)

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.399
So how do we get there?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.400
You were there.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.402
You've loved
yourself a long time.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.703
What is that process?

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.806
Mrs. Obama: I think it's
different for everyone.

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.943
And I can't say that I've
loved myself for a long

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.945
time, but there was a
journey to get there.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:32.084
And some of it starts as
a young girl -- when you

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:35.087
confront your first bully,
the first time somebody

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:38.057
calls you out -- your
name, as we would say.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:41.260
The first disappointments
and failures that you have,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.495
how do you deal with that?

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.397
What supports systems do
you set up for yourself?

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:49.635
I always tell young girls,
surround yourself with goodness.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:54.106
I learned early on how to
get the haters out of my life.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:54.773
(applause)

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:57.176
You've got to just sort
of surround yourself with

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:01.313
people who uplift
you, who hold you up.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:04.683
And for whatever reason --
well, I was lucky I had

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:07.453
people like -- I had
parents who held me up.

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.221
I had a father
that valued me.

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.923
MS. WINFREY: I think people
who have good parents are --

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.425
they come into the world
with a strength, yes, and

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.426
an advantage.

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.428
Mrs. Obama: And that
was an advantage.

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.497
But if you don't have that
parent -- that mother, that

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:20.499
father -- then you've
got to find it.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.501
You've got to
find those people.

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:23.502
Because they're out there.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.738
I tell my mentees all of --
there is somebody out there

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:29.542
who loves you and who is
waiting to love you, and you

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:30.543
just have to find them.

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.545
And that means you have
to make room for them.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:35.114
And if you're surrounded by
a bunch of low-life folks

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:38.884
who aren't supporting you,
then there is no room for

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.519
the people who do love you.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.153
(applause)

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:45.457
MS. WINFREY: You mentioned
a moment ago "the haters."

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.928
How do you handle the
haters, particularly in this

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:52.064
office, where haters have
to be handled politically

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:53.933
correctly and
with discretion?

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:54.934
(laughter)

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:58.304
And I know so many people
are faced with it -- we know

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:01.674
this about social media --
people say just the meanest

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.810
things, and you're faced in
your life with people who

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.112
can tear you down a lot --
the haters, hateration.

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:09.582
Mrs. Obama: Well, when it
comes to social media --

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:12.651
there are just times I turn
off the world, you know.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.987
There are just some times
you have to give yourself

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:17.823
space to be quiet, which
means you've got to set

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:18.857
those phones down.

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:20.859
You can't be reading
all that stuff.

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.495
I mean, that's like letting
somebody just walk up and

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:24.964
slap you, you know?

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.498
(laughter)

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.199
You would never do that.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.834
You would never just sit
there and go, slap me in the

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:35.741
face and I'm good with it.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.742
No.

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:38.744
So why would you open
yourself up to that?

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:39.745
So that's one thing.

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.714
With social media and --
I don't read that stuff.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.716
I learned that early
in the campaign.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.718
I couldn't keep reading
stuff about my husband and

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.720
what people thought and --
because I knew who he was.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.722
I knew what was going on
in our home, in our lives.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.724
So I didn't need to read
about it from somebody else.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.960
But the other thing that I
have found, particularly in

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.964
this job, that it's --
people won't remember what

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.800
other people say about you,
but they will remember what

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.901
you do.

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:07.306
So my strategy -- and I've
always been like this.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.575
When a teacher would come
and tell me that I couldn't

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:13.646
do something, I would get so
much satisfaction proving

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:14.647
them wrong.

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.983
I'd be like, okay, all
right, oh, you don't think

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:20.019
I'm going to do X, Y and Z,
well I'm going to be the

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.355
best X, Y, Z
you can imagine.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:27.660
So when it came to this
role, I just said, you know,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.529
let me just be First Lady.

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:37.303
Let me wake up every day and
work hard to do something of

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:41.240
value, and to do it well,
and to do something

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.777
consequential, and to do
something that I care about.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.013
And then let that
speak for itself.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:51.483
And that would shut up the
haters, because I would have

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:55.988
a whole portfolio of stuff
that defined me because it's

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.357
what I did, not
what you called me.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:15:59.224
(applause)

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.694
So the best revenge
is success --

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.796
MS. WINFREY: Is
success, yes.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.164
Mrs. Obama: --
and good work.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:07.700
You don't have to say
anything to the haters.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.135
You don't have to
acknowledge them at all.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.238
You just wake up every
morning and be the best you

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:14.239
you can be.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.674
And that tends
to shut them up.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:19.445
MS. WINFREY: You know, I've
always thought too, that the

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:23.549
best success comes when you
can actually shift your

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.517
paradigm to service.

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:31.423
And obviously, you are in a
position of public service.

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:36.128
Was it a conscious,
intentional decision to sort

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:42.434
of sit still, be with this
place, and then allow your

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:47.373
passion to fuel your
interest, allow your passion

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:50.008
to lead you to all the
things you've been able to

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:54.046
do with international girls'
education, with health

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:55.047
and wellness?

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:58.150
Was that a conscious,
intentional decision?

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.352
Mrs. Obama: Absolutely.

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:02.955
Because in this --
particularly when you're in

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:06.225
public service, you're First
Lady, the President and

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:10.929
you're interacting with the
world, people can

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:13.966
smell inauthenticity.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:19.138
They know when you are not
what you appear to be.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.073
And that was always
something that I said in

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.809
this role that -- I want
people to know me, know

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:29.314
Michelle, Michelle Robinson
Obama, not the First Lady.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:32.584
In every interaction I have
had with anybody who's had

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:34.753
some connection with
me, I have tried to be

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:37.423
authentically myself.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.225
And in order to do that, I
learned that I have to do

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.928
things that I
authentically care about.

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:46.865
Because if I fundamentally,
deep down have a belief in

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:50.035
the cause, and I -- it moves
me, then I'm going to be

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:51.103
excited about it.

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:54.807
That excitement is going to
be conveyed to the people

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.074
that I'm trying to reach.

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.610
It's not going to
be a heavy lift.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.846
That's why people say, how
can you speak in front of

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:02.815
all these people and
do this every day?

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:06.084
Look, I get energy
from people.

00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:09.521
And not everybody in
politics, in public service

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.522
are people-people.

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:17.362
Barack and I really do -- we
are energized by the people

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:21.333
we meet, by the military
spouses that I meet out there.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:24.903
I picked working with
military families because

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:25.904
they moved me.

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:28.740
I met them out on the
campaign trail and I didn't

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.077
know that there were
millions of military

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:35.647
families out there serving
and sacrificing in ways that

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.649
we take for granted
in this country.

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.452
And I vowed then and there,
just from meeting them, that

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:43.555
if I got to be First Lady I
would try to be that voice

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:46.492
for them, I would try to
shine that light on them.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.493
(applause)

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:50.829
So that came out of a direct
passion for who those people

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.831
were and what I
learned about them.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.533
MS. WINFREY: And I remember
when you all first arrived

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:58.203
at the White House, you said
to the country that this is

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:01.473
your house, and we're going
to open this up as your house.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:05.043
And so when I saw all those
Girl Scouts out on the lawn,

00:19:05.043 --> 00:19:07.946
I went, you all really
did open up the house.

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:08.814
(laughter)

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:09.915
Mrs. Obama: Yes, yes.

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:14.453
That's been some of the most
fulfilling things we've been

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.155
able to do in
the White House.

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:21.760
It's really bringing people
here who would never, ever

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.365
get to set foot on that lawn
and walk into those doors.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.366
(applause)

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.868
I tell my mentees all the
time -- you know, one of the

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.204
things I want them to take
away when they come --

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.273
because they come regularly;
they come at least once a

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:37.109
month and we sit down and we
talk, and they have seminars

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.078
-- and I want them all to
know you walk into the White

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:43.315
House every day, and you
walk up to the First Lady of

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.517
the United States and say,
"Hey, Michelle, what's

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:46.518
going on?"

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.855
And if you can do that,
you can do anything.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.658
If you can exist in this
space at this time in

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:53.425
this moment --

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:54.426
(applause)

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.260
MS. WINFREY: Yes.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.663
Mrs. Obama: And there is no
class that you can't handle.

00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:00.799
There's no school whose
rejection will make you fold

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.034
or make you crumble.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.569
You've been here.

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:06.838
And I've watched so many
kids come through those

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:12.044
gates and really be in that
space -- picking tomatoes

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.581
with me in the garden,
getting to sit in and have

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.584
tastings at the state
dinner, being invited to

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:19.685
watch Hamilton.

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:23.155
I mean, just watching their
eyes just experiencing

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:25.357
things that really only
the privileged get to

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.760
experience, but having it be
kids and people who would

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.730
never believe they would
set foot in that house.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.732
MS. WINFREY: You see
them get empowered --

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:34.733
Mrs. Obama: Oh, gosh, yeah.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.735
MS. WINFREY: -- and
transformed in the process.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.704
Mrs. Obama: So many kids,
you think their world view

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:39.805
will never be the same.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.141
And that's the least we can
do as President and First Lady.

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.811
I think that's the
obligation of anyone who

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.379
lives in that house.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.881
(applause)

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:54.286
MS. WINFREY: How do you feel
-- I always feel that until

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:57.923
you take your last breath
you're always growing, and

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.525
that every experience that
you encounter in your life

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:03.528
-- just all of you being
together here today and

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:07.165
being in a room with people
who are like-minded, who

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:10.802
share the same vision -- all
of that is so stimulating.

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:13.572
You leave here and you feel
like you can be better and

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:14.573
do better.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:18.877
What has the experience --
or how has the experience of

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:26.084
being First Lady
actually grown you?

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:26.551
Mrs. Obama: Wow.

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.220
So many ways.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.156
I mean, first of all, there
is absolutely nothing I

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.791
can't do, right?

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.493
(applause)

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.093
MS. WINFREY: Because
you walk in that --

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.728
Mrs. Obama: That's
right, that's right.

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:37.462
MS. WINFREY: You live
in the White House.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:40.065
Mrs. Obama: We've been to
the mountain top, and it was

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.133
a hard climb but we made it.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:41.833
(laughter)

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:42.534
We made it!

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:48.273
(applause)

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.375
So you just -- again, you
begin to understand how much

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:56.948
you can tolerate, how much
growth you can have, how

00:21:56.948 --> 00:22:00.752
much potential there is, how
much opportunity there is to

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:04.890
help people, how
fulfilling it is.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.559
I mean, that's been the
thing that I've learned, that

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:08.260
MS. WINFREY:
Fulfilling in it.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.763
Mrs. Obama: Oh, it feels --
public service -- I left the

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:15.801
practice of law to go into
public service for

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:17.436
selfish reasons.

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:21.139
I wanted to be happy and
feel good every single day.

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:25.077
I wanted to wake up inspired
and ready to do something

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.411
greater than myself.

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:32.517
And that's what service and
giving and -- that's what

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:36.388
this room means to so many.

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:39.057
And I just want to make sure
that when people leave here

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:42.127
they don't go back into
their isolation; that they

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.596
don't go back to their
phones, looking down.

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:47.332
Because this relationship
isn't enough.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:50.469
You need to have people
in your lives that you're

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.204
connecting with,
that you're helping.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.073
I mean, there is nothing
that makes me feel better

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:58.977
than knowing that I helped
to change somebody's life --

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:02.013
Oprah, you know this
more than anyone else.

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:04.149
And if you're doing that
every single day, the

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:09.020
haters, the doubters -- none
of that matters, because you

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.357
are getting so much by the
-- from the work that

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.191
you're doing.

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:15.360
MS. WINFREY: Well, you know,
I figured this out -- early

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.030
on in the show I had read
this quote from Dr. King,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.734
one of my favorite quotes
from him, that says, "Not

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:27.339
everybody can be famous,
but everybody can be great,

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:30.842
because greatness is
determined by service."

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:34.746
And I literally shifted -- I
used that quote to help me

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:38.550
shift the way I saw the
platform of television.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.520
Instead of like, oh, I'm
going to -- I'm on TV, how

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.424
do I use that platform as a
platform of service, is what

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:46.892
I did.

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:47.492
Mrs. Obama: Amen.

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.126
MS. WINFREY: Yeah.

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:48.860
Mrs. Obama: Yeah, we know.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.761
And you did that
pretty well too.

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:55.567
(laughter and applause)

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:58.603
MS. WINFREY: But when yo
think about growing and

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:02.874
being empowered yourself, it
is what you've been able to

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:07.145
do for other people that
leaves you the fullest.

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:08.547
Mrs. Obama: Yes, absolutely.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:10.415
That is really the thing.

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:14.119
So I don't know, I don't
sort of -- my growth

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.054
is incidental.

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:21.626
It's the lucky gift
I get for giving.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:26.164
And, like you said,
I'm still growing.

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.632
We are all still growing.

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:30.368
I used to tell some of the
young people I worked with

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:33.638
way back in Chicago days
that I used to hate the

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.473
question "What do you want
to be when you grow up?"

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:39.311
because it assumes that at
some point you stop becoming

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.379
and you just are something.

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:44.516
And that would be a sad
thing to think that this is it.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:47.652
And that's one of the things
I've learned -- that there

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:52.290
are so many phases to life
that this is just -- even as

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.093
big as being First Lady and
living in the White House

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:58.563
has been, this is still just
a portion of a very bigger

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:01.566
journey that I have yet
to know the outcome.

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:03.969
And I won't know it
until I'm laying down.

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:06.004
It's just ever-evolving.

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.005
(applause)

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:10.475
And I think that reality --
this experience has helped

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:11.509
me to see that.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:12.811
These are just phases.

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:15.347
And this has been a very
interesting phase, and a

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:18.583
very impactful phase, but
there's more to come.

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:20.585
MS. WINFREY: I love you
saying that -- I'm

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.720
not through.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.320
Mrs. Obama: We
ain't through!

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:22.954
(laughter)

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:23.788
MS. WINFREY: We
aren't through!

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:24.456
(applause)

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:27.859
Okay, so, yes, I
believe in service.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:28.860
I believe in helping people.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.329
I want people to feel
fulfilled and empowered in

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:32.330
their life.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.301
But still, somedays I think
it's just cool to be me.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.802
(laughter)

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:39.738
Mrs. Obama: And I think that
too -- some days it's just

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:41.139
cool to be Oprah.

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:43.775
(laughter)

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:47.212
MS. WINFREY: So I want t
know, what are those days

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:49.681
when you just say,
mmm, mmm, mmm --

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.716
(laughter)

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.885
-- look at me in
the White House.

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:56.521
(laughter)

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:57.122
Mrs. Obama: There are so --
yeah, just sitting up here,

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:57.589
mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.090
(laughter)

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.029
There are a lot
of those moments.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:07.465
Prince and Stevie Wonder
singing in the East Room,

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.601
just -- may he
rest in peace.

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:13.004
I mean, those rare gifts of
entertainment, the kind of

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:16.141
music we have been able to
bring into the White House.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:21.579
Sitting with the Pope,
watching my mother and my

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.315
daughters talk to the Pope.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.382
That's like a --

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:25.583
MS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.985
Mrs. Obama: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:31.122
(laughter)

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.525
Dinner with the Queen of
England, just like, mmm,

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:34.693
mmm, mmm.

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:35.627
(laughter)

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:36.761
MS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:39.097
Mrs. Obama: You know, you
try to play these moments

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:41.733
off, like oh, yes, yes, I
know what I'm doing -- and

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.302
inside you're going,
mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:46.171
MS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.639
Mrs. Obama: Good lord.

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:51.142
Watching my husband walk off
of Marine One and go to the

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.611
Oval Office, it's
like, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:54.512
(laughter and applause)

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:55.413
MS. WINFREY: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:26:55.413 --> 00:27:01.353
(laughter)

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.655
Mrs. Obama: And you kno
he's got that walk, right?

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:04.222
MS. WINFREY: I know!

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:06.491
(laughter)

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:07.559
Mrs. Obama: Like,
mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.160
MS. WINFREY: He's
got the swag.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.363
(laughter)

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.164
Did he always
have that swag?

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.866
Or has he gotten swaggier?

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:20.405
Mrs. Obama: No, he
was very swagalicious.

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:21.406
(laughter)

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.541
Look, I told people this
from the very start, when I

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:26.778
-- started running -- Barack
Obama is exactly who he

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:27.779
says he is.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:28.780
We both are.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.782
That's what I've been
trying to tell people.

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:31.783
Ain't no surprises.

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:33.818
We're telling you who we
are, and no tricks up

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:34.819
our sleeves.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:35.820
We're regular folks.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.888
We care about people.

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:37.956
We care about family.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.290
We want to do well.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.493
We want to make
our country proud.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.095
We don't want to waste our
talents just making money

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:45.964
for ourselves.

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:50.101
Barack Obama hasn't
changed, not as a person.

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:54.372
Because he is an authentic
man who came in, and he's

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.841
going to leave
that same person.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.842
(applause)

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:02.147
So it's not the office that
changes you, it's just -- it

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:03.581
amplifies who you are.

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:06.017
I think I said that at
the last convention.

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:08.753
Being President doesn't
change who you are, it

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.088
reveals who you are.

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.657
And that's something that
we should all remember.

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:13.491
(applause)

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:17.996
MS. WINFREY: This is the
United State of Women.

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:21.399
There are a lot of
cool men out here.

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.267
I love the --

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.935
Mrs. Obama: Let's give it up
for the brothers, for the

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:25.870
men out here.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.771
(applause)

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:27.338
MS. WINFREY: There's a
lot of cool men out here.

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:29.340
I love the President's
speech saying you're looking

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.376
at a feminist.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.311
What can men do
leaving here?

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:36.247
Mrs. Obama: Be better.

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:40.985
(laughter and applause)

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:43.388
Be better at everything.

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:48.560
(applause)

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.629
Be better fathers.

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:56.067
Good lord, just being good
fathers who love your

00:28:56.067 --> 00:29:00.138
daughters and are providing
a solid example of what it

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:03.074
means to be a good man in
the world, showing them what

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:05.009
it feels like to be loved.

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:09.347
That is the greatest gift
that the men in my life gave

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:10.348
to me.

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:13.251
And we've talked about this
-- the fact that I never

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:17.622
experienced abuse at the
hands of any man in my life.

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:21.292
And that's sad to say that
that's a rare reality.

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:24.596
So men can be
better at that.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:31.803
Men can be better husbands,
which is -- be a part of

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:34.339
your family's life.

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:35.440
Do the dishes.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.075
(applause)

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.444
Don't babysit your children.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.946
You don't babysit
your own children.

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:42.747
(applause)

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:44.516
Be engaged.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:47.385
Don't just think going to
work and coming home makes

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:48.386
you a man.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.455
Being a father, being
engaged, all that stuff

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.456
is important.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.759
Be a better employer.

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:58.096
When you are sitting at a
seat of power at a table of

00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:02.433
any kind and you look around
you just see you, it's just

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:06.538
you and a bunch of men
around a table, on a golf

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:10.942
course, making deals, and
you allow that to happen,

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.545
and you're okay with
that -- be better.

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:14.279
MS. WINFREY: Be better.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.013
Mrs. Obama: Be better.

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:15.813
MS. WINFREY: Be better.

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.849
(applause)

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.417
I love that.

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.585
Mrs. Obama: Just be better.

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:24.589
(laughter and applause)

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.591
I could go on but I'm not.

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.091
(laughter)

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.093
You get the point,
fellas, right?

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:29.594
Fellas?

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:31.362
(applause)

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:32.964
What are you going to be?

00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:34.065
Audience Members: Better!

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:34.599
Mrs. Obama: There you go.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.334
MS. WINFREY: There you go.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.203
(applause)

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:40.605
So here's the question that
comes up over and over and

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:44.142
over -- we talked a little
bit about it -- this

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:46.110
idea of balance.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.546
Is that a false
notion for women?

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:52.717
Because can we really -- are
we ever going to have it all?

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.719
I used to say you can have
it all you just can't have

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.954
it all at one time.

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.855
Is that a false notion?

00:30:57.855 --> 00:31:03.394
Mrs. Obama: I am always
irritated by the "you can

00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:04.629
have it all" statement.

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:07.365
And I grew irritated with
that phrase and that

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:11.869
expectation the older I got,
as you're trying to have it all.

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:15.974
And you're beating yourself
up, and feeling less than

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:19.777
because you aren't
having it all.

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:22.513
Because it's a
ridiculous aspiration.

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:25.717
MS. WINFREY: Especially if
you're looking at everybody

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.085
else's Facebook page.

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.220
Mrs. Obama: Oh, god,
everybody has it all.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.355
Everybody is lying.

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:31.356
They're lying.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:32.790
(laughter and applause)

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.192
You all need to stop lying.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:38.596
Be real about the fact that
-- no one gets everything.

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.598
That was one of the first
rules you learned as a

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:41.599
little kid.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.568
You don't always
get your way.

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:44.569
Come on, people.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.771
You don't always get what
you want all the time.

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.673
And that's true in life.

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:52.710
So what I've told many young
people is that you can have

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.980
it all, but oftentimes it's
hard to get it all at the

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.482
same time.

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:58.182
MS. WINFREY: Yeah,
I believe that.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.151
Mrs. Obama: So it's just
a matter of

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:02.887
managing expectations.

00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:05.823
So for me, for example, you
know, when your husband is

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:07.825
President of the United
States and you have

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:10.728
children, something
has got to give.

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:15.533
I've made compromises in my
life and my career, but I've

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:19.637
also, in exchange, gained
a wonderful platform to do

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:20.638
some great work.

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:23.474
Who would have ever imagined
that we would make the

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:26.044
inroads we've made on
healthy eating and changing

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.713
the way our kids
are fed in school?

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:31.783
(applause)

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:35.386
I can point to so many
things that I've had -- that

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:37.889
I've been able to do.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:42.293
If I want to be heavily
involved in my girls' lives

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:44.796
that means that sometimes I
have to put some things on

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.565
the back burner to give
them what they need.

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:52.570
So it's hard to have it all.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:56.607
But that's where you go back
to knowing who you are, and

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:59.444
knowing that you're really
living through phases.

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:02.513
And if you're compromising
through one phase of your

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:06.184
journey, you're not
giving it all up, you're

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.985
compromising for that phase.

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:10.621
There's another phase that's
coming up where you might be

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:13.358
able to have more of what
you thought you wanted.

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:16.828
You get to know yourself
a little bit more.

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:20.531
So, no, I don't want young
women out there to have the

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:23.968
expectation that if they're
not having it all that

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:25.503
somehow they're failing.

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.772
Life is hard.

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:31.476
But life is long if you
maintain your health, which

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:33.945
is one of the reasons why
we talk about health, talk

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:35.246
about taking
care of yourself.

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:37.615
Because you want to get to
the next phases in life

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:40.318
where you can do more of
what you want to do at any

00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:41.319
given time.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:42.620
MS. WINFREY: You want to be
wherever you are right now.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.689
And, just like you
say, I'm not through.

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.157
Mrs. Obama: Mmm hmm.

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:46.958
You're not through.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.126
MS. WINFREY: Not through.

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:52.630
So 5,000 women and
men in this room.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.799
(applause)

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:58.169
Thousands and thousands of
others streaming us online

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:59.070
-- hey.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.405
(laughter)

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:02.073
Hey, everybody streaming.

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:04.609
What is the one thing --
because I think it's really

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:07.211
easy when you come to a
conference like this and you

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.147
get so inspired and you see
Marley and Mikaila, those

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:11.649
young women, and you see
Billie Jean King, and Gloria

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:19.657
Steinem, and Shonda Rhimes,
and Kerry Washington.

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:20.324
Mrs. Obama: It's
amazing gathering --

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:22.860
MS. WINFREY: You see all
these women and you're just

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.063
like, I just want to
be more of a woman!

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:29.300
And you're going to
be overstimulated.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.402
(laughter)

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:36.407
What is the one thing you
want us to leave here with?

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:40.878
What is the one charge
or one offering?

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.180
What do you want to say?

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.182
Mrs. Obama: It's hard
to think of one thing.

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:45.883
MS. WINFREY: Okay, a couple.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:50.922
Mrs. Obama: But the
work always continues.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:55.326
And by that I mean
we're never done.

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:59.163
We can never be complacent
and think that we've arrived

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.231
now as women.

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:02.834
Because I hear this
from young women.

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:08.606
Some of you young women who
aren't feeling the pains

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:11.976
that many of our
predecessors have felt --

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:14.445
you think, well, there
aren't any problems, women's

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:17.148
rights, we've got this all
figured out, I'm already

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:20.818
equal, I'm good -- I'm just
like, oh, just you wait,

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.720
you'll feel it.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.256
So the work continues.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:28.292
And for all the young women
in this room, all the young

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:31.829
men, we can never
be complacent.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:37.602
Because we have seen in
recent times how quickly

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:42.306
things can be taken away if
we aren't vigilant, if we

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:47.311
don't know our history, if
we don't continue the work.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.479
(applause)

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:52.950
So my hope is that people
leave here inspired and

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.286
ready to do something.

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.822
Again, remember, it's not
what people say about you,

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.123
it's what you do.

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:02.159
So the question is what
are you going to do?

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.694
How are you going
to be better?

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.997
What are you going to change
in your office, in your

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.598
life, in your relationships?

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:10.334
What are you going to change
in your family dynamic?

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:13.371
And how are you going to
empower yourself with the

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:17.642
knowledge that you need to
know what work needs to be done?

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.710
We can't afford
to be ignorant.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.946
We can't afford
to be complacent.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:24.382
So we have to
continue the work.

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:27.418
MS. WINFREY: I think
that's powerful.

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:33.291
Because the question that
you just offered to us is

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:40.097
what did this mean, and what
can I do with what I have

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:43.267
received from all the
stimulation, all of this

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:46.003
energy -- what can I do,
that's the question.

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:48.306
You were talking
about the next phase.

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:52.944
I heard you say that when
you all are done -- we saw

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.112
your new house
-- when you're --

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:58.015
Mrs. Obama: We're neither
confirming or denying.

00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:58.783
(laughter)

00:36:58.783 --> 00:36:59.517
MS. WINFREY: Okay.

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:02.153
(laughter)

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.388
When you all are done --
okay, when you're done and

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:08.526
you move out of the White
House, I've heard you say

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.695
that you look forward to
riding around with the

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:13.230
windows down.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.865
You're still going
to be Michelle Obama.

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:16.233
Mrs. Obama: Yeah, I know.

00:37:16.233 --> 00:37:18.235
MS. WINFREY: And we're
going to know who you are.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.705
And it won't matter how many
baseball caps you put on,

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:22.106
we're going to say,
"Hey, Michelle."

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.574
Mrs. Obama: "Hey, Michelle."

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:24.342
(laughter)

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.343
I get that, I see --

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:28.346
MS. WINFREY: So what is the
one thing that you think you

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.448
really want to do?

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:31.782
And can we go shopping?

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.618
Mrs. Obama: Yeah, girl,
let's go shopping.

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.285
MS. WINFREY:
Let's go shopping.

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:34.919
Mrs. Obama: You and me.

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.187
That will be a scene.

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:39.991
(laughter)

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:41.425
You know, it's --

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:42.226
Audience Member:
-- go shopping!

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:43.027
Mrs. Obama: What?

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.329
You want to go
shopping with us?

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:48.232
(applause)

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:50.468
It's really the
little things.

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:57.642
And you feel this --
fame can be confining.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.010
And then you start missing
the little things.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.044
What do I want to do?

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:04.348
I want to walk out -- I
want to open my front door

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:07.351
without discussing
it with anyone --

00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:09.587
(laughter)

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:13.858
-- and I want to walk out
that door and just walk.

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.859
(laughter)

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:19.664
Just want to walk by myself,
or with a semblance of

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.766
feeling like I'm by myself,
because that's what you

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:25.770
learn how to do -- it's
like, I'm alone with 800

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:26.871
people walking behind me.

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.872
(laughter)

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:32.143
But I've learned how
to -- "I'm by myself."

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:35.846
But I do, I want to
walk down a street.

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:40.951
I want to sit in a yard that
is not a national park.

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:48.292
(laughter)

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.127
I do want to
drop into Target.

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:54.799
I want to -- I do, I want
to go to Target again!

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:55.666
(laughter)

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.935
I've heard so many things
have changed in Target!

00:38:57.935 --> 00:39:00.104
(laughter)

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.540
I tell my friends they're
going to have to give me a

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:07.044
re-entry training for like,
okay, what do you do at CVS now?

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:08.012
How do you check out?

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.081
(laughter)

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.649
It's like I've been
living in a cave.

00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:14.852
But it is, it's the small
things -- fresh air.

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:17.755
In the White House you
can't open a window.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:20.624
Sasha opened her window
once -- there were calls.

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:23.861
(laughter)

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.563
"Shut the window!"

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.997
It never opened again.

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.099
(laughter)

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:31.902
So it's the little
things that you --

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:33.270
MS. WINFREY: The things
that we all just take

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.004
for granted.

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:34.939
Mrs. Obama: Take
for granted.

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:38.576
I won't even ask for
anonymity, because I think

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:39.944
that's forever gone.

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.145
MS. WINFREY: Yes.

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:43.080
Mrs. Obama: But one of the
things that I've learned is

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.085
that if you just flow into a
pattern of life with people,

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.887
they give you
space to come in.

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:53.791
That's happened at my kids'
school and the places where

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.192
I go and work out.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.294
Once people get used to the
fact that you're going to

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.295
be there --

00:39:58.295 --> 00:39:59.296
MS. WINFREY: "It's
the First Lady!"

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:00.731
Mrs. Obama: Then it's
sort of like it's over.

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.633
It's like you do it a few
times, it's like "It's the

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.768
First Lady."

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:09.306
So I hope to find a way to
seamlessly work my way into

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:10.441
a normal life.

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:13.377
And it's going to take time,
but I'm going to slowly --

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.379
MS. WINFREY: It's
going to happen.

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.981
And we're going
to go shopping.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.415
Mrs. Obama: We're
going to shop!

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.483
MS. WINFREY: We're
going to go shopping.

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:23.888
And you will leave
here most proud of?

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:27.758
Mrs. Obama: You know, truly,
I am most proud of my daughters.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.393
(applause)

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:35.566
I mean, I could go down the
list of my initiatives, and

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:38.502
we have done a lot --
changed the way our kids eat.

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.404
We've supported military
families, we made that

00:40:40.404 --> 00:40:42.706
conversation part
of the community.

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.842
The work that we're doing
on girls' education will be

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.244
something that I do for
the rest of my life.

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.246
This is all work
that will continue.

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.247
It is there.

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.650
Those problems won't be
solved in my lifetime.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:57.054
But raising two girls
-- like I said at the

00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:00.191
beginning, when I sent them
off in the car that first

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:04.228
day and they were so little,
and the bulletproof glass

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:08.632
was so thick -- I thought,
oh, my god, I just want them

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:12.236
to grow up feeling a sense
-- knowing that they're

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.004
loved by us.

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:16.006
Feeling confident.

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:18.909
Feeling a sense of normalcy,
feeling a sense of

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:22.446
obligation to do something
outside of themselves.

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:25.115
Just being good people.

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:30.221
And we just went to Malia's
high school graduation, and

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:33.958
we're watching Sasha move
her way through high school.

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:38.429
And I am very proud of those
two and how they've managed

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:41.398
this situation and how
they have continued to be

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:45.035
themselves, regular little
girls just trying to figure

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:45.769
it out.

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:50.941
And as all mothers do, you
breathe that sigh of relief

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:53.344
that you didn't
mess up your kids.

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:56.881
And every day I cross my
fingers and hope that I'm

00:41:56.881 --> 00:42:00.517
doing right by them, and I'm
providing them with a good

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:03.587
foundation so that they
can be great people.

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.422
MS. WINFREY: Thank you.

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.423
(applause)

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.726
And I just want to say, the
way you've handled this

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:13.564
office, the way you carry
yourself, have presented

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:19.136
yourself to the United
States of America, and the

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:22.106
women of the United States
of America, and men of the

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:25.809
United States of America,
reminds me of a line that

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:28.012
Maya used to say -- it's
actually in the beginning of

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:33.217
one of her books -- she says
"You make me proud to spell

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:37.755
my name W-O-M-A-N."

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:38.489
(applause)

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:42.259
Michelle Obama.

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:48.065
And I would like to add
to that: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:51.969
