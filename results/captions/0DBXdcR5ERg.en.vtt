TODAY BROUGHT THE PRESIDENT A

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:09.742
NEW REASON TO FREAK OUT, WHEN.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:10.943 align:start position:0%
HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN JERRY

BUSINESSES, TRANSITION, AND
ADMINISTRATION.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
CAMPAIGN, BUSINESSES,
TRANSITION, AND ADMINISTRATION.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:28.327 align:start position:0%
SO THEY'VE NARROWED THE PROBLEM
TO THINGS HE'S DONE.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.228 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS AREN'T

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.362 align:start position:0%
MESSING AROUND.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:31.831 align:start position:0%
THEY'VE SENT DOCUMENT REQUESTS
TO 81 PEOPLE AND ENTITIES,

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.767
INCLUDING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,
THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, THE TRUMP

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.071 align:start position:0%
ORGANIZATION, THE TRUMP
TRANSITION, AND SOMETHING CALLED

THE DONALD J. TRUMP REVOCABLE
TRUST.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.111 align:start position:0%
WELL, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY:
TRUST REVOKED.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.246 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
TRUMP'S BAD WEEK REALLY GOT INTO

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:51.284
GEAR WITH THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT
COMMITTEE'S HEARING FOR FORMER

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:56.022
TRUMP LAWYER AND KID BEING TOLD
BY HIS PARENTS THAT THE DIVORCE

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.124 size:88% position:44%
IS HIS FAULT, MICHAEL COHEN.

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.693 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:01.594 align:start position:0%
REALLY SAD.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S SAD.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.130 align:start position:0%
HE'S VERY SAD.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.632 align:start position:0%
HE'S SO SAD.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.569
COHEN TESTIFIED THAT NOT ONLY
DID TRUMP REIMBURSE HIM FOR THE

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.971
STORMY DANIELS PAY-OFF WHILE IN
OFFICE, HE BROUGHT A COPY OF THE

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
CHECK.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.109 align:start position:0%
TAKE A LOOK:
FROM DONALD TRUMP, TO MICHAEL

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start position:0%
COHEN, TOTALING $35,000, FROM
CAPITAL ONE BANK.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.482
WHICH MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE THEIR
SLOGAN IS "CAPITAL ONE: WHAT'S

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.784 align:start position:0%
IN YOUR WALLET?"
"OH, DAMNING EVIDENCE OF

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.018 align:start position:0%
CAMPAIGN FINANCE FRAUD?

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:30.823 align:start position:0%
YIKES."

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:38.164 align:start position:0%
ETTIT'S TRUE.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.533 align:start position:0%
SO NOT ONLY WAS COHEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSFERRING THE

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:45.204 align:start position:0%
MONEY TO STORMY, HE WAS ALSO THE
IN-FAMILY MESSENGER:

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE ASKED ME TO PAY OFF AN
ADULT FILM STAR WITH WHOM HE HAD

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:53.312 align:start position:0%
AN AFFAIR AND LIE TO HIS WIFE
ABOUT IT, WHICH I DID.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.915 size:78% position:39%
I LIED TO THE FIRST LADY.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:02:00.419 align:start position:0%
WHEN THE PRESIDENT CALLED ME, I
WAS SITTING IN A CAR WITH A

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.421
FRIEND OF MINE AND HE HAD ME
SPEAK TO HER AND EXPLAIN TO THE

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.490 align:start position:0%
FIRST LADY.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.858
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THAT'S ALWAYS THE
SIGN OF A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:10.963 align:start position:0%
( AS TRUMP )
"BABE, I NEVER CHEATED ON YOU.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:17.870
NOW, I'D PREFER IF ANY FURTHER
QUESTIONS ABOUT MY AFFECTION

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:21.974
AND LOYALTY GO TO MY LAWYER, WHO
HAS PREPARED A SIGNED AFFIDAVIT

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.411 size:84% position:42%
ATTESTING THAT I LOVE YOU."

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.312 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THE DEMOCRATS PUSHED COHEN TO

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.314 size:84% position:42%
REVEAL AS MUCH AS HE COULD.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.950
REPRESENTATIVE OCASIO-CORTEZ
ASKED HIM WHO MIGHT KNOW ABOUT

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.452
THE ALLEGED SECRET TROVE OF
TRUMP DOCUMENTS OWNED BY "THE

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.856 align:start position:0%
NATIONAL ENQUIRER."

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.424
&gt;&gt; SO YOU WOULD SAY THE PERSON
WHO KNOWS THE WHEREABOUTS OF

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:39.792 align:start position:0%
THESE DOCUMENTS WOULD BE DAVID
PECKER?

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.663 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DAVID PECKER, BARRY LEVINE OR
DYLAN HOWARD.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.966 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHO ELSE KNOWS THAT THE
PRESIDENT DID THIS?

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.436 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ALAN WEISSELBERG, RON
LIEBERMAN, AND MATTHEW CALAMARI.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.605
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: "SIR, I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME, SO IF YOU COULD

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:56.175
PLEASE IMPLICATE AS MANY NEW
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND PLEASE

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.045 align:start position:0%
SAVE THE SILLIEST NAME FOR
THE VERY END.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:05.051 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING BORDERLINE
ANTI-ITALIAN, LIKE BETTY

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:12.858 align:start position:0%
SPAGHETTI OR LUIGI CASSEROLI, OR
MATTHEW CALAMARI."

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:13.926 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:14.927 align:start position:0%
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
ASKING COHEN A SINGLE

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.762 align:start position:0%
SUBSTANTIVE QUESTION.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:19.398 align:start position:0%
INSTEAD, THEY JUST CALLED HIM A
LIAR.

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:21.667
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST ANNOUNCED WITNESS
FOR THE 116TH CONGRESS IS A GUY

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.672 align:start position:0%
GOING TO PRISON IN TWO MONTHS
FOR LYING TO CONGRESS.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.641 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW A JUROR IN
AMERICA THAT WOULD BELIEVE

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:33.079
ANYTHING MR. COHEN SAYS GIVEN
HIS PAST ACTIONS AND LIES.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.348
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
YOU TO LOOK UP HERE, AND LOOK AT

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start position:0%
THE OLD ADAGE OUR MOMS TAUGHT
US.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:42.021 size:81% position:41%
LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:43.222 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU LEARNED "LIAR,
LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE" FROM

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:47.093 align:start position:0%
YOUR MOM?

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.795 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
"HONEY, IF YOU'RE EVER IN AN

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:53.199
ARGUMENT WITH SOMEBODY, REMEMBER
TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD AND CALL

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:56.335 size:88% position:44%
THEM A BIG DUMB DOODY-FACE."

00:03:56.368 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
SAYING WE SHOULDN'T BELIEVE

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.643 size:88% position:44%
COHEN BECAUSE HE LIED IN THE
PAST ISN'T A GOOD ARGUMENT.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.845
THAT'S WHY TRUMP HIRED HIM IN
THE FIRST PLACE, TO LIE ABOUT

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.647 align:start position:0%
HIS AFFAIRS AND CRIMES.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.549
HE WANTED A DIRTBAG LAWYER, HE
HE WANTED A DIRTBAG LAWYER, HE

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:14.820 size:81% position:41%
DIDN'T WANT ATTICUS FINCH!

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:18.891 align:start position:0%
( AS ATTICUS )
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS PORN

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start position:0%
I'M GOING TO DO TO YOU IS GOING
TO BE ( BLEEP ) DISGUSTING.

00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:41.013 align:start position:0%
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:46.686
IN THE NAME OF GOD, DO YOUR DUTY
AND TAKE THIS CHECK FOR $130,000

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:54.827 size:78% position:39%
AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH, SIR!

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:04.036 align:start position:0%

OF COURSE, TRUMP FIRED BACK

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.405 align:start position:0%
AGAINST THE TESTIMONY ON
TWITTER.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:09.041 align:start position:0%
"VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING FAILED

IT'S A TOTAL NEW LOVE LETTER TO

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:27.126 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WAIT, WHY DID HE PUT "TRUMP" IN

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.896 align:start position:0%
QUOTES?

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:34.066 size:88% position:44%
DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT'S HIM?

NO, REALLY.

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:41.140

KEEPS INTERRUPTING ME.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:44.977 align:start position:0%
I DON'T THINK HE'S RIGHT
IN THE HEAD."

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.345 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT COHEN'S BOOK PROBABLY

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.781 align:start position:0%
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:54.053 align:start position:0%
