00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.370
The President:  Thank you.

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.570
(applause)
Please. Thank you very much.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.760
I’m very honored to welcome
our State Attorneys General

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.530
back to the White House.
We were together last year,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.800
and I said,
“I’m inviting you back.”

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.130
And a lot things have been done,
a lot of progress has been made.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.210
And, Vice President, thank you
very much for being here.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.759
You were here last year
and we’re here again, Mike.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.580
Let me begin by saying
our hearts go out

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.680
to everyone affected by
the devastating storms

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.100
in Alabama, Georgia,
and the surrounding states,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.760
and especially
to the families of those

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.960
who have tragically
lost their lives.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.110
I’ve spoken with Governor Ivey,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.490
and we’re working closely with
officials throughout the region

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.000
to get our communities
back on their feet.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.910
Attorney General Marshall
and Attorney General Carr,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.330
when you get home,
please tell the people

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.440
of the great states
of Alabama and Georgia

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.720
that America has their backs.
We have a call in to Brian Kemp,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.010
and we let them know and —
the Governor and everybody —

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.280
that we’re with you 100 percent.
Thank you very much.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.180
One hundred percent,
we’ll be there. Thank you.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.770
I want to thank your
National Association President,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.590
Louisiana Attorney
General Jeff Landry —

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.950
a friend of mine.
We’re also grateful to be joined

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.340
by our fantastic new Attorney
General, Bill Barr.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.940
Bill, thank you.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.530
Today, we join together
to reaffirm

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.900
and strengthen the vital
partnership among state,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.270
local,
and federal law enforcement.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.870
Only by working together
can we ensure security

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.650
for every community and deliver
justice for every citizen.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.190
I want to take a moment to send
a message this afternoon,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.860
on behalf of everyone
in this room,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.570
to all law enforcement
personnel across America:

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.230
You are loved, you are cherished
and respected

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.030
by the American people
more than you will ever know.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.220
So true.
More than you will ever know.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.650
When I took office
two years ago,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.700
one of my highest priorities
was to reduce violent crime.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.050
In the two years
before my inauguration,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.320
violent crime was up
substantially —

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.070
very substantially —

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.660
and murders had increased
by more than 20 percent.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.060
For this reason,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.450
my administration resurrected
Project Safe Neighborhoods —

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.490
bringing together citizens
groups, sheriffs,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.990
and police departments to put
dangerous offenders behind bars,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.700
while supporting crime
prevention and reentry programs.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.490
Part of the reason
we’re doing well

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.290
is that people
are getting jobs

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.040
because the economy may be
the strongest it’s ever been.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040
I mean, all of your states
are doing very well.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.690
I think we have the strongest
economy, perhaps, ever.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.660
The lowest unemployment
rate we’ve ever had —

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.190
you could say “51 years”
or you could say “ever.”

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.790
But groups — if you look
at African American,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.870
Asian American,
Hispanic American —

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.670
the lowest unemployment rate,
historically, ever.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.970
So that helps a lot
with what you do.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.100
We deployed 200 new violent
crime prosecutors.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.850
We charged a record number
of firearms offenders.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.020
And last year, we prosecuted
the most violent criminals ever.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.520
The most ever
in our history, also.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.010
With your help and leadership,
violent crime

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.070
is now going down for
the first time in a long time.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.020
Murders in America’s
largest cities

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.060
dropped by 7 percent
between 2016 and 2017.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.770
Last year, we passed
historic legislation

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.670
to combat the devastating
opioid and drug crisis.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.990
And I’m dealing with China right
now on a very big trade deal,

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.010
as you probably
have read, heard.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.700
Some of you are
a little bit involved.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.900
But I can tell you,
I said to President Xi

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.850
that we cannot let fentanyl
into our country.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.600
Almost 100 percent
comes from China.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.890
It’s devastating.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.860
As you know, better than I do,
it’s devastating.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.560
And he has promised to —

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.410
and they’re in
the process of doing —

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.330
so when I take him
for his word —

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.200
make it a criminal act
at the highest level,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.560
which, in China,
means the death penalty.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.170
That should have
a massive impact on fentanyl

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.400
coming into our country
from China.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.410
This legislation expands
lifesaving treatment

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.060
and authorizes funding
for local law enforcement

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.390
to help those badly addicted
get the treatment they need.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.180
Our State Attorneys General
are launching bold initiatives

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.170
to fight this epidemic.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.750
In Arkansas, Attorney General
Leslie Rutledge — thank you.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.080
Where is Leslie?
Thank you.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.929
Thank you, Leslie, very much.
Great job you’re doing too.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.260
Has taken on
the drug companies,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.330
launched a groundbreaking
education program

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.150
and trained local
law enforcement to investigate

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.590
and prosecute those responsible
for the opioid epidemic.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.410
So, Leslie, I want to
thank you very much.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.410
Everyone is talking about it.
Great job.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.730
But to defeat
this deadly epidemic,

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.270
America’s southern border
must be urgently

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.680
and very strongly secured.
We fight wars 6,000 miles away,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.800
we spend billions
and billions of dollars,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.139
but we don’t control
our own border.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.440
Drug trafficking
and human traffickers

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.610
exploit our porous border

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.560
to finance
their ruthless operations

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.390
across our hemisphere.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.760
One in three migrant women
is sexually assaulted

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.630
on the very dangerous
journey north.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.280
Criminal cartels
terrorize innocent people

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.580
on both sides of the border.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.540
Thousands of our citizens
are killed by lethal narcotics —

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.900
88,000 people, just with
certain types of drugs —

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.070
most of which come
through the southern border.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.770
Eighty-eight thousand people die

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.569
and that’s just
a small portion of it.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.640
Hardworking people of every
background pay the price

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.470
for a lack of border control
and security.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.370
In the last two years,
ICE officers made 266,000

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.210
arrests of aliens
with criminal records,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.900
including those charged
or convicted

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.870
of approximately
100,000 assaults —

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.690
and these are new numbers,
hard to believe —

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.060
30,000 sex crimes,
and 4,000 murders.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.620
Every day, our brave ICE
officers are on the front lines

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.710
protecting our communities.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.450
We must always support
the heroes of law enforcement,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.340
and we all support
law enforcement in every way.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.040
Sanctuary cities that release
known criminal aliens

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.350
put all Americans at risk.
I urge everyone here today

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.200
to make sure that your states
and cities are fully cooperating

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200
with the Department
of Homeland Security

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.580
in their lifesaving mission.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.370
We all share
the same righteous goal:

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.500
to build a future
where every American —

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.110
both immigrant and U.S.-born —

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.770
can thrive in safety,
dignity, harmony, and peace.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.210
Before Christmas,
I was proud to sign historic,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.740
bipartisan criminal justice
reform into law.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.660
And I want to thank the National
Association of Attorneys

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.940
General for everything you did
to help pass this

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.800
FIRST STEP Act.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.000
And a special thanks to Attorney
General Karl Racine.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.620
Where’s Karl?
Karl? Karl? Karl?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.340
Hi, Karl. Great job.
Thank you very much.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.970
You were very helpful.
Everybody said “Karl.”

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.780
I feel like you’re —
like I know you.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.100
(laughter)
That’s pretty good.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.310
State Attorney General Racine:  
I feel like

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.950
I know
you as well, Mr. President.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.300
(laughter)

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.010
The President:  Karl is —
really was fantastic,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.480
from the District of Columbia.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.260
Attorney General Josh Stein.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.890
Josh, thank you very much.
Thank you, Josh.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.350
Josh, Josh. Stand up, Josh.
Go ahead. Come on. That’s great.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.399
From a great place —
from North Carolina.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.820
And Attorney General, my friend
Ken Paxton, from Texas.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.040
Thanks, Ken. Thanks.
Great. Great job.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.950
Together, we’re making
our communities safer,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.160
our future brighter,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.110
and our people more prosperous
than ever before.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.380
This is what our state
and federal partnership

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.180
is all about:
putting the American Dream

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.640
within reach
of all of our citizens.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.550
And that’s happening
more and more,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.580
and we’re very proud of it.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.320
Thank you all for
your friendship

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.789
and your partnership
and leadership.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.400
Extraordinary
leadership, really.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.730
Thank you all for the incredible
service to your states,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.620
your citizens, and your nation.
You are very special people

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.770
and doing a very special
and important job.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.730
And everybody
very much appreciates it,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.760
and I want to lead that list.
Great job. Thank you very much.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.460
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.330
(applause)
