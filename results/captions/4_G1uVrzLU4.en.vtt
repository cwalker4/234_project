00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.580
SHANE SMITH: Hello.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.990
The next morning we got back
onto our one-car train and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.240
headed off into the
wilderness.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.890
Every once in a while, there'd
be a break in the trees, and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.310
we'd pass these massive logging
camps that butted up

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.470
against the train tracks that
were obviously North Korean.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.450
We're on our little train
going into the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.720
middle of the forest.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.900
This is a logging camps
run by North Koreans.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.470
You can see there's a North
Korean flag and North Korean

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.440
propaganda in here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.600
There, there's some
North Koreans

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.390
waving at us over there.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.480
All this wood is going
to England.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
When we get off this
train, [LAUGH]

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700
we're going to go out into the
campus where they actually log

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.310
out in the middle of Siberia.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.560
Freaky, freaky business.

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:11.020
We finally started to approach
our last stop, the tiny

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.936
logging town of Tataul.

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:15.400
Now Tataul is a freaky place.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.380
It's as if the Soviets had
come up to the edge of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.410
civilization, then dropped off
their Stalinists apartment

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.970
blocks in the middle of nowhere,
and then gotten back

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.115
on the train and never
looked back.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.980
At the train station, we met
our new driver, a colorful

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.400
local type known simply
as "the Fish."

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.480
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He
just brought a

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.170
shotgun into the car--

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.850
[LAUGH]

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.390
just in case.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.470
SHANE SMITH: Dog
in the sidecar.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.910
Dog in the sidecar.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.110
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It looks
like a Doberman.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.310
SHANE SMITH: His mouthful of
gold teeth and his shiny track

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.170
suit confirmed what we
already suspected--

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.360
the Fish and his crew
were the local mob.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.910
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They've
actually moved here from the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.400
camp, the abandoned camp that
we visited yesterday, so--

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.890
SHANE SMITH: Right, so the
camp we were at is done.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.310
Now this is the new camp,
even further afield.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.940
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Right.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.070
Yeah, we're going to their new
camp, where they're actually

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.320
operating now.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.350
SHANE SMITH: Ask him, maybe,
if he thinks if

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.950
they'll be angry or--

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.270
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.350
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.700
And he brought a shotgun.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.250
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think
that's probably pretty useful.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.500
SHANE SMITH: Is this
the camp here?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.060
So we're here in a North Korean
logging camp in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.310
middle of Siberia.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.780
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This is where
they bring the logs from the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.325
forest and put them
onto railcars.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.420
SHANE SMITH: So there's
Korean propaganda.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.476
There's some Korean writing.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:45.800
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It says, "we're
going to take action to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.050
increase productivity during
the winter time."

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.471
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]

00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.580
OK.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.831
Here comes a Russian lady that
we're going to have to--

00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:53.272
SIMON OSTROVSKY: She
doesn't look happy.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:53.713
SHANE SMITH: Hello.

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.520
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.630
SHANE SMITH: She immediately
made a lot of phone calls and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.730
a lot of threats.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.930
Should we get arrested?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.340
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.590
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.400
SHANE SMITH: While we were
arguing with her, a van

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.680
straight out of 1957 pulled up,
and, lo and behold, out

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.170
came some North Koreans.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.625
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.250
MALE SPEAKER 1:

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.500
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.360
SHANE SMITH: Jason's
gone AWOL.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.370
He's in the camp.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.450
Jason's being shuttled back to
fucking Pyongyang as we speak.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.490
Jason, our producer, slipped
away with a small camera and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.750
started filming the camp.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.000
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.070
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.200
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He's saying
we've got to get permission

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.750
from the embassy before
we can show anything.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.095
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.300
SHANE SMITH: Now what he was
saying was a revelation.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.720
We had come all this way so we
could actually talk to North

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.510
Koreans, and one of the first
ones we met was admitting that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.130
the standard of living was a
problem in the home country--

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.860
which would never be admitted
to in North Korea proper.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.720
In fact, when the political
boss stepped in, he also

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.470
admitted to living
a hard life.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.930
But of course, he blamed
it on America.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.180
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:45.920
TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.465
SHANE SMITH:
[TALK-SINGING IN KOREAN]

00:05:50.465 --> 00:05:52.250
OK.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.070
So they won't let us in.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.990
They don't want to get
in trouble, which is

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.840
understandable.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.050
So they're kicking us out.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.270
We're going to try to go to the
forest to actually find

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.180
some North Korean workers
who are actually

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.430
cutting down the trees.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.990
You want a beer?

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.890
Hello.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.140
[SPEAKING KOREAN].
