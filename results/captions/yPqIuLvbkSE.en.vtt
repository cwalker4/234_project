00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.093
- Welcome back.

00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:03.200
Your liver, very important organ,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.730
because cancer cannot
get a hold on the body

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.630
if your liver's working well.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.030
There's an old proverb that's found

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.510
in Proverbs 14, verse six.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.240
It says, "knowledge is easy
to him that understands."

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.770
So what I wanna do tonight,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.010
is I wanna give you an
understanding of your liver

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.960
because when you have an
understanding of your liver,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.033
you actually then have the
knowledge on how to treat it.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.330
Everything that comes into your body,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.080
comes first to the liver.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.750
And the liver basically
determines where everything goes.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.290
And everything that
comes out of your body,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.450
comes out under the
jurisdiction of the liver.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.970
And so, I'm gonna begin with showing you,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.080
which I already have touched on,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.190
is what happens with everything
that comes into the liver.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.860
Now, any environmental poisons
that come into the liver,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.330
the liver assesses it,
and if it's really toxic,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.943
it wraps it up in fat and stores it.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.440
But if it can, it'll break it
down to a water soluble state

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.333
and release it.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.860
What we also looked at
in our last lecture,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.380
is what happens with the food.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.120
All of this food breaks down to glucose

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.310
in the gastrointestinal tract,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630
and then it goes into the blood on the M1,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.850
straight to the liver.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.163
So, here's our liver.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.720
And then the liver
determines where it goes.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.290
The liver is the largest
internal organ in the body.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.000
Your liver is the only organ

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.420
that has the ability to regenerate.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.430
And you'll see why God made that so,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.620
as we go through this lecture.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.370
Your liver is called the Project Manager.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.170
Because everything that goes into the body

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.660
goes first to the liver.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.010
It determines what happens.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.840
And so, as I showed you
in the last lecture,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.040
all of this food breaks down to glucose.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.320
The glucose goes into the blood.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.250
And it goes straight to the liver.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.510
It's called the portal
vein, or called the M1,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.343
straight to the liver.

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:04.610
And then the liver determines.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.090
First of all it goes to the cell.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.006
So I'll take you through this once more.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.490
The glucose goes into the cell,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.800
it goes through a 20 step pathway.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.130
Which gives us two units of energy.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.320
End result of the 20 step pathway,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.180
is a chemical form of
glucose called pyruvate.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.310
Pyruvate, as the chemical form of glucose,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.900
gets fed into the powerhouse.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.930
Called the powerhouse because
this eight step pathway

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.730
gives us 36 units of energy.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.270
And as I showed you, this
is the oxygen pathway.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.140
Oxygen is what causes so much energy.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.550
This has no oxygen,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.250
so it's also called the anaerobic pathway.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.750
We also looked at how the excess glucose

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.870
gets stored as glycogen.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.680
Little bunches of grapes.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.680
We also looked at how the
excess after that, of glucose,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.673
is stored as fat.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.110
Your muscle cell stores this glycogen,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.010
the quick quick-release glucose store,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.800
and it can only be used
by your muscle cell.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.520
But your liver can also store glycogen.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.820
And the liver that your
glycogen-- (laughs)

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.620
I mean the glycogen that your liver stores

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.710
it can go all over the body.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.830
Whereas the glycogen in your muscle cell

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.283
can only be used by your muscle cell.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.030
There's a book called "Good
Calories, Bad Calories,"

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.950
by Gary Taubes.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.980
You might've heard of it;
it's quite a famous book.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.330
And he shows, that back in the 1850s,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.730
there was a man called William Banting

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.530
who was putting on weight.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.830
And he went to a very famous
doctor, called Claude Bernard,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.570
a French doctor,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.810
and he took him off all starches.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.000
It was called starches then.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.280
We call it carbohydrates now.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.332
So, what did he eat?

00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:09.450
He had a lot of fiber, lot of vegetables.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.420
He had a lot of meat,
butter, cream, cheese, eggs.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.150
There was his protein.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.150
And meat, butter, cream, cheese,
eggs also has a lot of fat.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.489
That was the diet that he was
given by Dr. Claude Bernard.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.410
The weight just fell off him.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.290
Can you see why?

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.340
You see, when you're not giving your body

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.300
this quick-release glucose stores,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.260
your liver can convert
protein and fat to glucose,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.610
and your liver can turn your
fat stores into glucose.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.120
And, as I said the other lecture,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.110
that's called gluconeogenesis,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.253
creating new glucose
out of the fat stores.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.090
So, William Banting was not hungry,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.800
because he was getting lots of energy

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.790
from that being broken down and these.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.260
The weight was just falling off him

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.140
because his liver was
breaking down his fat stores,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.660
'cause he wasn't delivering
the quick-release glucose.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.930
He was never hungry because,
as you'll see tomorrow night,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.560
these are the three food groups

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.300
that keep the food in the stomach longer.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.520
'Cause he found the perfect diet:

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.533
never hungry, weight
falling off, lots of energy.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.063
So, William Banting wrote a paper on it.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.610
And it was called "The Bant."

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.340
And this paper, we'd say
today, it went "viral."

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.320
But it actually went
everywhere, this was the 1850s.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.070
And it was said, if you were on a diet,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.220
people would say, "are
you doing The Bant?"

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.500
Let's fast forward to the 80s.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.373
What diet does that sound like?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.030
Dr. Robert Atkins diet?

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.960
Do you know that his book was number one

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.280
on the New York Times' Bestselling List

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.150
four years running.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.107
Nutritionists and doctors hated him.

00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:02.810
Ancel Keys, who came up
with the fat and cholesterol

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.850
cause heart disease.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.780
They hated him.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.240
But the fact was, the people loved him.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.073
Why?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.280
Because what are we interested in?

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.890
Something that works.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.283
This worked.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.133
And Atkins' patients weren't
dying of heart attacks.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.363
Atkins scratched his head.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.550
Because his patients, the cancer patients,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.790
were going into remission.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.950
Remember we looked at, yesterday,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.010
how fungus and cancer are closely related,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.780
and fungus loves high glucose.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.530
Now his patients were on a diet

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.160
that released slow, low glucose.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.140
So, the cancer cells couldn't survive.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.860
His patients with high cholesterol levels

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.960
came back to normal.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.793
Did you hear that?

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:51.626
What are they eating?

00:06:51.626 --> 00:06:54.130
Meat, butter, cream, cheese, eggs.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.560
No wonder the nutritionists
and the doctors hated him.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.963
Because he proved them all wrong.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.830
And I would be a fool not to
acknowledge what that diet did.

00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:09.130
Now, before you run out
of the door, hear me out.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.448
Because I'm a vegetarian.

00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:12.710
(laughs)

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.770
And what was Atkins?

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.973
A high meat diet.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.700
Do you know he had the science.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.980
And as Dr. Karl Benjamin said to me,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.217
he said, "I used to be
one of Atkins' patients.

00:07:23.217 --> 00:07:25.960
"And if Atkins had read the China study,"

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.957
he said, "I believe Atkins
would have become a vegetarian."

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.820
So, we're looking at his science here.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.743
And his science was correct.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.460
His diabetics were coming
off their medication.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.806
This is Type I and Type II diabetes.

00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:44.083
My last lecture showed you why that is so.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.270
And that's why Atkins wrote his books.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.220
And he discovered that
these three food groups

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.450
are the three essential food groups.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.740
Do you know what "essential" means?

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.903
Body cannot make it,
you've gotta put it in.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.670
Fiber's essential because
your gastrointestinal tract,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.010
as you'll see tomorrow night,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.893
it needs to be swept every day.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.750
And the vegetables sweep that.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.784
Most people don't realize,
on the Atkins diet,

00:08:11.784 --> 00:08:14.743
you had to eat three
cups of vegetables a day.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.603
One cup had to be greens.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.810
Protein's essential
because 50% of the membrane

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.830
around every cell in the body is protein.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.680
And 50% of the membrane

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.543
around every cell in the body is fat.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.920
That's pretty essential.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.620
Except for the brain cell.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.263
Those cells are 70% fat.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.620
The membrane around them.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.073
The fattiest organ in
the body is the brain.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.935
The three essential food groups.

00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:51.910
How many Aussies, on the
high carbohydrate diet,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.143
are missing out on the three essentials?

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.110
Now, carbohydrates aren't bad.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.560
What a relief; we like them.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.460
My husband would never forgive
me if the potatoes stopped.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.090
Carbohydrates are only
bad if you overdo them

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.230
and they're refined.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.283
Can you see that?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.653
That's where the problem arises.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.130
What Atkins found was that
the nonessential food group

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.013
is actually carbohydrates.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.613
Do you know what that means?

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:23.850
You can live well without them.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.470
But let me very quickly
say, I don't suggest you do.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.653
There's no need.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.390
You see, your carbohydrate
part of the meal

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.510
is your negotiating part of the meal.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.810
And the negotiation's changed,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.670
depending on your weight,
your size, your height.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.253
My 6'6" brother-in-law
eats more carbs than I do.

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:48.350
But probably where the
negotiation's changed the most

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.480
is your health status.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.890
So if someone wanted to
quickly conquer diabetes,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.850
as I just showed you,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.450
what would they drastically drop?

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.580
Carbs.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.300
Someone wanted to lose weight quickly,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.900
what would they drastically drop?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.733
Carbs.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.240
Someone wanted to conquer cancer,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.880
what would they drastically drop?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.250
Carbs.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.560
And because it's a nonessential,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.880
you can actually live without it.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.070
It was in late 2016,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.650
Catalyst did a show
called "Fat or Fiction."

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.070
I don't know if anyone here saw it.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.830
Very interesting.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.010
There was a professor
of nutrition on there.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.777
He said "you can actually live very well,

00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:26.917
"without one dot of carbohydrate."

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.407
But as I said, it's not a bad food.

00:10:31.407 --> 00:10:32.900
And it's not a wrong food.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.900
It's just that most people
today overdo the carbs. (laughs)

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.400
Yes, it's got nutrients.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.570
Yes, we run on carbs.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.010
But can you see my point?

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.333
Most people overdo it.

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:50.950
So, how do you do it on a vegetarian diet?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.853
Let me show you.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.300
Here is the food, we're
gonna look at the food part

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.733
of the meal.

00:11:00.733 --> 00:11:02.500
We're going to look at the
protein part of the meal,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.333
and the carbohydrate part of the the food.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.360
Carbs.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.410
And we're gonna go to Genesis 1:29,

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.737
and we're gonna look at what
God tells Adam and Eve to eat.

00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:18.487
"And God said, 'behold I've
given you every herb, berry,

00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:20.650
"and seed, which is upon
the face of the Earth.'"

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.020
So what's a seed?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.220
A seed is a grain.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.773
A seed is a legume.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.653
A seed is a seed.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.340
So what are the grains?

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.320
We've got wheat, rye, barley,
oats, amaranth, buckwheat,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.560
quinoa, rice.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.393
We said rice.

00:11:39.393 --> 00:11:40.950
So many.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.420
And they are high in protein
and high in carbohydrates.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.230
So how many on our carbohydrate
list are from grain?

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.280
So, grain, grain, grain,
grain, grain, grain, grain.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.010
The majority on our
high carbohydrate list,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.360
are from grain.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.230
What's a legume?

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.470
That's lentils, chickpeas,
lima beans, black eyed beans,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.270
cannelloni beans, kidney
beans, so many beans.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.140
They are high in protein.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.383
And they are medium to
low in carbohydrate.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.660
The fact is, they are about
a third the carbohydrate

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.593
that you will find in the grain.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.310
Seed: pumpkin seed, sesame
seed, sunflower seed,

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.770
chia seed, flaxseed, or linseed.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.260
High in protein, low in carbohydrates.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.027
So, "God said, 'behold, I've
given you every herb, berry,

00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:33.447
"and seed which is upon
the face of the Earth,

00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:34.717
"and every tree.

00:12:34.717 --> 00:12:37.380
"In the which of the tree
is a fruit-bearing seed."

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.601
What's a fruit-bearing seed?

00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:40.637
That's your nuts.

00:12:40.637 --> 00:12:43.800
All your nuts come from
the fruit of the tree.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.800
Nuts are high in protein,
low in carbohydrate.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.850
So we've got pecan, and
walnut, and hazelnut,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.900
Brazil, almonds, cashews, so many nuts.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.033
Macadamia.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.580
To ensure you're getting
your three essentials,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.220
my suggestion is you increase
the legume, nut, seed part

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.070
of the meal,

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.663
and to decrease the grain.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.350
Again, when my grandsons come,

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.290
my three little grandsons
are coming to stay

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.009
at grandma's house next
week for the holidays,

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:24.750
they'll eat three times the grain I do.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.190
They're growing boys.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.670
They want cereal.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.883
I cook them millet or oats
for porridge every morning.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.710
Can you see that it changes?

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.543
I don't need much.

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:38.100
I'm just a little lady. (laughs)

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.093
How do you know when you're getting

00:13:39.093 --> 00:13:41.220
the right amount of carbs?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.053
Who'll tell you?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.363
Your body will tell you.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.330
How will it tell you?

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.730
You'll be the right weight,
you'll have lots of energy,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.600
you sleep well.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.477
There's your sign.

00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:53.767
What's the old Aussie saying?

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.620
"If you're on a good thing, stick to it."

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.837
What does the Bible say
in 1 Thessalonians 5:21?

00:13:59.837 --> 00:14:04.460
"Prove all things and hold
fast to that which is good."

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.510
In other words, if it works, do it.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.333
That's why I do it. It works.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:15.193
But most people stop the
fat because of cholesterol.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.830
And this is a good time
to look at cholesterol

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.910
because your liver makes cholesterol.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.260
And it makes cholesterol
according to the demands

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.903
that the body puts on it.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.270
And 80% of the cholesterol
that your liver makes

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.063
is made from glucose.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.820
And 20% of the cholesterol
that your liver makes

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.770
is made from fat.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.233
Now this illustration alone shows you,

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:46.220
it's not the butter on the bread,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.720
it's the bread under the
butter that's the problem.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.773
It's not the fat.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.619
Yes, there's a lot of
problems with butter today,

00:14:55.619 --> 00:14:56.850
(laughs)

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.120
because of the cows that it came from.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.730
I put olive oil on my bread.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.710
My husband puts avocado on his bread.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.000
In fact, most of the time
I put both on my bread.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.050
'Cause remember fat doesn't make you fat.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.550
So, let me show you the two
different types of cholesterol.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.230
You've got HDL, which is
high-density lipoprotein,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.690
and you've got LDL,
low-density lipoprotein.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.950
HDL's role in the body
is that of a carrier.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.930
It carries excess
cholesterol out of the blood

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.030
and back to the liver.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.830
That's why it's called the good guy.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.293
LDL is the repairer and the rebuilder.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.660
Unfortunately, it's called the bad guy.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.990
But what you've gotta remember,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.560
is the body doesn't make anything bad.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.270
It has a role in the body.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.750
It has another role, and
it delivers cholesterol

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.900
to the brain.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.263
And your brain loves cholesterol.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.070
So let's have a look at how
these two work in the body,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.500
particularly in the blood.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.270
So here's your artery.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.250
And because of its high
density, HDL's in the middle.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.123
And because of its low
density, LDL is on the edge.

00:16:13.771 --> 00:16:17.095
There's an interesting book
that I've read recently.

00:16:17.095 --> 00:16:18.720
It was only written about a year ago.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.110
It's called "Put Your
Heart in Your Mouth,"

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.200
by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.360
She's well known for her
gut and psychology book.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.340
She spends about three chapters showing

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.700
that the cause of heart disease

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.880
is damage to the arterial walls.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.980
So what damages the arterial wall?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.740
They're the endothelial cells.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.180
Cigarettes, there's four thousand
chemicals in a cigarette,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.313
and those chemicals damage the artery.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.160
The chemicals in our food,
in our cleaning products,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.928
in our shampoos, in our
conditioners, in our moisturizers,

00:16:54.928 --> 00:16:58.433
they're damaging the arterial wall.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.250
Mercury.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.299
Mercury damages the arterial wall.

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.990
It's found in fish, it's
found in the flu vaccine,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.270
and it's found in the mercury
fillings in our mouth.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.173
Mold.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.880
Mold is toxic.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.320
Mold gets into your blood,

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.370
it can cause holes in the arterial walls.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.910
A high-wheat, high-sugar diet,
creating a lot of glucose.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.910
That sticky glucose connects
with protein molecules,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.480
and sticks to the wall of the arteries.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.503
So the high-carb diet can do it.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.800
Alcohol and high sugar just feed it.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.930
Who's gonna plug up the holes?

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.763
Students?

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.760
The repairer and the rebuilder.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.170
The repairer and the rebuilder comes along

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.470
and plugs up the holes.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.050
Now, the person doesn't realize

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.380
that the mold in the
house is killing them.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.990
They don't really believe what it says

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.093
on the packet of the cigarettes.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.810
They don't realize that the chemicals

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.940
that they're cleaning
their bathrooms with,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.180
that are in their food.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.460
And so, what's happening
is the damage continues.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.270
They don't realize that the
mercury fillings in their mouth

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.320
are damaging the walls.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.350
So, what's happening in the arteries?

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.950
What's it called?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.953
Atherosclerosis.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.910
To blame cholesterol for heart disease

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.277
is like blaming the fire
trucks for the fire.

00:18:26.277 --> 00:18:29.860
"Well, they must cause the
fire, they're always there."

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.257
It's like blaming the
ambulances for the accidents.

00:18:33.257 --> 00:18:34.270
"Well, they must be causing them.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.720
"They're the one common
denominator at every accident."

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.163
Can you see that theory?

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.020
Let me tell you the books

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.770
that we have at our health retreat.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.980
One book is called "The
Great Cholesterol Deception,"

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.730
by Dr. Peter Dingle.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.590
Another book is called "The
Great Cholesterol Con,"

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.350
by Dr. Malcolm Kendrick.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.430
Another book, which is an e-book,

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.580
is "The Great Cholesterol
Lie," by Dr. Dwight Lundell.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.540
He's a cardiovascular surgeon.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.940
He's performed ten thousand bypasses.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.377
And he's written a book,
"The Great Cholesterol Lie."

00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:09.048
"The Great Cholesterol
Myth," by Jonny Bowden.

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:12.329
We've got another one called
"The Great Cholesterol Hoax,"

00:19:12.329 --> 00:19:14.270
"101 Lies,"

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.053
We're running out of words.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.157
Dr. Malcolm Kendrick, in his book,

00:19:22.157 --> 00:19:23.520
"The Great Cholesterol Con,"

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.083
he says there is no proof.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.863
We've been deceived.

00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:36.405
So, when they increase the
cholesterol lowering medication,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.070
which so many are on, sadly,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.570
what does that do?

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.240
Well, what it does is it
blocks the pathway in the liver

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.350
that the liver uses to make cholesterol.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.810
But it's the same pathway
that the liver uses

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.450
to make coenzyme Q10.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.900
What's coenzyme Q10?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.430
It's your heart protective enzyme.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.281
So, someone can go on
cholesterol lowering medication,

00:19:57.281 --> 00:20:01.340
to reduce their heart disease,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.953
and increase their risk.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.620
Surely that's reducing heart disease.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.543
Has it? No.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.177
Something else is happening.

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:12.840
Are you ready for the side effects

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.950
of cholesterol lowering medication?

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.620
Dementia, Alzheimer's,
memory loss, muscle wasting,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.610
and they've just added
another one, breast cancer.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.403
Because your sex hormones
are made from cholesterol.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.680
So, if you're on cholesterol
lowering medication,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.450
you can stop immediately,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.890
there will be a side effect.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.990
Your memory will return.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.470
(audience laughing)

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.523
That's the only side effect.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.400
17 cases, 17 hundred cases of Alzheimer's

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.733
are being diagnosed
every week in Australia.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.930
Okay, so cholesterol lowering medication,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.283
fat free diet, margarine,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.320
surely that's reduced heart disease.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.153
No.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.423
Because it's a false theory.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.570
In his research, Ancel Keys,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.680
he had to eliminate the Maasai.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.470
They live on blood, milk and meat.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.213
Zero heart disease.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.113
He had to put them out of the equation,

00:21:15.113 --> 00:21:17.670
they don't prove his theory.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.323
Is that true science?

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.620
Mind you, they don't live long,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.820
because their poor gut
can't handle no fiber.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.520
But they don't have heart disease.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.620
We've been spun a lie, I'm
sorry to break the news to you.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.483
Well, they've tried something else.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.623
This is another great deception.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.910
When I was in America, two years ago,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.230
running a health retreat in Alabama,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.393
we had a nutritionist do
our program, she was 69.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.780
She was in very good nic
for her age, still working.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.977
She said, "I have the
advantage of being trained

00:21:56.977 --> 00:21:59.110
"in university 40 years ago."

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.667
She said, "forty years ago, we were taught

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:06.840
"that a cholesterol level
under 300 was perfectly safe."

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.950
Now, on Australian standards,
that would be about 7.5.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.070
Did you hear that?

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.303
Perfectly safe.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.600
She said, "they've dropped the levels."

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.583
In America, it's now 200.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.190
Anyone over 200 is put on
cholesterol lowering medication.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.710
What would that be in Australia?

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.193
Is that 5.5?

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.063
Is that true?

00:22:31.063 --> 00:22:33.100
Anyone over 5.5 in Australia

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.283
is put on cholesterol lowering medication?

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.610
Okay, so cholesterol lowering medication,

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.610
fat free diet, they've lowered the levels,

00:22:44.658 --> 00:22:47.600
surely that has reduced heart disease.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.003
Has it? Not at all.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.890
Not at all.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.600
It's still the number one killer.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.720
Yet, Alzheimer's come up,
mental illness has come up,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.470
because your brain cannot
function without cholesterol.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.420
So they set up the Framingham heart study

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.940
to prove that high cholesterol
cause heart disease.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.360
I like this study,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.150
because it wasn't set up by
the pharmaceutical companies,

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.410
or the dairy industries,
or the meat industries,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.650
or the grain and cereal industries.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.440
It's an independent study.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.780
Little town, 30,000 people,
been done over 30 years.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.700
Some die, more are put on.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.030
And it's not proving that high cholesterol

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.060
cause heart disease.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.060
They're finding that people

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.510
with low and medium cholesterol levels

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.243
are still having heart attacks.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.290
Notice that that doesn't
reach the newspaper.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.160
Because the pharmaceutical companies

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.770
are making a lot of money out of people

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.760
on cholesterol lowering medication.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.040
'Cause if you're put on
cholesterol lowering medication,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.790
how long are you told you're on it for?

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.623
Life.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.500
But do you know what
this study is showing?

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.063
People with high cholesterol
levels don't get Alzheimer's.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.679
Would you like me to give you
a moment's silence for that?

00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:15.560
(audience chuckling)

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.373
Because what does your brain need?

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.730
Cholesterol.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.943
Can't function without it.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.023
Sorry, we're being spun a lie.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.000
So, you can see how
important the liver is.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.110
It makes cholesterol.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.490
It makes cholesterol
according to the demands.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.700
And our body need it.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.237
Dr. Malcolm Kendrick
said "for the first time,

00:24:38.237 --> 00:24:41.897
"normal levels of a normal,
vital, body substance,

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:43.747
"is being called a disease."

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.210
But what I'd like to look at now,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.273
is what happens with everything
that comes out of your body.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.570
And I'd like to show you what happens

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.030
at Misty Mountain Health Retreat,

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.790
when our guests fast for two days.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.740
You see, when you fast for two days,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.090
we serve fresh fruit and
vegetable juices every two hours.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:10.280
When you fast for two
days, digestion stops.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.680
And we're not giving
enough fuel to run on.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.600
And so your body starts
to break down fat stores.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.880
And something else a
little bit more sinister

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.940
is being released.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.030
It's your fat soluble toxins

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:26.380
that have been stored in our
fat cells over many a year.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.400
And your body cannot
release fat soluble toxins

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.850
in a fat soluble state.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.750
They have to be broken down
to a water soluble state,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.032
then they can be released.

00:25:36.032 --> 00:25:38.480
So let me show you how this happens.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.610
This is the symbol of
the fat soluble toxin.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.960
Phase 1:

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.340
So our guests, on Monday,
when they're fasting,

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.920
their liver goes into
phase one of the breakdown.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.230
In phase one, the liver
takes this fat soluble toxin,

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.203
and it breaks it down to a metabolite.

00:25:57.203 --> 00:26:00.763
A metabolite simply means
first stage of metabolism.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.720
This metabolite is a lot more complicated

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.500
that it originally was.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.283
It's actually highly volatile.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.723
This metabolite creates
a lot of free radicals.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.653
And free radicals damage the tissues.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.434
This metabolite can sometimes
be a hundred times more toxic

00:26:27.434 --> 00:26:29.550
than it originally was,

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.093
especially in the breakdown of alcohol.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.160
You might say, "well
what's the liver done?"

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.820
It's just created something
worse than it originally was.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.713
It's process.

00:26:41.713 --> 00:26:44.470
It's like when I clean
out my kitchen cupboards.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.440
My kitchen looks a hundred times messier

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.409
than when I started.

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:49.240
It's a process.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.130
But your liver has certain
needs at this phase.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.740
It needs antioxidants.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.740
Antioxidants are given a
nickname: free radical scavengers.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.990
So what are your most potent antioxidants?

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.720
Beta carotene, that's found in your orange

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.660
and your green colored vegetables,

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.660
and vitamin C, ascorbic
acid with bioflavanoids,

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.500
and vitamin E, a fat soluble vitamin.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.940
We have to be eating fat to
get our fat soluble vitamins.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.940
Now, within 36 hours of
beginning a detox, a fast,

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.543
phase two kicks in.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.380
In phase two the liver takes
this highly volatile metabolite

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.850
and it joins it together with amino acids.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.500
The union of the amino acids
and the toxic metabolite

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.170
creates the water soluble state.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.670
And remember, as a water soluble state,

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.250
it can be easily released out of the body.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.133
And it's symbol is a wave in a box.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.873
Phase three happens in
conjunction with phase two.

00:28:04.963 --> 00:28:09.840
In phase three, your liver
takes this water soluble state

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.680
and releases it out via your urine,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.200
releases it out via your sweat glands,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.340
releases it out via your colon.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.510
And that's why, at Misty
Mountain Health Retreat,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.850
every afternoon, our
guests go in a steam sauna

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.593
and have a good sweat.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.763
Important part of the detox.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.110
So, what I have shown you here,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.013
has only been known since 2002.

00:28:38.313 --> 00:28:40.970
And what I have shown you explains why

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.660
you are better to do
two days juices a week,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.430
or two days a fortnight,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.810
rather than one long fast.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:54.310
Because if you do, say, a ten day fast,

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:59.310
your liver is gonna be releasing
too many fat soluble toxins

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.180
creating too many metabolites,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.833
and you can get quite sick.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.880
So, at Misty Mountain Health Retreat,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.850
we supply the antioxidants

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.010
by supplying fresh
vegetable and fruit juices

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.110
every two hours.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.290
There's all your antioxidants.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.913
Every second juice, we
serve a protein powder.

00:29:21.162 --> 00:29:26.162
And this protein drink contains
protein made out of pea.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.420
It's got little bit of coconut
cream and almond milk in it,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.833
it's quite delicious.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.330
Phase three requires fat.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:37.740
So, every protein drink,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.570
we put a bit of coconut cream in there

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.860
to provide the saturated fat
to keep those cells supple

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.620
to be able to do the process.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.540
I was giving this lecture
on year in America,

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.447
and a man said "this is fascinating,

00:29:51.447 --> 00:29:53.730
"the three phase of the liver detox."

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.237
But he said, "this is
not for your lay people."

00:29:56.237 --> 00:29:58.010
"This is for your academics."

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.693
I said, "lay people have
livers too, you know."

00:30:00.693 --> 00:30:02.960
(audience chuckling)

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.070
This explains why we need more protein

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.460
than any generation that
lived on the planet.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.910
We're dealing with more
environmental poisons

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.403
than any generation.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.660
I thank God, that he's given us a liver,

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.530
that has the ability to detoxify us

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.483
from environmental poisons.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.710
And in Psalm 104, verse 14,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.900
the Bible says "God gave
herbs for the service of man."

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.760
There are herbs that will specifically

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.180
heal and cleanse the liver.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.763
And that is St. Mary's
thistle, and dandelion,

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.187
and a sweet bitter is ginger.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.700
In my book, "Self Heal by Design,"

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.363
I have devoted a whole chapter

00:31:02.363 --> 00:31:06.060
on the three phase of the liver detox.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.330
But also in that chapter,
I give a list of the herbs

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.710
that are specific to help heal the liver.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.090
Remember the liver's a recoverable organ.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.811
And it will recover if you
give it the right conditions.

00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:18.835
What's also contained in my book,

00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:23.183
is a liver detox that goes over five days.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.190
Because, remember,
cancer cannot get a hold

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.000
on the liver that's working well.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.430
And the liver is a recoverable organ.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.063
So, let's look after our livers.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.420
Now, we do have time for a few questions,

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.887
if there are any questions.

00:31:41.124 --> 00:31:43.624
