00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.520
In the Game of Thrones show, the three-eyed
raven is a pretty standard character.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.590
He’s like Obi-Wan or Dumbledore – a wise
old mentor who teaches a hero magic, and then

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.590
dies.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.779
But in the books, he has a rich backstory
– he was a warrior who fought his brothers,

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.349
a spymaster who ruled a kingdom, and a leader
of the Night's Watch, who becomes one of the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.169
most powerful and mysterious characters in
the series.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.180
His grand plan involves the old gods and Azor
Ahai, Bran Stark and Jon Snow, maybe Daenerys,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.580
and Quaithe and even Euron Greyjoy.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.670
In the books, he’s called the three-eyed
crow – but his real name is Brynden Rivers.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.970
Brynden was born one hundred and twenty-five
years ago.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.810
The King of Westeros back then was Aegon the
Fourth Targaryen, a terrible, selfish, lustful

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.260
king . He was married to his sister Naerys
– cause the Targaryens love incest – and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260
they had a son called Daeron.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.230
But Aegon took many other women as lovers,
and fathered bastard children including Daemon

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Waters, Aegor Rivers, Shiera Seastar, and
Brynden Rivers – the man who would become

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.000
the three-eyed crow.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.600
Brynden was an albino, with pale skin, white
hair and red eyes.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.200
He had a winestain birthmark on his face that
was shaped kinda like a raven – so Brynden

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.370
was called Bloodraven.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.300
Brynden wasn’t as big and strong as his
half-brothers , but he was smart , and good

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.650
with a longbow.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.320
Brynden’s half-sister Shiera was famously
beautiful – and Brynden and Aegor competed

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.630
for her love.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.990
Shiera chose Brynden as her lover , but Brynden
and Aegor came to hate each other – Aegor

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.450
was called “Bittersteel” . Daemon, meanwhile,
was a golden boy who everyone loved – which

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.909
complicated politics.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.590
Cause when King Aegon died, his trueborn son
Daeron inherited the throne.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.850
But some people preferred Daemon.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.970
So with the help of Bittersteel, Daemon rebelled.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.630
He took the name Blackfyre, and fought a war
against Daeron for the throne.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.890
This was the first Blackfyre Rebellion, and
it ended with the Battle of the Redgrass Field.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.960
Brynden fought for Daeron and the loyalists
– he rained arrows on the Blackfyres, killing

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.099
Daemon and two of his sons . Then Bittersteel
attacked and fought a “duel” with Brynden.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.810
Brynden lost an eye in this fight – but
in the end, Aegor fled . So Brynden helped

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.450
to save the realm from Blackfyre rebels, but
to do it he killed his own half-brother Daemon

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.110
– kinslaying is a terrible crime in Westeros
. But Brynden is willing to bad things for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.760
the sake of the greater good – and for the
sake of defeating Bittersteel.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.060
Bittersteel went east, founded an army called
the Golden Company, and plotted with the surviving

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.510
Blackfyres.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.050
King Daeron later died in a plague, so Daeron’s
son Aerys became the new king . But Aerys

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.120
wasn’t much interested in being king – he
was obsessed with old books about magic and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.940
prophecy . So Aerys chose Brynden to be his
Hand of the King – and Brynden basically

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.740
ruled the realm for him .
Brynden was a spymaster, with a huge network

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.930
of informers.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.940
It was said that Bloodraven had a “thousand
eyes and one” – the one eye on his face,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.190
and the thousand eyes of his spies.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.840
Brynden watched for anyone who spoke treason
against the Targaryens – or supported the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.690
surviving Blackfyres.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.849
He was so focussed on the Blackfyres that
he ignored an ironborn invasion . And the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.090
realm also suffered from drought and other
problems.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.170
So many people hated Bloodraven – they called
him a kinslayer, a bastard, and a “sorcerer”

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.910
. Cause like Aerys, Brynden was known to study
magic . It was said that he and his lover

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.520
Shiera used sorcery to uncover secrets – and
that Brynden could “change his face” or

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.440
his shape . Which might actually be true.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.830
In a Game of Thrones prequel book, Daemon
Blackfyre’s son tries to start a second

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.440
Blackfyre rebellion – but Bloodraven’s
spies uncover the plot , with the help of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.599
a really suspicious guy called Maynard Plumm
. Plumm knows too much, he makes weird references

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.330
to Bloodraven, and there’s something strange
about his face . Plumm disappears from the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.620
story just before Bloodraven arrives . So
it’s strongly hinted that Maynard Plumm

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.380
is actually Bloodraven in disguise.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.650
Plumm wears a “moonstone brooch” , which
suggests that Bloodraven uses a glamour – the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.510
same kind of magic that Melisandre uses with
her ruby . So there’s truth to these rumours

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.020
– Bloodraven uses magic to spy and control
the kingdom.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.120
Years later, there was a Third Blackfyre Rebellion
– where Brynden beat Bittersteel again . And

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.520
after that, King Aerys died, and his brother
Maekar became king.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.370
Then when Maekar died, there was a succession
problem – cause most of Maekar’s children

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.800
were dead or dumb or– female.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.889
So Bloodraven called a big meeting to decide
who should be the next king . He even invited

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.720
a surviving Blackfyre to the council.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.020
Bloodraven pinky-promised that he totally
wouldn’t kill the Blackfyre when he arrived,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.830
and when he arrived, Bloodraven totally killed
him . The council chose Aegon the Fifth Targaryen,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.070
or Egg, to be king.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.100
And the first thing King Egg did was to arrest
Bloodraven.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.490
Cause if the Hand of the King goes round killing
people he promised not to kill, people would

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.100
stop trusting the government.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.659
Brynden argued “that he had sacrificed his
own … honor for the good of the realm”

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.910
. But still, he had to be punished.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.050
So he was sent to join the Night’s Watch
on the Wall – Maester Aemon joined the Watch

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.280
at the same time . Brynden eventually became
Lord Commander of the Watch, and led them

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.440
for years, until one day, he went off for
a ciggy and never came back – presumed dead

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.389
beyond the Wall . The next time we see Brynden,
it’s fifty years later, when Bran meets

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.500
him as the three-eyed crow.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.169
So what happened?

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.050
How did this Targaryen bastard become an ancient
tree wizard?

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.550
And what does he want?

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.750
Magic in Game of Thrones is connected to family
heritage, or blood.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.850
The Targaryen family, with the blood of Valyria,
are connected to dragons and fire magic.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.240
The Stark family, with the blood of the First
Men, are connected to the old gods, weirwood

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.150
trees and warging magic.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.930
Bloodraven is special because he has the blood
of both Valyria and the First Men – his

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.310
father is a Targaryen, and his mother is a
Blackwood.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.440
The Blackwood family descend from the First
Men, and their heraldry is a weirwood tree

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.630
– a symbol of the old gods.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.820
[] It’s hinted that Brynden was into the
old gods from early on.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.910
His longbow at the Redgrass Field was made
of weirwood . Brynden’s pale skin and red

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.070
eyes look just like a weirwood’s face, with
white bark and red sap eyes.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.620
And the rumours that Brynden could transform
into a dog and control wolves and spy with

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.759
crows sounds just like skinchanging powers
– like how Bran wargs into animals – maybe

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.060
young Brynden could that too.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.050
He might also have had green dreams – visions
of the future like Jojen has . And at the

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.759
Night’s Watch, Brynden might have seen the
threat of the white walkers.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:07.300
[] So Brynden was drawn north, beyond the
Wall, to a cave beneath a great weirwood tree.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.310
Brynden merged with the weirwood, its roots
growing through his body, extending his life,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.490
and heightening his power as a greenseer – which
means he skinchanges into animals, sees through

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.900
the eyes of trees, and has visions of future
and past . Brynden sat dreaming, watching,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.240
and scheming for fifty years, waiting for
Bran Stark.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.460
[] Apparently, Bran has a special destiny
as a greenseer like Brynden . So Brynden visits

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.460
Bran in dreams in the form of a three-eyed
crow, and tells him to fly, to wake his magic

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.210
, and he sends Jojen to take Bran north . Brynden
says Bran is important for the war against

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.450
the white walkers . And it looks like he’s
right – in the show, Bran uses his powers

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.380
to spy on the walkers with ravens, and he
has psychic contact with the Night King . It

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.039
looks like Brynden succeeds in empowering
Bran to fight for life against the night – but

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.639
Brynden’s influence goes much deeper.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:07.310
When Jon Snow joins the Night’s Watch, Lord
Commander Mormont has a pet raven.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.900
And the raven speaks – usually just repeating
words that it hears, but sometimes it seems

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.670
to understand what’s happening, and influences
the story.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.139
When the Watch elects a new Lord Commander,
the raven says “Snow, snow, snow”, and

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:24.900
lands on Jon’s shoulder – which helps
get Jon chosen as leader . The bird often

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.410
says “King” around Jon – in Book 5,
it says “King … Snow, Jon Snow” . And

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.840
just before that, the raven appears in a dream
Jon has, where he fights “dead men” with

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.539
a burning sword . So what’s happening here?

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.139
Many readers believe that this raven is controlled
from afar by Bloodraven.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.639
We do know that he uses birds to spy and enter
dreams.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:51.509
So he’s probably using this bird to spy
on the Night’s Watch, and to influence Jon.

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:57.310
Brynden not only helps Jon lead the Watch,
it looks like he wants Jon to be King of Westeros.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:02.279
Which might be why in Season 6, Brynden shows
Bran Jon’s birth – as the son of Lyanna

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:07.379
Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, Jon is “the
heir to the Iron Throne” . And he has the

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:11.509
blood of both the First Men and Valyria, just
like Bloodraven.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:16.889
This dream of the dead and a burning sword
sounds like Azor Ahai, a hero prophesied to

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.819
save the world from darkness.

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:22.869
Brynden’s interest in this prophecy might
come from his Targaryen side.

00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:27.889
Cause as Brynden says “There have always
been Targaryens who dreamed of things to come”

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:30.209
– who had visions of the future.

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:33.209
And many Targaryens are especially interested
in Azor Ahai.

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:39.379
Rhaegar was into this prophecy – it might
have been why he ran off with Lyanna and fathered

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.379
Jon.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:44.540
Rhaegar’s parents Aerys and Rhaella got
married because a witch said that Azor Ahai

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.879
“would be born of their line” . Aemon
was into this prophecy , and Brynden served

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:53.509
with Aemon on the Wall for nineteen years
. King Aerys was into prophecy , and Shiera

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:58.959
was into “ancient scrolls” . So, much
of Brynden’s family was into prophecy, especially

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.189
Azor Ahai.

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.750
So it’s likely that Brynden was also into
this stuff.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.439
With all of his wisdom and visions as a Targaryen
and a greenseer, Brynden must have worked

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:13.300
out that Jon is probably Azor Ahai, and this
explains why Brynden helps him.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.240
In fact, this might explain a lot of what
Brynden does.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.319
Judging by Aerys and Rhaegar’s marriages,
it seems that a particular Targaryen bloodline

00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.980
is expected to produce Azor Ahai.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.550
Maybe the reason why Brynden was so focussed
on stopping the Blackfyres wasn’t just politics

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.040
or beef with Bittersteel, it was Brynden trying
to protect the special bloodline that he believed

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.829
led to the hero who’d save the world.

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:42.740
This might have been why King Aerys refused
to have children , why Egg was chosen as King,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.510
even why Egg married a Blackwood with the
blood of the First Men.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.389
This might all have been Bloodraven’s influence,
guiding the Targaryens on a hundred-year Bene

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.089
Gesseritine eugenic quest to breed Azor Ahai.

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:59.869
There’s no knowing how deep this goes, but
at the very least it looks like Brynden helps

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:05.629
Jon because he believes that Jon is the hero
Westeros needs – the rightful king, Azor

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:11.009
Ahai, the hero who’ll save the world – with
the help of the greenseer Bran.

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:16.350
Brynden is combining the power of the Targaryens
and the old gods, fire and ice, to save the

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.320
world from the Long Night.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.579
But – what about Daenerys?

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:25.869
Daenerys obviously has a big part to play
in the song of ice and fire.

00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:30.410
Like Jon, she’s a Targaryen who could fit
the prophecy of Azor Ahai, and is making a

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.239
claim on the Iron Throne.

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:34.720
So why doesn’t Brynden help her?

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.299
Dany spends most of the series in the east,
across the narrow sea, which might be Brynden’s

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.339
blind spot.

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.959
The magic of greensight seems limited to the
lands where weirwoods grow, so Brynden might

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:47.769
not know that this distant dragon queen is
legit.

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:52.230
Or, maybe, Brynden’s already got someone
on the job.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.389
In Book and Season 2, Daenerys meets Quaithe,
a mysterious masked woman who visits Dany

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.910
in dreams and gives her cryptic advice.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.589
There’s a theory that Quaithe is actually
Brynden’s sister-lover Shiera Seastar.

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:10.930
Both these characters are mysterious magical
women associated with stars . [] And of course,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.869
Shiera was born a hundred years ago, so like
Brynden, she’d need some magic to keep her

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:21.859
alive – and as it happens, both Shiera and
her mother are said to use magic to preserve

00:12:21.859 --> 00:12:27.480
their beauty . Maybe Shiera uses magic to
extend her life as Quaithe.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.959
And the mask Quaithe wears might hide Shiera’s
famous beauty.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:37.389
So, there’s no strong evidence here, but
it would super cool if Quaithe is Shiera – after

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:42.430
all these years still working with Brynden,
using sorcery to spy and influence, just as

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.040
they did in King’s Landing, but now at a
greater scale.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.369
Brynden watches Jon and Bran in the west,
while Shiera watches Dany in the east – the

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:57.889
world of ice and fire guided by the most magical
and incestuous power couple in the series.

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:00.759
Brynden’s influence could really be godlike.

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:04.879
He can enter dreams, see through trees, control
animals.

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:08.779
So it’s possible that Brynden sent these
direwolf pups to keep an eye on the Starks

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:13.120
. He might have sent the boar that killed
King Robert, and the bear that Tormund fucked

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.860
. The weirwood dream that led Jaime to Brienne
. Beric’s magic in that weirwood cave , the

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.629
Ghost of High Heart . Coldhands and Sam , and
Joramun’s Horn – there are a million little

00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:29.649
ways that Brynden might influence the story
… as well as through Dany and Bran and Jon

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:32.779
and the last hundred years of Targaryen monarchy.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:38.199
Brynden is the Westerosilluminati, pulling
the strings, controlling everything – and

00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:41.069
it’s all towards the goal of saving the
world.

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:43.109
So Brynden’s… a hero.

00:13:43.109 --> 00:13:45.779
A good guy – right?

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:49.290
Bloodraven is aa spooky motherfucker.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.990
He looks like a “corpse”, a “ghastly
statue … of twisted wood, old bone, and

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.759
rotted wool” , living in a dark cave that
is literally littered with skulls.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:02.399
He hangs out with a corpse-man and some creepy
forest elves.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:07.649
He tells Bran to “Never fear the darkness”,
“Darkness will make you strong” . He often

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:10.589
sounds more like the Emperor than like Obi-Wan.

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:14.290
So if it looks like a bad guy, and quacks
like a bad guy…

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.429
Is Bloodraven a bad guy?

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:18.699
There are theories that he’s secretly evil.

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:23.179
Like, maybe Brynden only wants Bran because
Brynden’s old body is dying, and he plans

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:28.429
to steal Bran’s young body – magic bodysnatching
is a thing in Book 5.

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:32.749
Others think that Brynden is secretly helping
the white walkers wipe out humanity.

00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:37.669
Melisandre does have a vision of Brynden where
she thinks he’s with the evil Great Other

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:41.749
. And there is the possibility that Brynden
is manipulated by the children of the forest,

00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:46.709
and their psychic weirwood hivemind – author
George Martin has written stories about evil

00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.179
seductive alien hiveminds.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:53.749
[] But what we’ve seen in the text suggests
that Brynden is something more interesting

00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:58.720
than a bad guy – he’s a guy who does bad
things for good reasons.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.139
He kills his half-brother to end a war.

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.680
He lies and betrays to keep the peace.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.459
He spies, assassinates, manipulates – all
for the sake of the realm.

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:10.720
So Brynden’s not straight-up evil.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.499
He’s something almost scarier – a man
who gets good outcomes at any cost.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:23.410
Like, with Bran, Brynden empowers a hero to
save the world – but he also lures a crippled

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:28.089
eight year old boy on a dangerous journey
that kills his friends to change Bran into

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.929
something he never wanted to become.

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:35.829
Bran comes north hoping that Brynden would
be a nice wizard who’d “fix his legs”

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:40.379
. He never signed up to become a tree boy,
but by the time he arrives he hardly has a

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:41.419
choice.

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:46.290
Brynden manipulates Bran – at one point,
he magically edits Bran’s memories so that

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.749
he forgets Jaime crippling him . Brynden’s
agent Coldhands secretly feeds Bran human

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:56.559
flesh, and possibly also dead body of Jojen
– go watch that video.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:01.910
Also, in the show, a side-effect of Bran’s
power is that he becomes robotic and dehumanised

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:07.749
– Meera says it’s like Bran died . So,
yeah, Brynden does terrible things.

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:11.449
But what makes him an interesting character
is that he does these bad things for good

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:14.729
reasons – he’s trying to save the world.

00:16:14.729 --> 00:16:19.889
Game of Thrones often explores this idea of
ends justifying means.

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:23.979
When Stannis considers killing a child to
win the realm, he asks “what is the life

00:16:23.979 --> 00:16:26.729
of one … boy against a kingdom?”

00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:33.259
And Davos says “Everything” . If we sacrifice
our basic humanity and compassion, what kind

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.569
of world are we even saving?

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:40.989
Brynden’s extreme means may lead to unforeseen
consequences.

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:46.800
In Bran’s dream in Book 1, Bran falls towards
spikes of ice, and Brynden tells Bran to “Fly

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.739
or die” – to force him to wake his magic.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:52.129
Bran succeeds, and flies over the spikes.

00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:56.939
But he sees “the bones of a thousand other
dreamers impaled” below.

00:16:56.939 --> 00:17:01.350
Which might suggest that Brynden has tried
to teach magic to other people this way.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.980
He has been sitting in his cave for fifty
years – maybe in that time, he’s tried

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.079
other students.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.529
[] And one theory suggests that Brynden taught
Euron Greyjoy.

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:17.600
Euron in the books is a mystical, scary figure
– his ship is crewed by mutes, the deck

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.179
painted red to hide the blood.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:25.600
He has a magic horn called Dragonbinder, and
he captures and tortures priests, warlocks,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.400
and pregnant women – he’s planning a mass
blood sacrifice to transform himself into

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.230
a Lovecraftian god.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.419
“These are the last days”, he says, “when
the world shall be broken and remade.

00:17:37.419 --> 00:17:42.540
A new god shall be born from the graves and
charnel pits”.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.450
The inspiration for this horrific apocalypse
might inadvertently come from Bloodraven.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.880
Cause there are hints of a connection between
Euron and Brynden.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.360
Euron calls himself “the Crow’s Eye”
, and his banner is a single red eye crowned

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.059
by crows – which might refer to the single
red eye of Brynden the three-eyed crow.

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:06.500
In Book 4, Euron says that when he was a boy,
he dreamed that he could fly.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.120
That if he just tries, if he leaps from a
tower, he might fly . And this is just what

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.890
happens to Bran – he falls from a tower,
and Brynden visits his dream and tells him

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.669
to try to fly.

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:23.899
So maybe Brynden had seen magic potential
in young Euron, and made contact hoping to

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:25.429
train him as a greenseer.

00:18:25.429 --> 00:18:31.380
But when he entered Euron’s dream and flung
the boy at psychic ice spikes, something went

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.210
wrong, and Euron went rogue.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:40.030
Maybe seeing the heart of winter, staring
deep into the void, broke Euron’s mind somehow.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:45.340
Maybe seeing the threat of the walkers only
inspired Euron to bring the Long Night.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.299
Maybe this tantalising taste of arcane power
led to Euron’s obsession with collecting

00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:57.519
magic artefacts, warlocks, priests, crowns,
and exploiting them to bring about his apotheosis.

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:02.679
In the next book, Euron is set to bring some
serious grimdark shit on Westeros.

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:06.910
And this might not have happened if it weren’t
for Bloodraven being so single-minded in his

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:11.389
goals that he goes round psychically traumatising
children.

00:19:11.389 --> 00:19:16.200
You can make a similar argument about Brynden’s
political career – his harsh control of

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.340
Westeros may have just fed more discontent
and rebellion.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.669
So you can see Bloodraven’s character as
a criticism of the idea of ends justifying

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:26.669
means.

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:33.490
Maybe if we forget compassion and caution
we may only create more darkness.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:38.460
A lot of Bloodraven’s early history is told
in the Dunk and Egg prequel stories, collected

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.610
in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:45.220
It tells the story of the Blackfyre conspiracy
uncovered by Bloodraven and Maynard Plumm

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.470
– plotting and scheming and talking smack
a hundred years before the main series.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.970
The Dunk and Egg stories are short, self-contained
tales of Westeros that take just a few hours

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.720
