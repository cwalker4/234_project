00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.500
The Separatist Droid Army was the largest
of its kind, making up the vast majority of

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.269
the ground forces of the Confederacy of Independent
Systems during the Clone Wars.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.259
But despite its grand size and power, such
a massive army was reduced into nothing after

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.070
Vader gave out a signal from the Separatist
High Command center which ordered a complete

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.480
shutdown of all battle droids.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.360
While this signal ended the Separatists’
ability to wage war on a galactic scale, it

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.820
didn’t end some remnants of its movement
from continuing the fight many years after

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.990
the war ended, as many former military commanders
and government leaders still continued to

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.440
resist the newly formed Empire.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.590
This group was known as the Separatist Holdouts,
which ranged from isolated squads of droids

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.690
that never received the shutdown signal to
commited commanders who restarted droid factories

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.390
in order to rebuild the army itself.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
First in Canon, the droid army shutdown caused
panic among the lower command structure of

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.969
the Separatist military, with many of them
fleeing into the Western Reaches of the galaxy

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.360
which was a region that still held strong
pro-separatist sentiments and in which the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.780
Republic didn’t have a firm foothold in.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.500
When the Empire was established, it declared
vast military campaigns in the Western Reaches,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.951
justifying its aggressive advancements as
a need to fully wipe out the remaining Separatist

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:22.100
elements.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.740
These early campaigns saw widespread praise
from most of the general public, as they viewed

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.159
the crackdowns as final stepping stones into
ensuring peace and stability into the galaxy

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.490
once more.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.840
As the Separatists started to get cornered,
some of them began to stage terrorist attacks

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.730
on pro-Imperial worlds.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.030
These Separatist terror attacks were like
candy to the militarists of the Empire, which

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.299
used them to justify the vast increase and
expansion of the Imperial military and the

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.799
occupation efforts on many planets.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.090
As time went on however, some portions of
the public began to question whether or not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.799
the Separatist holdouts were really as great
a threat as the Empire made them out to be.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.840
Others even wondered if the Empire itself
staged some of the terrorist attacks as a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.099
means to increase its authority over the affected
regions.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.780
We know of at least one case where this was
somewhat true, where an Imperial testing facility

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.650
ended up blowing up due to an experiment involving
Kyber crystals went wrong, which was later

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.670
blamed on a Separatist anarchist terror group
to cover up the research of the crystals.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.810
About a decade after the end of the Clone
Wars, nearly any real threat of the Separatist

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.680
Holdouts was destroyed by the Empire.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.370
The very few leaders that survived went into
hiding, with some taking on the life of crime.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
Some eventually joined the Rebel Alliance
once the Rebellion became widespread.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.870
A few isolated battle droid squads remained,
but they were usually wiped out whenever they

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.870
contacted the outside world.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.300
Those that weren’t continued their previous
orders of maintaining a defensive position

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.069
on whatever outpost they were until they ran
out of power, with a few even forming mini

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.530
droid societies overtime.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.379
Other droids were reactivated and used by
either the Empire or the Rebellion for various

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.420
purposes.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.110
In Legends, the existence of the Separatist
Holdouts was very similar to their Canon counterpart,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.100
with the main differences being that they
lasted longer and seemed to have been at a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.780
greater size, plus we get more more detailed
examples of some of them.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.440
After the shutdown of the droid army, many
Separatist worlds went on the defensive as

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.530
they fortified their positions and remained
inside their shielded cities and outposts.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.319
Many of these worlds were within the Western
Reaches and Outer Rim regions of the galaxy.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.879
Hoping to reclaim these territories under
the Imperial banner, the Empire continued

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.409
and even accelerated the former Republic’s
mass militarization efforts.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.879
The Reconquest of the Rim was the biggest
campaign of the Empire in its effort to retake

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.540
the Separatist worlds, as well as destroying
bands of pirates and slavers that were allowed

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.100
to reign free during the unstable times of
the Clone Wars.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.049
This campaign was met with wide praise from
the general public over the course of its

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.260
2 years as order and peace was brought back
to the galaxy.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.820
Actually many of the generals and admirals
that led this campaign became galactic heroes

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.280
to the citizens of the core worlds.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.049
One notable battle was on the planet Acherin,
where the Separatists leaders of the world

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.089
actually protected a Jedi who survived Order
66 and sought refugee.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.710
After refusing to surrender and give up the
Jedi, Acherin underwent massive bombardment

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.680
campaigns from the Empire, which saw the death
of thousands of civilians and the destruction

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.650
of its biggest cities.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.960
Despite this, the Separatist leaders and the
Jedi survivor were able to escape with the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.509
help of Obi Wan.

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.469
Another notable Separatist holdout was the
Nosaurian cell, known as the New Plympto resistance.

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.860
The natives of the planet continued to fight
their invaders, who now were under the Imperial

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.860
banner.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.370
They too were led by a surviving Jedi Master,
named Dass Jennir.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.240
Although this resistance group was able to
take down an impressive number of Imperial

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.379
troops, they ultimately lost and met severe
consequences for their actions, as all the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.389
soldiers were executed on the spot regardless
of their surrender.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.189
Later the Empire tracked down the families
of all the soldiers and forced them into slavery

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.689
as further punishment for their resistance
as an example to the rest of the galaxy.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.330
Perhaps the one most people are familiar with
is the Gizor Dellso holdout on Mustafar, where

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.779
a surviving Geonosian restarted a droid factory
on the planet in an effort to rebuild the

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.949
droid army and its fleet in an attempt to
overthrow the Empire.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.050
He was able to amass quite a considerable
force, including a full blown fleet of droid

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.180
starfighters and even a few old Separatist
capital ships.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.710
The 501st was sent to wipe him and his forces
out, but met resistance far greater than they

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.439
initially predicted.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.240
Despite this, the 501st was able to punch
through the naval blockade and land on the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.099
main droid platforms, taking control of enough
of the sector to implant an orbital strike

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.289
beacon that signaled the Star Destroyer overhead
to bombard the factory into total destruction.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.550
This was the last major Separatist holdout
that held any real threat toward the Galactic

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.550
Empire.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.051
A few squads of battle droids still remained
activated in the galaxy here and there, but

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:16.499
they tended to pose very little threat.

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:21.629
The largest grouping of still active droids
were encountered during a skirmish on Geonosis

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.389
between Imperial and Rebel forces, during
which they discovered a core ship that still

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.360
contained activated battle droids.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.939
They were destroyed in the aftermath however.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:35.399
Once the Rebel Alliance formed, many surviving
Separatist holdouts joined the Alliance to

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.140
restore the Republic, offering the rebellion
their men in arms and the few remaining separatist

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:54.349
ships they still had at their disposal.
