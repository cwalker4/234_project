Reviewer: Fatima Zahra El Hafa

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.232
I'd like for you all
to transport in time with me.

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:23.122
We're going to go back to 1932.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:28.050
So my mother went
with her family to a house in 1932,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.401
and she told me about going up the stairs.

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:34.391
I'm taking a little break to the right
and there was a room there.

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:36.769
There were flowers.
There were people talking.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.641
She was little,
so she's looking up at everybody.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:44.882
And the dearly departed was there,
laid out on a chair between two boards

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:48.943
between, well, he wasn't that big,
one board, two chairs.

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:53.932
How many of you have seen
something like that?

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:58.121
Yes, if you're of a certain age, perhaps.

00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:00.772
We did have a few hands raised. Fabulous.

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:04.303
We've taken death out of the home,
and when we took death out of the home,

00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:08.162
we stopped learning about dying
and what to do about it.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:11.113
And we stopped learning
how to do something

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.403
or what to do [when] we get scared.

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:17.279
And when we get scared of something,
very often we stop talking about it.

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.803
So we have in this country...

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:22.073
We don't talk about death
and dying very often.

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:24.323
I'm a death educator
and a death researcher,

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.113
and that makes me a little crazy.

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:28.903
So we're going to talk
about death and dying today.

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:31.523
I want to start by telling you
about my mother.

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:35.963
My mother opted to go on hospice in 2005

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.713
and she and I had
a lot of frank conversations.

00:01:38.713 --> 00:01:41.073
I said to her one afternoon,

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:44.163
"Mom, you may have some visitors
when it's your time to go.

00:01:44.163 --> 00:01:46.784
You may have angels or family members.

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:49.953
I don't know who's going to show up
but somebody may show up.

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:52.373
Will you tell me if somebody comes?"

00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:55.184
And she's walking down the hall
and she looks over shoulder

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:57.564
and she said, "It depends on who it is."

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:58.864
(Laughter)

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:01.344
OK, I have no idea what that means.

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:04.574
Four months later,
she was in the hospital bed,

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:08.044
in the living room at her house,
and her eyes were closed

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.614
and I was watching her track something,
something underneath her eyelids.

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:13.613
I said, "Mom, what do you see?"

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:17.064
She said, "Daddy Charlie, grandmother,

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:19.769
mother and daddy,
uncle Claude, aunt Nala."

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.455
She has a beautiful smile in her face.

00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:24.134
I said, "Where are they?"

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:27.685
"Walking up the road from the farmhouse."

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.985
My brother Jim
had been gone about 13 years.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:34.406
He had died some 13 years beforehand
and I expected him to be there.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.676
I had had a dream

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:39.535
that he was sitting in a chair,
his legs crossed, reading a book.

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:41.815
So I said, "Mom, where's Jim?"

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:46.075
"Oh, he's been right here."

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:47.345
The night she died,

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.525
my mom was reaching up
towards something I couldn't see,

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.575
and I didn't know then that
that was part of deathbed phenomenon

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:55.224
until I began my research.

00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:57.425
And here's some other things I learned.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:03:00.596
For six centuries, anecdotal accounts

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:05.037
and a little bit of research
have detailed the auditory visual

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:08.907
and tactile experiences
of those nearing death.

00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:13.877
Most often people are met
by friends or family members.

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:16.916
Their purpose seems to be
to help the dying person

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:19.076
with the death experience.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.436
And most often
these visions are comforting.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:22.856
People see angels.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:26.286
People see religious entities
that are important to them culturally.

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:30.436
So you may see the Buddha,
or the Virgin Mary,

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:33.936
or Yama, the Hindu god of death.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:36.637
People see landscapes. People hear music.

00:03:36.637 --> 00:03:39.216
Kids have kid-friendly visions.

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:41.436
There's a story about a hospice...

00:03:41.436 --> 00:03:44.797
There was a pediatric hospital
here in San Antonio in the 80s.

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:48.466
And the story went that there was
a boy there that was dying.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:51.397
He was complaining to the nurse
about the noise in the corner,

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.827
the noisy boys in the corner.

00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:55.287
The nurse looked over,
and there wasn't anybody.

00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:56.497
She said, "Who's there?"

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.357
And he named off three names

00:03:58.357 --> 00:04:02.958
of three kids who had been
at that hospital before he got there.

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.036
These experiences happen
all over the world,

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:09.587
all religion, all cultures, all ages.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:13.017
They happen to people who are blind,
they happen to people who are deaf.

00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:16.958
Some researchers say, this is
the limbic system going crazy.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.379
These are purely hallucinations.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:23.248
These are embedded memories
of a lifetime that are coming out.

00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:28.618
Others say, this is proof
of the souls' existence after death.

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:33.237
Neither side can prove their hypothesis,
and my conjecture is this:

00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:36.635
it doesn't matter - sorry
for all the scientists in the room -

00:04:36.635 --> 00:04:39.978
it doesn't matter why they happen,
it matters that they do.

00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:46.329
In my research, I talked with people

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.948
who are at the bedside
when somebody's dying.

00:04:48.948 --> 00:04:53.449
One wife said to me, she was talking
to her husband one afternoon and said,

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.438
"Do you ever see anybody or hear anybody?"

00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:59.069
She said in her estimation,
he was completely lucid.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.299
He had had a little bit
of pain medication.

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:03.740
He was doing a sudoku puzzle,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.209
and he said, "Yeah, there is a soldier

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.119
that comes and stands by my bed
at night and keeps me company.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:11.909
Can't you just see him
standing there at attention?

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.688
And there's a dog that comes in
and lays by my feet in the afternoon."

00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:19.290
And he went on to describe
the beloved family pet

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.319
that had been their's
early in their marriage.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.770
Witnesses in my research talked about
how they saw something happening

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.490
and they knew they didn't need
to do anything about it.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.981
So when Mrs Harrison walked in
and saw Mr Harrison talking to somebody,

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.250
she was a little perplexed,
but she asked him about it.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.550
He was terrified to die.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.050
He had been horribly abused as a child,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.419
terrified to die, afraid his family
was going to come.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.101
Instead, on the scene came
this seven-year-old boy named Jimmy.

00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:53.181
Mrs Harrison said, she went with it.

00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:56.659
She said, "I really didn't know
what else to do. I just went with it."

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.711
And Jimmy stayed with. Mr Harrison
the last two weeks of his life

00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:01.310
and kept him company

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.150
and helped his transition
being an easier one as he left this world.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.431
Witnesses talked about how
they recognize that the phenomena

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.531
that were happening were signs
that death was near,

00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.701
even when experts said
that wasn't the case.

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:18.161
They saw the signs,
and they knew the difference

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:20.922
between hallucinations and visions.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:25.460
So hallucinations, for them,
didn't have any kind of context,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.162
and were frightening,
anxiety-provoking, versus the visions,

00:06:29.162 --> 00:06:33.760
which did have a context,
and brought great comfort.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.742
When I work with families
now, I tell them,

00:06:36.742 --> 00:06:39.452
"Your person may see things you can't see,

00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.298
they may hear things you can't [hear],

00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:44.933
they may reach up to the sky,
they may look through you,

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:49.432
they may talk in metaphors
about moving or leaving or going,

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:52.492
even though they're bed bound,
they need their shoes,

00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:54.942
or they need their map,
or they need their purse,

00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:56.612
or they need to get to the stadium.

00:06:56.612 --> 00:06:58.022
They've got to get somewhere.

00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:01.182
When Mom said – just before
her three-year-old died,

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:07.703
he said, "Daddy, the train's here.
I've got to go now."

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:11.423
For that mom and for
other folks in my research,

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:16.083
these visions, these deathbed phenomena,
were of great comfort to them.

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:20.983
When we educate families
about these experiences,

00:07:20.983 --> 00:07:25.183
and we educate the patient about
these experiences, there's less fear.

00:07:25.183 --> 00:07:30.073
And, my goodness, we need
less fear around death and dying.

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:33.254
I had the opportunity to work
with a patient named Butch.

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:37.164
Butch which was 94,
he had congestive heart failure,

00:07:37.164 --> 00:07:39.314
and he decided he needed to go in hospice.

00:07:39.314 --> 00:07:41.084
He was ready.

00:07:41.084 --> 00:07:43.214
I got a text one afternoon
from his daughter

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:46.004
that the visions had started
and everything was okay.

00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:49.014
His daughter talked about
how Butch was often in the other room.

00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:53.424
And this is the language she used for him
being there, talking with the unseens,

00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:57.784
versus over here, talking to the daughter
and the other people who are in the room.

00:07:57.784 --> 00:07:59.554
And he was often in the other room.

00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:01.975
So one afternoon - I forgot to say:

00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:06.254
Butch was a pretty famous rugby player,
in South Africa in his day.

00:08:06.254 --> 00:08:11.405
So one afternoon, in the other room,
the rugby team came to visit Butch.

00:08:11.405 --> 00:08:13.714
Now his family had also come.

00:08:13.714 --> 00:08:15.964
His parents had come,
his brothers and sisters.

00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:17.584
But there was the rugby team.

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:21.055
The rugby team had come in
on really long ladders.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:23.865
Came down, stayed with him,
and they had a really big party.

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.845
And then the rugby team left. 
They left shorter ladders.

00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:29.865
And Butch was ticked because
the ladders were too short

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.775
and he couldn't get up to where they were.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:35.695
Another day he was ticked off
because his suitcase was packed

00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:39.336
and he was ready to go,
and they left without him.

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:43.534
Another day, he held out his hand,
and he said his daughter,

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:47.526
"I've got these machine parts.
I don't want to lose them."

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.725
This is a very common
metaphor for the dying.

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:52.716
There is some bigger whole picture,
and their piece is missing,

00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:55.325
and they've got to make sure it's whole.

00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:57.821
He's got these parts in his hand.

00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:00.532
She went and got a Ziploc.

00:09:00.532 --> 00:09:04.206
Let me tell you why I love that –
because more often than not,

00:09:04.206 --> 00:09:09.126
people reach for medication
to quell something they don't understand.

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:12.486
And they miss an opportunity
to connect with the person.

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:16.726
They miss an opportunity to meet
the dying person where they are.

00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.997
She didn't miss it.

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:24.167
Is any of this real? I say "Yes."

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.777
Yes, it's real, because it's real
to the people that it happens to.

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:30.488
I don't know how to measure those things

00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:34.597
that are beyond our ordinary
human capacity for understanding.

00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:38.426
I'm a researcher. I don't know
how to measure wonder.

00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:45.747
I know what it feels like. 
I do know what it feels like.

00:09:45.747 --> 00:09:48.987
And I know I feel great
comfort myself when I think,

00:09:48.987 --> 00:09:51.887
that my mom didn't leave
this world by herself,–

00:09:51.887 --> 00:09:54.118
and the boy got to go on that train

00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:58.017
and Butch had his buddies
around before he left.

00:09:58.017 --> 00:10:01.279
When I meet people at parties
for the first time,

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:04.108
think how much fun that is. 
"What do you do for a living?"

00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:07.298
Me, and the sex girl, and the bacteria guy

00:10:07.298 --> 00:10:09.738
can all go together to the party.

00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:13.189
(Laughter)

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:16.998
So we I meet them, and this happens.

00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:20.608
It is, "That's really nice.
I'm going to go get a drink."

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:22.068
And I never see them again.

00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:23.149
(Laughter)

00:10:23.149 --> 00:10:26.401
Or something happens
like [what] happened at lunch today.

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.379
"Let me tell you a story.

00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:29.948
I've been scared to tell anybody

00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:32.459
because I didn't want anybody
to think I was crazy.

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:35.479
And I say, "My goodness.
I want to hear your story.

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:37.419
Please tell me your story."

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:42.140
It's these stories, yours and mine,
that are going to bring comfort

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.659
and hope and calm as we help
the ones we love leave this world,

00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:51.329
and as it is our own time to go.

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:55.159
So if you have had
a deathbed vision experience,

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.640
a witness experience
with somebody you love,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.959
would you raise your hand?

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:04.000
Ok, I would like for you,
in the next 48 hours,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.530
to tell somebody about that.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.120
The more we tell our stories, the more
we're going to eradicate this fear.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.000
And it's really important.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.457
Steve Jobs said six words before he died.

00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:24.140
October 5th, 2011, he died.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.100
"I want to invite you to engage in
your own sense of wonder

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.931
as I leave you today,
minds wide open,"

00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:37.161
were Steve Jobs' last words,

00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:39.211
"Oh, wow.

00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:41.621
Oh, wow.

00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:44.091
Oh, wow!"

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:46.921
Thank you.

00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.551
(Applause)
