00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.567 align:start position:0%
Brexit.

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.135 align:start position:0%
There

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.637 size:88% position:44%
was a 72% turnout of British

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.205 align:start position:0%
citizens

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.740 size:88% position:44%
in Britain who voted and, in

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:10.343 align:start position:0%
effect,

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:11.477 align:start position:0%
37% voted to leave.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.012 align:start position:0%
It's hardly an

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.013 size:84% position:42%
overwhelming mandate but it

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.782 align:start position:0%
indicates

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.284 size:81% position:41%
a sense of the division in

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.419 align:start position:0%
Britain.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.153 align:start position:0%
I

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.088 size:88% position:44%
think that division reflects

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.224 align:start position:0%
very much

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:26.659 align:start position:0%
it the stupidity of a

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.594 align:start position:0%
referendum on a

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.729 align:start position:0%
very complex subject.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0%
Not only the

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start position:0%
stupidity, but the

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.534 align:start position:0%
devisiveness of the

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.036 size:84% position:42%
issue in terms of class, in

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.604 align:start position:0%
terms of

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:39.672 size:88% position:44%
the growth of insecurity and

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
the

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:42.675 size:88% position:44%
growth of austerity with the

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.076 align:start position:0%
Government.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.411 align:start position:0%
So the Government was

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.545 size:81% position:41%
asking to remain when they

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
were

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:49.315 align:start position:0%
pursuing policies of

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.749 align:start position:0%
austerity which were

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:51.918 size:84% position:42%
increasingly in securities.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.519 size:75% position:38%
This is relevant for our

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:54.687
later discussion because it's

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.255 size:75% position:38%
happening in other parts

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start position:0%
of Europe.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.892 size:81% position:41%
If you have your citizenry

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.027 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.095 align:start position:0%
insecure, and

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.029 size:84% position:42%
feeling aggrieved, then the

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.198 align:start position:0%
Government

00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:07.667 align:start position:0%
says "Vote for us to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.268 align:start position:0%
remain." Don't be

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.436 size:84% position:42%
surprised if a large number

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.938 align:start position:0%
of them

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.105 align:start position:0%
revolt against that.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.107 align:start position:0%
I think we also

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.075 size:78% position:39%
have a terrible situation

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.977 align:start position:0%
because

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.078 size:75% position:38%
David Cameron, the prime

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start position:0%
minister at

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.848 size:84% position:42%
the time, has said recently

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.416 align:start position:0%
that he

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:24.417 size:81% position:41%
doesn't regret calling the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.885 align:start position:0%
referendum.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:26.986 align:start position:0%
He regrets the outcome.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start position:0%
That seems to

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.623 align:start position:0%
me an exercise in se

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.625 align:start position:0%
mantices that I

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:33.826 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.194 align:start position:0%
We don't have a

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.362 align:start position:0%
tradition in British

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.563 align:start position:0%
democracy of a

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.032 align:start position:0%
referenda.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
We are a representative

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.801 align:start position:0%
democracy.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.002 align:start position:0%
We believe in Edmund

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:44.304 align:start position:0%
Burke's principle.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.704 align:start position:0%
We elect people to

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.206 size:84% position:42%
represent us even if we may

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.974 align:start position:0%
not agree

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.509 align:start position:0%
with them.

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:52.278 size:81% position:41%
I think we're in danger of

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
repeating some of these

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.981 size:84% position:42%
errors that has taken place

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.348 align:start position:0%
in Brexit today and

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.517 size:84% position:42%
there's one other issue I'd

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.985 align:start position:0%
like to

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.052 size:75% position:38%
mention at the beginning

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.854 align:start position:0%
because it

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:03.022 align:start position:0%
affects every single

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
democracy today,

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.594 size:88% position:44%
which is that we're seeing a

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.064 align:start position:0%
corruption of democracy

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:15.100 align:start position:0%
dominated by

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.803 align:start position:0%
pollute  -- plutocatic

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.371 align:start position:0%
donors and

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.873 size:84% position:42%
owners of the media who can

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.408 align:start position:0%
manipulate

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.943 align:start position:0%
opinion.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.244 size:75% position:38%
This is an unprecedented

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.212 size:88% position:44%
situation which is powerful.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.747 align:start position:0%
We know

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.914 size:81% position:41%
in Britain the Brexit vote

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:33.085 align:start position:0%
was

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.088 align:start position:0%
influenced by Cambridge

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.423 size:88% position:44%
Analytica and big money went

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.591 align:start position:0%
into the Brexit

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.059 align:start position:0%
campaign.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.326 align:start position:0%
Ironically, many of the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.395 align:start position:0%
leaders of that Brexit

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.163 align:start position:0%
campaign are

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start position:0%
now rushing to leave

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
Britain.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.334 size:81% position:41%
The richest man in Britain

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.902
has promptly gone off to live

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.337 align:start position:0%
in Monaco, a tax

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.338 size:78% position:39%
haven, because he doesn't

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.241 align:start position:0%
want to pay

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:56.576 align:start position:0%
British taxes.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.676 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Who is that?&gt;&gt;

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.244 align:start position:0%
Ratcliffe.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.713 size:84% position:42%
He's just been knighted and

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.248 size:78% position:39%
then he rushes off and he

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.816 align:start position:0%
moves to a

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.017 size:88% position:44%
tax haven, openly saying it.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.485 align:start position:0%
The same

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:07.553 align:start position:0%
with Dyson, the most

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.154 align:start position:0%
dramatic

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:10.289 size:84% position:42%
entrepreneur who led in the

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.523 align:start position:0%
Brexit

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.125 align:start position:0%
thing.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.427 size:84% position:42%
He's now moving his company

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.895 align:start position:0%
to Singapore.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.063 size:81% position:41%
Very interesting choice of

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.230 align:start position:0%
place, a tax haven.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.665 align:start position:0%
He says it's got

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.066 size:78% position:39%
nothing to do with Brexit

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.367 align:start position:0%
but it's very strange.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.803 align:start position:0%
And one of the titles

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:24.938 align:start position:0%
that's being used to

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
describe the

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
prospect of Brexit in

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.842 align:start position:0%
Britain is

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:30.809 size:81% position:41%
Singapore on Thames, which

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.377 align:start position:0%
is rather

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.245 size:84% position:42%
appropriate given what he's

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.947 align:start position:0%
done.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.615
But we have a whole string of

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.117 align:start position:0%
people

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.218 align:start position:0%
rushing to take out

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.322 align:start position:0%
residency in

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.925 size:78% position:39%
France, like Nigel Lawson

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.660 align:start position:0%
and Nigel

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:48.794 align:start position:0%
Farage, making sure his

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:51.096 align:start position:0%
children have

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.264 size:84% position:42%
German passports and so on.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.233 align:start position:0%
So we have

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.902 size:88% position:44%
a very split situation and I

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.269 align:start position:0%
think the bitterness in

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.805 size:88% position:44%
Britain is going to last for

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.305 align:start position:0%
a long time.

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.507 size:88% position:44%
Whatever happens, whether we

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.209 size:78% position:39%
have a second vote, which

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.345 size:88% position:44%
is the route I prefer, or we

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.146 size:88% position:44%
have the May's deal which is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.615 size:88% position:44%
very controversial but a lot

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:11.383 size:78% position:39%
of the no deal people are

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:12.485 size:78% position:39%
desperate to clamber onto

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
that or some other

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
compromise.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start position:0%
We're going to have a

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:20.760
bitterness that stretches for

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:21.794 align:start position:0%
decades, I believe.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.395 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jules.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.431 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; So I confess, I looked at

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:26.699 size:81% position:41%
this slightly differently.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:28.267 size:78% position:39%
When I was thinking about

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.535 size:84% position:42%
Europe after Brexit, whilst

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:31.037
there's a huge amount I don't

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.471 align:start position:0%
know, I was

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:33.572 align:start position:0%
thinking Europe after

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:34.973 align:start position:0%
Brexit, let's

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.042 align:start position:0%
imagine there is less

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.542 align:start position:0%
uncertainty.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:39.344 size:88% position:44%
So from me, seeing this from

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:41.013 size:84% position:42%
London I can see two trends

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.148 align:start position:0%
that come with less

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.615 align:start position:0%
uncertainty.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.018 align:start position:0%
The first is I think a

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:46.919 size:81% position:41%
really large resurgence of

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.487 align:start position:0%
human

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.855 align:start position:0%
relationships that have

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:50.990
found uncertainty to be quite

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.458 align:start position:0%
a blocker.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:53.793 align:start position:0%
There has been a really

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.261 align:start position:0%
large amount

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:56.595 size:78% position:39%
of pragmatism beneath the

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.030 size:88% position:44%
politics that I have seen in

00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.431 align:start position:0%
my daily

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.700 align:start position:0%
engagements with

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.034 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs from

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.302 align:start position:0%
across the continent,

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:04.603 size:75% position:38%
particularly our digital

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.839 size:84% position:42%
entrepreneurs for whom many

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:07.873 align:start position:0%
issues are global, not

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.141 align:start position:0%
regional

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:10.743 align:start position:0%
anyway.

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:12.478
But for each chink of clarity

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
I think we get, I think

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:15.580 size:75% position:38%
we'll see that pragmatic

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.282 size:88% position:44%
energy grow and the reason I

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:19.085 align:start position:0%
say that is I think it

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.386 align:start position:0%
reflects the many inter

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.687 size:81% position:41%
dependencies that we have.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.455
This is not to under estimate

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.757 size:88% position:44%
the importance of frameworks

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.859
that go with it but the inter

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.261
dependencies we have in terms

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.461 size:75% position:38%
of finance, talent, tech

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:30.596 align:start position:0%
across our European

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.931 align:start position:0%
continental

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.099 align:start position:0%
ecosystem areville

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.667 align:start position:0%
significant.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.134
We're a powerful ecosystem of

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.303 size:84% position:42%
powerle cities and actually

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:38.871 size:75% position:38%
the report that came out

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.440 size:78% position:39%
on Monday at the start of

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.875 align:start position:0%
Davos, they

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.076 size:78% position:39%
had the ten most powerful

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
city s in

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:46.845 align:start position:0%
the world and four are

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.380 align:start position:0%
European.

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:49.582 size:81% position:41%
London remains a city that

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.116 align:start position:0%
attracts

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:52.351 size:81% position:41%
more FDI projects than any

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.620 align:start position:0%
other city

00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:55.921 align:start position:0%
in the world.

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.389 align:start position:0%
We see so many

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.624 size:84% position:42%
city-to-city collaboration.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:05:59.691 size:81% position:41%
But our entrepreneurs have

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.126 align:start position:0%
been itches for

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.695 size:84% position:42%
certainty and clarity and I

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.430
have been quite struck by the

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:05.531 size:78% position:39%
levels of confidence that

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:06.699 align:start position:0%
there will be ways

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:08.300 align:start position:0%
through.

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.002
So I take reassurance in that

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:11.303 size:75% position:38%
level of pragmatism that

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:12.571 size:81% position:41%
when uncertainty starts to

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.307 size:84% position:42%
reduce we will start to see

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.708 align:start position:0%
that collaboration come

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.976
through from the factors that

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.444 align:start position:0%
pull us together.

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.146
The second thing that I think

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.713 align:start position:0%
will be positive from a

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:22.981 size:84% position:42%
reduction in uncertainty is

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.550 size:88% position:44%
to - all the energy, effort,

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:25.951 align:start position:0%
brainpower that

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:27.220 size:78% position:39%
has gone into this issue,

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.154 align:start position:0%
particularly

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.589 size:88% position:44%
on the UK side, but actually

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:32.224 align:start position:0%
across

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.458 size:88% position:44%
European countries, has been

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:34.993 size:84% position:42%
significant at a time when,

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.429 size:88% position:44%
again, sitting in Davos, you

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.263 size:75% position:38%
have a time to lift your

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.099 size:88% position:44%
heads up and think about the

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:41.367
fourth industrial revolution,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.567
the shared opportunities, but

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:43.669 size:88% position:44%
goodness, shared challenges,

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.103 align:start position:0%
much of which, I

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:46.872 size:88% position:44%
think, is integral as to why

00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:48.174 size:81% position:41%
these issues are facing us

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.474 align:start position:0%
from Brexit in

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:50.842 align:start position:0%
the first place.

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:52.345 align:start position:0%
But there are so many

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:53.912 align:start position:0%
shared values we have I

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:55.414 size:84% position:42%
think for many people there

00:06:55.447 --> 00:06:57.383
was a lot we took for granted

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:58.784 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we now

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:00.219
appreciate a little bit more.

00:07:00.252 --> 00:07:02.021 size:81% position:41%
But when we talk about our

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.255 size:81% position:41%
shared liberal values, our

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.523 align:start position:0%
shared diversity as a

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:05.758 align:start position:0%
European continent, the

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.026 size:75% position:38%
importance we put around

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.326 size:81% position:41%
equality, these are things

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.062 size:84% position:42%
that when we talk about the

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.663 size:75% position:38%
future of AI and ethics,

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:13.366 size:88% position:44%
Europe needs to be firing on

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.666 size:75% position:38%
all cylinders right now.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.901 size:81% position:41%
It's really important that

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.503 size:78% position:39%
our voice is heard at the

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:18.971 align:start position:0%
global table.

00:07:19.004 --> 00:07:20.840 size:81% position:41%
So for me the reduction of

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:21.908
uncertainty, the reduction of

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.275 align:start position:0%
finance going into

00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:24.510 size:75% position:38%
contingency planning but

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:25.778 align:start position:0%
actually being put into

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.345 size:81% position:41%
issues where we all really

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:28.747 size:88% position:44%
need to be fighting together

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.315 align:start position:0%
when we share so much.

00:07:30.348 --> 00:07:31.884 size:81% position:41%
That for me is something I

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:33.085 align:start position:0%
look forward to.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.553 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Martin.

00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:36.421 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; OK, I'm - nobody said

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:37.890 size:84% position:42%
anything I disagree with so

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:39.058 size:81% position:41%
that's a bit disappointing

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.626 align:start position:0%
but it means I don't

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.428 size:84% position:42%
need to go over the history

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:44.664 size:88% position:44%
of the referendum, which Guy

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.131 align:start position:0%
went through

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:47.733 size:81% position:41%
very well, and some of the

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.668 align:start position:0%
characters

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.602 size:78% position:39%
involved can be described

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:52.905 align:start position:0%
pretty

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:54.373 align:start position:0%
accurately.

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:58.043 size:78% position:39%
I thought you were rather

00:07:58.077 --> 00:07:59.111 align:start position:0%
restrained, actually.

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.746 align:start position:0%
And the London

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.048 align:start position:0%
and cities, I've been a

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.249 align:start position:0%
Londoner all

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:04.816 align:start position:0%
my life.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.285 size:88% position:44%
I recently wrote about that.

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:07.753 size:75% position:38%
So put this to one side.

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.121 align:start position:0%
So let's

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:10.522 align:start position:0%
focus on this.

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:12.124 align:start position:0%
I want to divide my

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:13.658
discussion into what it means

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:15.694 size:88% position:44%
for the UK and what it means

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.829 size:88% position:44%
for Europe and I will try to

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.297 size:84% position:42%
cover it very, very quickly

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.433 size:88% position:44%
so it will be very terse and

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.069 size:88% position:44%
there will be lots of points

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:24.436 align:start position:0%
I can't elaborate.

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:26.238 size:78% position:39%
So the first point is the

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.406 align:start position:0%
uncertainty will not be

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.507 align:start position:0%
removed on March 29.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.842 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Not then.

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.276 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It depends

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:33.045 size:81% position:41%
on the path we then follow

00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:34.547 size:75% position:38%
but in many respects the

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.881 align:start position:0%
uncertainty is bound to

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:37.116 size:75% position:38%
remain for years, if not

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.550 align:start position:0%
decades

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.918 align:start position:0%
afterwards, and I will

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.753 size:78% position:39%
explain why and I will go

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.156 size:88% position:44%
through the different parts.

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:45.691 size:78% position:39%
So first of all, we don't

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.259 align:start position:0%
know what

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.193 size:84% position:42%
Parliament will, or whether

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.997 align:start position:0%
Parliament

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.232 size:81% position:41%
will agree on anything and

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.834 align:start position:0%
therefore

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.068 align:start position:0%
we don't know what will

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.437 align:start position:0%
happen on

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.638 size:78% position:39%
March 29 in the following

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
respects.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.674 size:78% position:39%
We don't know whether the

00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:03.842 size:81% position:41%
Prime Minister's deal will

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.244 align:start position:0%
ultimately be passed.

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:06.745
I think that's quite possible

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.614 size:88% position:44%
and Brexit is moving in that

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:10.549 size:84% position:42%
direction, as she expected.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.118 align:start position:0%
So the

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.185 size:75% position:38%
chances are significant.

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:14.653 align:start position:0%
It is quite

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:16.188 size:81% position:41%
possible that no deal will

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.523 size:88% position:44%
be reached by Parliament and

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:18.524 align:start position:0%
in theory we crash

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.059 align:start position:0%
out.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.459 align:start position:0%
I'll come to that.

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.161 size:88% position:44%
And it is also possible that

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.363 align:start position:0%
Parliament will agree

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:25.831 align:start position:0%
and seek and gain an

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:29.434 align:start position:0%
extension to the

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.503 align:start position:0%
article 50 vote, exit

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.070 align:start position:0%
possible, or

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.505 size:84% position:42%
probably in order to have a

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
second

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:36.308 align:start position:0%
referendum.

00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:37.309 align:start position:0%
These are also possible

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.910 align:start position:0%
outcomes.

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:40.245 size:84% position:42%
And they all obviously have

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:41.613 align:start position:0%
completely different

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:42.648 size:84% position:42%
implications for subsequent

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.149 align:start position:0%
uncertainty.

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.484 size:88% position:44%
If the Prime Minister's deal

00:09:45.517 --> 00:09:46.885 align:start position:0%
goes through, the

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.420 size:84% position:42%
uncertainty is, in a sense,

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.789 size:84% position:42%
least but all we've decided

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:51.123 align:start position:0%
is the withdrawal.

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:52.391 size:75% position:38%
We have not decided, and

00:09:52.424 --> 00:09:53.892 align:start position:0%
indeed have

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.627 size:88% position:44%
not begun to negotiate quite

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:56.494 size:88% position:44%
deliberately the post Brexit

00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:58.663 align:start position:0%
trade

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:00.265 align:start position:0%
deal.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.900 size:88% position:44%
It's clear that that will be

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.135 align:start position:0%
very difficult.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:04.570 align:start position:0%
The Brexiters will

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.071 size:78% position:39%
want to go back to Canada

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.939 align:start position:0%
and Canada

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:08.874 size:84% position:42%
is imcompatable, the Canada

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.109 align:start position:0%
free trade

00:10:11.142 --> 00:10:12.044 size:78% position:39%
area is incombatable with

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.312 align:start position:0%
the Irish

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:14.913 align:start position:0%
backstop.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.449 size:84% position:42%
We don't know how that will

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:17.849 align:start position:0%
be resolved.

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.618 align:start position:0%
If we have a change of

00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:21.019 align:start position:0%
government, which is

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.554 size:84% position:42%
possible, it is very likely

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.056 size:84% position:42%
what the Labour Party would

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:25.523
pursue in government would be

00:10:25.557 --> 00:10:26.725 size:84% position:42%
a very different trade deal

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.194 align:start position:0%
from what

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.261 align:start position:0%
the  Conservative Party

00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:30.762 align:start position:0%
would seek.

00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:31.730 size:81% position:41%
There's total uncertainty,

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.265 align:start position:0%
even with

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.232 size:81% position:41%
the Prime Minister's deal,

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:35.834 align:start position:0%
about the

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:37.269 size:88% position:44%
subsequent trade with the UK

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:38.971 size:81% position:41%
and the rest of the world.

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:40.206 align:start position:0%
It could take years

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
to resolve those.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.907 align:start position:0%
I won't go through

00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.076 size:84% position:42%
the timetable is granted is

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.611 align:start position:0%
currently

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.345 size:81% position:41%
only a couple of years but

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:48.713 align:start position:0%
it could be extended.

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.449 size:88% position:44%
If there is no deal, nothing

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:51.884 size:75% position:38%
is resolve ed because no

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.152 align:start position:0%
deal is meaningless.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.753 align:start position:0%
There will be a huge

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:56.255 size:81% position:41%
number of deals that would

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.856 size:81% position:41%
have to be agreed after no

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
deal on almost

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:01.660 size:81% position:41%
anything including how our

00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:04.329 align:start position:0%
aviation

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:05.230 size:84% position:42%
works, important regulatory

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:07.032 align:start position:0%
areas, I

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:08.266 align:start position:0%
can't go through all of

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.702 align:start position:0%
them.

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.102 align:start position:0%
Immediately start

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:12.370 size:84% position:42%
negotiating in a completely

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:13.539 size:84% position:42%
different environment, that

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.507 size:75% position:38%
would be a mess, that is

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.908
clear, and our future trading

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:18.377 size:78% position:39%
policy outside in this no

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.944 size:75% position:38%
deal world would be also

00:11:19.978 --> 00:11:21.246 size:88% position:44%
completely uncertain because

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.681
we would have to re-establish

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:24.182 size:81% position:41%
WTO membership and a whole

00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:25.584 size:78% position:39%
lot of other things which

00:11:25.617 --> 00:11:26.685 align:start position:0%
will be very, very

00:11:26.718 --> 00:11:28.186 align:start position:0%
complicated.

00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:29.988 size:78% position:39%
And of course, if we have

00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:31.256 size:81% position:41%
another referendum, nobody

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:32.591 size:78% position:39%
knows what will happen in

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.026 align:start position:0%
that referendum.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:36.094 size:81% position:41%
It could be any one of the

00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:37.429 size:81% position:41%
possible outcomes, or even

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.297 size:88% position:44%
what will be on the table of

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.732 align:start position:0%
this referendum.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:42.033 size:88% position:44%
The important to understand,

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:43.435 size:88% position:44%
we have consign ed ourselves

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:45.003 size:75% position:38%
to a multiyear with mess

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.771 size:84% position:42%
which, in my view, and this

00:11:46.805 --> 00:11:48.140 size:88% position:44%
is where I part company with

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:49.874 align:start position:0%
my

00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:51.043 size:84% position:42%
colleague on my right, will

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.544 align:start position:0%
create an

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.745 size:81% position:41%
enormous, ongoing cost for

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:55.247 align:start position:0%
the UK and its trading

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:58.583 align:start position:0%
partners and the only

00:11:58.617 --> 00:11:59.551 size:88% position:44%
description for this process

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.286 align:start position:0%
is one of

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:02.487 align:start position:0%
insane psycho drama.

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.988 align:start position:0%
So that's - the

00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:05.157 size:84% position:42%
important thing is there is

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
no post

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
Brexit EU because we're

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:11.796 align:start position:0%
nowhere near

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.366 align:start position:0%
the post-Brexit world.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.767 align:start position:0%
The British

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.036 align:start position:0%
elite in holding this

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.204 size:75% position:38%
referendum and having it

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.405 align:start position:0%
carried through is

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.706 align:start position:0%
astounding.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.907 align:start position:0%
So that's us.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.342 align:start position:0%
So what does

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.409 align:start position:0%
it mean for Europe?

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.911 align:start position:0%
Well, the

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:27.012 size:81% position:41%
uncertainty will be costly

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.413 align:start position:0%
for Europe because

00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:29.381 size:78% position:39%
uncertainty is costly for

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:30.949 align:start position:0%
Europe.

00:12:30.982 --> 00:12:32.784 size:81% position:41%
In general I take the view

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.486 size:88% position:44%
since the EU is six times as

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.087 align:start position:0%
big as

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:38.123 size:88% position:44%
the UK its break down of its

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:39.358 align:start position:0%
trade relations in all

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.692 align:start position:0%
dimensions will be a

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.460 size:84% position:42%
sixth as big but it will be

00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:44.029 align:start position:0%
as big

00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:45.831 size:78% position:39%
across the whole EU as it

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:47.332 size:81% position:41%
will be for the UK, pretty

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:48.933 align:start position:0%
well.

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.402 size:88% position:44%
Not quite, because there are

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:51.637 align:start position:0%
much more alternatives.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.104 size:75% position:38%
But, of course, per head

00:12:53.138 --> 00:12:54.373 align:start position:0%
it will be much, much

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.941 align:start position:0%
smaller.

00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:57.442 size:78% position:39%
I do think that Britain's

00:12:57.475 --> 00:12:59.177 size:81% position:41%
exit will change the EU in

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.779 size:81% position:41%
important ways and I would

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.314 size:75% position:38%
just like to find a path

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:03.682 align:start position:0%
from the

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:05.083 align:start position:0%
uncertainties.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.151 align:start position:0%
Some positive and nom

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.786 align:start position:0%
negative.

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:09.220
The positive way are twofold.

00:13:09.254 --> 00:13:10.856 size:88% position:44%
It's made clear that exit is

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:11.991 align:start position:0%
really quite costly.

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:13.225 align:start position:0%
That's quite

00:13:13.258 --> 00:13:14.693 align:start position:0%
encouraging.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.027 align:start position:0%
And two, because it's

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.463 size:84% position:42%
clear exit is quite costly,

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.730 size:75% position:38%
it's pushed the whole EU

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.232 align:start position:0%
together.

00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:21.566 size:75% position:38%
My favourite joke is the

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.001 align:start position:0%
great nightmare,

00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:24.803 size:78% position:39%
and I know it should stop

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:26.171 size:84% position:42%
now, the great nightmare of

00:13:26.204 --> 00:13:27.772 align:start position:0%
Britain throughout

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:29.174 size:84% position:42%
history is it should have a

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.510 align:start position:0%
united

00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:32.511 size:75% position:38%
Europe and Britain, with

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.513 align:start position:0%
Brexit has

00:13:34.546 --> 00:13:35.380 size:78% position:39%
united Europe against it.

00:13:35.413 --> 00:13:37.048 align:start position:0%
It's

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:37.983 size:88% position:44%
economic culture will change

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:39.584 align:start position:0%
somewhat,

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:41.019 size:88% position:44%
in a less liberal direction.

00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:42.888 size:78% position:39%
Guy might like that but I

00:13:42.921 --> 00:13:44.689
think it will be an important

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.791 size:84% position:42%
development and, of course,

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.226 align:start position:0%
it will be smaller.

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.294
It will be seen in some parts

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.129 size:84% position:42%
of the world that are quite

00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:52.363
significant country has left,

00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:53.865 size:88% position:44%
a country which is invisible

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.300 size:84% position:42%
because of its language and

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:56.835 size:81% position:41%
history, and they will say

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.336 size:84% position:42%
well, if the British really

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.105 size:84% position:42%
think the EU is dying maybe

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:01.206 size:81% position:41%
there's something in that.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.807 align:start position:0%
So all round, a

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:03.742 size:88% position:44%
complete total comprehensive

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.343 align:start position:0%
disaster

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:06.278 size:84% position:42%
from which nobody important

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.481 align:start position:0%
will gain,

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.748 align:start position:0%
except, in my view, Mr

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:11.983 align:start position:0%
Putin.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:13.318 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.853 align:start position:0%
Thank you.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:16.522 size:88% position:44%
There's a lot to think about

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.889 align:start position:0%
there and unpack.

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.424 size:84% position:42%
I'm just conscious of time.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.326 size:88% position:44%
We do want to answer some of

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.761 align:start position:0%
your questions.

00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:24.596 size:81% position:41%
So as you were all talking

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.931 size:84% position:42%
there, I was thinking about

00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:27.299 align:start position:0%
various elements.

00:14:27.332 --> 00:14:29.167 size:78% position:39%
I want to talk about, and

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.003
actually one of the guests in

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:32.370
the audience has brought this

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:33.571 align:start position:0%
up with a question on

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:35.140 align:start position:0%
Slido.

00:14:35.173 --> 00:14:36.642 size:78% position:39%
If we're looking ahead to

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.176 align:start position:0%
what life is like after

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.711 size:84% position:42%
Brexit, given the fact that

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.480 size:88% position:44%
we've got years and years of

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:42.781 size:81% position:41%
uncertainty and everything

00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:44.516
else and all the questions we

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:46.084 size:78% position:39%
can't answer, can we talk

00:14:46.117 --> 00:14:47.852
about what this means for the

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:49.054 size:88% position:44%
future of the labour market.

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.522 align:start position:0%
So this

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.823 align:start position:0%
question, what are the

00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:53.024 size:78% position:39%
potential consequences in

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.059 align:start position:0%
regards to the labour

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
market?

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.162 align:start position:0%
If you could keep your

00:14:57.195 --> 00:14:58.663 size:78% position:39%
answers short and can you

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.064 size:84% position:42%
talk about labour market in

00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:01.467 align:start position:0%
the UK and then labour

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.501 align:start position:0%
market in Europe?

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.169 align:start position:0%
Guy.

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.904
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to be very

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.539 align:start position:0%
brief.

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:09.641
I wrote at a book just before

00:15:09.674 --> 00:15:11.076
the referendum and before the

00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:14.946 size:75% position:38%
election of Donald Trump

00:15:15.647 --> 00:15:17.782 size:81% position:41%
and I said a large part of

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.284 size:88% position:44%
the precariat will be voting

00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:20.719
for Brexit and will be voting

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.954 align:start position:0%
for Trump.

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.455 align:start position:0%
I think

00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:24.890 align:start position:0%
we've got to be, as

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:26.291 align:start position:0%
Europeans, looking

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:27.826 size:84% position:42%
in the mirror at this issue

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.328 align:start position:0%
because we

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:30.362 size:75% position:38%
shouldn't divorce what's

00:15:30.395 --> 00:15:31.863 align:start position:0%
happening in

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:33.064 size:81% position:41%
Britain from the fact that

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.633 align:start position:0%
there's a

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:35.834 size:78% position:39%
crisis in Europe as well.

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.435 align:start position:0%
The crisis

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.503 size:88% position:44%
of insecurity, the growth of

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:40.171 align:start position:0%
the

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.239 size:84% position:42%
precariat, I get invited to

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.842 align:start position:0%
every

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:44.943 align:start position:0%
single country in the

00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:49.180 align:start position:0%
European Union

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.415 size:88% position:44%
to talk to precariat groups.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:53.085 align:start position:0%
In France

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.720 size:75% position:38%
is a latest symptom of a

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.454 align:start position:0%
fundamentally

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.523 align:start position:0%
festering inequality,

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:59.190 align:start position:0%
insecurity,

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.425 align:start position:0%
stressful set of

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:01.526 align:start position:0%
circumstances.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.161 align:start position:0%
We've

00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:04.196 align:start position:0%
got to be self-critical

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.631 align:start position:0%
because the

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.598 align:start position:0%
European Union has also

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.166 align:start position:0%
failed to

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.401 size:84% position:42%
address the growth of these

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.336 align:start position:0%
phenomena.

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:13.471 size:81% position:41%
I think that part of it is

00:16:13.504 --> 00:16:15.173 size:81% position:41%
much to do with the labour

00:16:15.206 --> 00:16:19.043 align:start position:0%
market but it's much

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.180 size:84% position:42%
more to do with what I call

00:16:22.213 --> 00:16:23.449 align:start position:0%
rentier

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.817 align:start position:0%
capitalism.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.419 align:start position:0%
The growth goes to

00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:30.021 size:81% position:41%
plutocracy and plutocratic

00:16:30.054 --> 00:16:31.423 align:start position:0%
corporations.

00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:32.591 align:start position:0%
More austerity cuts for

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.992 align:start position:0%
living standards and

00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:35.226 size:78% position:39%
benefits are intensifying

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:36.728 size:78% position:39%
this insecurity and if we

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:37.929 size:75% position:38%
continue to go down this

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.464 align:start position:0%
course, we

00:16:39.497 --> 00:16:40.699 size:81% position:41%
will move from a situation

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:42.334 align:start position:0%
where today

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.635 size:78% position:39%
one in four voters across

00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:45.069 align:start position:0%
the European

00:16:45.103 --> 00:16:46.438 align:start position:0%
Union is voting for a

00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
populist party

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.040 size:88% position:44%
or populist politician, to a

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:50.708 align:start position:0%
point

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:52.477 size:88% position:44%
where half will be doing so.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.778 size:78% position:39%
And that, of course, will

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.213 align:start position:0%
spell political

00:16:55.246 --> 00:16:56.748 size:81% position:41%
dangers that we don't need

00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:57.716 size:81% position:41%
to elaborate because we've

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.250 align:start position:0%
been there

00:16:59.283 --> 00:17:00.118 size:78% position:39%
before, we're seeing what

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.487 align:start position:0%
Trump

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.988 align:start position:0%
represents.

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.722 size:81% position:41%
I happen to be an economic

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
adviser to one of the

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
opposition

00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:08.794 size:78% position:39%
leaders in Britain, and I

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:12.897 align:start position:0%
said I wish

00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:16.801 size:81% position:41%
you could come out and say

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:18.569 align:start position:0%
Cane's

00:17:18.603 --> 00:17:19.771 size:84% position:42%
famous remark, he was asked

00:17:19.804 --> 00:17:21.973 align:start position:0%
why are

00:17:22.006 --> 00:17:23.041 size:78% position:39%
you being inconsistent on

00:17:23.074 --> 00:17:24.977 align:start position:0%
this issue?

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.344 align:start position:0%
He said, "Sir, when the

00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:28.747 align:start position:0%
facts change,

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.948 align:start position:0%
I change my mind.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.416 align:start position:0%
What do you do,

00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:32.918 size:81% position:41%
sir?" I think we've got in

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.419 align:start position:0%
Trump a

00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:35.521 size:75% position:38%
fundamental shift in the

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.555 align:start position:0%
geopolitical

00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:38.523 size:81% position:41%
situation where Europe has

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.959 align:start position:0%
to address

00:17:40.992 --> 00:17:42.093 align:start position:0%
its own problems and

00:17:42.126 --> 00:17:44.395 align:start position:0%
challenges and

00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:45.830 size:84% position:42%
forge a new identity in the

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
context of

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:49.668 align:start position:0%
an emerging China and a

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:52.204 align:start position:0%
fundamentally

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.204 align:start position:0%
different United States

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.739 align:start position:0%
where it's

00:17:54.772 --> 00:17:56.241 size:78% position:39%
America first and all the

00:17:56.274 --> 00:17:57.375 size:81% position:41%
other stuff that goes with

00:17:57.408 --> 00:17:59.077 align:start position:0%
it.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.179
I think it is something to do

00:18:01.212 --> 00:18:02.848
with the labour market but is

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.683 size:75% position:38%
much more to do with the

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:05.950 align:start position:0%
breakdown of our income

00:18:05.983 --> 00:18:07.185 size:78% position:39%
distribution system where

00:18:07.218 --> 00:18:08.486 size:75% position:38%
disproportionately large

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.721 size:88% position:44%
amounts of wealth and income

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
are going

00:18:12.023 --> 00:18:13.224 size:75% position:38%
to a tiny plutocracy and

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:14.826 align:start position:0%
elite.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.861 size:88% position:44%
Those people are represented

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.328 align:start position:0%
here in Davos.

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:18.763 size:84% position:42%
The group I'm writing about

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.298 align:start position:0%
and talking to are not

00:18:20.331 --> 00:18:21.433 size:81% position:41%
represented here in Davos.

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:23.401 align:start position:0%
I think we do have a

00:18:23.434 --> 00:18:24.702 size:78% position:39%
fundamental challenge and

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.505 size:88% position:44%
it's not just to do with the

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.939 align:start position:0%
labour market.

00:18:27.972 --> 00:18:29.207 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Jules, your thoughts on

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.775 align:start position:0%
what this

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:31.642 size:84% position:42%
Brexit process, whatever it

00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:33.278 align:start position:0%
looks

00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:34.479 size:81% position:41%
like, means for the labour

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.947 align:start position:0%
market in

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.315 align:start position:0%
the UK and in Europe.

00:18:37.348 --> 00:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think the

00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:40.852 align:start position:0%
one - I mean it is very

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.286 size:84% position:42%
difficult to answer and, of

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.855 align:start position:0%
course, this is such a

00:18:43.888 --> 00:18:45.057 size:81% position:41%
critical question where we

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.190 size:75% position:38%
really don't know what's

00:18:46.224 --> 00:18:47.658 align:start position:0%
going to happen.

00:18:47.692 --> 00:18:49.494 size:84% position:42%
But I think the things from

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.728 size:84% position:42%
trying to balance political

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.029 size:84% position:42%
and economic arguments that

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:54.032 size:88% position:44%
have come out on the UK side

00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:55.867 size:81% position:41%
of things, I think the one

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.669 size:88% position:44%
thing that has come in quite

00:18:57.702 --> 00:18:59.104 size:81% position:41%
clearly has been the issue

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:00.371 align:start position:0%
around not skills-based

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.406 align:start position:0%
movement but just free

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.907 align:start position:0%
movement.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.110 size:78% position:39%
So I do think it is quite

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.744
likely that the UK will adopt

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.113 align:start position:0%
a skills-based system.

00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:09.514 size:78% position:39%
That's what all the white

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:10.615 align:start position:0%
paper advisory has been

00:19:10.648 --> 00:19:12.017 align:start position:0%
talking about.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.585 size:75% position:38%
But, again, I think that

00:19:13.618 --> 00:19:15.087 size:81% position:41%
Europe, as a continent, it

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.954 align:start position:0%
will be far more hit by

00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:18.356 size:84% position:42%
automation, by the need for

00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:19.657 align:start position:0%
reskilling, the digital

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:21.225 size:84% position:42%
economy, the changes in the

00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:22.961 size:84% position:42%
way that we work and travel

00:19:22.994 --> 00:19:24.429 size:78% position:39%
anyway, that I think that

00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:25.863 size:81% position:41%
this is something that the

00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:27.498 align:start position:0%
agenda is moving on so

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:28.667 size:84% position:42%
quickly that it's something

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.269 size:75% position:38%
that we need to pool our

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.703 align:start position:0%
brainpower.

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.070 align:start position:0%
I know that's slightly

00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:34.506 size:84% position:42%
avoiding the question but I

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
think it's very hard to

00:19:36.073 --> 00:19:37.509 size:78% position:39%
predict and it's not just

00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:38.810 size:75% position:38%
about the arguments that

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.344 size:84% position:42%
we're having at the moment.

00:19:40.378 --> 00:19:41.780 size:84% position:42%
I think there are arguments

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.381 size:81% position:41%
that we haven't thought of

00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:44.516
that the digital economy will

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:46.084 align:start position:0%
dictate.

00:19:46.117 --> 00:19:47.318 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Martin, something Guy

00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:48.620 size:81% position:41%
mentioned earlier is James

00:19:48.653 --> 00:19:50.087
Dyson is moving to Singapore.

00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:51.622 size:88% position:44%
His argument for going there

00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:53.424 size:84% position:42%
is to find the right skills

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.859 size:84% position:42%
for his company and what he

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
does.

00:19:56.394 --> 00:19:57.895 align:start position:0%
He said it's not about

00:19:57.929 --> 00:19:59.230 align:start position:0%
Brexit, not about tax.

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:00.698 size:88% position:44%
But there is this discussion

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.267 size:88% position:44%
about skills, where they are

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.668
and how the system's working,

00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:04.969 size:75% position:38%
education and everything

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.538 size:88% position:44%
else, that Europe is lagging

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:07.906
behind the likes of Asia, the

00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
US?

00:20:09.574 --> 00:20:10.908 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I can't obviously comment

00:20:10.942 --> 00:20:12.277 align:start position:0%
on Mr Dyson's business

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.445
affairs, and I wouldn't dream

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.612 align:start position:0%
of doing

00:20:14.645 --> 00:20:16.314 align:start position:0%
so.

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.383 size:84% position:42%
So - but I think the points

00:20:18.416 --> 00:20:19.884 size:81% position:41%
are already brought up and

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.253 size:88% position:44%
the most obvious change that

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
one can expect, if

00:20:22.653 --> 00:20:24.789 size:81% position:41%
we leave, and if we have a

00:20:24.822 --> 00:20:25.990
government, anything like the

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.792 size:88% position:44%
present one, both of which I

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:28.860 size:84% position:42%
think are open to question,

00:20:28.893 --> 00:20:31.028 align:start position:0%
is

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:31.930 size:88% position:44%
that immigration policy will

00:20:31.963 --> 00:20:33.498 align:start position:0%
change.

00:20:33.531 --> 00:20:34.666 align:start position:0%
The instinct of this

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.335 align:start position:0%
Government will

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.770 size:84% position:42%
be to try to reduce numbers

00:20:38.803 --> 00:20:42.874 align:start position:0%
very sub

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.515 align:start position:0%
stant  -- sub  --

00:20:50.548 --> 00:20:51.917 align:start position:0%
substantially.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.785 align:start position:0%
It will try to pursue a

00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:55.286 size:78% position:39%
policy which is trying to

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.787 size:88% position:44%
deal with that very problem,

00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:58.022 size:84% position:42%
which is orientated towards

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:59.523 size:84% position:42%
taking in skilled labour as

00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:01.225 size:88% position:44%
they define it, which at the

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:02.860 align:start position:0%
moment they seem to be

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.162 size:88% position:44%
defining by how much they're

00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:05.664 align:start position:0%
going to be paid.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:07.398
I understand the last one was

00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:08.667 size:81% position:41%
30,000 a year, someone can

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.101 align:start position:0%
correct me.

00:21:10.134 --> 00:21:11.636 size:81% position:41%
So if you're going to earn

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.204 align:start position:0%
more than

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.673 size:88% position:44%
30,000 pounds a year you can

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:17.209 align:start position:0%
come in,

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:18.409 size:75% position:38%
if you can't you're not.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:21.379 align:start position:0%
That moves

00:21:21.412 --> 00:21:22.547 align:start position:0%
all our nurses and it's

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.881 align:start position:0%
pretty

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
important.

00:21:25.383 --> 00:21:26.618 size:75% position:38%
You can hear the screams

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.185 align:start position:0%
already.

00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:29.887 size:84% position:42%
So that will be our effect.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.256 align:start position:0%
Now what will it mean?

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.690 align:start position:0%
That will, of

00:21:32.723 --> 00:21:34.258 size:78% position:39%
course, be a mess because

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:35.293 size:84% position:42%
all our immigration systems

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:37.429 align:start position:0%
are a mess and

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:38.463 size:75% position:38%
thainge -- changing them

00:21:38.496 --> 00:21:39.998 align:start position:0%
will - that

00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
is certain.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.067 align:start position:0%
They will be under the

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.168 size:78% position:39%
Home Office, which is our

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:45.504 align:start position:0%
worst

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.804 align:start position:0%
department.

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.306 align:start position:0%
I think that's a

00:21:48.339 --> 00:21:49.307 size:81% position:41%
noncontroversial statement

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.775 align:start position:0%
in Britain.

00:21:50.808 --> 00:21:52.043 size:78% position:39%
But on the European side,

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:53.544 align:start position:0%
obviously

00:21:53.577 --> 00:21:54.746 size:78% position:39%
export of labour, there's

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:55.947 align:start position:0%
been a very significant

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.348 align:start position:0%
emigration to the UK.

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:58.583 size:88% position:44%
A lot of talented, wonderful

00:21:58.616 --> 00:22:01.119 align:start position:0%
people have

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.653 align:start position:0%
come pch .

00:22:02.687 --> 00:22:04.356 size:84% position:42%
I think the costs to Europe

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.923 size:75% position:38%
will be real, though not

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.258 size:84% position:42%
massive because most of the

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:09.227 align:start position:0%
people who would

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.862 align:start position:0%
like to come have come.

00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:12.330
A huge Polish immigration has

00:22:12.363 --> 00:22:13.531 size:81% position:41%
happened and clearly there

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.166 align:start position:0%
will be lots of people

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:16.401
leaving for very good reasons

00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:17.802 align:start position:0%
in this situation.

00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:19.371 size:75% position:38%
But I do think, finally,

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.439
there are a lot of firms I've

00:22:21.472 --> 00:22:22.774 size:81% position:41%
been in contact with, very

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.175 align:start position:0%
different groups

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:25.477 size:78% position:39%
from Guy's, for which the

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.978 align:start position:0%
flexibility

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.512 size:88% position:44%
of moving labour around, and

00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:29.747 size:84% position:42%
I'm talking skilled, medium

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:30.982 size:88% position:44%
skilled people around Europe

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.751 size:84% position:42%
is a very important part of

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:33.684 size:75% position:38%
that business operation.

00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
And if

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:36.588 size:75% position:38%
they're going to have to

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.055 align:start position:0%
deal with the

00:22:38.089 --> 00:22:39.557 size:84% position:42%
Home Office on all of those

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:41.092 align:start position:0%
things it

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.827 size:88% position:44%
will be a nightmare and they

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.462 align:start position:0%
will run Britain from a

00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:45.864
separate island from the rest

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.131 size:75% position:38%
of the European business

00:22:47.164 --> 00:22:48.666 size:81% position:41%
because they will have to,

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.702 size:88% position:44%
that will be one of the many

00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:52.237 size:81% position:41%
ways in which this will be

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.771 align:start position:0%
costly.

00:22:53.804 --> 00:22:55.907 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I've talked to a lot of

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.442 size:81% position:41%
company CEOs about lots of

00:22:57.475 --> 00:22:59.210 size:81% position:41%
things to do with this but

00:22:59.243 --> 00:23:01.245
two or three have said to me,

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
who run businesses in

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:04.282 size:88% position:44%
Britain, who employ a lot of

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:05.649 align:start position:0%
European workers, that

00:23:05.683 --> 00:23:07.251 size:88% position:44%
actually what they will do -

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:08.686 align:start position:0%
they've already

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.521 size:84% position:42%
got their bases lined up in

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:11.489 size:78% position:39%
Amsterdam, other parts of

00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:12.991 align:start position:0%
Europe.

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.192 size:78% position:39%
They've already got their

00:23:14.225 --> 00:23:16.093 align:start position:0%
sort of ducks in a row.

00:23:16.127 --> 00:23:17.929 size:88% position:44%
We're almost out of time but

00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:20.297
I just want - a lot of people

00:23:20.331 --> 00:23:21.832 size:88% position:44%
have liked this question and

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:23.935 size:88% position:44%
it's the top of my list here

00:23:23.968 --> 00:23:26.237
so I'm going to put it to you

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.739 size:81% position:41%
guys for a quick response.

00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:29.073 size:78% position:39%
What is the best argument

00:23:29.106 --> 00:23:30.275 align:start position:0%
against a new

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.409 align:start position:0%
referendum?

00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:33.044 align:start position:0%
Guy.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:34.378 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Further uncertainty but I

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.780 align:start position:0%
still think that

00:23:35.813 --> 00:23:37.048 size:78% position:39%
it's the least bad option

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.349 align:start position:0%
from where

00:23:38.382 --> 00:23:39.617 align:start position:0%
we are today.

00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:41.052 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; To have one?

00:23:41.085 --> 00:23:42.687 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; To have a second vote.

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.256 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:46.191 size:81% position:41%
the young precariat didn't

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:48.192 align:start position:0%
turn out

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:49.661 align:start position:0%
last time.

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.028 align:start position:0%
We had 70% turnout.

00:23:51.062 --> 00:23:52.763 size:84% position:42%
A lot of younger people are

00:23:52.797 --> 00:23:53.965 size:84% position:42%
tending to be much stronger

00:23:53.998 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
remain.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.768 align:start position:0%
They see

00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:57.803 align:start position:0%
themselves as European.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.336 align:start position:0%
I think that

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.139 size:88% position:44%
having a second vote will be

00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:02.407 size:81% position:41%
divisive but any option is

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.674 align:start position:0%
going to be

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:05.209 align:start position:0%
divisive.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:08.046 size:88% position:44%
And I think this will be the

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.313 size:75% position:38%
least bad of the options

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:10.849 align:start position:0%
available.

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.049 size:75% position:38%
And we should enter that

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.551 align:start position:0%
debate by

00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:14.753 size:75% position:38%
saying that we should be

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.087 align:start position:0%
critical

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.488 align:start position:0%
remainors.

00:24:17.521 --> 00:24:18.957 align:start position:0%
None of us should be

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.258 align:start position:0%
idolising the EU.

00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:22.994 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; The UK has always

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.395 align:start position:0%
been that, hasn't it?

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:25.329 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; A predominantly European

00:24:25.363 --> 00:24:26.931 align:start position:0%
audience.

00:24:26.964 --> 00:24:28.599
I think one of the lessons of

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:31.235 align:start position:0%
Brexit

00:24:31.268 --> 00:24:32.436 size:78% position:39%
should be the lessons for

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.571 align:start position:0%
all of us.

00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:35.272 align:start position:0%
I

00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:36.707 size:88% position:44%
think we all have lessons to

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:37.909 align:start position:0%
learn.

00:24:37.942 --> 00:24:42.046 align:start position:0%
It

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.248 size:88% position:44%
may take different forms, it

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:44.715 align:start position:0%
may be a

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:45.817 align:start position:0%
different form to what

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.351 align:start position:0%
happened in

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:48.520 size:88% position:44%
Britain and what happened in

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:51.589 align:start position:0%
Eastern

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:52.690 size:84% position:42%
Europe is different but the

00:24:52.723 --> 00:24:54.125 align:start position:0%
same fe

00:24:54.158 --> 00:24:55.226 align:start position:0%
phenomena has to be

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.728 align:start position:0%
addressed.

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.295 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think the argument

00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:00.065 size:84% position:42%
against is even if a result

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:01.365 size:75% position:38%
came out for effectively

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.633 size:88% position:44%
remain, it probably wouldn't

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:03.968 size:88% position:44%
do so in a hugely conclusive

00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:05.737 align:start position:0%
way.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.271
It's not suddenly going to be

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.739 align:start position:0%
an 80/20 split.

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.541 size:88% position:44%
It's likely to be very close

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:11.743 size:88% position:44%
and looking at the different

00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:12.943 align:start position:0%
polls it is

00:25:12.977 --> 00:25:14.578 align:start position:0%
close.

00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:16.013 size:84% position:42%
It looks like it's slightly

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:17.582 size:88% position:44%
shifted but it's very close.

00:25:17.615 --> 00:25:19.050
The reason that could be very

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:21.619 align:start position:0%
disruptive

00:25:21.652 --> 00:25:22.787 align:start position:0%
and divisive, I draw

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.222 align:start position:0%
parallels with

00:25:24.255 --> 00:25:25.457 size:81% position:41%
Attenborough talking about

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.858 size:75% position:38%
why isn't more done more

00:25:26.891 --> 00:25:27.959 align:start position:0%
quickly on climate

00:25:27.992 --> 00:25:29.494 align:start position:0%
change.

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:31.295 size:81% position:41%
He said as humans, when we

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:33.097 size:88% position:44%
listen to things that are of

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.299 size:88% position:44%
such complexity and enormity

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:36.134 align:start position:0%
and very often put in a

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:37.168 size:81% position:41%
negative way, we naturally

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:38.702 align:start position:0%
tune out.

00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:40.905 size:88% position:44%
I think a lot of people have

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.073 size:84% position:42%
tuned out because it's just

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.807 align:start position:0%
so complex

00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:46.244 size:84% position:42%
and, as I say, a lot of the

00:25:46.277 --> 00:25:47.545
discussion around it has been

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:48.979 align:start position:0%
quite negative.

00:25:49.013 --> 00:25:50.715 size:84% position:42%
So I think that would be an

00:25:50.748 --> 00:25:51.950 align:start position:0%
argument

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.584 align:start position:0%
against.

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:54.819 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; So little advertisement,

00:25:54.852 --> 00:25:56.388 size:78% position:39%
this is the subject of my

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:57.888 align:start position:0%
column which

00:25:57.922 --> 00:25:59.724 size:88% position:44%
will be up in about an hour.

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.192 align:start position:0%
Well, the

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:02.393 size:75% position:38%
case for and against the

00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:03.762 align:start position:0%
next

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.230 align:start position:0%
referendum.

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.498 size:75% position:38%
I think - it's basically

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.866 align:start position:0%
been described.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.201 align:start position:0%
That it won't resolve

00:26:10.234 --> 00:26:11.101 size:81% position:41%
the uncertainty because it

00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:12.703 align:start position:0%
won't

00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:13.705 size:81% position:41%
decide Britain's position,

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:17.808 align:start position:0%
and that it

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:21.379 align:start position:0%
will turn what is still

00:26:21.412 --> 00:26:22.913 align:start position:0%
manageable and

00:26:22.947 --> 00:26:24.315 size:84% position:42%
civilised civil war - it is

00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:26.217 align:start position:0%
a civil

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.418 size:81% position:41%
war - into an unmanageable

00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:29.587 align:start position:0%
and very

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.722 size:75% position:38%
uncivilised civil war in

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.257 align:start position:0%
which, if the

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.457 size:75% position:38%
Brexiters lose, but by a

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:34.959 align:start position:0%
modest

00:26:34.992 --> 00:26:36.361 align:start position:0%
margin, a very, very

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.429
significant proportion of the

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.829 align:start position:0%
British population

00:26:38.862 --> 00:26:40.331 size:78% position:39%
will feel, with some good

00:26:40.364 --> 00:26:41.765 size:81% position:41%
reason, that they have not

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:43.067 align:start position:0%
been listened to, that

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.001 align:start position:0%
they've been cheated of

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.570 align:start position:0%
their

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:46.804 size:81% position:41%
democratic right to make a

00:26:46.837 --> 00:26:48.806 align:start position:0%
decision

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.907 align:start position:0%
and that therefore the

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.043 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of

00:26:52.076 --> 00:26:53.277 size:78% position:39%
the political system of a

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.812 align:start position:0%
whole, of

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:55.980 size:84% position:42%
which they're a part, which

00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:57.548 align:start position:0%
is, I

00:26:57.581 --> 00:26:58.783 size:81% position:41%
would say, the single most

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.351 align:start position:0%
important

00:27:00.384 --> 00:27:01.885 size:81% position:41%
asset Britain as a country

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.354 size:88% position:44%
has had historically and the

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.755 size:88% position:44%
thing that is striking about

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:05.957 align:start position:0%
Britain compared with

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.024 align:start position:0%
other large European

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.660 align:start position:0%
countries.

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:10.094
That asset will be destroyed.

00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:11.095 size:81% position:41%
Unfortunately, in my view,

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:15.033 align:start position:0%
that asset

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:16.234 size:75% position:38%
is going to be destroyed

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.835 align:start position:0%
anyway.

00:27:17.868 --> 00:27:19.404 size:81% position:41%
I remain - I'll be precise

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:22.406 align:start position:0%
because this

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.741 align:start position:0%
is so important.

00:27:23.774 --> 00:27:25.743 align:start position:0%
I got my paper and

00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:26.844 size:84% position:42%
myself support as the first

00:27:26.877 --> 00:27:29.781 align:start position:0%
best

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.382 size:75% position:38%
option if it can be done

00:27:31.415 --> 00:27:32.750 align:start position:0%
without risk,

00:27:32.783 --> 00:27:34.185 align:start position:0%
the Prime Minister's

00:27:34.218 --> 00:27:35.220
wretched deal for this reason

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:36.821 align:start position:0%
.

00:27:36.854 --> 00:27:38.022 align:start position:0%
People disagree with me

00:27:38.055 --> 00:27:39.223 align:start position:0%
but for this reason.

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:40.658 align:start position:0%
If the Brexiters

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:41.825 size:84% position:42%
won't let that through, I'm

00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:43.394 align:start position:0%
never

00:27:43.427 --> 00:27:45.163 size:78% position:39%
going to accept a no deal

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:46.664 size:75% position:38%
crash out and we'll have

00:27:46.697 --> 00:27:47.999 size:81% position:41%
another referenda but then

00:27:48.032 --> 00:27:49.567
the civil war has already got

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.935 align:start position:0%
really serious.

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.270 align:start position:0%
The responsibility of

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:53.505 size:78% position:39%
the Brexiters in the last

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:54.972 align:start position:0%
month in not

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:56.074 align:start position:0%
accepting victory and

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.408 align:start position:0%
compromise is

00:27:57.441 --> 00:27:58.576 align:start position:0%
making a political

00:27:58.609 --> 00:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
resolution in

00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:03.048 size:78% position:39%
Britain almost impossible

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:06.251 align:start position:0%
and that is,

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:07.419 align:start position:0%
to me, absolutely

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:08.619 align:start position:0%
astonishing.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:11.455 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:12.757 align:start position:0%
depressed.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.991 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:28:14.024 --> 00:28:15.860 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And we are

00:28:15.893 --> 00:28:17.161 size:75% position:38%
pretty much out of time.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:20.097 align:start position:0%
As you can

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.265 align:start position:0%
tell, it's extremely

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:24.302 align:start position:0%
complicated and

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:25.536 size:81% position:41%
difficult issue to try and

00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
navigate

00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:31.876 size:88% position:44%
and try and resolve so  many

00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:33.344 align:start position:0%
problems

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.212 align:start position:0%
come up as you try to

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.214 align:start position:0%
discuss even the basic

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.748 align:start position:0%
issues.

00:28:37.781 --> 00:28:39.316 size:81% position:41%
Thank you so much for your

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.885 align:start position:0%
questions.

00:28:40.918 --> 00:28:42.587
This was a very short session

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.988 size:75% position:38%
so apologies we couldn't

00:28:44.021 --> 00:28:45.356
cover more of your questions.

00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:46.691 size:75% position:38%
But you can continue the

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:47.892 align:start position:0%
conversation.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.393 align:start position:0%
If you do

00:28:49.426 --> 00:28:50.561 size:81% position:41%
that use #wef19 #Brexit on

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.829 align:start position:0%
social

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.431 align:start position:0%
media.

00:28:53.464 --> 00:28:55.199 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Sally, I feel like it's

00:28:55.232 --> 00:28:56.400 size:75% position:38%
ended on such a negative

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.902 align:start position:0%
note.

00:28:57.935 --> 00:28:59.470 align:start position:0%
Can I put in a short

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:01.005 align:start position:0%
anecdote.

00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:03.074 align:start position:0%
A few years ago I was a

00:29:03.107 --> 00:29:04.442 size:75% position:38%
British ambassador and I

00:29:04.475 --> 00:29:05.676
collaborated with my European

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.211 size:84% position:42%
colleagues in such a strong

00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:08.646
way, not because our capitals

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:10.147 align:start position:0%
instructed us to or the

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:11.349 size:88% position:44%
Commission instructed us to,

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.817 size:78% position:39%
but because there were so

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.051 align:start position:0%
many things on which we

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:15.586 align:start position:0%
agree.

00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:16.821 align:start position:0%
We had shared priority,

00:29:16.854 --> 00:29:17.855 align:start position:0%
shared interest, shared

00:29:17.888 --> 00:29:19.456 align:start position:0%
values.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.158 size:84% position:42%
I think let's not forget as

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:22.727 align:start position:0%
we go forward, I'm not

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.994 align:start position:0%
meaning to belittle the

00:29:24.027 --> 00:29:25.262 size:81% position:41%
complexity, the fragility,

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.030 size:88% position:44%
but let's not forget what we

00:29:27.064 --> 00:29:28.532 size:88% position:44%
represent as a continent, as

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.301 size:84% position:42%
a group of people who share

00:29:30.334 --> 00:29:31.803 size:78% position:39%
values because, as I say,

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:33.370 align:start position:0%
there are so many other

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.605 size:84% position:42%
things beyond our continent

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.407 size:84% position:42%
that are so important and I

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:37.508 size:84% position:42%
think it's really important

00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:38.909 align:start position:0%
to remember that.

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:40.809 size:88% position:44%
