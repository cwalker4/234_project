00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.660
The First World War is perceived by many today
as static, with no real tactical development.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.230
However, all of the armies fighting underwent
major evolutionary steps between 1914 and

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.500
1918 and we’re covering them in a series
of specials, and today I’m talking about Britain.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.700
I’m Indy Neidell; welcome to a Great War
Special episode about the evolution of the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.690
British Infantry in the First World War.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.420
Britain entered the war with an army that
had been shaped by the Boers Wars and other

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.960
colonial wars.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.839
British infantry tactics in 1914 emphasized
rapid, accurate rifle volleys and finding

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.179
cover by means such as entrenching.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.870
The average British private at the time, in
contrast to those of the other warring armies,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.760
was a professional soldier who had served
over four years.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.949
He was part of a platoon, which was part of
a company.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.229
That company of around 150 men was the basic
tactical unit, meaning that companies were

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.890
given tasks and objectives, not platoons,
and there was very little room for initiative

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.119
or deviation at the platoon level or lower.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.799
The trained British regulars were well equipped
and many could accurately fire a “mad minute”,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.799
15 rounds at 300 yards with his Lee Enfield
rifle.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.359
This was just about the only weapon the British
infantry used in 1914.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:35.869
The spaced but tightly controlled, highly
trained British formations were very effective

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.520
in defensive actions against exposed, close-knit
attacking formations, like the German ones

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.409
they faced at the Battle of the Mons, the
first British encounter with Germans during

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.409
the war.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.679
The Germans were taken aback by the skill
of the outnumbered British, who they had seriously

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.009
underestimated.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.499
British tactics were not, however, so effective
on offense, against artillery, machine gun

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:00.600
fire, and an entrenched enemy.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.140
Indeed, it was clear early on in the war that
defense was king on the western front, and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.600
new equipment, weapons, and tactics must be
developed to break the stalemate.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.450
One change that was fairly unwelcome in the
British army was the change in the soldier

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
himself.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.660
The British regulars had been arguably the
best soldiers in the world in general, but

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.830
there had only been 100,000 or so of them,
and by the end of 1914 most of them were either

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.280
dead, missing, prisoners of war, or too badly
wounded to fight.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.350
The four types of soldiers Britain used over
the course of the war were described by Professor

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.930
Richard Holmes as “old, new, borrowed, and
blue”, as in something of each that a bride

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.780
should have at her wedding.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.320
Old as in the professionals at the beginning
of the war, followed by Borrowed when soldiers

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.421
were “borrowed” from the British Territorial
Army - the reserves for home defense, New

00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:59.440
was the army of volunteers that came after
them, and finally the Blue conscripted men.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.170
The Territorials were first used to replace
the regulars in places like Gibraltar or Egypt

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.990
to free up regulars for fighting in Europe,
though as 1915 rolled on they themselves were

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.790
fielded in ever-larger numbers on the Western
Front.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.380
These men had volunteered to go to the front
instead of serving at home and did not have

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.460
the training, the fitness, or the experience
of the regulars.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.590
There were more of them, though, and soldiers
also poured in from all corners of the British

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.320
global empire.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.570
But the war that these men turned up for was
rapidly changing, as new weapons, sub-unit

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.590
tactics, and leadership training developed.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.430
You had the widespread introduction of poison
gas, aerial reconnaissance and combat, and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.120
platoon technologies like light machine guns,
the mills bomb, rifle grenades, and trench

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120
mortars.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.260
Grenades were great for clearing out trenches
and dugouts without exposing yourself.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.470
They had begun use at the front as just a
locally made weapon, but the “jam-tin”

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.700
bombs were unpredictable and quite likely
to kill the thrower instead of the enemy.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.890
The Mills bomb #5 became the standard grenade
in 1915 and the rifle grenade variant, the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.910
#23, in 1917.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.459
The trench mortar, which the Germans brought
to the war at its beginning, was another big

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.630
innovation.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.430
Mortars themselves were old weapons, but their
steep angle of fire was ideal for trench warfare,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.470
and the Stokes mortar was simple, lightweight
and portable, and was the infantry’s artillery.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.750
With 1916 came Kitchener’s Army.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.680
These were the volunteers asked for by British
Secretary of State for War Lord Herbert Kitchener

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.400
in his iconic poster campaign.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.000
These men often served in platoons or companies
with their friends from school or work.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.620
The pals’ battalions were great for morale,
sure, but an entire generation of men from

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.900
a single town could be lost in one morning
if that unit had a disaster in battle.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.540
And disasters to the New Army certainly happened
in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.120
Thing is, senior British leaders did not really
trust the new army with having the initiative

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.510
to move and fight in small units, so there
was a kind of a return to 1914 thinking.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.990
The plan at the Somme was to destroy the German
defenses with artillery, walk across No-mans

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.560
land in battalion formation, and occupy the
destroyed positions as the cavalry exploited

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.400
the breakthrough.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.010
As we’ve seen in the regular episodes, this
did not happen.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.720
But the march of progress continued.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.370
The tank first saw battle in September 1916,
as the British premiered it to the world.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.590
They were not very effective, but they did
have enormous potential and showed that at

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.139
least somebody was forward thinking, and from
the battles of 1916 came the innovations of

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.139
1917.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.210
Specifically - the men were learning to coordinate
arms, weapon systems, and branches of service

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.810
to make a cohesive fighting force.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.490
But those men were no longer the old, the
new, or the borrowed.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.230
Volunteers were drying up so in 1916 Britain
passed the Military Service Act, which introduced

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.030
conscription, and by 1917 conscripts were
being sent to the front with no experience

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.650
and little training.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.990
Front line training, though, had seriously
improved; brigades and divisions had organized

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.510
training regimens, and soldiers spent a good
part of their “rest” days training.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.350
The platoons were re-organized into a self-contained
fighting unit, with its own specialized troops

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.000
- grenade throwers, machine gunners, snipers,
and so forth.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.920
These would now all work together under a
junior officer or sergeant on their own specific

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.030
objectives.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.130
By the Battle of Cambrai in late 1917, infantry
and tanks were even coordinated, with three

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.570
tanks and a platoon working together, even
as the infantry as a whole coordinated with

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.919
the artillery.

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.660
From then on it was clear- especially in battles
like Hamel and Amiens- that all of the branches

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.610
of the army must work together with objectives
designated all the way down to the smallest

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.930
of units.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.770
So the British soldier of 1918 was likely
a conscript, but with a lot of experience.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.200
He worked in a small team that featured a
variety of weapons specialists as opposed

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.740
to just riflemen, he knew his unit’s objectives
and he knew the ground he had to cover since

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.550
vastly improved communications, improved reconnaissance,
and intelligence analysis allowed for a detailed

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.810
knowledge of the enemy positions.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.730
He knew what to expect from the artillery,
he knew what the tanks were going to do and

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:39.370
how to work with them, and initiative was
expected and often encouraged at all levels,

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.990
even down to the individual.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.960
Now, you may wonder why this episode is just
about the British.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.790
This is part of a series of specials about
the tactics and the development of the various

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.889
nations’ armies.
