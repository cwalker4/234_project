00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.110
Costco is cheap really cheap.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.500
This chicken costs five dollars. These birds are an iconic

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.220
Costco product. Costco sells about 60 million of them every

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.780
year. Sounds like a great moneymaker right. Wrong. Costco

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.900
sells these chickens at a loss sometimes up to 30 to 40

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.350
million dollars per year. The chickens are a lure to get

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.140
customers in the door. They're placed strategically at the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.380
back of every Costco so customers might pick up other items

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.040
along the way.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.670
That's why Costco wants to keep the price so low.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.970
The trouble is that chicken prices have crept up over the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.570
last 10 years and the industry is practically an oligopoly

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.170
run by the likes of Tyson and Perdue. Costco like most

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.260
American Grocers buys from these behemoth companies because

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
there's no other option. But not anymore. In 2016 Costco

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.850
announced its plans to open a chicken farming operation in

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.270
eastern Nebraska. It will own the whole supply chain from

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
baby chicks to feed to the final product. This operation

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.870
will provide Costco with 40 percent of its yearly chicken

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.540
needs about 100 million chickens.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.780
That's one hundred million chickens. It won't have to buy

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.010
from Tyson or Perdue.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.610
But here's the problem. Large scale chicken farming doesn't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.880
really exist in Nebraska.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.370
So Costco is paying the not so cheap price of 440 million

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.750
dollars to make it happen.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.090
Costco's chicken operation will process about 2 million

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.810
chickens every week. Here's how it will work. Costco will

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
own the chickens feed and the processing plant. Local

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560
farmers will own the barns and equipment and raise Costco's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.350
chickens to maturity. Then the chickens will go to the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
plant in Fremont Nebraska where workers will prep the birds

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.650
for sale. Some will be sold in parts but most will become

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.830
those famous rotisserie chickens. This model is called

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.310
vertically integrated agriculture. It's a relatively new

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.210
method of farming.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
But today it's responsible for 95 percent of the nearly 9

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.760
billion chickens produced in America each year. So how did

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.360
we get here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.880
In the early 20th century chicken meat was merely a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.030
byproduct of egg production. The only chickens sold for

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.450
meat were older hens who could no longer lay eggs. So it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.150
was a rare and expensive product even though the meat would

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.450
be tough and unpalatable. By today's standards. But that

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.310
changed rapidly after World War 2.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.890
A couple of large companies Tyson and Perdue found ways to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.340
increase the number of chickens they would raise through

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.180
the industrial model where large numbers of similar breeds

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
are raised in confinement in houses. And the discovery that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
antibiotics are administered in small doses daily not only

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.140
keep the chickens healthy but would bring them to market

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.920
weight faster.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.280
Farmers can now raise fatter chickens with less feed in less

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.270
time and Americans quickly gained a taste for them. In 2012

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.540
the average American consumed four times as much chicken as

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.620
they did in 1950. More people eating more chicken sounds

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.730
great for farmers right.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.720
Not really independent farmers struggled to keep up with

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.780
costly new equipment so small to mid-sized farms began

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.690
disappearing vertically integrated mega farms took their

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.670
place producing twenty nine percent of chickens in 1967 but

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.060
ninety five percent today.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.130
By 2017 the industry produced over 30 billion dollars worth

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.060
of chickens so chicken went from a luxury product to the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.820
most commonly consumed meat in just a few decades.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.320
But this system has its own problems. The modern chicken

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.830
industry has faced a slew of criticisms inhumane treatment

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.950
of the chickens devaluation of property near processing

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.280
plants abusive treatment of plant workers environmental

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.670
degradation and exploitative farming contracts. The

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.940
contracts especially have come under fire in recent years

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.270
as farmers speak out in documentaries and file lawsuits

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.510
against their former employers. Just ask Craig Watts who

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.660
farms chickens for produce from 1992 to 2016.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.560
You just turned over control of your farm to that company.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.310
You did it the way they told you to do it. Whether it made

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.610
sense to you or not. But at the end of the day you could

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.890
follow those to a tee and they could still find something

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.140
that you didn't like. It was like hitting a moving target.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.040
A typical mega farm has three to five chicken barns each of

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.800
which costs the farmers about two hundred thousand dollars.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.980
Journalist Christopher Leonard argued in his 2014 book The

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.490
Meat Racket that this system makes farmers into modern day

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.090
sharecroppers trapped in indebted servitude on the edge of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.180
bankruptcy but taking their business elsewhere isn't an

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.910
option for chicken farmers. Chicken companies essentially

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.660
have spheres of influence across the US. And most farmers

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.380
only live close to one of them. To top it off wholesale

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.920
chicken prices have shot up over the last 10 years. Recent

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.620
lawsuits alleged that this is because the biggest chicken

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.830
companies illegally aspired to fix prices. To put it simply

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.310
chicken companies are making huge profits but consumers are

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.220
paying more and many chicken farmers live in poverty.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000
This is the industry that Costco is about to enter but it

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.140
wants to do it differently.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.070
While the specifics of Costco's contracts are confidential a

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.220
representative explains the basics to CNBC. Let's take a

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.150
look. First Costco offers 15 year guaranteed contracts.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.300
Most contracts are much shorter sometimes only lasting one

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.870
year or even just one flock of chickens. This should give

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.510
Costco's farmers time to pay off their two million dollar

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.470
loans. However Costco can also cancel a contract with 90

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.190
days notice.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.370
I didn't I don't know why we would accept a contract unless

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.250
there is some gross negligence on the part of on behalf of

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.590
the broker. I think that's the reason those types of

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.580
arrangements are there.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.760
Christopher Leonard argues that similar terms in other

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.030
contracts make it too easy for companies to cancel giving

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.790
them a disproportionate amount of power over the farmers.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.600
Second Costco will pay a baseline amount for each flock

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.720
regardless of quality as well as bonuses for good flocks.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.410
If a farmer consistently underperforms they'll be placed in

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.570
a grower improvement program which basically says grower

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.230
growers here's a challenge we see and this is a new

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.630
benchmark we want to help you get to so that you're

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.760
performing better and working with them.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.380
What's the former Perdue farmer sees the program as nothing

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.690
more than a first step to a canceled contract.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.820
That's pretty common in poultry contracts. One bad luck can

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.260
make a three long average really bad in a hurry.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.680
Third Costco is working with the Nebraska Department of

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.020
Environmental Quality to meet standards that are not

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.110
required by state or federal laws. But researchers from

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.320
Johns Hopkins argue that regulations can only do so much to

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.960
prevent the worst outcomes of large scale vertically

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.220
integrated agriculture.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.180
That part of Nebraska has somewhat of a fragile ecosystem

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.200
and and the the waste that is generated every shadow which

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.780
is put on fields is great fertilizer. While the right

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.440
quantities it is but if you're producing 2 million chickens

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.020
in a really small area it becomes a runoff problem.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.520
Finally Costco will pay its 1000 meatpacking plant workers

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.980
fifteen dollars an hour well above Nebraska's nine dollar

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.510
state minimum wage. However that's still significantly less

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.750
than the starting salary at Hormel plant in the 1990s

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.010
Costco's chicken operation will add an estimated one point

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.060
two billion dollars 10 Nebraska's annual GDP so it could be

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.180
a boon for Nebraska farmers who have signed up hope that

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.790
adding chickens will bolster their farms for years to come.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.700
One of the most exciting parts of adding chickens to our

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.720
operation is that I have a daughter who is graduating from

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.850
University of Nebraska Lincoln because of the chicken

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.070
operation we're able to bring her home.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.120
But others disagree. Randy Rupert a longtime resident of

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.090
eastern Nebraska formed a group specifically to oppose the

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.450
move.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.990
We don't want vertical integration in Nebraska. It's

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.960
wrongheaded it's bad for the environment it's bad for

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.280
farmers it's bad for towns are our mantra is This is not

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.970
farming this is this is industrial production of widgets

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.240
Costco's chicken operation won't open for another year.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.000
And besides the industry as a whole is moving towards

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.790
organic chicken. But with the State of the industry as it

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.460
is now it's worth asking is five dollars for a whole

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.050
chicken just too good to be true.
