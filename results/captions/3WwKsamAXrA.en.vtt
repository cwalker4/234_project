00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.170
The United States government was built by
the founders with many, many layers in order

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.389
to ensure a better union.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.600
By having so many checks and balances and
separation of powers, anyone who tried to

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.560
pull a hostile takeover of the government,
or turn it into something less democratic,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.730
would find an incredible amount of resistance
from multiple angles, and would have to take

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
years just to advance in any significant way.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.390
While this system has a lot of advantages,
it can also be very confusing even to many

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.320
living in the United States, because of the
staggering complexity of the entire system.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.200
The United States government and many of its
functions or responsibilities are often misunderstood

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.160
by the average citizen.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.400
10.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.989
There Is No “The Government” In The United
States

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.100
One of the favorite claims you will hear from
any conspiracy theorist is that there is something

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.789
called “the government.”

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
These theorists seem convinced that the United
States government is a vast, monolithic entity

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
that is always sharing information and working
towards the same goals.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.329
In a way, it seems to give them a feeling
of security that the government is all powerful

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.060
and able to watch out for them and protect
them, despite their constant fear mongering.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.109
However, they are greatly exaggerating the
competence and coordination of the United

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.189
States government.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.340
The government is made up of the legislative,
judicial and executive branches, all of which

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.829
have people within them with radically opposing
viewpoints.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.109
These people all have their goals to make
the world a better place, and like most politicians

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.109
they have secrets.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.539
The USA also has powerful state governments,
with similar setups.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.759
Dotted throughout the country are police departments
that rarely have to answer to much of anyone

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.779
and cooperate with each other on mostly a
good faith basis — then there are all the

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:53.889
sheriff’s departments as well, which are
elected officials and have different rules

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:55.990
and authority than the police.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.889
And then, if that wasn’t enough, there are
many spy agencies, and several different military

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.490
branches with many subgroups within them.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.700
Many of these groups, for secrecy reasons,
only share information on a strictly need

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.750
to know basis, so they may share certain surface
details to avoid bungling into each other,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.349
but it is highly unlikely in most cases that
they know exactly what the other agencies

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.720
or military branches full plans are, and what
their eventual goals are.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.439
In a way, the United States government is
like a centipede with all the legs moving

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.099
awkwardly in different directions.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.099
9.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.909
The Claims Of Military Dominance Are True
But Also Somewhat Misleading

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.140
One of the proudest boasts of the United States
and many of their citizens is that they spend

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.290
more on military, and have a more powerful
and well upgraded military than anyone in

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.290
the world.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.790
Now, we aren’t saying this boast isn’t
true — although Russia has a few more nukes

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.230
— but it does leave out some important details.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.250
Diplomacy is a subtle game, and showing off
your military dominance is often a great way

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.370
to get enemies to the negotiating table without
you having to lift a finger.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.090
However, if this type of diplomacy is done
in a less subtle way, your enemy may become

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.349
even more belligerent, and now you risk either
looking weak or being forced to invade.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.780
Now, the United States could probably invade
and take out a lot of small nations, but they

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.290
do not want to be forced to do so.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.609
The truth is that much of the military spending
actually goes towards maintenance on even

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.189
some fairly recent equipment, because maintaining
the most powerful military in the world is

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.250
incredibly expensive — and as you can imagine,
going to war is going to greatly increase

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.560
your maintenance bill.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.249
However, that is only a small part of the
cost of a sustained occupation, which can

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:36.250
cause a real hit to the budget of even a world
superpower like the United States of America.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.439
Despite taking control of Iraq and Afghanistan
fairly easily initially with almost no losses,

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:47.390
the actual sustained occupation was extremely
costly in both money and lives.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.390
8.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.459
The Power Of The President Is Still Greatly
Exaggerated

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.719
Many people have been trying to educate others
on this one for some time, but it does not

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.129
really seem to take hold.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.530
While many people will always be angry with
whoever is in the presidential office and

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.909
direct most of their anger toward them, they
are allowing others at fault to conveniently

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.280
avoid any real attention, and keep up their
work completely unheeded.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.030
The president of the United States of America
does have a certain number of powers, but

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.470
outside of signing or vetoing legislation,
actions made by the president can be reversed

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.820
by the next president to take power — as
they are not permanently binding without a

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.600
full act of congress — and could be fairly
easily blocked by congress or the courts.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.320
One of the greatest real powers of the president
is simply the amount of attention they get,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.740
which they can use to shape the public mindset
and act as a leader for their party, or for

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.990
a specific ideology.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.530
However, their power is much more limited
than many people realize.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.670
The leaders of the House and Senate have great
power to bring forth legislation to the president’s

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.820
desk, and it is extremely rare to see the
house or senate minority or majority leader

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.820
running for president.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.200
They already have an extremely powerful position,
and they do not have to deal with nearly as

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.580
much of people’s ire if they dislike a decision
— many of them would likely see the presidency

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.440
as a downgrade.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.920
There are also those in the judicial branch,
especially the supreme court, who wield tremendous

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.230
influence and power.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.460
A swing vote on the Supreme Court can shape
the face of the country, and they have their

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.210
position until they retire or death claims
them.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.210
7.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.830
Free Speech Only Applies To The Government
Limiting Your Speech

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.230
This pops up on message boards, and in public
places of business, and just about everywhere

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.610
else you can imagine.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.690
People will be told in some way by someone
in authority to be quiet, or tone down the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.950
type of thing they are saying, and the person
will go on a rant about freedom of speech,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.540
and how their first amendment rights are being
violated.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.890
Or some public figure will lose their job
for something they said in an interview, and

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.930
their fans will claim the first amendment
is being stomped on.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.660
However, the first amendment is very specific
and isn’t really interested in what private

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.070
citizens or places of business do.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.540
The first amendment states that the government
cannot abridge your speech, or the speech

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.400
of the press, and that people have a reasonable
right to public assembly to address their

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.450
grievances — in a public place.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.840
All this means is that the government has
to give you a reasonable accommodation if

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.780
you ask for a public protest, and cannot punish
you for what you say and put you in jail for

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.780
it.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.490
However, this does not mean a private place
of business, or a private website, has to

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.520
put up with you, nor does it mean your employer
has to give you a platform to express views

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.090
that are antithetical 
to them.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.100
Free speech protects you from government retaliation,
but retaliation from any sort of private entity

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.420
is another matter.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.420
6.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.800
Anti-Discrimination Laws Are On The Books,
But That Doesn’t Mean Proving It Is Easy

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.810
Sometimes it happens that someone gets kicked
out of an established place of business that

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.820
is open for the public.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.620
For whatever reason, the incident gets attention
and people argue about whether the people

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.860
involved were racist or not, when the people
kicked out were not white.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.300
Now, this is understandable considering the
history of the United States, but in all of

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.870
these cases many people are incensed that
no prosecutor or lawyer seems interested in

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.590
trying to punish someone with a civil rights
violation, or prosecute them with a hate crime.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.210
While it may seem obvious to some people watching
a video from a distance, proving something

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.210
like intent in a court of law can be a whole
lot more difficult.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.300
While civil rights laws now disallow discrimination
based on skin color and the like, public businesses

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.970
can refuse to serve anyone for really any
non-illegal reason they want, and as long

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.110
as they can come up with something remotely
reasonable sounding, the police will make

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.690
you leave and ask you not to come back.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.750
In some cases perhaps the person who was asked
to leave was a victim of racial discrimination

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.330
and did nothing wrong, but the trick is proving
that this has actually happened.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.300
If taken to court, the owner or manager of
the establishment could just give some kind

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.020
of reason like they were making staff uncomfortable,
or customers had complained, or something

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.470
hard to disprove.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.800
To win a case like this, you would practically
have to have tape of someone calling someone

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.940
racial slurs or the like, and it is fairly
rare for that type of outburst to be caught

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.940
on film.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.940
5.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.110
The Post Office Is A Part Of The Government,
But Requires No Tax Revenue

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.390
The United States Postal Service is an agency
that has confused a lot of people.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.460
Some people actually believe it is completely
distinct from the United States government

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.710
— this is not the case — or that it is
a private corporation owned by the government,

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.840
kind of like Amtrak.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.720
However, the USPS was actually founded back
in the days of Benjamin Franklin, who became

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.700
the first Postmaster General.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.440
He wanted the agency to have a certain level
of independence, but he still wanted it to

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.839
be a part of the United States government.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:39.510
The Postal Reconstruction Act of 1971 did
change the USPS, but it did not remove it

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.430
from the federal government, or make it a
private entity, and USPS employees are still

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.440
federal employees with all of the related
benefits.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.390
The confusion likely stems from the fact that
since this act, the USPS is expected to take

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.650
care of all of its operating expenses simply
by the costs it charges for its services.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.150
It does not exist to make a profit, and it
does not take your tax dollars — it takes

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.130
a fair price for the service provided, and
does its constitutionally mandated duty to

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.430
provide that service to all Americans no matter
what.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.430
4.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.780
Yes, Puerto Rico Is Indeed Part Of The United
States Of America

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.850
Recently there was a news story about a Puerto
Rican couple being turned away by a clerk

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:24.000
at a Motel 6, who told them that he needed
an American ID, and that an ID from Puerto

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.051
Rico did not count as such.

00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:29.440
Some people thought that the clerk was being
malicious, but it is more than likely that

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.000
he was honestly confused.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.530
The truth is that over 40% of Americans are
actually completely unaware that Puerto Ricans

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.170
are fellow citizens and that their territory
is considered part of America.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.490
Now, this is possibly in part due to the fact
that Americans get little exposure to the

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.060
United States territories.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.461
The Hawaiian islands are a very popular tourist
destination, but Puerto Rico, Guam, the US

00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:56.710
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern
Mariana Islands are as isolated from the mainland

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.900
as Hawaii and are simply not nearly as popular
spots.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.370
It would do well however, for Americans to
get a better knowledge of all US territories,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.700
and learn more about the intricacies of all
of what makes up America.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.680
The only thing a Puerto Rican needs to get
into the United States of America and stay

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.300
as long as they wish is their Puerto Rican
ID or passport, since they have already been

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.520
in America their entire lives to begin with.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.520
3.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.950
English Is Not The Official Language Of The
United States Of America

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.400
Sometimes people will get confused and start
talking about how in America, you speak English,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.920
and not any other language.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.820
They will demand this of others, and suggest
people should be forced to assimilate, or

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.820
they should leave.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.820
Now, this misunderstanding stems partly from
the fact that English is by far the most spoken

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.279
language in the country and is used for almost
everything written, but that doesn’t mean

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.279
it is correct.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.670
There are roughly 500 languages that are spoken
in the United States today, and the federal

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.810
government of the United States does not recognize
any of them as the official language of the

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.810
country.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.480
It has been proposed before, but it has never
succeeded, except on a state level.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.340
At this point several states have passed laws
stating that their state’s official language

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:08.800
is English, but this still does nothing, at
least yet, to change any federal laws or statutes.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.510
In truth, there is really no point to making
anything official — most people speak it,

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.070
and most people use it for written communication,
and there is rarely any confusion — there

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.250
is also the argument that making an official
language would violate the first amendment.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.480
Even if it were made the official language,
there are still some people who would struggle

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.340
with it, and keep speaking mostly in their
native language, and other citizens would

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.930
be happy to use their own language skills
to help them fit in, as humans like to do.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.930
2.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.250
The Jury System Is Not Foolproof, Jury Nullification
Can Be Used For Good Or For Ill

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.280
The jury system and justice system in general,
on its face, seems like a really, really good

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.280
idea.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.540
Everyone has to have a fair and speedy trial,
and no cruel or unusual punishment is allowed.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.670
Forced interrogations are a thing of the past
and people are presumed innocent instead of

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.670
guilty.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.871
In many ways it is a paragon of proper justice,
but every system has flaws, and one of the

00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:06.380
biggest ones in the United States is the ability
for juries, if the entire group is in sync,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.870
to simply to decide to do what they want and
tell the judge to take his instructions, and

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.980
the law and witnesses to take what they told
them, and stuff it.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.460
This is something called jury nullification,
but it can also be used to ensure someone’s

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.460
guilt.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.720
Now, it says you will have a jury of your
peers, but this is extremely dubious.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.839
No precedent has ever been followed to make
sure the people judging you are part of your

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:30.810
peer group, so you end up with whoever is
local to that courthouse.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.420
In some cases to prevent abuse a trial is
moved to an entirely different geography for

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.600
jury toxicity reasons, but this is not always
possible.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.150
In the old south in the United States of America,
many people who were obviously guilty of lynching

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.500
got away with it due to friendly juries, and
many black people saw themselves jailed with

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.250
what was basically nothing more than a cursory
examination from the jury.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.580
This isn’t to say the system is biased all
or much of the time, but perhaps emphasizing

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.910
the peers part in jury selection would help
improve the fairness of the process overall.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.910
1.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.180
The Supreme Court May Seem Insanely Powerful,
But They Do Not Have The Final Say

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.190
Many people get very, very upset when the
Supreme Court does something, and people from

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.520
both parties will accuse them of being activist
judges or something similar.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.930
It is quite common to suggest that the Justices
are actually trying to legislate from the

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:20.089
bench, and using their lifelong position to
control the country in an entirely inappropriate

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:21.089
way.

00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:24.910
This misconception likely stems from people
thinking that the Supreme Court has the final

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.190
say on everything.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.800
The Supreme Court’s job is not to legislate
or tell politicians what to do, it is to evaluate

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.410
laws based on the constitution and decide
if the constitution is being properly respected.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.780
However, laws can be changed to narrowly fit
requirements and they can be passed again,

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.040
or a constitutional amendment can be made
to override the Supreme Court entirely.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.740
If something like this were to occur in response,
it’s not like the Supreme Court could just

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.740
step in.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.399
Even if the Justices thought the new constitutional
amendment was incompatible with the rest of

00:13:55.399 --> 00:14:00.000
the constitution without more drastic changes,
they could not actually do anything until

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.550
someone had challenged it in court, and it
had properly worked its way up the ladder.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.260
Even if they wanted to hear a case as soon
as possible, they have to wait for it to reach

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.260
them.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.280
In the end, as much as some people may complain
about them, they are just interpreters of

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:41.040
the constitution — they are not legislators
or executives.
