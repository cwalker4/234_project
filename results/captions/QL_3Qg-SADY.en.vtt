00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.020
SHANE SMITH: Nearly every
industry in the world has a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.000
trade show.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.070
You have car shows, electronics
shows, even comics

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.610
have their own trade shows.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.630
But here in Jordan for the last
14 years, in huge tents

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.460
in the middle of the desert,
they have a massive

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.140
trade show for war.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.450
It's called the Special
Operations Forces Exhibition,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.333
or SOFEX for short, and it's
hosted by Jordan's King

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.095
Abdullah II, one of America's
only allies

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:39.400
in the Middle East.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.150
I wanted to know exactly what
was for sale and just who was

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.340
selling it at the world's
largest special-forces

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.210
supermarket.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.050
But I'm a magazine guy, not a
gun guy, so I brought along an

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160
ex-Marine and an Iraq War vet,
Matt Ruskin, to help me sort

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.860
through all this stuff.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.660
SHANE SMITH: It gets
interesting, because when you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.210
walk through security and you
come to this, it's sort of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.595
like a trade show out in the
middle of the desert.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.140
And the first thing you see are
like any other trade show,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.840
advertising.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.580
But here it's like, F-16 with
sniper targeting pod, the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.240
Hellfire missile, the
Javelin missile.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.865
It's crazy.

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.115
It's the first thing you see.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.630
And all this advertising
is aimed at

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.550
one audience, generals.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.670
So we're here at the
beginning of SOFEX.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.550
They're going to have the
keynote speeches.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.310
As you can see, there's pretty
much every general in the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.620
world here.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.870
It's crazy.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.190
SHANE SMITH: The arms industry
is estimated at anywhere

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.970
between $350 billion to $500
billion a year, one of the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.380
largest industries
in the world.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.280
And these are all the guys,
the military advisers, the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.510
generals, who come here to
buy weapons systems.

they used to talk about the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.090
Well, this is it right here,
the business of war.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.940
All the generals coming with
billions upon billions of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.140
dollars of taxpayer money to buy
weapons to fuck shit up.

SHANE SMITH: Here we go.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.700
It's all going to
kick off now.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.730
King Abdullah's arriving.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.725
So here come some of the
special ops forces.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.550
Jordan has a profound, almost
pathological, fixation with

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.610
special ops.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.340
Why?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.380
Well, one, because it borders
with Syria, Israel, Saudi

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.720
Arabia, and Iraq.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.290
And two, because "special ops"
is code for taking down

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.300
terrorists, insurgents, or
anyone else that the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.400
government deems to
be undesirable.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.180
And since 9/11, if you join
the fight against global

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.630
terrorism, it also means that
Uncle Sam will cut you a nice

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.350
big check for weapons,
especially if they're

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.600
American-made.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.450
So we just saw the
show of force.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.236
They took over the building.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:07.170
They dropped the people in.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.850
There was a hostage crisis.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.180
They did it all, they
killed everybody.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.400
And now SOFEX is
going to begin.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.019
And if you didn't know that
the military industrial

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.158
complex was a party,
you'd be wrong.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.330
So we're going to go in with all
of the generals, see what

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.580
everybody's buying.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.790

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.962

weapon systems.

you can buy at SOFEX.

purchase, they'll train you on

just how to use them, too.

can learn how to raid an

is a Airbus 300.

What it allows us to do is
various types of training as

it relates to special
operations, whether it's a

We can initiate smells and

may go along with a certain
kind of scenario.

That's right.

The mindset's a big factor
for each operator.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.260
And the more you can expose
them to in a controlled

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.900
environment like this, the
better operator he's going to

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.530
be, the more surgical
he's going to be.

they're going to make it smell

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.020
like rotting flesh.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.440
MALE SPEAKER 5: Burnt hair,
oily machinery, dead body.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.630
SHANE SMITH: Is there ever a
worry that baddies would come

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.250
and use the area as training?

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.640
Because you know, you have
Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.832
all those neighbors, and
you just wonder who

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:56.380
gets to come train.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.590
CHARLES REDLINGER: Well,
Jordan's in a tough

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.710
neighborhood.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.330
There's no doubt about it.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.460
SHANE SMITH: Jordan is in
a tough neighborhood.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.210
In fact, both Egypt and Syria
are currently trying to put

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.800
down popular rebellions, and
Iraq is basically in a full-on

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.430
special-ops civil war.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.420
And where are they getting
all these weapons?

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.070
SOFEX.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.110
How hard is it to come and buy
arms on the open market?

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.940
SHANE SMITH: And we noticed
that they sell kits.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.510
For example, you can buy a
regular helicopter, but you

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.710
can buy a kit to upgrade it to
add in a missile system or

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.190
Gatling gun system
quite easily.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.440
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE:
Yes, of course.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.090
SHANE SMITH: So I can buy a
helicopter from one country,

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.970
and I can buy a weapons system
from another country, and then

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.300
have an attack helicopter?

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.550
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE: Yes.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.790
SHANE SMITH: So North Korea's
bought some of these?

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.080
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE: Yes.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.380
SHANE SMITH: Can I
have a key chain?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.120
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, sure.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.986
SHANE SMITH: Thank you.

00:11:30.986 --> 00:11:33.280
Where are you guys from?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.770
SHANE SMITH: Kazakhstan.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.040
Czech Republic.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.220
Is that made in Azerbaijan?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.960
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.800
SHANE SMITH: Yeah?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.480
So Azerbaijan makes the
biggest, longest

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.950
rifle I've ever seen.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.310
Where are you guys from?

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.840
MALE SPEAKER 6: Germany.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.060
SHANE SMITH: Germany.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.290
Turkey is here.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.530
China is here.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.760
Jordan is here.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.400
The Russians are here, all
selling weapons systems to

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.470
whoever wants to buy them.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.330
You want jets?

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.210
You want rockets, helicopter
grenade,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.710
RoboCop killer systems?

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.823
[ROBOT VOICE]

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.888
You have 20 seconds to comply.

00:12:05.888 --> 00:12:08.210
You got it.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.920
That's an automatic
grenade launcher.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.150
MATT RUSKIN: That's my favorite
weapon in the entire

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.310
Marine Corps arsenal there.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.966
SHANE SMITH: No one's
stopping him.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.610
No one's saying, hey, you
shouldn't be actually playing

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.660
with the grenade launcher.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.070
Now fucking around with these
dudes and their guns was fun.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.680
But after a while you start to
freak out, because you realize

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.060
that they're selling weapons the
same way that you'd sell

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.470
next year's car model.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.690
MALE SPEAKER 7: The world's
most demanding

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.510
shooters demand SIG.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.750
This is the world's most
revolutionary pistol.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.840
We have the resources and
the energy to solve

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.930
any small-arms problem.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.100
SHANE SMITH: Javelin would be
one of the most innovative

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.350
weapons systems.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.730
SHANE SMITH: And when he says
successful, what he really

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.900
means is that it's great
at destroying stuff.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.900
And we weren't the only ones to
notice, like the Marine we

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.705
ran into who had just finished
his second tour in Iraq.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.930
SHANE SMITH: And the biggest
sellers by far are the

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.110
American companies.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.100
In fact, 16 of the 20 largest
arms manufacturers are based

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.630
in the United States.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.300
And being the biggest store in
the mall means selling a lot

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.680
of weapons to a lot of people.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.420
What's crazy about this is that
America gives a lot of

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.660
these countries foreign aid so
that they can come here and

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.750
buy weapons systems from
their companies.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.480
It's kind of like a parent
giving their kids the credit

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.440
card and saying, go to the mall
that I own and just buy

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.990
whatever you want.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.360
So the last time you were in the
Middle East, you were in

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.210
Iraq as a Marine.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.140
Does it spin you out to see like
Northrop Grumman, General

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.120
Dynamics, all these American
companies making tons of money

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.090
off of war?

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.890
MATT RUSKIN: What's the trip is
you see Norinco right here

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.016
next to an American
arms display.

00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:15.040
And they used to launch 9-foot
Norinco rockets on us.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.590
SHANE SMITH: Really?

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.890
MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.310
SHANE SMITH: The insurgents
would buy Norinco rockets and

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.280
then use them against you.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.930
And they're right next to the
American military companies.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.210
Interesting.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.290
So we went over to the Norinco
booth to see if they could

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.390
explain how their weapons ended
up in the hands of Iraqi

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.513
insurgents.

While we couldn't get an answer
from the Chinese,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.970
sitting right there on display
in the next booth over were

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.190
shells that were exactly the
same as the ones Iraqi

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.600
insurgents used to make roadside
bombs, or IEDs.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.280
MATT RUSKIN: All right, they
take the tips off of these,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.750
and you can see it's pretty
hollow in there.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.330
And they'll pack this whole
thing full of C4, and it

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.540
creates some hellacious
shrapnel.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.775
SHANE SMITH: And here you can
just buy it like you would a

00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:28.400

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.855

No.

compete on that.

on those two.

these special-ops guys strut

impressive.

start thinking about the

guys come from, you can't help

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.590
but wonder the circumstances in
which these urban assault

be put to use.

might see down the road in

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.079
Afghanistan and recognize faces

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.450
definitely goes a long way.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.970
[GUNSHOTS]

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.550
SHANE SMITH: And recognizing
faces is important.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.450
In fact, facial recognition
technology is just the latest

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.550
feature being built into many
unarmed aerial vehicles, which

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.472
are also known as drones.

00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:43.160
You know, when you were a kid,
you used to have those little

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.190
model airplanes.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.740
And there'd be like, somebody's
dad would be a real

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.270
nerd and have the
model airplane.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.270
Now, it's all
model-airplane-style drones

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.140
that can take pictures
or drop bombs.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.140
The sad thing is that countries
who actually buy

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.100
this stuff rarely end up using
it against foreign militaries.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.760
More often than not,
they're turning it

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.220
against their own citizens.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.450
And thanks to the number of
governments who are afraid of

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.110
their own people, business
is booming.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.040
ADAM THOMAS: We've just made
an assessment of the global

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.855
security market spending.

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:20.335
And our assessment this year
is we think spending on

00:18:20.335 --> 00:18:23.000
security's between
$180-190 billion.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.605
We now see that doubling
to $400 billion in

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.930
the next four years.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.960
SHANE SMITH: $400 billion
just on--

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.100
ADAM THOMAS: That's everything,
from border

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.940
security, homeland security,
anti-immigration, anti-drug,

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.770
protection of oil fields,
and everything else.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.150
SHANE SMITH: So even
in a recession--

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:37.980
ADAM THOMAS: Yep.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.570
So you can see two to three
times more on security

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.770
spending than there's
going to be on

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.270
defense tactical spending.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.545
Hence, the importance
of SOFEX.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.900
SHANE SMITH: So we
just left SOFEX.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.210
We're pretty spun out.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.670
A lot of generals, a lot of
weapons systems, missiles,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.300
tanks, planes, helicopters,
and it's kind of a bummer.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.690
And as we left SOFEX, the
magnitude of what we

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.400
just saw hit us.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.600
If the arms markets are doubling
every year in sales,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.330
it means that the armies are
actually using and expending

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.876
their weapons, which means,
quite simply, that they're

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:16.324
killing people.
