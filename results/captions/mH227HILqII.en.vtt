00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.230
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.080
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Gilgit, Pakistan,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.820
and in the Karakoram Mountain Range.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.750
Today we are gonna go on a
cultural and food tour of Gilgit.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540
We're gonna explore the market.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.320
We were invited to a
local home to eat lunch.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.110
I'm psyched to be here,
it's just spectacular.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.343
Okay, let's move.

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:22.224
(upbeat music)

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.170
All right, I'm gonna rewind
real fast to the day before.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.870
Our plan was to drive
through Deosai National Park

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.680
on our way to Gilgit, but things
didn't work out as planned

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.890
so we ended up having to turn around

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.777
and make a very long drive
in the opposite direction

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:40.700
to get to Gilgit.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.560
Before we start today's tour of Gilgit,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.670
I just wanna show you a
little bit of yesterday.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.210
We're not sure how much snow...

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.320
It snowed last night, but we're
gonna go across the plains

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.550
and try, attempt, to
get to the other side,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.450
and then make our way to Gilgit.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.620
Okay, getting kind of cold now,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.348
but we've stopped at Satpara Lake.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.921
(car engine revving)

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.763
(car door closes)

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.346
(upbeat music)

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.720
(car engine roars)

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.631
It's snowing.

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:12.876
(laughing)

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:15.112
- [Ali] This is the
starting point of Deosai.

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:17.060
This is the starting point
of Deosai National Park.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.903
- Sweet.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:21.390
(laughing)

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.230
Got a bit of...

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.100
Got a bit of a dilemma.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.442
Okay, my lips are starting to freeze.

00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:29.670
- This place is like 12,000 feet,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.610
and it's gonna be 14,000 feet
once we get to Sheosar Lake.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.760
- And it's gonna be snowing harder?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.533
- Certainly harder, it's
gonna take the elevation

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.510
2,000 more feet.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.260
- We're not sure if we should
pass all the way through.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660
I mean, if it's not safe
then let's not risk it.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.170
That's just fresh powder.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.223
That's, like, snow cone, cheers.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.879
Did you eat some snow?

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.155
Oh, that's cold.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.738
(upbeat music)

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.690
The chicken boti kebabs are on the grill.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.543
It smells so good.

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:10.690
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.523
Oh, nice.

00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:20.198
Oh, wow.

00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:21.530
Back in the car now, we're
on our way to Gilgit.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.554
We still, I'm sure, have about
three or four hours left.

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:26.550
(upbeat music)

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.750
Okay, so it is midnight.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.830
We've been driving since
6:30 a.m. this morning.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.810
We finally arrived to Gilgit.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.186
Thank you, nice to meet you.

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.497
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:38.500
- [Woman] This is homemade
crepe and fritter.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.083
(upbeat music)

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:45.709
(laughing)

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.770
- They prepared dinner for us,
and we got here kind of late,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.713
but they've graciously still
served us dinner at 1:00 a.m.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.343
Okay, next up for a local soup.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.445
It's so juicy.

00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:05.028
(upbeat music)

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.893
Thank you.

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:16.689
(upbeat music)

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.240
Welcome to the center of Gilgit,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.640
it's a bustling little city
but actually quite calm.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.190
The air is fresh.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.930
Actually we're driving in the van,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.570
but we just noticed this giant
pot of food right up ahead,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.280
and that's actually the
reason why we stopped.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.190
We gotta see what's in there.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.610
But just take a look at this truck.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.380
Fully outfitted for the mountains.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.560
They're loading it up.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.398
There's garlic and vegetables on the top.

00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:46.948
Look at that detail.

00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:50.750
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.640
I love how it's topped in
a leopard print blanket.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.023
Oh, nice, he just opened it up.

00:03:57.693 --> 00:03:59.300
Oh, that aroma, yeah, it's huge.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.820
And it looks like such fluffy rice.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.460
So it is Kabuli pulao.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.670
He dishes you a plate,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.660
and then he scoops on a bunch of yogurt

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.950
with tomatoes and onions
and cucumber inside.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.150
Yeah, what a cool spot.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.040
And, he's just, like, it's
in this closet-little shop.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.140
The master pot, it takes up
the entire front entrance

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.400
of the entire shop,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.750
and then there's some
dark seating in the back.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.570
It's so light and fluffy,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.180
like the cinnamon-y spices.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.740
- Warm rice underneath,
and the cool yogurt

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.340
and the crunch from the
onions, that's really nice.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.880
- Yeah, that fresh vegetable-like yogurt.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.340
Vegetable-filled yogurt.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.173
Thank you.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:47.916
- [Mark] Get that yogurt on that.

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:50.190
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.500
Oh, yeah, it would be good, though.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.590
Okay, Ali is just asking
for a piece of meat.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.290
Thanks to Ali we got the meat hookup.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.760
He asked him for some extra meat there,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.080
because there's not a
lot of meat in the dish,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.250
mostly used just for
flavor, to flavor the dish,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.920
but we did get a couple chunks
plus some more of that raita,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.233
that's the yogurt sauce
with the vegetables in it.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.583
Oh, the meat, yum.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.951
And bathing in steam of the pot.

00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:15.201
- He's eating in the car.

00:05:16.402 --> 00:05:18.263
(horn honking)

00:05:18.263 --> 00:05:20.763
(chill beats)

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.823
- The one over here is beef sliver.

00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:29.680
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.200
- We stopped at the next stall.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.010
We saw... it's beef.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.220
It looks so beautifully
marinated with chilis

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.720
and some kind of a red something.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.170
How can you resist a stall
that looks like this?

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.530
We got also some chutney,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.960
but let me just taste that straight meat.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.350
This is right off the grill.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.680
You just bite it right off the skewer.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.513
It's dripping.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.844
That's like salty, you
taste the chilis in there.

00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:52.963
That's some good meat.

00:05:54.462 --> 00:05:55.670
(dishes clanging)

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.485
(car horn honking)

00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.450
And that chutney, I don't
know what that chutney is.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.350
There's, like, lumps in it.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.100
It's kind of, like, yogurt-y maybe.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.060
The chutney is kind of plain,
maybe a little chili in there.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.700
And I think that is yogurt, maybe.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.230
Again, dip it in that
chunky, curdled chutney.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.313
Never had a chutney like that before.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.714
Oh, yeah, all the liver is great.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.750
(upbeat music)

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.210
We haven't even made it to
the main bazaar, main market.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.120
That's where...

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.770
We're on our way there right now.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:33.124
(chill beats)

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.390
You just will not be able
to get over, to fathom,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.640
the views from the city, just
the mountains surrounding,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.030
and just, like, the most
rugged, jagged, steep cliffs

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.630
of any mountains I've ever seen.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.940
And just snow-covered,
capped mountains everywhere.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.053
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:54.053 --> 00:06:55.928
I just got the full spectrum.

00:06:55.928 --> 00:06:57.800
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.380
Thank you, it's so good.

00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:08.672
(chill music)

00:07:08.672 --> 00:07:11.050
Oh, that looks so good.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.941
Again, just a total unplanned stop.

00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.100
The man selling the curry, he
actually was smiling at Micah

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.520
and waving at Smile with this huge grin.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.630
What an amazing man.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.030
You couldn't resist the chaplis?

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.871
- Yup.
- No.

00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:23.911
(laughing)

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:25.655
- [Ali] How could a day go
by without having chaplis?

00:07:25.655 --> 00:07:27.450
- [Mark] When a day can
go by without chaplis.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.600
- When we walked up,
though, he was like...

00:07:30.546 --> 00:07:33.213
(food sizzling)

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.580
- Oh, it's like a doughnut.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.360
And Uncle has this amazing
little dining room.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.710
Check out this little
closet-sized dining room.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.570
We're gonna sit in here.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.070
Okay, we got the chapli kebab.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.790
This is such a cool little spot,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.110
and they have to have indoor sections

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.020
because it gets so cold
in the winter here.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.233
Gonna start with the meat
curry along with the okra.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.563
Wow, that has some oily goodness to it.

00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:02.488
- Cheers, dude.

00:08:07.735 --> 00:08:09.860
- Oh yeah, you could
just tell from his smile

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.860
and his, like, jolly aura that
his food was gonna be good.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.921
Oh, that's just warm and
comforting and rich and delicious.

00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.910
Very nice.
- Okay, okay.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.860
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.602
It's got that wonderful, like, sliminess

00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:26.098
from the okra.

00:08:26.098 --> 00:08:28.348
(laughing)

00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:32.690
He just sets it on the table.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.530
Too bad it's not already
pre-cooked or we would order it.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.790
But he really wanted us to see the fish,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.369
so he set it on the table with us.

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:41.202
(laughing)

00:08:41.202 --> 00:08:44.012
Gave us a big smile and thumbs
up while he was doing it.

00:08:44.012 --> 00:08:45.580
(laughing)

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.710
What an amazing man.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.960
Oh man, you can smell that.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.060
The coriander seed is what
always is so noticeable to me,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.619
and this is all buffalo
meat, made from buffalo meat.

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:55.157
Okay, beautiful.

00:08:55.157 --> 00:08:57.657
(chill beats)

00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.234
(laughing)

00:09:00.234 --> 00:09:03.176
That's one of the greatest
possible formations of meat.

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:05.780
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.960
Yes.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.143
Okay, we're probably spending
way too much time here.

00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:14.680
We could just not leave,
but we gotta move on,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.430
because we gotta get to the village

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.870
where we have a home,
where we've been invited,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.800
to eat a home-cooked meal,
which is gonna be spectacular.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.219
Thank you, shukrian.

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:27.249
(chill beats)

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:30.443
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:33.840
The bridge actually leads
across, this is the Hunza River.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.440
Oh, man, the peaks, the snow-capped peaks,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.223
just fully surrounding, it's spectacular.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.131
(motorbike engine roaring)

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:43.531
(water rushing)

00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.114
(upbeat music)

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.700
We're on our way to the village now,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.040
but walking through the
market, walking through Gilgit,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.420
people were so friendly.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.340
People wanted to shake hands,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.670
dish they have a photo, to smile.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.173
Yeah, people are amazing here.

00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:05.756
(upbeat music)

00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:15.460
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.700
One of Ali's employees
is from this village,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.280
and he invited us to his village,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.983
to his home, for lunch today.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.220
That's the backyard,
that's their backyard.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.890
Look at that peak, you could just...

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.513
The mist, spectacular scenery.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.130
Nizam is the...

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.730
He's hosting us.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.270
What a backyard, and he said
that he takes his cattle

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.570
and his sheep and goats up
the mountain there to graze.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.020
It's unbelievable.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.990
We have a massive
mountain in the backyard,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.340
but this is the front yard,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.300
and if I can zoom over on this mountain,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.480
can you see that trail that
goes along this mountain?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.940
Nizam has just told us

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.070
that that's part of the
original Silk Road route.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.300
Micah, can you shake hands?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.133
- [Woman] Nice to meet you.

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:01.173
- [Mark] Yeah, good job, Micah.

00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:02.180
- [Woman] Nice to meet you, Peta, look.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.080
- He got to say hello to
some of the kids here.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.194
They're so nice and friendly.

00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:08.861
(kids laughing)

00:11:18.192 --> 00:11:22.109
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:25.300
Quick cup of tea before
we go to the garden

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.891
before we start more cooking.

00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:30.010
(upbeat music)

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.117
Oh, that's great.

00:11:31.117 --> 00:11:33.810
(upbeat music)

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.700
Okay, we're on our way to the garden.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.533
But we gotta...

00:11:36.533 --> 00:11:38.400
I guess it's a little
bit further than a walk.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.233
We're trying to save some time

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:41.370
so we're gonna jump in
this little minivan.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.653
(upbeat music)

00:11:57.525 --> 00:11:58.730
(laughing)

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.808
- That was quite a struggle.

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:01.847
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.560
- This is a saag field,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.600
a vegetable that we've
been eating frequently,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.850
and lots of corn as well.

00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:08.913
It's sweet corn.

00:12:08.913 --> 00:12:11.350
- [Ali] It's sweet corn.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.670
- I can actually feel
the fresh mountain air

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.686
just entering my lungs
with every single breath.

00:12:16.686 --> 00:12:19.269
(upbeat music)

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.857
We just made it to Nizam's
grandparents' home,

00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:23.864
and this is still a traditional home

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:26.497
made of stones and mud.

00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:29.316
(upbeat music)

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:30.780
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.903
- So they cut them in pieces,

00:12:32.903 --> 00:12:37.176
and then they dry them to
make a powder, a chili powder.

00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:39.698
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:39.698 --> 00:12:42.910
- That is a beautiful sight,
one of my favorite ingredients.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.960
I think we'll take some chilis for lunch.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.813
He's gonna crush some chilis, yes.

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:54.189
(laughing)

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.927
I just showed him the photo

00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:03.850
of him grinding the chilis.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.571
He just burst out into
just ultra happiness.

00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.582
(laughing)

00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:13.692
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:14.525
(laughing)

00:13:14.525 --> 00:13:15.673
What an amazing man.

00:13:16.878 --> 00:13:17.711
Thank you.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.370
We got some of the fresh saag.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.663
Just gonna sample it raw real fast.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.533
Ripe.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.680
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.560
- Is it?
- Yeah.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.590
- How does it taste?

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.423
- It's sweet.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.973
Sweet and so green tasting.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.380
It's unimaginable how hospitable

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.040
and how generous and
friendly the people are here.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.443
And just the chuckles and the handshakes.

00:13:50.318 --> 00:13:51.780
(sighing)

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.293
And the fresh air.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.740
One more type of saag that
we gotta see over here

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.120
underneath the cornfield.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.270
Is this (foreign word).

00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:04.893
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:07.422
(upbeat music)

00:14:07.422 --> 00:14:10.810
- This is one massive green chili.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.563
Wow, it's almost the size of a banana.

00:14:13.563 --> 00:14:15.055
(laughing)

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.638
(upbeat music)

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.980
Okay, back in the mini
mini-van on our way to go eat.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.680
I hope we can make it up the hill.

00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:31.139
(spices sizzling)

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:36.139
(women speaking in foreign language)

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.110
They've already prepared
most of the dishes,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.860
but they're just preparing that saag,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.970
especially that saag that we just picked,

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.400
and just kind of stirring frying
that in a little bit of oil

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.682
with some onions and chilis.

00:14:46.682 --> 00:14:50.630
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.730
Oh, it's dried tomato.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.330
And now we're gonna go take
a peak inside the kitchen

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.320
where some of the dishes, I think,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.670
have already been prepared.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.193
- 120 years old, this place.

00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:03.001
- This whole building?

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:05.930
Oh, cool, so cool.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.862
What's really cool about this house,

00:15:07.862 --> 00:15:11.370
I mean this old style house
is that there's a sun roof,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.870
but also right in the center
is where the stove is,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.133
but that also heats the little house,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:23.170
and then there's just carpets
and mats and pads all around.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.430
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.973
It's spectacular, beautiful.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:31.511
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:34.094
(upbeat music)

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.650
All the food is ready,
it's placed before us.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.950
A huge thank you to Nizam
and his entire family

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:46.188
for preparing this amazing, amazing meal.

00:15:46.188 --> 00:15:47.680
(upbeat music)

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.589
Mutton curry, just look, it looks so good.

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:53.620
(upbeat music)

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.453
When it's this good

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.760
you just gotta reach in with your fingers,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.578
get some of the rice, some of the mutton.

00:15:58.578 --> 00:16:01.161
(upbeat music)

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:04.530
Oh, wow.

00:16:06.443 --> 00:16:08.260
That is stunning, oh wow.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.440
You can actually taste the chilis in it.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.240
It's spicier than other
regions of food that we have.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.850
You taste the chilis.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.443
That sauce is so rich and succulent.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.573
Oh, that is stunning.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.080
And kind of tomato-y, garlic-y.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.440
Okay moving on over to the vegetable,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.580
and then yeah, I got that chili.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.903
Oh, nice.

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:32.779
Here's some of the saag, and
we'll reach in for that chili.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.820
That vegetable has a
really nutty taste to it.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.120
When it's cooked down,
it's like sweated down,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.670
it still has that crispness.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.090
The big chili is coming,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.540
but it has such a nutty
flavor to that vegetable.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.977
Nice, the big chili.

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:53.810
(laughing)

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.397
Okay, try this chili.

00:16:55.397 --> 00:16:57.980
(upbeat music)

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.720
It's not like intensely
spicy, but it's so flavorful.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.000
It's so fresh tasting,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.830
and this is the chili we
just picked up off the...

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.833
The chili tree, like, moments ago.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.833
Would you guys all like
to have a chunk of chili?

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:16.823
A chili cheers.

00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:20.698
(upbeat music)

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.663
Oh, it's sweet.
- So crisp.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.860
- Yeah, not, not spicy.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.253
- I was ready for the
worst, but this so good.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.223
- Not really spicy, more like
crisp and sweet, actually.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.240
I have to take one more
bite of the mutton curry

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.630
before proceeding onto
the beef curry, I believe.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.813
Okay, this one is the beef curry,

00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:50.300
and I got some of a
chunk of the roti as well

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.320
to sample with it.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.313
Oh, I got a nice nugget of the beef.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.210
The beef is unbelievable.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.360
You taste the tomatoes,

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.423
and then you taste the cumin so vibrantly.

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:07.272
And it's like tomato-y.

00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:11.164
Oh, that's incredible.

00:18:13.323 --> 00:18:16.910
And the curries are
amazing, but that vegetable,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.433
it's so fresh tasting, that nuttiness,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.582
and how they just sauteed it down

00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:23.426
in onions and garlic and the oil.

00:18:23.426 --> 00:18:26.534
That's the way vegetables should taste.

00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:29.790
(upbeat music)

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.970
There's only one thing that
can possibly make you forget

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.657
about the stunning scenery
that is right behind us,

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.840
and that is a meal and
hospitality this good,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.776
but then when you

00:18:40.776 --> 00:18:41.970
prepare it with the food

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.710
and you think about the
scenery that we're sitting in,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.046
it just makes it like an
experience beyond belief.

00:18:48.046 --> 00:18:50.629
(upbeat music)

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.520
What a treat, what a privilege.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.280
The spices, the home flavors,
the natural ingredients,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.333
the vegetables, and made with
so much love and hospitality.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.520
I wanna say a huge thank you
to Nizam and his entire family

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.810
for their gracious kindness.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.030
This was...

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.730
It is a meal I will never forget.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.630
And this location.

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:21.730
(breathing heavily)

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.131
Blown away.

00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:25.548
(kid crying)

00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:30.240
Shukran, shukran, oh, the green tea.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.583
Nice, shukran.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.350
Just to completely wash it
down, nothing more satisfying.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.883
This is a perfect situation,
and a beautiful family.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.450
What a special day.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.210
I cannot even...

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.250
I can't even fathom
everything from the scenery

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.743
to the hospitality and culture.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.390
Man, what a day, what a day.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.995
Buh-bye, buh-bye, thank you.

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.850
(upbeat music)

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.950
All right, back in the same place

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.720
that I started this video this morning.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.137
That was an unbelievable day
here in Paksitan, in Gilgit.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.200
Thank you to Nizam and his
entire family for hosting us.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.070
And thank you to Ali from
Landmark Communications,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.520
and Landmark Travel for organizing

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.930
and for setting everything up.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.020
That's gonna be it for this video.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.130
Tomorrow is gonna be another big day.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.050
Tomorrow we drive from Gilgit
to Hunza, Hunza Valley,

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.030
which is supposed to be one of
the most spectacular valleys

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.440
maybe in the world.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.767
It's gonna be an amazing
day, so stay tuned for that.

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:42.040
