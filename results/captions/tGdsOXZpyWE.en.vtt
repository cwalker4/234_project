00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:14.712
Tennessee Williams once told us,

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.881
"There comes a time
when you look into the mirror

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:21.853
and you realize that what you see
is all you'll ever be,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:26.349
and then you accept it
or you kill yourself,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.090
(Laughter)

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.611
or you stop looking in mirrors."

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:32.711
(Laughter)

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.811
And speaking of mirrors,
someone else once said,

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:40.243
"If we spend too much time scrutinizing
what's in our rearview mirror,

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:43.653
we're certain to crash
into a light post.''

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:48.956
I've spent the last four years of my life
studying people who look in mirrors,

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:52.973
rearview and otherwise
in their search for self-awareness.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.330
I wanted to know
what self-awareness really is,

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:58.357
where it comes from,

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.897
why we need it,

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:01.894
and how to get more of it.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:06.163
My research team surveyed
quantitatively thousands of people.

00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:10.289
We analyzed nearly 800 scientific studies.

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.824
And we conducted dozens
of in-depth interviews

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.972
with people who made dramatic
improvements in their self-awareness.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.059
Now, initially,

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:23.369
we were actually so worried
that we wouldn't find any of these people

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.456
that we called them
self-awareness unicorns.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:27.682
(Laughter)

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:28.676
True.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.991
But thank goodness, we did find them.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.997
Because what these unicorns taught me

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:36.821
would create a ground-breaking revelation

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:40.499
for how all of us can find
genuine self-awareness.

00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:42.970
And that's what I want to share with you.

00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:48.364
Today, I want you to reflect
on how you're reflecting.

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.497
I know that's a mouthful.

00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:53.770
And to get there,
we're going to need to shatter

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.070
one of the most widely held beliefs
about finding self-awareness.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.074
But first things first.

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:02.965
What is this thing we call
self-awareness anyway?

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:06.251
It's the ability to see ourselves clearly,

00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:10.227
to understand who we are,
how others see us

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:12.373
and how we fit into the world.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.274
Self-awareness gives us power.

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:18.529
We might not always like what we see,

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.515
but there's a comfort
in knowing ourselves.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.915
And there's actually a ton of research

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:27.440
showing that people who are self-aware
are more fulfilled.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.081
They have stronger relationships.

00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:31.403
They're more creative.

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:34.595
They're more confident
and better communicators.

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:38.453
They are less likely to lie,
cheat, and steal.

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:42.396
They perform better at work
and are more promotable.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:47.790
And they're more effective leaders
with more profitable companies.

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:53.325
In the world of self-awareness,
there are two types of people:

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:57.031
those who think they're self-aware,

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.474
(Laughter)

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.553
and those who actually are.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:03.728
It's true.

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:08.841
My team has found that 95% of people
think they're self-aware,

00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:10.732
(Laughter)

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:15.107
but the real number
is closer to 10 to 15%.

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:18.498
You know what this means, don't you?

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.798
(Laughter)

00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:23.928
It means that on a good day -
on a good day -

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:27.011
80% of us are lying to ourselves

00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:28.394
(Laughter)

00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:31.050
about whether we're lying to ourselves.

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:32.945
(Laughter)

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:34.364
Pretty scary, right?

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:40.405
So you can imagine the challenge we had
in figuring out who was truly self-aware.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.662
What do you think
would've happened if I had said,

00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.840
"Hey! How self-aware are you?"

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:47.114
Exactly.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.182
So to be part of our research,
our unicorns had to clear four hurdles.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.285
They had to believe they were self-aware

00:03:56.285 --> 00:04:00.154
as measured by an assessment
my team developed and validated.

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:06.316
Using that same assessment,
someone who knew them well had to agree.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:08.250
They had to believe

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.141
that they'd increased
their self-awareness in their life,

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:14.984
and the person rating them had to agree.

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.254
We found 50 people

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:23.262
out of hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds who met our criteria.

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.358
They were professionals, entrepreneurs,
artists, students, stay-at-home parents.

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:35.901
And we didn't find any patterns
by industry, age, gender

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.734
or any other demographic characteristic.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:43.854
These unicorns helped my team
discover a most surprising truth.

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.888
That approach you're using to examine

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:50.311
your thoughts, your feelings,
and your motives,

00:04:50.654 --> 00:04:52.605
you know, introspection.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:55.087
Well, you're probably doing it -

00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:57.355
there's no easy way to say this -

00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:00.912
you're probably doing it totally wrong.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.380
Yes, there is a reason
so few of us are self-aware.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.069
So let me tell you about the evening

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.991
that I first discovered the ugly truth
about introspection.

00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:17.469
It was about 10 p.m. on a beautiful
Colorado spring evening.

00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:18.832
And I was in my office,

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:22.146
hopped up on Diet Coke
and Smartfood popcorn.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:23.656
(Laughter)

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:26.438
And I just analyzed a set of data,

00:05:26.438 --> 00:05:30.048
and to say that I was surprised
would be an understatement.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.060
My team and I had just run a simple study

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:35.863
looking at the relationship
between introspection

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.468
and things like happiness,
stress and job satisfaction.

00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:45.246
Naturally, the people who introspected
would be better off.

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:47.228
Wouldn't you think so?

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:51.619
Our data told the exact opposite story.

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.904
People who introspected
were more stressed and depressed,

00:05:58.068 --> 00:06:01.417
less satisfied with their jobs
and their relationships,

00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:06.736
less in control of their lives.

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:10.462
I had no idea what was going on.

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:12.127
And it got worse.

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:17.566
These negative consequences increased
the more they introspected.

00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:19.821
(Laughter)

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:23.137
So I was quite confused.

00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:27.738
Later that week, I ended up
coming across a 20-year-old study

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:31.559
that looked at how widowers
adjusted to life without their partners.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.653
The researchers found

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:37.244
that those who try to understand
the meaning of their loss

00:06:37.504 --> 00:06:42.277
were happier, less depressed
one month later,

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:46.226
but one year later,
were more depressed.

00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:51.044
They were fixated on what happened
instead of moving forward.

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.478
Have you been there?

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:54.959
I have.

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:00.777
Self-analysis can trap us
in a mental hell of our own making.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:04.668
So things were starting to make sense.

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:08.743
Now, you Die Hard self-awareness fans

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:12.831
and particularly introspection fans
in the audience might be thinking,

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.745
"Sure, introspection may be depressing,

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.262
but it's worth it

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:19.643
because of the insight it produces."

00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:21.390
And you're right.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.644
I'm not here today to tell you

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.667
that the pursuit of self-awareness
is a waste of time.

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:28.140
Not at all.

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:34.920
I am here to tell you that the way
you're pursuing it doesn't work.

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:38.605
Here is the surprising reality:

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:44.971
Thinking about ourselves
isn't related to knowing ourselves.

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.763
So to understand this,

00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:52.162
let's look at the most common
introspective question:

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:53.481
"Why?"

00:07:53.597 --> 00:07:56.688
We might be searching
for the cause of a bad mood.

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:59.634
Why am I so upset
after that fight with my friend?

00:08:00.002 --> 00:08:02.061
Or we might be questioning our beliefs.

00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:04.480
Why don't I believe in the death penalty?

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.559
Or we might be trying
to understand a negative outcome.

00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:11.317
"Why did I choke in that meeting?"

00:08:11.888 --> 00:08:15.037
Unfortunately, when we ask "Why?"

00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:18.117
it doesn't lead us towards the truth
about ourselves.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:20.421
It leads us away from it.

00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:23.658
There are so many reasons
this is the case.

00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:26.318
Today I'll give you two.

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:30.097
Here is the first reason
we shouldn't ask why:

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:32.382
Researchers have found

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:35.187
that no matter how hard we try,

00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:41.013
we can't excavate our unconscious
thoughts, feelings and motives.

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:45.426
And because so much is hidden
from our conscious awareness,

00:08:45.904 --> 00:08:51.520
we end up inventing answers
that feel true but are often very wrong.

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:53.454
Let me give you an example.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.481
Psychologists Timothy Wilson
and Richard Nisbett set up a card table

00:08:58.564 --> 00:09:02.610
outside their local Meijers thrifty store
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:08.120
And on that card table, they laid out
four identical pairs of pantyhose.

00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:12.445
And they asked the people
walking by to pick their favorite.

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:14.590
(Laughter)

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:20.071
Now, consumer research shows that people
tend to prefer products on the right.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.976
And that's exactly what happened.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.961
Even though every pair was identical,

00:09:25.706 --> 00:09:29.395
people chose pair D
at a rate of four to one.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.491
And when asked why they have chosen
the pair they had,

00:09:34.794 --> 00:09:38.532
they confidently declared
that pair D was just better.

00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:40.592
(Laughter)

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.031
And even - get this -

00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:46.933
even when the researchers told them
about the effect of positioning,

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:49.718
they refused to believe it.

00:09:52.247 --> 00:09:54.910
The second reason
asking "Why?" is a bad idea

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.977
is that it leads us away
from our true nature.

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:01.693
We like to think of our brains
as supercomputers

00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:06.718
rationally analyzing information
and arriving at accurate conclusions.

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:10.229
Unfortunately, that's not what happens.

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:15.685
Let's do a quick exercise that's based
on another classic psychology study.

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:19.445
So if I were to ask you to make a list

00:10:19.469 --> 00:10:24.418
of all the reasons your romantic
relationship was going the way it was,

00:10:25.473 --> 00:10:26.979
what would you say?

00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:31.329
Let's say that in general
your relationship is pretty awesome.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:35.379
But let's just pretend that yesterday

00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:39.413
you happened to get in a huge fight

00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:44.113
about the proper way
to load the dishwasher.

00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:45.858
(Laughter)

00:10:46.453 --> 00:10:47.885
Really bad.

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:55.813
Now, because of something
called "the recency effect,"

00:10:56.103 --> 00:10:58.772
this is going to carry
an unfair amount of weight.

00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:04.245
You might start thinking of things like,
"I am so sick of his mansplaining!"

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:05.656
(Laughter)

00:11:05.656 --> 00:11:06.660
Or you might think,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.727
"Why the hell does it matter so much
how I load the dishwasher?"

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:12.084
And before you know it,

00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:15.444
you're thinking your relationship
isn't going so well.

00:11:15.444 --> 00:11:16.641
(Laughter)

00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:20.662
Asking "Why?" created "alternative facts."

00:11:20.662 --> 00:11:23.023
(Laughter)

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:30.601
And over time, this leads us
away from who we really are.

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:32.913
It clouds our self-perceptions.

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:36.163
So you might be wondering

00:11:36.378 --> 00:11:41.745
if asking "Why?" makes us depressed,
over-confident and wrong;

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:45.481
it's probably not going
to increase our self-awareness.

00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:47.183
But don't worry.

00:11:47.183 --> 00:11:51.368
I'm not here today to tell you
to stop thinking about yourselves.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:56.136
I am here to tell you to start doing it
just a little bit differently.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.376
So if we shouldn't ask "Why?"
then, what should we ask?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.698
Do you remember
our self-awareness unicorns?

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:09.807
When we looked at how they approached
introspection, we found the answer.

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:14.444
We analyzed literally hundreds
of pages of transcripts,

00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:17.061
and we saw a very clear pattern.

00:12:17.944 --> 00:12:21.885
Although the word "why"
appeared less than 150 times,

00:12:22.386 --> 00:12:26.371
the word "what" appeared
more than 1000 times.

00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:28.721
Let me give you a few examples.

00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:32.507
Nathan, a brand manager,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.712
got a terrible performance review
from his new boss.

00:12:36.568 --> 00:12:40.032
Instead of asking,
"Why are we like oil and water?"

00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:41.507
he asked,

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:46.028
"What can I do to show her
I'm the best person for this job?"

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:47.689
It changed everything.

00:12:48.014 --> 00:12:49.894
People now point to Nathan and his boss

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.466
as proof that polar opposites
can work together.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.906
Sarah, an education leader, was diagnosed
with breast cancer in her late 40s.

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.187
And when she asked, "Why me?"

00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:05.642
she said it felt like a death sentence.

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:07.851
So then she asked,

00:13:08.117 --> 00:13:10.180
"What's most important to me?"

00:13:10.876 --> 00:13:11.998
This helped her define

00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:15.932
what she wanted her life to look like
in whatever time she had left.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.367
She's now cancer free

00:13:18.418 --> 00:13:22.341
and more focused on the relationships
that mean the most to her.

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:28.543
Jose, an entertainment
industry veteran, hated his job.

00:13:29.424 --> 00:13:32.157
And instead of getting stuck,
what most of us would do,

00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:34.743
and ask, "Why do I feel so terrible?"

00:13:34.743 --> 00:13:39.683
he asked, "What are the situations
that make me feel terrible,

00:13:39.683 --> 00:13:41.667
and what do they have in common?"

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:45.879
He quickly realized that he would
never be happy in this job,

00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:47.346
and it gave him the courage

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:51.695
to pursue a new and far more fulfilling
career path as a wealth manager.

00:13:53.076 --> 00:13:54.634
So these are just three examples

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:58.736
of dozens of unicorns that asked
"What?" instead of "Why?"

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:03.581
Do I have any Nathans or Sarahs,
or Joses in the room?

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:07.432
I'll add one more: Tasha.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:12.669
So earlier this year, I published
a book about all of this,

00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:14.713
which I am so proud of.

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.737
But one day, for some unknown reason,

00:14:17.737 --> 00:14:21.260
I did what every author
is never supposed to do.

00:14:23.426 --> 00:14:25.409
I read my Amazon reviews.

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:27.409
(Laughter)

00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:31.629
And, you guys, it was devastating.

00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:38.319
I asked, "Why are people
being so mean to me

00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:44.324
about a book that I spent
thousands of hours researching

00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:47.019
and wrote to make their lives better?"

00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:48.852
Right?

00:14:49.015 --> 00:14:51.829
I fell into a spiral of self-loathing.

00:14:52.076 --> 00:14:54.829
It was honestly one
of the low points of my life.

00:14:55.777 --> 00:14:57.530
A couple of weeks went by,

00:14:57.867 --> 00:14:59.575
and it dawned on me

00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:01.884
that maybe I should take
my own advice.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.170
(Laughter)

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:07.159
So I tried a different question.

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:09.787
I asked, "What about all those people

00:15:10.235 --> 00:15:14.478
who were telling me that my book
has helped them change their lives."

00:15:15.202 --> 00:15:16.825
What a different outcome.

00:15:17.123 --> 00:15:19.617
So no, I wasn't doing it right either.

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.178
This is not an easy world, is it?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.424
Not at all.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.550
(Laughter)

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.526
She knows, we all know.

00:15:30.477 --> 00:15:33.640
But I have seen so much evidence

00:15:33.778 --> 00:15:36.716
that self-awareness
gives us a much better shot

00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:41.171
at finding happiness and success
in this crazy world.

00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:45.724
To start, we just need
to change one simple word.

00:15:46.668 --> 00:15:48.936
Change "why" to "what."

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:53.306
Why-questions trap us
in that rearview mirror.

00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:57.524
What-questions move us
forward to our future.

00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:04.268
As human beings, we are blessed
with the ability to understand who we are,

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:09.041
what we want to contribute,
and the kind of life we want to lead.

00:16:10.016 --> 00:16:14.064
Remember, our self-awareness unicorns
had nothing in common

00:16:14.404 --> 00:16:17.591
except a belief in the importance
of self-awareness

00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:20.298
and a daily commitment to developing it.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.834
That means we can all be unicorns.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.228
The search for self-awareness
never ever stops.

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:29.531
Life goes on.

00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:33.569
It's up to us to choose to learn and grow

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.643
from our mistakes and our tragedies,
and our successes.

00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:44.763
One of the best quotes I've ever heard
on this subject is from Rumi.

00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:51.850
He said, "Yesterday I was clever,
so I wanted to change the world.

00:16:52.936 --> 00:16:57.109
Today I'm wise, so I am changing myself."

00:16:57.993 --> 00:16:59.506
Thank you very much.

00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:01.604
(Applause)
