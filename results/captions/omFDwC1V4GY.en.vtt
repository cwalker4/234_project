00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cowboys with
six-shooters...

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.670
(gunshot)
covered wagons crossing the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.670
the plains, and Native Americans
wearing war paint and feathers.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.330
These are the images most people
associate with America's Old

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.500
West.
&gt;&gt; JOHN WHALEN: The Wild West

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
as we know it tends to come from
Hollywood movies.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.120
And that's a very cleaned up,
sanitized version of what the

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.080
West was really like.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But might there be

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.170
more to the story?
Much, much more?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.330
&gt;&gt; LOGAN HAWKES: When we think
of the Old West, the last thing

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.250
we think about would be Billy
the Kid chasing a flying

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.250
saucer across the desert.
From cowboys, to lawyers, to

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.670
doctors, to housewives washing
the clothes and taking care of

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.960
the sheep-- people were seeing
things in the sky they couldn't

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500
explain.
&gt;&gt; STANDING ELK: This is a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.460
replica of one of the bars that
was in one of the light ships.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.500
And they're guarded by the Star
People.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.420
&gt;&gt; BILL BIRNES: Ancient
aliens have been around for tens

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.170
of thousands, if not millions
of years.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.000
Why would they avoid the
American Southwest?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Millions of people
around the world believe we have

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.170
been visited in the past by
extraterrestrial beings.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.460
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.000
to shape our history?
And did the cowboys and natives

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.330
of America's Wild West actually
come in contact with alien

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.120
beings from another-- much more
distant frontier?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.500
&gt;&gt; COLONEL DOLARHYDE: What
kind of a man goes around

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.880
blowing up other people's cows?
&gt;&gt; ROY MURPHY: You got to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880
believe me.
There's white lights!

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.210
There's bright lights!
&gt;&gt; DOLARHYDE: So there was

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.210
this big light, and you fell
in the river, and when you come

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.670
back, two of my best hands has
just disappeared.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.500
There weren't no lightning this
evening.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the 2011 film,
<i>Cowboys and Aliens,</i> a man

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.460
awakens in the desert, with no
clue to his past, except for a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.960
mysterious metal device shackled
to his wrist.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.960
This may provide the key--
not only to his identity but to

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.080
his ability to protect the town
of Absolution from a deadly

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:13.330
attack by alien spaceships.
Based on the graphic novel

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.460
by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg
and directed by visionary

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:26.460
filmmaker, Jon Favreau...
Cowboys<i> and Aliens</i> skillfully

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.250
blends the conventions of the
classic Hollywood Western with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.170
the futuristic effects of an
alien invasion film.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.330
But although<i> Cowboys and Aliens</i>
is the product of its

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.460
creators' imagination,
there are those who believe

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.250
this story might have a few
roots in historical fact.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.830
Aurora, Texas.
This rural southwestern town

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.920
covers an area of just over
three square miles.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.080
Headstones at the local cemetery
mark the final resting places of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.120
the area's hard-working ranchers
and farmers.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.210
But one body allegedly buried
here has no marker at all.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.000
&gt;&gt; JIM MARRS: The Aurora
Cemetery was founded

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.420
in 1861, right at the start of
the war between the states.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.000
Texas State Historical
Commission has a marker here

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.670
that states the cemetery is well
known because of the legend that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.830
a spaceship crashed nearby in
1897, and the pilot, killed in

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:51.120
the crash, was buried here.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 50 years before the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.790
United States Army announced
that a flying disc had crashed

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.670
at Roswell, New Mexico, there
was a report of a strange

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.330
unidentified object that crashed
on the property of a local

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.750
judge.
&gt;&gt; JEFF DANELEK: On an April

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.330
morning in 1897, an airship
supposedly ran into a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.620
windmill on the property of a
gentleman named Judge Proctor.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.790
The ship exploded in flame and
was burnt to a crisp

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.670
essentially.
(explosion)

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.000
&gt;&gt; MARRS: There was an
explosion.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.960
In those days-- this is before
television, before jet

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.790
aircraft-- any big noise got
your attention.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.790
Plus, the ground shook, and so
they knew something tremendous

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.830
had happened.
&gt;&gt; DANELEK: A local reporter

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.750
arrived on the scene; he
reported that there was a large

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.670
debris field, and also that
there was the charred remains of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.170
what appeared to be to him an
alien from another planet.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.120
&gt;&gt; MAX McCOY: The occupant
described as unworldly

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.620
by witnesses, was given a
Christian burial and put in an

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.670
unmarked grave.
&gt;&gt; MARRS: In 1897, this was six

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.620
years before the Wright Brothers
actually made heavier-than-air

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.670
craft work.
So, uh, this is why I consider

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.500
the Aurora spaceship crash the
smoking gun of the UFO

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.080
controversy, because this
occurred six years before there

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.500
was anything manmade in the air.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Witnesses claimed

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.000
that debris from the crash was
recovered by local law

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.960
enforcement and never seen
again.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.500
Others claim that Judge
Proctor buried it at the bottom

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.620
of a deep well.
For decades, the incident

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.500
remained largely forgotten
until, in 1945, a man named

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.120
Brawley Oates, who had purchased
Procter's land, reportedly was

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.670
cleaning out the debris from the
well when he later developed an

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.170
extremely severe case of
arthritis, which he claims to

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.830
be the result of the
contaminated water.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.960
&gt;&gt; DANELEK: He believed that the
water from the well contained

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.580
some sort of element to it that
gave him a severe case of

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.960
arthritis.
It was a bad enough case of

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.170
arthritis that it eventually
killed him.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.000
So a lot of people today wonder
if the well wasn't contaminated

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.960
with some sort of radioactive
agents, which was the rationale

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.500
behind his, uh, his arthritis.
&gt;&gt; PHILIP COPPENS: We find that

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.000
people who are using that well
actually get ill.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And so what happens at a moment
in time is that the descendants

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.670
of these people actually decide
to cement the well.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The incident at
Roswell in 1947 also began

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.500
stirring controversy about the
Aurora incident-- this time,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.830
concerning the strange body
supposedly still resting in an

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.670
unmarked grave.
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: Researchers wanted to

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.670
exhume the body, but the local
cemetery association wouldn't

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.670
let them.
&gt;&gt; MARSHALL TRIMBLE: My first

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.960
question is: Why not?
What's it gonna hurt?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960
As a historian, it makes me
suspicious when somebody's

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.120
trying to hide something from
you; tells you, you can't...

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.460
you can't do something.
&gt;&gt; MARRS: I first got onto the

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.830
Aurora story back in 1973, and
was, uh, there before the

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.790
tombstone went missing, and
actually probably one of the few

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.080
people around who still remember
where the actual gravesite was.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.920
Now, the little grave is located
right here.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.670
It was a short little grave.
That of a child or a very small

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.960
person.
And the teeny little headstone,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.960
the marker, was right about
there.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.620
A few years ago, scientists with
ground penetrating radar

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.830
established that there really
had been a short grave here.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.750
Now, back in 1973, Bill Case was
the aviation writer for the

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.080
<i>Dallas Times Herald.</i>
I was working for the<i> Star</i>

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.960
<i>Telegram.</i>
We met up here.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.620
He had a metal detector, and we
found three readings of metal in

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.500
the grave.
A couple of months after the

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.080
headstone went missing, Bill
invited me to meet him up here.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.960
We went over the grave, and
there was no readings in the

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.750
grave.
He showed me three little holes

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.080
that had been drilled in the
grave.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.040
Somebody had extracted the
metal out of the grave.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In recent decades,
further investigation of the

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.620
crash site has turned up
inconclusive evidence, including

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.460
unusually high traces of
aluminum at the bottom of the

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.830
now-sealed well where Judge
Proctor had supposedly disposed

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.580
of the wreckage.
Could the events that happened

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.920
on a Texas farm in the early
hours of April 17, 1897, really

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.330
be evidence of an alien close
encounter?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.790
Could it have been the first
such event to occur in America's

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.830
western region?
Or was it only one of many?

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Adam's County,
Ohio.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.620
At the end of the 1700s,
President George Washington

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.290
awarded what was then the
unchartered land beyond the

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.120
Appalachian Mountains to
Revolutionary War veterans-- in

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.120
600-acre parcels-- as payment
for their service.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.330
But when the settlers arrived,
they found much of the land

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.460
covered with thousands of Indian
burial mounds.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.170
And one of these was very
different from the rest.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.250
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Imagine when
you're pushing west, and all of

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.830
a sudden, you find this gigantic
effigy mound in the form of a

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.580
serpent.
What you have is a gigantic

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.830
structure, which just sits there
in the middle of a very

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.250
interesting landscape.
&gt;&gt; BRAD LEPPER: Serpent Mound

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.330
was one of the amazing,
mysterious mounds found by

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.460
the first settlers as they came
over the Appalachian Mountains.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.250
There were thousands of mounds,
but Serpent Mound must have been

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:26.330
special.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like the Nazca

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.670
Lines in Peru, Serpent Mound
is a giant, prehistoric

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.670
structure that looks as though
it is meant to be viewed only

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.620
from the sky.
&gt;&gt; DAVID CHILDRESS: When you

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.420
see the Great Serpent Mound
Mound in Ohio, it's massively

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.290
huge.
And it can't really be

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.500
appreciated when you're standing
there, looking at it.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.170
What we have here is meant to be
seen from the sky.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.790
&gt;&gt; THOMAS JOHNSON: It's
mysterious in the fact that

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:03.620
it is on an elevated plateau
and concealed from the world,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.420
unless you're flying over it in
a plane.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.790
And it's on very uneven ground.
And really, to lay that out and

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.000
make it right, you'd almost have
to be above, looking down to get

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.170
it right, which is a mystery.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This 1,330-foot

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.420
long structure winds across the
land and depicts a coiled

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:32.120
snake, eating what appears to
be an egg.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.790
It is the largest effigy mound
in the world, and curiously,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.620
unlike most Native American
mounds, the Great Serpent Mound

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.580
was not constructed for burials.
&gt;&gt; ROSS HAMILTON: Serpent Mound

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.500
had no burials.
It's one of those mysterious

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.580
mounds that offered us no clue
as to who the builders were, but

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.580
on the property, there were
burial mounds dated from about

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.170
very early Adena period, nearly
3,000 years ago.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Another curious
aspect of Serpent Mound is where

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.670
the ancient Native Americans
chose to build it-- on the

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:16.120
outside swell of a five-mile
wide meteor crater.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.580
&gt;&gt; JOHNSON: 300 million years
ago, a meteor came into this

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.120
area and struck the Earth going
about 50,000 miles an hour.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.500
The Serpent Mound is built right
on the very edge of the crater.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.250
And there's magnetic anomalies
and faults that go across the

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.170
Serpent Mound and that the
Native Americans could dowse

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.960
them, and they could feel the
positive energy that's coming

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.460
out of the ground.
&gt;&gt; GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: If you

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.620
bring a compass to the Great
Serpent Mound, there's certain

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.120
spots where the compass needle
just keeps going.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.250
So, obviously, we have some
weird magnetic fields there and

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.620
also some gravitational
anomalies.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.250
&gt;&gt; JOHNSON: The myth has it
that the Native Americans, when

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.000
they came here, could see birds
similar to passenger pigeons, or

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.330
homing pigeons, circling by the
millions.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.620
Because within the skull of the
pigeon is a little piece of

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.250
hematite, or magnetite, and
that's how they navigate.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.460
And they couldn't figure out
where north was.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.960
Can you imagine millions of
birds flying in a circle five

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.170
miles wide?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.500
creating magnetic anomalies, the
meteor also deposited a number

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.170
of elements not indigenous to
the area, including one of the

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.120
rarest elements on Earth--
iridium.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.170
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: When we look at the
location of the Serpent Mound,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.960
we find that not only that there
is iron, that there is uranium,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.830
but also iridium.
Iridium can withstand

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.580
temperatures up to 2,000
Celsius.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.120
It is non-corrosive.
And it's actually been used in

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.460
unmanned spacecraft.
&gt;&gt; A.J. SHAKA: A lot of

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.830
iridium apparently comes from
outer space rather than being

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.920
found on the Earth.
There is a use of iridium for

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.460
thermal electric circuits.
These deep-space probes include

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.330
actually a radioactive source,
because it's the only thing that

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.580
can provide enough power when
you're out beyond Jupiter and

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.960
there's no sunlight and there's
no nothing.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.580
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: We have iron,
iridium and uranium, three

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.580
substances which definitely
should not be considered to be

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.250
of any use to Native Americans.
The question then is: To who are

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.330
they of use?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.830
theorists believe
extraterrestrials may have come

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.250
to this site to mine iridium for
their spacecraft, and point to

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.000
numerous caves found in the
crater swell beneath the mound

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.790
as evidence of this.
&gt;&gt; HAMILTON: Right here, we can

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.120
see one of those caves.
It's pretty large.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.330
And since this site is believed
to be many, many, millions of

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:55.500
years old, there's a chance that
there are many, many caves.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if alien
visitors really did come here to

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:03.170
mine iridium and other elements,
might this explain why the

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.500
Serpent Mound was built on a
scale that made its shape

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.170
visible from the sky?
&gt;&gt; HAMILTON: The Serpent Mound

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.250
is a marker for space according
to the Shawnee Indians.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.920
They're convinced that space
travelers are using Serpent

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.330
Mound as a marker.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to Zuni

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.170
Elder Clifford Mahooty, the
Shawnee aren't the only Native

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.290
Americans who believe Serpent
Mound has an extraterrestrial

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.830
connection.
&gt;&gt; CLIFFORD MAHOOTY: The Star

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.290
Ancestors taught the American
Indians about where they came

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.000
from, and how they're supposed
to carry out their rituals.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.080
The mound builders, I believe,
were those Indian tribes that

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.790
had contact with the
extraterrestrials.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.960
&gt;&gt; NANCY RED STAR: It's the
essence of our culture, and the

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.960
mounds were a place where we
would practice and learn from

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.210
those beings that come in from
outside of this world to visit.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists also point to the

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.290
placement and shape of the Great
Serpent Mound as proof of its

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.170
extraterrestrial origins.
&gt;&gt; HAMILTON: The serpent itself

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:31.120
was aligned to a constellation
that had its apex at the height

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.170
of the night sky 5,000 years
ago.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.790
The constellation Draconis-- it
was used to align the Great

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.960
Pyramid.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.960
lining up with the stars of
Draconis, the coils of Serpent

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.960
Mound also align with the solar
events of the solstice and

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:56.330
equinox, as well as the
18.6-year lunar cycle.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:01.170
Could these precise astronomical
alignments suggest that the

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.170
Serpent Mound served a greater
purpose than just acting as a

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.920
marker?
Some believe that because of its

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.170
magnetic anomalies, this site
may also have been used to

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.330
harness energy.
&gt;&gt; JOHNSON: These magnetic

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.330
anomalies, these faults, attract
lightning.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.080
&gt;&gt; HAMILTON: The Serpent Mound
is right on the edge of an

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.170
outcropping of pure limestone or
dolomite, which is even better

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.080
than the limestone they built
the Great Pyramid from, and it's

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.290
highly semi-conductive.
This is what I call the Serpent

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.830
Mound stone.
It's an unusual feature that

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.620
seems to be made of a different
kind of dolomite than what

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.670
exists on the outcropping of the
general serpent.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.080
This stone could've been placed
in the center of the oval.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.500
Therefore, you wouldn't get a
lot of random strikes, so much

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.920
as you would a lot of strikes
that would tend to come to the

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.880
stone.
(lightning crackles)

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could the Serpent
Mound have been a source of

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.790
great energy?
Might it have held an advanced

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.120
alien technology that was
somehow lost?

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.120
&gt;&gt; NICK REDFERN: When I look
at our history of building

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.000
ancient monuments like
Stonehenge, the Sphinx, the

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.580
Pyramids, the Mayan temples,
what it tells me is, no matter

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.500
how technologically advanced we
are today, we've lost a

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.170
knowledge of something
tremendous that came thousands

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.620
and thousands of years ago.
And it's a tragedy that not only

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.170
have we forgotten how to utilize
it, but we've relegated it to

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.830
the realm of folklore and
mythology.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.000
&gt;&gt; HAMILTON: When the lightning
lamps were eliminated, the

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.960
native culture fell into the
darkness again, about 5,000

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.620
years ago.
But we know that if their

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.670
prophecies hold true, the
Serpent Mound will be

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.620
reactivated again one day.
And when that re-activation

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:08.290
occurs, that'll be the beginning
of the restoral of the earth.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Was the Great
Serpent Mound really a hub of

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.670
ancient extraterrestrial
visitation?

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.080
If so, perhaps there is also
truth in legends of other, even

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.170
more bizarre, alien encounters
in the American West.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:44.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Palmyra, New York,
September 21, 1823.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.330
In the upstairs bedroom of a log
cabin, just south of this

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.960
small, rural village,
17-year-old Joseph Smith had a

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.790
vision of someone, or something,
not of this world.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.080
&gt;&gt; ANDREW JACKSON: It was late
at night, it was dark, and the

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.790
room filled with a very, very
bright light.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:10.620
And this personage was floating
in midair, his feet was off the

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.620
ground.
And he identified himself as

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.000
Moroni.
After talking with Joseph Smith

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.420
for a while, Moroni seemed to
ascend into the air, completely

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:31.000
leaving the room again dark.
The next morning, also, Moroni

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.290
came back to Joseph Smith to
show him the hidden golden book,

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.670
which is what we know as the
Book of Mormon today.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to the
Book of Mormon, Moroni

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.420
identified himself to Joseph
Smith as a man who lived in

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.920
America in the late fourth and
early fifth centuries.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.830
But America was not Moroni's
home-- he claimed to have much

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:01.290
more distant origins.
&gt;&gt; HAWKES: Moroni claimed to be

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.620
from the Pleiades star cluster.
So a church today, nine million

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.290
members strong, believe that
their church may have originated

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.830
not of this world, but of
another world.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to Joseph
Smith, not only did Moroni claim

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.500
to be from another planet-- he
also directed him to dig up the

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.830
golden plates from "the Hill
Cumorah," which scholars believe

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.500
is a reference to an ancient
Native American mound, much like

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.500
the Serpent Mound.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: We have since found

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
out that that in burial mounds
and other effigy mounds across

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.620
the Native American region, we
have such plates.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.670
These writing tablets have been
found, and not just in North

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.170
America, but also in South
America.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.460
This entity tells Joseph Smith
to go on a physical search for

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.170
an object, which we know could
have been an archeological

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.460
finding.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But if Moroni was a

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:09.250
spiritual or metaphysical being,
why would he give Joseph Smith

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.620
physical objects with which to
translate the plates?

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.170
According to ancient astronaut
theorists, Moroni may, in fact,

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:23.250
have been a Star Being-- an
extraterrestrial whose mission

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.790
was to pass down to Smith and
his followers the advanced

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.580
knowledge of the mound builders.
&gt;&gt; TOK THOMPSON: In Mormonism,

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.790
actually a lot of their theology
is directly related to this idea

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.750
of God and various angels and
various spiritual beings live on

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:47.790
different planets.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: According to Native

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.670
American legends, the Star
Beings left Earth thousands of

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.460
years ago, at about the same
time ancient astronaut theorists

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.170
believe extraterrestrials left
Egypt.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.330
But if Joseph Smith's vision of
Moroni was real, might this have

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.290
been not so much a spiritual
encounter as an

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:12.830
extraterrestrial one?
If so, perhaps there were other

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.790
such alien visitations-- ones,
which in turn, fueled an

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.170
increased interest in the stars
throughout the 1800s.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.620
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: In the 19th century,
people were very interested in

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.670
astronomy.
There was some thought that

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.330
there might be life on other
planets.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.460
So, often times, lights in the
sky were attributed to possibly

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:39.290
visitors from another world.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Joseph Smith felt

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.250
such a strong connection to the
Native Americans that he

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.670
believed they could help guide
him to a new holy land, which

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:54.790
he called "the new Zion."
Although Smith died in 1844--

00:24:54.790 --> 00:25:00.120
the victim of mob violence--
his successor, Brigham Young,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.290
ultimately led the Mormons
further west to Utah.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:08.670
In 1849, when the Mormons
arrived in the area of Parowan

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:13.170
Gap, local Ute leader, Chief
Wakara, told them they had

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.460
entered "God's own house" and
showed them proof in the form of

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.290
petroglyphs dating back
thousands of years.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.460
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: All throughout
Utah, petroglyphs depict

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.460
hunters with bows and arrows
going after buffalo.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:36.080
Very ordinary, daily life
occurrences.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.580
But there are also some other
depictions, which are very odd.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:48.500
And they look like spaceships.
They look like beings with

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.460
halos.
They look like beings with

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.120
antenna on their heads, or
beings that wear some type of a

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.170
suit.
For all intents and purposes,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.540
they look like depictions of
spacemen.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:13.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Great Falls,
Montana. October 19, 1865.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.120
Six months after the
assassination of President

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:22.170
Abraham Lincoln, a fur trapper
reports what might be the first

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.330
documented UFO crash in the Old
West.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.500
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: In 1865,
the<i> Missouri Democrat</i>

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.250
reported that a trapper saw a
light traveling through the sky

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.670
at night.
It flew over his camp, broke

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.540
apart and crashed in the forest
some miles away.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.960
The next day he tracked it down,
found a large stone imbedded in

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.500
the side of a mountain.
It was hollow, it was cracked

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.500
open; he claimed there were
chambers inside of it, and there

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.120
were hieroglyphic markings
on it.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.000
And there was also some
mysterious liquid spilled around

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.500
the area.
But the newspaper, you know,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.000
went so far as to suggest that
these were meteoric conveyances

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.290
of aliens from Mercury
or Uranus.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.620
So, the whole idea of
UFO crashes was

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.460
explored in the 19th century
almost a hundred years

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.420
before Roswell.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But what makes

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.460
this story even
more intriguing to Ancient

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.170
Astronaut theorists is the
location of the sighting--

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.290
along the upper Missouri River.
This is the home of

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.290
the Blackfoot Indians,
a tribe whose

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.250
ancient legends include strange
tales of Star Beings visiting

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.500
the region from other worlds.
&gt;&gt; ANDREW COLLINS: The Blackfoot

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.170
have very profound
legends and myths relating to

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:52.620
beings, which quite clearly are
said to have come down from some

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.250
kind of sky world to Earth
and in these sky vehicles.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.960
And the way that they are
described, these can be modern

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:11.330
ideas of flying saucers or UFOs.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could the object

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.460
that the Montana
fur trapper claimed to

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.920
have found really have been one
of the alien crafts described

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.500
in Blackfoot legends?
And might the markings

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.000
have been the same as
what Joseph Smith

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.830
found on the golden plates?
To some Native Americans,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.960
like Chief Standing Elk of the
Yankton Dakota Tribe, Star

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.960
Beings are still very much
amongst us-- and they are still

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.830
making contact with humans.
&gt;&gt; STANDING ELK: A lot of

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:47.120
our relatives that come
from the stars, they speak on a

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.790
telepathic level, and there were
some that came to me and showed

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:58.000
me a bar with symbols on there.
They talked to me, and I

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.120
understood them very, very well.
This is the replica of one of

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.500
the bars that was in one of
the light ships.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.920
And they represent the
universal laws.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.120
And they're guarded by
the Star People.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:23.120
So these are universal laws.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Did early Americans

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.250
really encounter
what the natives

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:31.080
called Star Beings as they
crossed the frontier?

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.330
And what other strange
encounters might they have

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:40.330
experienced as they made their
way further west?

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:58.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tombstone, Arizona.
In 1881, this mining boomtown

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.080
was the home of Wyatt Earp and
the site of the gunfight at the

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.710
O.K. Corral.
Less than ten years later, it

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.040
would become the location of
one of the most bizarre UFO

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.380
sightings in history.
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: According to

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.210
a story in the
Tombstone Epitaph in 1890, two

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:23.830
ranchers were out in the desert
of Arizona when they saw some

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.250
sort of monstrous bird flying
overhead with a huge wingspan.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.380
The body was described as being
like an alligator, and the wings

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.920
were described as membranous.
&gt;&gt; MARSHALL TRIMBLE: There's

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.920
another version of the
story told by the two old

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.080
cowboys when they were very old
That they never really, uh,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.830
they just shot at the bird,
and it got away.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.920
It was literally bulletproof.
&gt;&gt; HAWKES: There were a number

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.250
of reports of big birds that
cowboys would shoot at or chase

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.210
for great distances.
And they reported the bullets

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.580
would bounce off
the leathery skin.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.040
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But was the story
of this giant

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.880
bird simply a hoax,
as many believe?

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.080
Or was there some degree of
truth to it?

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.580
&gt;&gt; TSOUKALOS: In the Old West,
we have stories

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:21.210
of the Tommyknockers, these
creatures that resided in mines.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.670
Of the ghost rider, which was
this cowboy that was flying

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:30.880
across the sky, but also of
ghost trains.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.540
So, were all of those stories
just campfire stories that were

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.330
invented on the spot?
Or were they based in some type

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.540
of truth?
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For many Americans

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.880
living in the early and
mid-1800s, the vast western

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.580
frontier offered both
opportunity and profound

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.710
sociological change.
Freed of the constrictions of

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.710
European tradition and
Judeo-Christian fundamentalism,

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.830
the early pioneers could now
experiment with political,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.920
social and religious
philosophies which their Eastern

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.250
counterparts had frowned upon.
One such newly emerging

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.540
philosophy was called
Transcendentalism.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.170
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL J. CROWE:
Transcendentalism was perhaps

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:25.540
the leading philosophy developed
in America in the 19th century.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:31.250
One of the founding figures in
it was Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.170
It was belief in
extraterrestrial life that led

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:40.750
him to depart from Christianity,
and another author who is part

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.670
of that is the poet
Walt Whitman.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.710
His most famous book 1855 was
"The Leaves of Grass."

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.250
And in
"The Leaves of Grass," there are

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.880
like 200 references
to astronomy.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.040
He believed strongly in
extraterrestrials.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040
&gt;&gt; HAFNOR: In a nutshell,
transcendentalism reminded

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.920
young America that all
things are not knowable, and

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.000
that some things are knowable,
but not through the five senses.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.670
So it opened up Easterners as
they went west to new ideas and

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.580
new sights.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Another strong

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.420
influence on the
way 19th century Americans

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.920
viewed the world was the
emergence of a new genre of

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.750
literature: science fiction.
&gt;&gt; McCOY: I think the image

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.420
that has come down to us from
lots of movies and TV shows,

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.750
that the cowboy is kind of a
rough, illiterate character.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.040
Most cowboys were extremely
literate.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.920
Face it, there wasn't a lot of
entertainment out on the Plains.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.750
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One of the
first great American

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.040
science fiction writers was
Civil War veteran Ambrose

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.540
Bierce, who believed strongly in
the possibility of life beyond

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.750
our world.
&gt;&gt; HAWKES: Ambrose Bierce

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.830
was an author of
some very strange short stories.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.920
"The Difficulty of Crossing a
Field" was about an Alabama

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.540
farmer who one day was taking a
walk across the field when he

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.880
just disappeared.
He was gone.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.420
And years later, his wife would
say that she could hear his

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.750
voice from time to time,
coming from the circle, but he

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.080
wasn't there.
Ambrose Bierce was trying to

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.750
show us that this man traveled
inter-dimensionally to

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.580
another place.
And while he was still there,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.500
he wasn't there.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It is thought

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.500
by many scholars
and historians that Bierce--

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.080
as well as
other authors of early fantasy

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.880
fiction-- had been influenced
by Native Americans and

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.080
their folklore.
In addition to belief in

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.710
Star Beings,
they believed in the existence

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.420
of inter-dimensional gateways
or portals,

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.880
which would enable visitors to
travel between time

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.040
and space.
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL DENNIN: If you're

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.040
thinking about like
people suddenly disappearing

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.040
through a hole in space time
into another dimension, at the

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.670
surface of it, when we think
about our modern theory of

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.580
relativity and that you can bend
space and time, it seems not so

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.750
crazy, because we know
mathematically how to describe

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.250
holes in space time that connect
different regions of space

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.580
to others.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The mystery of

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.880
whether such portals really
exist may have been solved by

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.580
Ambrose Bierce himself, when he
ventured south of the border

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.040
into the Mexican desert.
&gt;&gt; CHILDRESS: At the very early

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.670
part of the twentieth century,
Ambrose Bierce was in northern

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:40.040
Mexico, in this area that's
known for strange phenomenon,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.920
called Paquime.
This area, too, is thought to be

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.330
another one of these
interdimensional portal areas.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.540
&gt;&gt; HAWKES: One theory is that
Bierce may not have traveled

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.000
into Mexico alone.
Another very colorful figure by

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.580
the name of F.A. Mitchell Hedges
may have traveled with him into

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.880
Mexico.
Mitchell Hedges was a great

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.250
British adventurer, most noted
for his discovery of a Mayan

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.710
crystal skull.
The ancient city of Paquime is

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.710
just a few miles away from the
Crystal Cave.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.580
The largest crystal deposits in
the world are found here.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.250
Mitchell Hedges believed that
his skulls were capable of

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.540
psychically communicating with a
person and interdimensionally

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:34.710
transferring that message to an
extraterrestrial being.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:40.210
The theory is that Hedges, along
with Bierce, may have discovered

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.830
or mastered the method of
speaking through the crystals or

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.830
employing their power, and may
have transported, as in his

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.830
stories, to an interdimensional
space, never to be heard from

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:55.380
again.
&gt;&gt; HAFNOR: While there, he sent

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.920
his last communication that we
know of, which was a letter, and

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.380
that letter ended with this
ominous line: "As for me, I

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.920
leave tomorrow for an unknown
destination."

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The man who wrote
about so many strange

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:12.580
disappearances was never seen or
heard from again.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:19.420
Did Ambrose Bierce meet with
foul play, or did he find an

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.420
interdimensional portal, like
the ones described in his

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:28.920
stories?
Perhaps the answer can be found

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.920
in a mysterious lake in
California, one thought by many

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.460
to be an actual gateway to
another world.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.290
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Elizabeth Lake,
Southern California.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.920
This high desert body of water
sits at the junction of the

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.620
tectonic plates that form the
powerful San Andreas fault.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.620
The Mexicans who colonized
California in the 1700s called

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.920
it Laguna del Diablo: Lake of
the Devil.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.330
And it was said that the devil's
own pet would come into this

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.420
world through a portal at the
bottom of the lake.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.000
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Local legend says
that at the bottom is actually

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.960
an entrance to the underworld.
They call it the Lake of the

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.330
Devil.
And it's said that in the middle

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:32.830
of the 18th century, from up
until about 1880 onwards,

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.620
something was happening there
which frightened locals.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:40.330
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: Some of the rich
landowners built ranches there.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.290
These ranchers claimed to have
been harassed and tormented by

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.920
some sort of monstrous beast
that would come out of the water

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.920
and steal cattle and menace the
locals.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The ranchers who
claimed to have witnessed this

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.830
beast called it, "The
Thunderbird," and their

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.330
description of it was nearly
identical to that of the giant

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.330
bird witnessed by cowboys in
Tombstone in 1890.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.120
&gt;&gt; WHALEN: Eventually, one of
the landowners got it in his

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.080
head that he was going to hunt
this creature down and sell it

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.000
to the circus, so according to
the story, this rancher was able

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.290
to actually fire a few shots at
this creature, which seemed to

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.000
be bulletproof and metallic.
The bullets bounced off.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.460
And after that encounter, the
bird flew east, never to be seen

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.290
again in California.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Could this

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:38.290
so-called Thunderbird really
have been the same creature that

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.960
cowboys shot at in Tombstone?
And why was it referred to by

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.960
locals as, "The Devil's Pet"?
&gt;&gt; STANDING ELK: They didn't

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.120
have the vocabulary we have
today, so when things happened

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.920
that they couldn't explain, it
was called the Devil's Tower.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.330
It was called the Devil's Lake.
It was called the Devil's this,

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.500
or the Devil's that.
&gt;&gt; COPPENS: Take it away from

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.500
religion, and you might find
that this was a portal to

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.330
another dimension which the
locals knew about, and might

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.330
have something to do with the
fact that this mysterious entity

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.500
was present at that very
specific location.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: If a portal to
another dimension or another

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.330
part of the universe does lie at
the bottom of Elizabeth Lake,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:29.960
might it also be possible that
the Thunderbird was not really a

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.460
creature at all, but something
even more incredible?

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.460
&gt;&gt; JONATHAN YOUNG: A thunderbird
was enormous, it made enormous

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.790
noises, so the thunder part of
it could sound like a jet

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.460
engine.
&gt;&gt; REDFERN: Its eyes were able

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.290
to literally pierce and emanate
fire.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:52.170
So we have this large flying
winged creature, which gives off

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.170
a thunderous sound, and lights
fly from its eyes.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.960
That to me says, yes, we could
be dealing with some sort of

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.960
craft.
(engines roaring)

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.000
(chanting)
&gt;&gt; ERICH VON DANIKEN: Native

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.120
Indians in North America-- they
know, of course, the bird.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.460
But now something differently
arrived.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.460
An object, which could fly,
which is bigger than the eagle,

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.460
but at the same time, makes
tremendous noise.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.170
So you have the creation of the
Thunderbird.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.670
&gt;&gt; MAHOOTY: Even when the
airplanes first started going

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.460
out, up in the sky here in the
southwest, they referred them to

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.080
as metal birds.
As a matter of fact, when the

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:39.830
first fixed-wing craft landed in
Zuni, the Indians over there

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.670
actually went out there and
worshipped the airplane.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.080
&gt;&gt; MARRS: It makes me think of a
concept called cultural

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.290
tracking, which is the idea that
UFOs can mask themselves to

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.960
appear as almost anything.
And you go back to ancient

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.120
China, and they talk about the
flying dragons.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.670
You go back to the ancient
Egyptians, they talk about

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.790
flying boats.
You go to the Roman times, and

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.830
they're talking about flying
shields.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.420
Perhaps that was just their
interpretation, or perhaps

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.000
that's what they actually saw.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Did the cowboys in

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.960
Tombstone, Arizona, and ranchers
at Elizabeth Lake witness an

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.960
alien vehicle?
One that may have been visiting

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.830
North America for thousands of
years?

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.670
&gt;&gt; HAWKES: The truth of the
matter is, there's some very

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.330
interesting and incredible
stories that come from the 1800s

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:36.830
about flying objects and strange
encounters and events.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:42.830
&gt;&gt; McCOY: The Old West was not
only rugged, deadly, bloody, but

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:46.790
it was also mysterious.
It was a time when people often

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.330
encountered things that they
didn't understand and had to

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.670
make up stories to account for
it.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.000
And you see this in nearly every
society.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.620
&gt;&gt; TRIMBLE: How many things do
we know today that were thought

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.170
to be just impossible?
I always try to keep an open

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:06.960
mind when-when I hear a story,
and I might not believe, but I

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:13.620
don't disbelieve, either.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Aliens invade a

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.580
quiet Western town, and
terrified residents scramble

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:23.960
for their guns in a valiant
attempt to defend themselves.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:29.790
A mere product of Hollywood's
high-concept imagination?

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:34.000
Or are films like<i> Cowboys and
Aliens</i> actually inspired by

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.170
historical events?
Stories that challenge

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.000
everything we know or
Stories that challenge

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.920
everything we know or believe
about ourselves?

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.120
As we continue to explore the
vastness of the universe and

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.750
examine more and more of the
mysteries of the Earth, are we

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.790
getting closer to unlocking
the secrets of our past, and

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.080
opening a doorway to our future?
