00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.780
There is a crisis here.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.640
Millions of people have fled Venezuela as
the country crumbles.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.680
Many of them are coming over this border into
Colombia.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.700
Here is this border town of Cucuta, you see
people with suitcases full of all their belongings.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.940
They don’t know where they’re going.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.000
They just know they need to get out of their
country.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.760
If you need proof of how bad it is in Venezuela
right now, look at this purse.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.150
This purse is made entirely of the bills of
the Venezuelan currency, the Bolivares.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.510
Inflation is so high that this money is now
completely worthless.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.549
So my friend Jorge over here has gathered a
ton of this stuff

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.020
and turned it into commodities, into purses,
into sculptures.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.740
It is worse than it sounds and it sounds pretty
bad.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
The country’s inflation rate will rise to
one million percent.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.040
More than a million Venezuelans moved to Colombia in recent years.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.840
And in an era of record setting migration, when borders seem to be getting thicker, harder to cross.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.100
Colombia is doing something that you don’t
see very often.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.360
It’s opening its doors and it’s letting
people in.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.080
The border crisis is shocking.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.040
It’s a real humanitarian crisis.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.500
The economic crisis there is about to get
even worse.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.160
Is there a point where Colombia and other
countries in Latin America

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.940
step in and say enough is enough now?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.500
This border town of Cucuta is now totally
bustling.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.099
This is the very end of the border.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.340
Where these people are entering.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.840
And the one thing that you’ll hear that
is a little interesting is...

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.320
“Compra cabello,” we buy hair.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.500
To continue on their way to make some money,
the women will sell their hair.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.880
You basically get 100,000 pesos, which is
like 30 dollars.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.680
I’m eating a Venezuelan styled hot dog

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.420
and the guys are reflecting on how much this
hot dog would cost

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.240
if they were trying to buy it in Venezuela
with the current economic situation

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.020
87% of the country’s households into poverty.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.220
Images that we’ve never seen in Latin America before is unfortunately something we’re seeing now.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.290
The collapse of Venezuela didn’t happen
because of a civil war or a natural disaster,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.980
but rather the colossal economic mismanagement
by the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.819
In just a few years, Maduro grabbed control
of most of the government

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.319
and then drove the country into an economic
disaster worse than the Great Depression and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.900
the fall of the Soviet Union.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.300
Of the two million people who have left Venezuela
in the midst of this crisis

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.440
about one million have come to Colombia, easily
more than any other country.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.500
The response by most countries in the region has been to put up new measures to stop migrants

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.909
from flooding into their country.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.320
But not Colombia, here the borders stays relatively
easy to cross.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.780
And even though Colombia already has millions of its own people in need of humanitarian assistance,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.880
the Colombian people and politicians continue
to let these migrants in.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.280
So I have decided that we’re not going to
close the border.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.480
We have to give them support.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.199
Now we’re in the refugee camp, is what they’re
calling it.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.680
Here the government provides all sorts of
services to these people.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.240
Haircuts and manicures.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.900
Today in the camp, they’re playing music.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.660
Some Colombian, some Venezuelan and everyone, locals, migrants

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.640
start singing and clapping along.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.680
The Colombian government has given most of these migrants status,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.150
allowing them to live in the country, get
healthcare, work and study for two years.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.360
But it’s not just the Colombia government
opening its doors.

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.820
In a neighborhood by the border, people starting
taking migrants into their homes,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.540
indefinitely and for free.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.460
And to understand why these people are opening up their doors to Venezuelans,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.060
you have to understand their past.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.220
If you go back to the 1800’s, Colombia and
Venezuela were actually a part of the same

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.169
country called Gran Colombia.

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.610
This country actually broke up into the modern
states we know today.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.610
Decades later, in the 80’s and 90’s, Colombia
was experiencing

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.060
some of its worst violence in its decades
long war with a rebel group called the FARC.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.560
This war displaced more than seven million
people,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.020
more than any other modern war.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.400
Hundreds of thousands of those people fled
to Venezuela, where the economy was thriving

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.940
And the Venezuelans took them in.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.800
So in a sense, this the Colombians way of
paying back Venezuelans for the hospitality

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.810
they were given.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.639
Here at the border, you go down the street
a little bit, and you see this sign that says

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.719
welcome to Colombia.

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:15.220
Above it, it says, “ Colombia and Venezuela,
united forever."

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.110
It’s part of these two countries being different,
having very different governments.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.000
There is this common identity among the people.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.920
But there are reasons to believe this sense
of solidarity might not last forever.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.100
A slew of crimes, allegedly committed by Venezuelans,
have led to a new wave of skepticism in the country.

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.330
Earlier this year, the police chief in this
border town told people

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.259
that they shouldn’t rent their properties to Venezuelans after a migrant was arrested for a homicide.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.750
But despite the growing skepticism, many Venezuelans
continue

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.470
to see tremendous support in Colombia,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:05.740
a country that has chosen to keep its doors open to the thousands of migrants who come in everyday.
