00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.320
From WatchMojo.com to preshows in movie theaters
to… well, TopTenz, everyone wants to provide

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.390
small novelty pieces of information about
beloved movies.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.500
Unfortunately, the high demand means that
the product has gotten a bit diluted over

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
time.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.340
Misunderstandings or even outright lies now
permeate the pop culture landscape.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.700
We’re inclined to believe a lot of them
if for no other reason than the reputation

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.020
that people have in show business for being
weird, or for crazy things to happen when

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.360
millions of dollars are spent on make believe.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.120
Here at TopTenz there’s too much respect
for the truth to let that stand.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.911
Well, at least we want to help our readers
put some smug people who think they’re the

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:44.950
smartest people in the world because they
know some piece of trivia in their place.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.950
10.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.950
Alien’s Gender Flip

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.730
Since Ellen Ripley’s status as the main
character (and sole survivor, not counting

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.600
the cat) of the Alien franchise was a surprise
in the original film of the series, the part

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.480
being played by Sigourney Weaver instead of,
say, her then-more famous male co-star Tom

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.430
Skerritt made it a subject of a lot of discussion
from 1979 onwards.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.860
One of the claims that popped up over the
years was that the character was originally

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.360
intended to be male.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.799
This seems to be a carryover from the genderflipped
character Ruth Leavitt in the slightly less

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.889
famous 1971 science fiction classic The Andromeda
Strain.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.650
None other than screenwriter Dan O’Bannon
refuted the story.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.719
He clarified that, intentionally, none of
the characters were gender specific in his

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.110
script so that the casting director could
take care of that.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.499
He had even included notes about this decision
on the last page of his original screenplay.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.119
We’ll leave it up to the reader to decide
what if anything this says about gender roles

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.149
in fiction.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.149
9.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.689
Johnny Depp/Jackie Earle Haley

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.429
It’s a classic story of an audition with
a comical twist: Someone who doesn’t even

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.139
intend to be an actor is just going along
with a friend to audition for a job.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.490
Turns out the casting director prefers the
friend who wasn’t intending to act, and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.029
that person goes on to be a big star.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.609
Something very similar to that happened to
Bob Hoskins, for example.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.500
The single most famous example of this would
likely be in 1983, when Jackie Earle Haley

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.360
brought Johnny Depp along with him for a role
in A Nightmare on Elm Street and ended up

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.200
launching his friend’s career.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.170
Then for a fun coincidence, Jackie Earle Haley
was cast as Freddy Krueger for the 2010 remake.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.040
Except… no.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.980
Haley clarified in an interview in Esquire
that all this talk of him and Depp at the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.540
audition was just a rumor.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.819
He doesn’t even know what the origin of
the rumor could have been, just that him not

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.840
bringing Depp there was crystal clear.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840
8.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.030
Daniel Day Lewis’s Insane Method Acting

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.420
Daniel Day-Lewis is as much famous for his
extreme method acting as he is for winning

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.700
three Academy Awards for Best Actor.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.370
For example, playing the primarily paralyzed
Christy Brown in My Left Foot involved him

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.310
staying in a wheelchair for the duration of
the shoot.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.350
He supposedly insists on only being referred
to by his character’s name.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.560
It’s all designed to instill the belief
that he spends all day trying to think of

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.329
himself as the character in some maniacal
worship of the acting profession.

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.849
On the podcast I Was There Too, Paul F. Tompkins
(who worked with him on There Will Be Blood)

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.909
clarified that Lewis wasn’t so intensely
in character at all.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.409
Between takes he would discuss the characters
as if they were characters, he wouldn’t

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.219
insist at all on being referred to by his
character’s name, and he was fine with dropping

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.720
the accent once the shoot was done for the
day.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.400
Indeed, as Tompkins opines, it would be an
indication that Lewis isn’t a good actor

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.959
if he makes others uncomfortable with such
unreasonable demands, since part of the nature

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.769
of being a good actor is to pay attention
to the needs of your collaborators.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:37.920
7.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.010
Tricking Alan Rickman

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.120
No, this isn’t an assertion that it’s
untrue that Alan Rickman was ever tricked.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.719
This is referring to a story that, in order
to get a better reaction out of Hans Gruber

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.099
for the shot when he is dropped off Nakatomi
Plaza in Die Hard, supposedly the director

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.140
told him that he would be dropped on the count
of three.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.620
However, to get a genuinely shocked reaction
before Rickman had properly braced himself,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.550
though, he was dropped on the count of one.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.409
Sorry to ruin everyone’s fun, but Rickman
was asked about this very thing during a Q&amp;A

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.409
event.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.510
He unambiguously didn’t remember it happening,
which – considering how vividly he remembered

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.400
the director saying “we’re going to drop
the actor” – means that would have been

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.810
an aspect that would have stuck in his memory.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.859
Considering he remembered the fall being higher
than the generally reported (40 feet instead

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.310
of 25) he clearly wasn’t in the mood to
downplay anything.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
6.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.310
Al Capone’s Tailor

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.730
Bringing it back to the subject of method
acting, we all know perhaps the second biggest

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.040
method actor in the world was Robert DeNiro
for years and years, starting with becoming

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.380
a real cab driver for weeks to prepare to
play Travis Bickle in 1974’s Taxi Driver.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.940
By the time 1987 rolled around, for The Untouchables
the news went around that DeNiro was supposedly

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.150
personally tracking down Al Capone’s tailor
so that the pajamas he wore (and even his

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.280
underwear) matched the crime lord’s.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.452
As was pointed out by others well after this
misconception spread, given that there was

00:04:57.452 --> 00:05:02.860
a 56-year gap between Capone’s incarceration
and the production of The Untouchables, Capone’s

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.360
tailor was very unlikely to be in the right
shape to work.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.980
For one thing, Capone’s tailor was actually
Louis Dinato, an associate of Capone’s whose

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.530
main noteworthy aspect was being repeatedly
questioned by the police even after Capone

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.730
was imprisoned (to no avail), as if he were
some sort of interrogation punching bag.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.570
The person who actually did the costume work
for DeNiro was Rich Bruno, and given that

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.160
he was only 52 when The Untouchables was made,
it would have been quite a trick for the costumer

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.570
to be tailoring for Al Capone.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.710
5.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.640
Spider-Man’s 156 Takes

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.701
This one has been a favorite of trivia sites
for years: Somehow Sam Raimi’s 2002 film

00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:45.290
Spider-Man had enough time in the production
schedule to devote hours and hours (if not

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.510
days) to shoot 156 takes of Tobey Maguire
catching a tray full of food.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.320
Now granted, in 2002 CGI affordable enough
for a throwaway gag wasn’t quite up to scratch,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.350
so there’s plenty of reason to do it mechanically
instead of with computers.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.270
But Maguire didn’t do it alone and the “156
takes” claim is certainly a joke (evidenced

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.290
by the fact that in its source, a commentary
track, the commenter gets a laugh from it).

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.760
It explicitly was a combination of using a
“mechanical rig” to drop the food and

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.070
gluing the tray to Maguire’s hand, and using
force-absorbing gel on the bottom of said

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.070
food.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.870
In fact, if you go frame-by-frame, you can
see a white substance stuck to the bottom

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.870
of the apple.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.060
That at least confirms it wasn’t CGI, since
why would a CG artist put that on there?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.510
Still, it definitely puts this back in the
“SFX” category.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.510
4.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.900
Werner Herzog’s Shoe Bet

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.200
Errol Morris and Werner Herzog are two of
the most interesting documentary filmmakers

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.530
working today, and their film careers were
connected in a rather befuddling way.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.560
Errol Morris began his career in 1978 with
the cult documentary Gates of Heaven (particularly

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.610
beloved by Roger Ebert) at a time when he
had little funding and getting distribution

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.950
for the film would have been extremely difficult.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.460
Herzog came up with a bizarre bet to motivate
his friend: If the movie were completed, Herzog

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.400
would eat his shoe at the premiere.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.390
It was enough of an event that a short film
was made of the preparation of the meal.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.600
Then Morris came along during a Q&amp;A session
at the Lincoln Center and revealed that they

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.550
actually didn’t have a wager – it was
just something that Herzog had made up as

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.990
an excuse to eat a shoe.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.890
Not wanting to be comedically upstaged, while
telling the truth about this, Morris said

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.470
he would joke for years that the bet had actually
stipulated Herzog’s foot.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.470
3.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.970
The Dark Knight’s Remote Futzing

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.640
Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker
in this 2008 blockbuster was so compelling

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.420
that much of his manic behavior felt completely
natural, leaving audiences open to the notion

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.020
that even the biggest parts were improvised.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.600
A scene where the Joker claps in jail is an
example.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.690
But the best known example is the scene where
the Joker is blowing up Gotham General Hospital,

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.340
but stops when there seems to be a problem
with the detonation.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.090
In what was alleged to be improv, Ledger messes
with the remote, and then the explosion resumes,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.140
leaving him to scramble onto the bus.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.520
As director Christopher Nolan explains in
a behind the scenes feature included on The

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.120
Dark Knight blu-ray, the sudden stop in the
explosion and the Joker’s pause was actually

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.660
planned in advance.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.170
In fact, Warner Brothers provided a CGI mockup
of how the scene would be staged as evidence.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.990
That’s much further than most studios go
in debunking a piece of trivia.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.990
2.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.950
Citizen Kane’s Non-Plot Hole

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:30.220
Since this 1941 film has for decades been
known as arguably the best ever made, it was

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.240
a delight for film buffs and critics alike
to claim that the story has a gigantic plot

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.649
hole right in the middle of it.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:40.590
The impetus for the story is that the titular
Kane’s last word was “Rosebud” and it

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.670
was supposed to be said to an empty room.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.070
Which begs the question of how anyone heard
what his final word was if he was alone.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.650
There was a story circulated that this was
pointed out to auteur Orson Welles by a member

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.880
of the crew, and Welles responded some variation
on “don’t you ever tell anyone this.”

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.860
The problem with the plausibility of that
little story is that it’s not consistent

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.720
with the content of the movie.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.190
While the opening scene has been watched by
cinefiles and parodied many times by shows

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.780
such as The Simpsons, the scene’s person
who heard the words doesn’t appear until

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.990
much later.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.590
Very near the end, the reporter that’s been
spending the movie trying to learn from Kane’s

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.200
intimates what Rosebud could mean has a brief
chat with the butler Raymond, who explicitly

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.150
says he’s the one who heard it.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.800
Raymond’s other main contribution to the
movie is telling the reporter about the famous

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.660
scene where Kane wrecks his room until he
sees a snow globe and says Rosebud the first

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.660
time.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.261
So if someone had asked Orson Welles about
who heard the words, Welles would just have

00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.850
said Raymond instead of acting as if his entire
movie were in jeopardy.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.890
1.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.710
Being John Malkovich’s Beer Can

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:49.200
A lot of this trivia took a concerted effort
to debunk or a celebrity to wanted to set

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200
the record straight.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.190
In this case, the thing that disproved it
was completely unintentional.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.600
Indeed, the performer in question might not
even have ever heard of the false story.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.300
In Being John Malkovich, there’s a scene
where the titular actor is walking by a road

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.450
while he’s in a rut.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.340
An extra in a passing vehicle yelled “Hey
Malkovich, think fast!” and threw a beer

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.940
can at his head.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.470
Supposedly the scene was completely unscripted
and instead of being rebuked for potentially

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.740
ruining a take, the actor got a raise (some
versions say he got a Screen Actors Guild

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.740
card) because the line of dialogue was used.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.950
The truth didn’t come out until Malkovich
was doing a question and answer session known

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.380
as a “AMA” (Ask Me Anything) on the popular
website Reddit.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.029
One of his fans asked about that particular
scene without mentioning it was supposedly

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.580
completely spontaneous.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.490
The actor said that he was especially fond
of that scene, and had been looking forward

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.570
to it… as soon as he read it in the script.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.540
In fact, director Spike Jonze wasn’t even
sure if any of the actors would be able to

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.720
hit Malkovich in an acceptably low number
of takes.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.980
In hindsight, it would have been a pretty
bad idea to actively encourage extras to do

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.980
things that might harm actors and ruin takes,
so everyone should have found the story dubious

00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:22.410
even before Malkovich accidentally corrected
them.
