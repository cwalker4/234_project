00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:48.607 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I BOXED.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.575 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SEMIPRO.

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.744
&gt;&gt; NO, POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE.

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
MY FATHER WAS AN AMATEUR
FIGHTER.

00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:55.013 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.482 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND I USED TO BOX WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:59.452
AND I WENT TO KIND OF A ROUGH
SCHOOL, AND I HAD TO, LIKE,

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.187 align:start position:0%
REALLY LEARN TO BOX.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.887 align:start position:0%
SO --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ON THE FLY.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.121 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:08.828 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE MOVIE "GLORIA
BELL," AGAIN WITH JULIANE MOORE.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
IT'S ABOUT A BUDDING
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU TWO.

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:17.736
WHAT WAS JOHN TURTURRO'S-- WHAT
WAS YOUR BUDDING ROMANCE LIKE?

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:22.441
WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST DATES LIKE?

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:24.376 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY FIRST DATES?

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:27.546 align:start position:0%
USUALLY I WOULD ASK SOMEBODY OUT
WHEN I WAS DANCING.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:30.416 align:start position:0%
I REMEMBER KISSING A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.651 align:start position:0%
AND SHE WAS-- SHE WAS
UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL.

00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:36.922 align:start position:0%
BUT SHE WAS THE WORST KISSER,
YOU KNOW.

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:39.158 align:start position:0%
I MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
KISS, EITHER.

00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:40.426 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE.

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.262 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS LIKE AIR KISSES OR
SOMETHING.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:48.234
AND I REMEMBER, I WAS, LIKE, I
SAID, "IF THIS IS WHAT KISSING

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.502 align:start position:0%
IS, I DON'T KNOW.

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.570 size:78% position:39%
MAKE THIS IS NOT FOR ME."

00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:52.237 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M OUT.

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.839
&gt;&gt; AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH.

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:57.209
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A WHOLE-- THAT'S A
WEIRD THING, YOU KNOW, GETTING

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:58.544 align:start position:0%
TO KNOW SOMEONE.

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
IT'S TRIAL AND ERROR.

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:03.115 align:start position:0%
UNTIL YOU MEET SOMEONE WHO YOU
SORT OF CONNECT WITH.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:08.120
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, THIS IS GOOD
ADVICE FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:09.321 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:11.123 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE, TRIAL AND

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:11.690 align:start position:0%
ERROR.

00:08:11.723 --> 00:08:12.291 align:start position:0%
DON'T JUST SETTLE DOWN.

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:14.059 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:15.327 align:start position:0%
IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.829 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PUT SOME EFFORT
INTO IT.

00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:19.298 align:start position:0%
AND SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE
BAD KISSERS--

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:19.999 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.000
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LEARN.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:21.934 align:start position:0%
AND SOMETIMES SOMEONE TEACHES
THE OTHER PERSON.

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:24.103 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO TAUGHT YOU? 
WHO TAUGHT YOU?

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.005 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:30.609 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:32.278 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "GLORIA BELL" IS IN
THEATERS NOW.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.647 size:78% position:39%
JOHN TURTURRO, EVERYBODY!

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.448 align:start position:0%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STAR OF
STAGE AND SCREEN, ANDREW

00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:38.784 align:start position:0%
RANNELLS.
