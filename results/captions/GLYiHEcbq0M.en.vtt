-As President Trump
returns from his summit

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.872
with Kim Jong-un,
he was facing more fallout

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.840
from Michael's Cohen's
Congressional testimony.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.543
For more on this, it's time for
"A Closer Look."

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:15.214
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.750
This has truly been one of
the most eventful weeks

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.084
of the Trump presidency --

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:21.621
and every week of the Trump
presidency is eventful.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.290
Just once, I'd like
the CNN chyron to say,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.026
"Breaking -- Nothing happened.
Now, get a good night's sleep."

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.461
[ Laughter ]

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.030
For example, today, Trump
wrapped up his summit in Vietnam

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.731
with North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.867
And it wouldn't be a Trump
summit with a world leader

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.903
without a super weird
handshake.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.172
Check out this moment
between Trump and Kim,

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:43.043
and watch specifically for how
Trump goes in for the handshake.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.946
[ Laughter ]

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.183
It's like...

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.986
he was going in for
a karate chop...

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:58.124
and then remembered it was
supposed to be a handshake.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.959
[ Laughter ]

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.330
Trump always shakes hands the
way a 7-year-old boy would think

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.366
a big, important businessman
shakes hands.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.336
[ As Trump ]
"I'm gonna go in for the chop,
then up and down real hard,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.405
and then, I say
'good job with the files.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.274
We should do
golfing sometime.'"

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.643
[ Normal voice ] Now, you might
think the tyrannical dictator

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.946
of an oppressive regime
would never get stressed out,

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.182
but on his way to the summit,
cameras apparently caught Kim

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.617
lighting up
a cigarette.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.387
-Along the way, the North Korean
dictator was caught giving in

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:30.122
to one of his vices,
taking a smoke break,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:33.525
and using what appeared to be
a crystal ash tray.

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.028
-He's one of the most brutal
dictators in the world,

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.498
and he looks like a K-Mart
employee on Black Friday...

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.565
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.201
...pacing around
the parking lot,

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.869
trying to build up
the nerve to quit.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.003
"All right.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.271
I'm gonna so in there,
and I'm gonna say,

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.975
'Donald, it's over.
And don't try to chop my hand.'"

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.243
Everything about this summit
was weird.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.845
For example,
the White House press pool,

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.214
which consists of a group
of rotating reporters

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:57.984
whose job it is to track
the president's movements,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.185
was apparently transported
to Trump's meeting

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:02.755
with Kim Jong-un
in a broken bus.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.757
According to the report,
the pool was transported

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:07.293
to the palace in a bus
with a broken horn

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.397
that consistently honked
on its own at nothing.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.700
I will say,
"a horn that honked a nothing"

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.668
sounds like the title
of a children's book

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.103
about Donald Trump.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.272
[ Laughter ]

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.740
Now, everyone...

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.841
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.710
Let's be clear...

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.013
everyone should want a peaceful,
diplomatic solution.

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.248
And after a summit
like this,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.249
you'd at least want
a coherent explanation

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.618
of where things stand, given
the stakes of the situation.

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.988
Yet, here is Trump describing
the summit with Kim

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.156
after it was over.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.726
-We just left
Chairman Kim.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:44.330
We had a really,
I think a very productive time.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.235
We spent pretty much all day
with Kim Jong-un,

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.038
who is...

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.807
He's quite a guy,
and quite a character.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.642
-"Quite a character"?

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.877
He's one of the most brutal
dictators in the world,

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.546
and you're talking about him
like he's Dwight

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.581

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.556
[ Normal voice] Of course,
it's very possible

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.925
Trump was distracted by the big
story looming over the summit --

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.627
the explosive
Congressional testimony

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.628
of his former personal fixer,
Michael Cohen.

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:19.765
In fact, there's already fallout
from the Cohen hearing.

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:22.134
This morning, the Democratic
chairman of the committee,

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.270
Elijah Cummings, said
the committee would probably

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.671
call more witnesses.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.907
Cummings said, if Michael Cohen
mentioned their names

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.976
in the hearing yesterday,
chances are

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.011
they would be called in
to testify, too.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.279
Now, that's huge.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.947
It means everyone
from Jared Kushner

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.516
to Ivanka Trump to Don Jr.
could be called in to testify.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:40.920
But personally, I'm most excited
about one person in particular,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.122
and it comes from
this exchange yesterday.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.058
-To your knowledge,
did the president ever provide

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.028
inflated assets
to an insurance company?

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.663
-Yes.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:53.098
-Who else knows
that the president did this?

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.434
-Allen Weisselberg,
Ron Lieberman,

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:57.369
and Matthew Calamari.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.204
-That's right.

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:03.009
There's an actual human person
named "Matthew Calamari."

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.077
[ Laughter ]

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.512
Or at least,
I think he is a person,

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.716
and not Squidward's deadbeat
uncle on "Spongebob."

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.919
If there's any upside
to electing a New Yorker

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.688
as president, it's that
we will at least get to hear

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.156
a member of Congress
say the words

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.725
"Thank you for being here,
Mr. Calamari.

you're under oath,

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:26.932
And you can tell
Trump and Republicans

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.467
are worried about
Cohen's testimony

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:29.535
because,
leading up to it,

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.970
they've been publicly
threatening him.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.805
On Tuesday,
congressman Matt Gaetz

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:35.274
threatened to reveal information
about Cohen's personal life.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:37.309
And last month,
Trump went on Fox News

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.179
and said investigators should
look into Cohen's father-in-law

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.881
for committing
some sort of crime --

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.483
although he wasn't very clear
on the specifics.

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:46.152
-In order to get
his sentence reduced,

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.620
he says
"I have an idea.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.156
I'll tell -- I'll give you
some information

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:52.191
on the president."
Well, there is no information.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:56.228
But he should give information,
maybe, on his father-in-law,

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:59.265
because that's the one
that people want to look at.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.633
Because where
there's that money,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.301
that's the money
in the family.

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.670
And I guess he didn't want to
talk about his father-in-law.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.405
He's trying to get
his sentence reduced.

father-in-law's name?

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:34.053
to build a Trump Tower
in Moscow during the campaign,

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:37.056
Rudy said "I can tell you, from
the moment I read the story,

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.791
I knew this story
was false."

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.692
"Because?"
"Because I have been through

00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:41.794
all the tapes."

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.096
"Wait. What tapes
have you gone through?"

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.665
"I shouldn't
have said 'tapes.'"

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.832
[ Laughter ]

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:48.868
"So, there were no tapes
you listened to, though?"

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.871
"No tapes.
Well, I have listened to tapes,

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:53.639
but none of them
concern this."

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.640
[ Laughter ]

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.275
"I remember
what it is now.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:59.779
I was thinking about a mixtape
that Mr. Trump made for me."

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.615
[ Laughter ]

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.682
You know...

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:06.752
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.422
You know who I'd love to see
testify in front of Congress?

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:12.291
Rudy. He crumbles
under no pressure.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.559
I mean, look at him.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.229
He always looks like
he just sat on a park bench

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:19.765
and it turned out
to be a ski lift.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.502
"Oh!
What's the big idea, bench?"

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.771
Not only did Trump
fail to get a deal in Vietnam,

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.240
but as he returns home,
he's facing the fallout

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.975
from Cohen's
explosive testimony.

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.311
We know so much today
that we didn't know yesterday.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.747
In fact, at this point,
someone should just ask Cohen,

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:37.616
point blank, how many times
Trump broke the law.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:39.551
-100 times?
-More.

00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.420
-200 times?
-More.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.255
-500 times?
-Probably.

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:44.924
-This has been
"A Closer Look."

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:49.729
[ Cheers and applause ]
