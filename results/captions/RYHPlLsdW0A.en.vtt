00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Woman: And now one of the most
respected investors in America

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.920
is going to tell you
about his secrets.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.960
Man: "Warren Buffett."
It's the sound of money.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.620
$9.2 billion...
Woman 2: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett,

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.258
the second richest man
in America.

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:40.166
Man 2:
He's estimated to be worth about $62 billion.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.208
That makes him
the richest man in the world.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.917
????

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.542
Woman 3: You know,
Buffett is not exactly what you might expect.

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:52.771
Woman 4:
Even though he's in the money business,

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:55.000
he doesn't even own
a calculator or a computer.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.425
Man 3:
He takes the long view,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:00.291
and it's made him billions,
many billions.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.300
Man 4:
Maybe you can beat the house,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.217
but I don't think you can beat
Warren Buffett.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:09.333
Man 5: Buffett filed his first
tax return at 13 years old.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.041
But he's no average
billionaire, Tom.

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.550
Tom:
No, he certainly isn't, Matt.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.458
Woman 5:
He's a $44 billion average Joe.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.717
Man 7:
Warren Buffett has an approach

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:23.333
that doesn't make him very popular
with his fellow billionaires.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.274
Man 8: Warren Buffett,
the boy from Nebraska

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.383
who grew up to become
the Wizard of Omaha.

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:31.625
Man 9: What was it about him
that allowed him to become

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.834
the richest man in the world?
How did he do it?

00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:37.125
????

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.883
Warren: 70 years ago,
I was in high school.

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:54.333
Almost a third as long
as the country has been around.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:56.841
And when I was
in high school,

00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:59.208
I really only had
two things on my mind...

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:01.508
girls and cars.

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.500
And...
and I wasn't doing very well with girls,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.342
so we'll talk
about cars.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.383
But lets just imagine
that when we finish,

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:14.792
I'm going to let each one of you
pick out the car of your choice.

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.759
Sounds good, doesn't it?

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.634
Pick it out,
any color, you name it,

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:23.708
it'll be tied up with a bow,
and it'll be at your house tomorrow.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.875
And you say,
"Well, what's the catch?"

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:30.592
And the catch is...

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.483
that it's the only car you're
going to get in your lifetime.

00:02:34.683 --> 00:02:38.375
Now what are you going to do,
knowing that that's the only car

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.592
you're ever going to have
and you love that car?

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:44.208
You're going to take care of
it like you cannot believe.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.550
Now what I'd like to suggest

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.583
is that you're not going to get
only one car in your lifetime,

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:52.917
but you're gonna get
one body and one mind,

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:54.508
and that's all
you're going to get.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:58.792
And that body and mind
feels terrific now,

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.750
but it has
to last you a lifetime.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.462
I'm on the way
to the office.

00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:08.375
It's all
of a five-minute drive.

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:10.750
Been doing it...

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:15.342
for 54 years.

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:18.175
One of the good things
about this five-minute drive

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:23.792
is that on the way there's a McDonald's,
so I'll pick up something.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.583
Woman on speaker: Good morning,
thank you for choosing McDonald's.

00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:29.800
Go ahead and order
whenever you're ready.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.333
I'll have a Sausage McMuffin
with egg and cheese.

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:35.759
Woman: Anything else?
That's it, thank you.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.708
Warren: Yeah,
and I tell my wife as I shave in the morning,

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:45.217
I say either $2.61,
$2.95, or $3.17,

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:48.921
and she puts that amount
in a little cup by me here

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.625
and that determines
which of three breakfasts I get.

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.258
Hi. 2.95.
Okay, 2.95.

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:57.337
There's the two.
How you doing, sir!

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.648
Hey, great!
You're on "Candid Camera"!

00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:01.759
I see. Hello, everybody!

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.546
Warren:
When I'm not feeling quite so prosperous,

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:07.856
I might go with a 2.61,
which is two sausage patties,

00:04:08.056 --> 00:04:11.166
and then I put 'em together
and pour myself a Coke.

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.300
Hi, how are you?
Hi. I've been good.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.250
3.17 is a bacon, egg,
and cheese biscuit,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.550
but the market's
down this morning,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.125
so I think I'll pass up the
3.17 and go with the 2.95.

00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:29.792
????

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.966
Warren:
I like numbers.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.917
It started before
I could remember.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.792
It just felt good,
working with numbers.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:48.708
I was always playing around with
numbers in one-way or another.

00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:50.800
And it was fun to have
a bunch of guys over

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.667
and have them betting on which
marble would reach the drain first.

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:58.175
I had a lot
of energy as a kid.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.792
I... I was inquisitive,
and I was the youngest one

00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:03.583
always in the class,
'cause I'd skip.

00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:06.208
I've always been competitive.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.875
I liked to read
more than most kids.

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:13.467
I really like
to read a lot.

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:16.542
My Aunt Edie gave me
a copy of "The World Almanac"

00:05:16.742 --> 00:05:18.008
and that was heaven to me.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:24.041
And I can still tell you that Omaha's
population was 214,006 in 1930.

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.467
Some numbers
just kind of stick with you.

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:30.041
And very early,
probably when I was seven or so,

00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.374
I took this book out
of the Benson Library

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:34.708
called "A Thousand Ways
to Make a $1,000."

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:39.087
And one of the ways
in this book

00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:41.708
was having
penny weighing machines.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:47.166
And I sat and calculated
how much it would cost

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:48.258
to buy the first
weighing machine,

00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:49.440
and then how long
it would take for the profit

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.000
from that one to buy another one,
and I would sit there

00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:54.217
and create these
compound interest tables

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.088
to figure out how long
it would take me to have

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:57.959
a weighing machine
for every person in the world.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.467
I had everybody in the country
weighing themselves ten times a day,

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:05.917
and me just sitting there like John
D. Rockefeller of weighing machines.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.717
The allowance when I was a
little boy was a nickel a week,

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:17.583
but I liked the idea of having a little
more than a nickel a week to work with,

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:19.625
and I went
into business very early.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.500
I started selling Coca-Cola
door to door.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.592
I sold gum door to door.

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:25.966
I sold
"Saturday Evening Post,"

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.542
"Liberty" magazine,
"Ladies Home Journal," you name it.

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.583
I think I enjoyed the game
almost right from the start.

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:38.258
But I like being my own boss.

00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:40.583
That's one thing I liked
about delivering papers.

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.091
I could arrange
the route I wanted.

00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:46.458
Nobody was bothering me
at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning.

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:52.759
I was delivering
500 papers a day,

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.208
and I made a penny a paper,
but in terms of compounding,

00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:58.583
that penny's turned
into something else.

00:06:58.783 --> 00:07:02.792
????

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.650
Einstein is reputed to have said
that "Compound interest

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.800
is the eighth wonder of the world"
or something like that,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.417
and it goes back to that story you probably
learned when you were in grade school

00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:18.375
where somebody did
something for the king,

00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:20.770
and the king said,
"What can I do for you?"

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.966
And he said,
"Well, lets take a chessboard

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:26.166
"and put one kernel of wheat
on the first square

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:27.917
"and then double it
on the second

00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:29.425
and double it on the third."

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:32.375
And the king readily agreed to it,
and by the time he figured out

00:07:32.575 --> 00:07:35.425
what two to the 64th
amounted to,

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.508
he was giving away
the entire kingdom.

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:42.133
So it's a pretty simple concept,
but over time,

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:45.208
it accomplishes
extraordinary things.

00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:52.925
Berkshire is an amazing company.

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:56.467
Fourth largest company
in the "Fortune" 500.

00:07:56.667 --> 00:08:00.508
He is the only person
who has ever, from scratch,

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:05.500
built a company that is in the
top 10 of the Fortune 500.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.425
Woman: Berkshire Hathaway.
Fine, thank you.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.375
Warren: Well,
Berkshire is a holding company of sorts.

00:08:16.575 --> 00:08:20.417
It owns a large number
of separate businesses

00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:22.717
that operate
independently of each other

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:27.083
and, to a great extent,
from the parent company, Berkshire Hathaway.

00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:34.208
All right, well,
we're going to get more from you in a second.

00:08:34.408 --> 00:08:37.166
Warren: So we have maybe 70,
maybe 80 businesses,

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:39.749
and we ask them
to behave in a way

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:42.133
that doesn't hurt
our reputation

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.875
at Berkshire Hathaway,
but they run their own lives.

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:51.375
Other people do most of the decorating in
the office, so various things come in.

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:56.708
Originally,
when I moved in in 1962...

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:58.925
you can see this...

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.841
I went down
to the South Omaha Library,

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.083
and I think for a dollar,
I got seven copies

00:09:06.283 --> 00:09:08.634
of old "New York Times"

00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:12.792
from big times like
the Panic of 1907.

00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:15.416
This is one...
1929 obviously.

00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:17.841
But I wanted
to put on the walls

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:20.592
days of extreme panic
in Wall Street,

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:24.583
just as a reminder that anything
can happen in this world.

00:09:24.783 --> 00:09:25.283
I mean it...

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:27.792
it's instructive art
you can call it.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.125
????

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:39.667
I was born in 1930
here in Omaha, Nebraska,

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:41.000
during the stock market crash.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:48.500
My dad lost his job in 1931,
a year after I was born.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.550
He was a stock salesman,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.291
and he had what little savings
he had in the bank,

00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:56.217
and so he started
his own company.

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:58.166
He worked right through
the depression.

00:09:58.366 --> 00:10:00.291
????

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:05.834
Bertie Buffett:
He had an investment company,

00:10:06.034 --> 00:10:06.966
and as an adult
when I looked back,

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:10.000
I thought, "Wow, did that ever
take a lot of nerve."

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.400
Sometimes we'd
go down there on Sunday,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.500
and we could play
with the adding machine.

00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.125
My brother and I tended
to play the games together.

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:22.841
And I remember
at one point he said to me,

00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:27.834
"I'm going to be a millionaire by the
time I'm... 30," or something like that.

00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:31.250
It was totally outside of anything
my family had experienced,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.708
but he just was
unusual that way.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.170
Doris Buffett:
Well, I was the oldest,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.841
and then my brother
and then my sister.

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.800
And my father would go
to New York periodically

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.542
to check on businesses,
stocks, and things like that,

00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:48.708
and he'd come back,
he'd always have a costume

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:51.125
for each of us,
and Warren loved it.

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:55.175
He was very good-natured.
He was quiet.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.750
It was hard to tell
he was a genius at that point,

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.917
but I mean,
who was looking?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.583
Warren:
The first books I read on investment

00:11:06.783 --> 00:11:08.583
were actually
in my dad's office.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.583
Pretty soon, I read
all the books in the office

00:11:12.783 --> 00:11:14.750
and read some of them
more than once.

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.504
My dad had
various nicknames for me.

00:11:18.704 --> 00:11:20.481
He'd call me
"Fireball" sometimes,

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.949
because I'd start
little businesses.

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.217
He didn't care
about money at all.

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:28.050
He believed very much
in having an inner scorecard

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.583
and never worry about what other
people are thinking about you.

00:11:31.783 --> 00:11:33.550
You know, just... just...

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.750
if you know why you're doing what
you're doing, that's good enough.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.925
I admired everything
about him to the extent

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:43.175
that I was absorbing lessons
from him without knowing it.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:47.125
And the idea that all lives have
equal value is something that

00:11:47.325 --> 00:11:50.125
all three of his children
felt since I can remember.

00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:55.875
My dad at one point
ran for congress

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:57.625
when I was 12 or so.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.425
It was
a very republican household.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:03.542
I campaigned for him.
My sisters campaigned for him.

00:12:03.742 --> 00:12:05.041
The whole family did.

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:11.258
My mother was
very, very bright,

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:14.625
and she was very gregarious.
She was a good campaigner for my dad.

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.966
Bertie:
She had a lot of ambition,

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.925
and I think
my brother Warren got a lot

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:27.166
of his extreme competitiveness
from my mother, actually.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.717
Doris:
She was brilliant at math.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:31.754
You know, I guess
they still had these things

00:12:31.954 --> 00:12:33.592
where you crank them
and things added up,

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:36.917
and she could add it in her head
faster than the machine could do it.

00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:39.500
She was
absolutely amazing in that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.625
Warren: She was very dutiful
about taking care of the kids,

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:45.883
but you didn't get
the same feeling of... of love.

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:49.667
It was there, but it just... it didn't
come out the same way as with my dad.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:54.500
Howard Buffett, Sr. on radio:
In the nation, the only permanent way

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.583
to prosperity is
a balanced budget.

00:12:57.783 --> 00:12:59.800
Unless that goal
is achieved,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.425
all post-war plans will collapse
like Hitler's conquest.

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:07.333
Man on radio: You have heard
Congressman Howard L.H. Buffett,

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:09.542
a Republican member
of the House of Representatives

00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:11.021
from Nebraska
speaking on the...

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.300
Warren:
When I was about 12 or 13,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.546
we moved to Washington,
my family, and I was mad.

00:13:15.746 --> 00:13:18.627
I was having fun in Omaha,
and I lost all my friends,

00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:21.708
and now I moved to a town
where they were all strange,

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:25.291
and so I was very,
very unhappy.

00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:27.542
????

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:31.542
At school,
I just lost interest.

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:35.208
I took pleasure
in tormenting my teachers.

00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:40.941
At that time for example,
AT&amp;T was the stock

00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:43.675
that all teachers owned
for their retirement,

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:47.508
and I decided that it would
drive my teachers a little crazy

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:50.375
if I went and short the stock,
because when you go short a stock,

00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:53.125
you're betting
that it will go down.

00:13:53.325 --> 00:13:54.883
So I shorted
10 shares of AT&amp;T,

00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:56.966
and then brought
the confirmation to school

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.375
and showed these teachers
I was shorting the stock.

00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:01.883
They found me
a big pain in the neck,

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:04.166
but they did think I knew
a lot about stocks.

00:14:04.366 --> 00:14:05.750
????

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:12.383
And then at home,
my mother would have terrific headaches,

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:15.400
and you didn't want to be around her
when she was having the headaches,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.417
and she would... she would lash out more.
She would never do it in public.

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:22.083
Doris: Well,
I think we were terrified of her.

00:14:22.283 --> 00:14:23.467
????

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:24.883
When I'd wake up
in the morning,

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:27.417
I'd listen to hear her voice.
I could tell by her voice

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.425
if it was going to be
a terrible day or not.

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:33.625
Warren: When she got difficult,
the three children felt it.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:40.125
When I was at the low point, sort of,
I decided that I would run away.

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.917
So I talked two other guys
into running away with me.

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.458
We went out,
and we start hitchhiking...

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:51.508
and then we got picked up
by the highway patrol

00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:54.792
and that scared
the hell out of us.

00:14:57.083 --> 00:15:00.875
It's very interesting. My dad never
really gave me hell about doing this,

00:15:01.075 --> 00:15:02.175
but he finally said,
"You know,"

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:05.458
he said,
"you can do better than this."

00:15:05.658 --> 00:15:08.342
And just saying that,
I mean, I...

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.834
I felt like I was
letting him down, basically.

00:15:11.034 --> 00:15:13.500
So in all ways,
he was teaching me.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.166
Never taught
by telling me things,

00:15:16.366 --> 00:15:17.800
he just taught by example.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.333
He had unlimited confidence in me,
even when I screwed up,

00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:24.625
and that takes you
a long, long way.

00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:29.717
The best gift
I was ever given

00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:32.625
was to have the father
that I had when I was born.

00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:42.458
I didn't want to go to college.
I was 16 when I got out of high school

00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:44.175
and I was buying stocks.

00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:46.008
I mean,
I actually was having a pretty good time

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:49.333
and I didn't see that really was much
to be gained by going to college,

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.250
but my dad
kind of jollied me into it.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.217
????

00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:55.546
Doris:
He had a roommate who was a friend of mine,

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.875
and the roommate said
it would just drive him crazy,

00:15:58.075 --> 00:15:59.342
because he studied
all the time,

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.875
and Warren would come in
15 minutes before the exam

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:06.008
and just ace his way
through it.

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:09.041
Warren: I finished in three years,
'cause I had enough credits,

00:16:09.241 --> 00:16:11.500
and I was in a hurry.
I wanted to get out.

00:16:15.458 --> 00:16:17.291
Warren:
When I got out of the University of Nebraska,

00:16:17.491 --> 00:16:19.883
I applied
to Harvard Business school.

00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:24.000
They told me I was to get
interviewed in a place near Chicago.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.208
I got there,
and he interviewed me for about 10 minutes,

00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:30.008
and he said, "Forget it."

00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:31.675
"You're not going
to Harvard."

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.712
And so now I'm thinking,
"What do I tell my dad?

00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:37.750
Oh, this is terrible."
And it turned out to be

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.208
the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:40.759
Later that summer,

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.550
I was looking
through a catalog

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.583
and in the catalog, it had these
names of people that were teaching,

00:16:46.783 --> 00:16:49.500
and one was Graham
and another was Dodd.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.875
I had read this book
by the two of them,

00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:54.646
so I wrote him a letter
in mid-August,

00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:57.217
and I said,
"Dear Professor Dodd,"

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:59.592
I said, "I thought
you guys were dead."

00:16:59.792 --> 00:17:02.675
"But, now that I found out
that you're alive

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.667
and teaching at Columbia,
I would really like to come."

00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:08.396
And he admitted me.
So, you know what?

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:11.125
That... it just shows,
you never can tell.

00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:14.875
????

00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:19.550
Man: Gentlemen,
Professor Graham.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.300
Warren:
Ben was this incredible teacher.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.000
I mean he... he was a natural,
and he drew us all in.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.383
Are Wall Street professionals...

00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:31.008
they more accurate in the shorter
term than the long term forecast?

00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:36.708
Well, our studies indicate that you have
your choice between tossing coins...

00:17:36.908 --> 00:17:39.383
and taking the consensus
of expert opinions,

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:43.041
and the results are just
about the same in each case.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:45.425
Warren:
It was like learning baseball

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:47.841
from a fellow
who's batting .400.

00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:50.625
It really... it shaped
my professional life.

00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:56.583
There are two rules of
investing according to Warren,

00:17:56.783 --> 00:17:59.125
and he learned this
from Ben Graham.

00:17:59.325 --> 00:18:01.458
????

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:05.467
Rule number one,
never lose money.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:09.333
Rule number two,
never forget rule number one.

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:15.542
Ben Graham basically coined
the term "value investing."

00:18:15.742 --> 00:18:18.175
He believed
in careful scrutiny

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:20.883
of a company's
financial statements,

00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:25.500
and that if you bought value,
it would eventually prove out.

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:31.300
A few years ago,
I went to Amazon,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.759
and sure enough,
they had this manual there,

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:37.208
so while reliving my youth...
other guys were going to Amazon

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.792
and probably buying
old "Playboys" or something,

00:18:40.992 --> 00:18:42.675
but I bought old
Moody's manuals instead,

00:18:42.875 --> 00:18:46.708
and when I got out of school,
I started selling stocks,

00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:48.342
I was 20 years old at the time,

00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.634
looked about 16,
and acted about 12,

00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:54.875
so I was not the most impressive
salesperson anybody ever met.

00:18:55.075 --> 00:18:58.166
But what I would do was I went
through, page by page,

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:01.333
looking for possibly
undervalued stocks.

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.375
Peter Kunhardt: Is this like going
through an old family album?

00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:07.521
Better!

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:09.667
????

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.925
When I got out of business
school at Columbia,

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:17.566
I developed pretty decent
skills in terms of business,

00:19:17.766 --> 00:19:21.208
but I hadn't really come to
terms with the world exactly.

00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:24.592
Kunhardt:
What were you like around girls back then?

00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:29.333
Bad. I was... I was sort of out of the
swing of things there for a while.

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:34.300
I went to my 60th reunion,
and there was a girl there.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.691
I took her out one time to the
Uptown Theater in Washington,

00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.083
and I asked her whether she
remembered what movie we saw,

00:19:41.283 --> 00:19:42.634
and she said,
"No, I don't remember that."

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:45.375
And then she said,
"But I do remember one thing."

00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:47.383
And like an idiot,
I said, "What was that?"

00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:49.583
And she said, "Well,
you picked me up in a hearse."

00:19:49.783 --> 00:19:50.966
And it was true
that I owned

00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:53.667
a half-interest in a hearse
while I was in high school,

00:19:53.867 --> 00:19:55.750
which was not
the smoothest thing that...

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.833
or coolest,
as they would say now...

00:19:58.033 --> 00:19:59.917
that you could...
you could do on a date.

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:06.417
There were two turning
points in my life.

00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:07.592
Once when
I came out of the womb,

00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:09.625
and once when I met
Susie, basically.

00:20:09.825 --> 00:20:13.342
????

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:15.375
She was the girl, yep.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.050
But it took her
a little longer

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.708
to figure out
I was the boy.

00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:25.008
Susie Buffett:
I was going to be

00:20:25.208 --> 00:20:28.091
his youngest sister's roommate
at Northwestern.

00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:32.333
So I walk into their house,
he was sitting in this chair,

00:20:32.533 --> 00:20:35.966
and he made
some sarcastic quip.

00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:39.583
So I made one back.
I thought, "Who is this jerk?"

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:40.634
????

00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:42.917
And that's how we met, yes.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.917
Listen, Warren is smarter
than you even know.

00:20:49.117 --> 00:20:51.959
His brain is going
all the time.

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.342
And my dad said to me,

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:56.592
"Now you have
to understand about him...

00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:59.041
"you're not going to have
discussions with him

00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:01.000
"like you would
most normal people,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.583
but he has
a heart of gold."

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:07.708
He was just
totally enamored of her,

00:21:07.908 --> 00:21:09.966
and why not?
And she of him.

00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:13.792
She'd sit on his lap all the time,
and he'd stroke her hair.

00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:16.166
It was softening him.

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:20.046
Susie was
really kind, considerate,

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:22.834
and she was
the balancing force.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.041
Warren: I just got very,
very, very lucky.

00:21:29.241 --> 00:21:30.841
But I was
a lopsided person,

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.542
and it took a while,
but she just stood there

00:21:33.742 --> 00:21:36.175
with a little watering can

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:40.708
and just nourished me along
and... and changed me.

00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:43.091
????

00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:45.759
Somebody once said
that the chains of habit

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:49.708
are too light to be felt until
they're too heavy to be broken.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.000
I had been terrified
of public speaking.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.625
I couldn't do it.
I'd throw up.

00:21:57.875 --> 00:22:00.875
And I knew if I didn't cure it then,
I'd never cure it.

00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:02.508
????

00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:06.629
And so I saw an ad in the paper
for the Dale Carnegie Course,

00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:10.750
which worked on developing your
ability to speak in public,

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:11.717
and I went down there.

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.800
Dale Carnegie:
Be sincere.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.841
A good smile
has the same effect

00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:17.717
as a puppy's tail.
When a puppy wags...

00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:20.046
Warren:
They made us do all these crazy things

00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:22.375
to get out of ourselves,
and so we stood on tables

00:22:22.575 --> 00:22:23.792
and did all kinds of things.

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.837
Warren:
If I hadn't had done that...

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.834
my whole life
would have been different.

00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:36.383
So in my office
you will not see

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:38.592
the degree I got from the
University of Nebraska.

00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:41.959
You will not see the Masters degree
I got from Columbia University,

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:44.667
but you'll see
the little award certificate

00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:47.083
I got
from the Dale Carnegie Course.

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:50.900
As a matter of fact,
every week,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.217
the instructor
would give a pencil

00:22:53.417 --> 00:22:57.834
to whoever had done the most with
what we'd learned the week before.

00:22:58.034 --> 00:23:00.250
And so in the fourth
or fifth week,

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.425
I proposed to her mother,

00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:05.692
and she said yes.
And so that week,

00:23:05.892 --> 00:23:08.759
I won the pencil,
I also got engaged,

00:23:08.959 --> 00:23:10.792
and it was
an incredible week.

00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:12.291
????

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:18.004
Warren:
The wedding date was kind of interesting,

00:23:18.204 --> 00:23:19.917
because I couldn't see
anything without my glasses,

00:23:20.117 --> 00:23:20.966
and I was
so nervous that I...

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.508
I just decided
to take off my glasses

00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:26.625
and I wouldn't be able to see
all those people out there.

00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:30.917
????

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:35.959
She was 19 when we got
married and I was 21...

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:41.333
but she was so much more mature than I was.
There was no comparison.

00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:48.333
She was a better person
than I was...

00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:51.834
but when you get married,
it's not a question of saying,

00:23:52.034 --> 00:23:54.834
"I'm going to put
a 14% factor in for humor,

00:23:55.034 --> 00:23:57.834
and 17% for intellect,
and 22% for looks."

00:23:58.034 --> 00:24:00.175
It doesn't work that way.

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:03.750
I knew it was the right decision, and...
and it was.

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:14.834
Woman:
You could live anywhere in the world.

00:24:15.034 --> 00:24:16.091
Why do you choose
Omaha, Nebraska?

00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:19.045
Yeah, I love it, and I...
you know, I was...

00:24:19.245 --> 00:24:21.689
born about a mile from here
and, you know,

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:24.333
I've never had a bad
experience in Omaha.

00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:27.792
????

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:39.208
Well, Omaha and Nebraska
are home to me.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.458
Everything about it
seems like home.

00:24:45.625 --> 00:24:49.634
It's a pace,
it's relationships.

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:53.041
There's a lot of continuity.
There's a lot of community.

00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:54.300
There's a lot
of friendship.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.800
It's a very solid place
and friendly place

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.917
in which to grow up in,
in which to conduct a business.

00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:07.442
When I came back
to Omaha in early 1956,

00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:10.417
I had no idea
what I was going to do.

00:25:11.875 --> 00:25:15.000
A few months after I came back,
some members of the family said,

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.312
"What should we do
with our money?"

00:25:16.512 --> 00:25:17.656
And I said, "Well,
I'm not going back

00:25:17.856 --> 00:25:18.800
"in the business
of selling stocks,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.333
but if you would like
to join me in a partnership,"

00:25:21.533 --> 00:25:22.300
I said,
"I'll be glad to do it."

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.959
So within a couple of months
after coming back,

00:25:25.159 --> 00:25:26.625
I set up
the first partnership.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.834
????

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:35.333
I wrote
all the checks individually.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.008
I filed
11 income-tax returns.

00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:40.125
I took delivery on stocks for
all these different companies.

00:25:40.325 --> 00:25:43.542
I...
I was a one-man band there for six years.

00:25:47.208 --> 00:25:50.583
Sandy Gottesman: Warren would sit
upstairs in his little office there,

00:25:50.783 --> 00:25:53.500
and I would bring up
the name of a company,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.800
and most of the time he knew

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.796
much more than I did
about the company.

00:25:56.996 --> 00:25:58.592
He'd know how many shares
were outstanding.

00:25:58.792 --> 00:26:01.166
He'd know the capitalization.
He'd know the earnings.

00:26:01.366 --> 00:26:04.217
It was absolutely incredible.

00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:07.542
I mean when Warren said something,
it meant a heck of a lot,

00:26:07.742 --> 00:26:10.542
and I think all of us paid
a lot of attention to Warren

00:26:10.742 --> 00:26:13.792
when he took a definite
stand on something.

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:19.834
Charlie Munger:
When I first met Warren back in 1959,

00:26:20.034 --> 00:26:21.091
I recognized immediately

00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:24.708
that he was
a very intelligent person.

00:26:24.908 --> 00:26:26.342
For the last four
or five years,

00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:28.650
the stock market
has been booming along

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.959
and presumably
forecasting better business,

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:32.342
which has really
not materialized,

00:26:32.542 --> 00:26:35.083
so maybe the stock market
is really correcting

00:26:35.283 --> 00:26:37.145
a previous incorrect
forecast this time

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:39.008
rather than making
a new correct one.

00:26:39.208 --> 00:26:43.708
He made a lot of money
buying thinly traded securities

00:26:43.908 --> 00:26:47.125
that were incredibly
cheap statistically.

00:26:47.325 --> 00:26:48.667
????

00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:52.166
Loomis:
Warren was, at that time,

00:26:52.366 --> 00:26:53.550
dealing with small companies,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.316
and his investments often were
to buy a company

00:26:57.516 --> 00:27:01.083
that you could figure was
a discarded cigar butt,

00:27:01.283 --> 00:27:02.717
but it had
one more smoke in it,

00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:06.129
and he wanted
to buy at the right time

00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:09.585
to be able to benefit
from the one smoke.

00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:12.841
The first partnership
started with $105,100.

00:27:13.041 --> 00:27:16.816
I put up the 100,
and the other people put up the 105,000.

00:27:17.016 --> 00:27:20.792
And then at the start of 1962,
I moved to Kiewit Plaza.

00:27:20.992 --> 00:27:23.583
And by the time I moved
to Kiewit Plaza,

00:27:23.783 --> 00:27:25.687
we had $7 million invested,

00:27:25.887 --> 00:27:27.792
and a fair amount
was profits.

00:27:27.992 --> 00:27:31.508
????

00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:35.375
I was then renting a house.
I never owned a house to that point.

00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:37.634
And then two years later,

00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:41.333
I bought the house
I live in today in 1958.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.333
We had three children,
Susie and I.

00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:56.425
And we had 'em young,
incidentally,

00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:58.333
which was I think was
a very good thing.

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:00.834
????

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.583
My daughter Susie
was born here.

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.583
I named her Susie just like that,
as soon as I looked at her,

00:28:09.783 --> 00:28:11.166
because she looked
just like her mother,

00:28:11.366 --> 00:28:15.217
????

00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:17.250
And she was a cinch.

00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:24.917
And then Howie was, you know,
this absolute bundle of energy...

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.375
which made things
very difficult

00:28:28.575 --> 00:28:30.542
for big Susie
for a while.

00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:36.542
Peter again reverted back
to Susie's personality,

00:28:36.742 --> 00:28:38.291
and he was an easy child.

00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.542
Howard Buffett: Well,
I would describe my childhood as normal,

00:28:45.742 --> 00:28:47.792
but who knows
what normal is?

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:49.008
People often think,

00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:51.875
"Well, Warren Buffett was
this famous rich guy."

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:53.375
He was not famous,
and he wasn't rich

00:28:53.575 --> 00:28:54.625
when we were growing up.

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:56.342
????

00:28:56.542 --> 00:29:00.258
What I saw first and foremost,

00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:03.342
day in and day out,
was consistency.

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.837
Every day we hear the garage
door close in the house

00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:10.333
and then like clockwork,
my dad would come in the door,

00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:13.708
"I'm home!" and we'd
all eat dinner together,

00:29:13.908 --> 00:29:16.000
which I think surprises
a lot of people.

00:29:18.667 --> 00:29:21.208
Susie Buffett, Jr. : My dad,
he used to rock me to sleep at night

00:29:21.408 --> 00:29:23.550
and sing "Over the Rainbow,"
so I have

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.920
this insanely sentimental
attachment to that song.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.291
I've always had a really close
relationship with him.

00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:33.083
????

00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:37.667
Warren:
I've got three very different kids,

00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:39.646
and they've got
a common heart,

00:29:39.846 --> 00:29:41.625
which they got
from their mother.

00:29:44.208 --> 00:29:45.691
She did most
of the work by far

00:29:45.891 --> 00:29:47.179
of bringing up
the children,

00:29:47.379 --> 00:29:48.467
which is probably
a good thing.

00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:50.875
They have more
of her qualities than mine,

00:29:51.075 --> 00:29:53.333
which I would...
I would recommend.

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:55.800
Howard:
Well, my mom was

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.383
the biggest part
of my life growing up...

00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:01.375
even though I got disciplined
on a regular basis

00:30:01.575 --> 00:30:03.041
and she was usually
the one doing it,

00:30:03.241 --> 00:30:04.800
she was still
my best friend.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.050
She was somebody
who would help anybody,

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.759
I mean,
whether she knew 'em or didn't know 'em

00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:12.542
or maybe even didn't agree with them,
she would still help them.

00:30:14.083 --> 00:30:15.883
Warren:
She was incredibly empathetic,

00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:20.458
and she was interested
in every person individually.

00:30:20.658 --> 00:30:24.375
She never cared about money
or business at all.

00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:25.717
Susie:
I mean he would go around saying,

00:30:25.917 --> 00:30:29.046
"I'm going to be the
richest man in the world."

00:30:29.246 --> 00:30:32.064
And I think, well,
it's like somebody says,

00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:35.386
"I play music,
and I'm gonna be Mozart."

00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:38.708
I don't know.
How does anyone know...

00:30:39.458 --> 00:30:41.425
How does anyone know?
You know?

00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:46.041
So that was okay.
I don't really care about that.

00:30:47.375 --> 00:30:49.542
Loomis:
I would say that Susie led Warren

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.562
toward changing
his political views.

00:30:51.762 --> 00:30:53.383
He grew up
as a young Republican,

00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:56.525
his father was
a Republican congressman,

00:30:56.725 --> 00:30:59.667
but Susie saw things
in different ways.

00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:01.175
She was the catalyst.

00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:04.841
Freedom, freedom, freedom!

00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:07.592
Louder, louder,
louder, louder, louder!

00:31:07.792 --> 00:31:10.525
Freedom, freedom...
What do we want now?

00:31:10.725 --> 00:31:13.458
Susie:
When the children were growing up,

00:31:13.658 --> 00:31:16.217
I was very involved
in civil rights.

00:31:16.417 --> 00:31:21.583
I was immersed in it, and I think
that's what made Warren a Democrat.

00:31:21.783 --> 00:31:25.291
He would go with me
to hear speakers.

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:29.091
Warren: I remember that speech
that Martin Luther King gave.

00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:33.375
That was one of the most inspiring
speeches I... I've ever heard.

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:35.175
I come to say to you
this afternoon...

00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:37.834
Warren: Took me right out of my seat.
My wife was with me.

00:31:38.034 --> 00:31:39.175
We both had
the same experience.

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:42.275
Martin Luther King: It will not be long.
It was interesting, he...

00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:46.575
in that speech, he talked about
truth forever on the scaffold,

00:31:46.775 --> 00:31:50.875
long forever on the throne,
but that scaffold sways the future.

00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:53.250
Well, he was going
to be dead in six months,

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.458
but that scaffold
did sway the future.

00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:59.191
My wife was
more active than I was,

00:31:59.391 --> 00:32:01.091
but I was 100%
with her mentally.

00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:04.754
I was just working a little
more on my own investments.

00:32:04.954 --> 00:32:08.417
But it didn't make a difference
what we were gonna do

00:32:08.617 --> 00:32:09.800
with the money
after we made it.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.717
I thought I would pile
it up over the years

00:32:11.917 --> 00:32:16.041
then she would unpile it
in terms of running a...

00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.925
one very large foundation.

00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:21.254
And I was particularly good
at compounding money,

00:32:21.454 --> 00:32:24.583
and therefore society
would benefit by waiting.

00:32:24.783 --> 00:32:26.750
????

00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:31.717
I was genetically blessed
with certain wiring

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.667
that's very useful in a
highly-developed market system

00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:36.467
where there's lots
of chips on the table,

00:32:36.667 --> 00:32:39.583
and you know, I happen
to be good at that game.

00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:43.917
Ted Williams wrote a book
called "The Science of Hitting,"

00:32:44.117 --> 00:32:46.467
and in it he had a picture
of himself at bat

00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:51.667
and the strike zone broken
into, I think, 77 squares.

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:53.425
And he said,
if he waited for the pitch

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:56.300
that was really in his sweet spot,
he would bat .400

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.291
and if he had to swing at
something on the lower corner,

00:32:59.491 --> 00:33:01.675
he would
probably bat .235.

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:05.083
And in investing,
I'm in a no-called strike business,

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.133
which is the best business
you can be in.

00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:09.008
I can look at a thousand
different companies,

00:33:09.208 --> 00:33:13.250
and I don't have to be right on every
one of them or even 50 of 'em...

00:33:14.583 --> 00:33:16.500
so I can pick the ball
I want to hit.

00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:23.333
And the trick in investing is just to sit
there and watch pitch after pitch to go by

00:33:23.533 --> 00:33:25.008
and wait for the one
right in your sweet spot.

00:33:25.208 --> 00:33:28.000
And the people that are yelling,
"Swing, you bum"? Ignore 'em.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.542
There's a temptation
for people to act

00:33:32.742 --> 00:33:33.925
far too frequently in stocks,

00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:36.508
simply because
they're so liquid.

00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:39.175
Over the years
you develop a lot of filters,

00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:42.417
and I do know what I call
my circle of competence,

00:33:42.617 --> 00:33:44.550
so I-I... I stay
within that circle,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.583
and I don't worry about things
that are outside that circle.

00:33:48.783 --> 00:33:50.383
Defining what your game is,

00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:54.417
where you're going to have an
edge is enormously important.

00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:02.175
????

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:05.417
I bought the first shares
of Berkshire in 1962,

00:34:05.617 --> 00:34:07.396
and it was
a northern textile business

00:34:07.596 --> 00:34:09.175
destined to become
extinct eventually,

00:34:09.375 --> 00:34:14.250
and it was a statistically cheap
stock in a terrible business.

00:34:15.625 --> 00:34:18.091
Berkshire Hathaway
was closing mills

00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:21.792
and as they closed mills,
it would free up some capital,

00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:23.792
and then they would
repurchase shares,

00:34:23.992 --> 00:34:25.592
so I bought
some stock with the idea

00:34:25.792 --> 00:34:28.458
that there would be another
tender offer at some point,

00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:31.708
and we would sell the stock
at a modest profit.

00:34:31.908 --> 00:34:33.883
And at one point,

00:34:34.083 --> 00:34:37.333
the management asked me at what
price we would tender our stock,

00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:39.166
and I said, "$11.50."

00:34:39.366 --> 00:34:41.800
????

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.834
And the tender offer
came out a few months later,

00:34:45.034 --> 00:34:49.175
and it was
at $11 and 3/8ths,

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.500
which was an eighth
of a point cheaper.

00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:53.634
And that made me very mad,

00:34:53.834 --> 00:34:56.634
so I just started
buying more stock.

00:34:56.834 --> 00:35:00.458
I just felt that I'd been
double-crossed by the management.

00:35:00.658 --> 00:35:02.966
And in May of 1965,

00:35:03.166 --> 00:35:05.667
I bought enough so we
controlled the company,

00:35:05.867 --> 00:35:07.583
and we changed
the management.

00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:17.066
It was a pretty silly way
to behave,

00:35:17.266 --> 00:35:19.491
as Warren has recounted
in retrospect.

00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:22.079
One of the reasons
Warren is successful

00:35:22.279 --> 00:35:24.467
is he's brutal
in appraising his own past.

00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:29.458
He wants to identify misthinkings
and avoid them in the future,

00:35:29.658 --> 00:35:32.562
but it was an accident that
he chose Berkshire Hathaway.

00:35:32.762 --> 00:35:35.467
If the chairman hadn't tried
to cheat him out of an eighth,

00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:39.667
there wouldn't have been any
Buffett- Berkshire Hathaway history.

00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:45.458
Warren: If you're emotional about investment,
you're not going to do well.

00:35:45.658 --> 00:35:47.958
You may have all these
feelings about the stock.

00:35:48.158 --> 00:35:50.258
The stock has
no feelings about you.

00:35:50.458 --> 00:35:52.258
Looking back, it's interesting,
that tender offer...

00:35:52.458 --> 00:35:56.834
I didn't realize it, but it... it happened
about five days after my dad had died

00:35:57.034 --> 00:35:59.875
and whether that had affected me or not,
I don't know.

00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:02.333
????

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.208
Kunhardt: Do you remember your last
conversation with your father?

00:36:07.408 --> 00:36:09.583
Yeah, but I don't want
to talk about it.

00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:19.708
Munger:
I think it just sobered him and hurt him,

00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:22.083
but...

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.917
Warren soldiers on.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.133
Both Warren and I
could look at our fathers

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:35.258
and see what they did right
and what they did wrong.

00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:40.375
Warren's father was a real
old-fashioned right-wing ideologue.

00:36:41.375 --> 00:36:43.508
And his father was
so intense about it,

00:36:43.708 --> 00:36:46.883
that Warren just decided
that it was mistake...

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:50.150
it cabbaged up your head
to be that much an ideologue,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.417
so he loved his father,
but he didn't want to become

00:36:53.617 --> 00:36:56.792
that much of a true believer in...
in anything.

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:04.542
My politics became more overt
after my dad died.

00:37:04.742 --> 00:37:06.258
????

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:08.467
Civil rights
changed my views.

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:11.050
You know, in 1776
Thomas Jefferson wrote,

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.125
"All men are created equal,"
and then when they wrote the Constitution,

00:37:14.325 --> 00:37:15.841
they all of a sudden
decided that, no,

00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:18.125
it was just 3/5ths of a person
if you were black.

00:37:18.325 --> 00:37:19.583
I mean, that struck me
as kind of crazy.

00:37:19.783 --> 00:37:22.050
????

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.000
Susie: I was talking to him one
day about some racial issue,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.583
and he said to me,
"Wait till women discover

00:37:30.783 --> 00:37:33.083
they're the slaves
of the world."

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:38.166
Now how many men
were cognizant of that,

00:37:38.366 --> 00:37:40.083
and even women then?

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:44.750
Warren:
The initial example is really my mother.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.550
She came from a generation

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.879
where the main function
of the wife

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:51.008
was to help
her husband in the job.

00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:54.587
And my sisters are
fully as smart as I am.

00:37:54.787 --> 00:37:57.966
They got better personalities
than I had,

00:37:58.166 --> 00:38:00.667
but they got the message
a million different ways

00:38:00.867 --> 00:38:02.966
that their future
was limited,

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:05.592
and I got the message
that the sky is the limit

00:38:05.792 --> 00:38:09.375
and it wasn't due to a lack of
love or anything of the sort.

00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:11.125
It just...
it was the culture.

00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.175
On the other hand,
you can look

00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.275
at the flip side of that
and say it's quite encouraging,

00:38:16.475 --> 00:38:18.375
because if you look at what
this country accomplished

00:38:18.575 --> 00:38:19.800
only using half of its talent,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.592
just think of the potential
for the future.

00:38:21.792 --> 00:38:24.166
I'm enormously bullish
on America over the future

00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:26.187
and part of the reason
is that we,

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:28.008
by some rather
stupid decisions,

00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:30.834
essentially put half our
talent on the sidelines.

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:36.291
Loomis: Warren is probably the most
rational person I've ever met.

00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:39.792
Charlie Munger
would be a close rival.

00:38:39.992 --> 00:38:41.508
And Charlie became a man

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:44.899
that Warren
depended on heavily

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:47.908
and I think his first
experiences

00:38:48.108 --> 00:38:50.717
in the discarded-
cigar-butt era

00:38:50.917 --> 00:38:55.708
convinced him that it was not
exactly where he wanted to be.

00:38:55.908 --> 00:38:57.999
Munger:
He made so much money for so long

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:00.353
doing what he'd been taught
by Ben Graham,

00:39:00.553 --> 00:39:02.508
which he'd buy
these very cheap stocks.

00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:04.583
If they were cheap enough,
he didn't care it was

00:39:04.783 --> 00:39:06.091
a lousy company
and a lousy management.

00:39:06.291 --> 00:39:10.917
He knew he was going to make money anyway,
just because of the cheapness.

00:39:11.117 --> 00:39:13.217
Warren:
Charlie Munger has had a big impact on me

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:18.583
in moving me toward looking for
wonderful companies at fair prices

00:39:18.783 --> 00:39:21.050
rather than fair companies
at wonderful prices.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.542
That was enormously important, because it
enabled Berkshire to scale up in a way

00:39:25.742 --> 00:39:28.708
that would have been
impossible to do otherwise.

00:39:29.792 --> 00:39:32.258
Yep?
Man: What are the key indicators

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:35.925
you'd look for within companies
before making an investment?

00:39:36.125 --> 00:39:39.083
Well, I look for something that
does give them a moat around it.

00:39:39.283 --> 00:39:42.050
????

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:45.125
We have a company called See's
Candies out on the west coast.

00:39:45.325 --> 00:39:47.841
See's Candies
Boxed Chocolates.

00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:51.879
If you give a box of See's
chocolates to your girlfriend

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:54.773
on the first date
and she kisses you?

00:39:54.973 --> 00:39:56.990
We own you.
You know? I mean we...

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.724
we can raise
the price tomorrow.

00:39:58.924 --> 00:40:00.258
I mean,
you'll buy the same box.

00:40:00.458 --> 00:40:02.083
You're not gonna
fool around with success,

00:40:02.283 --> 00:40:04.800
so the key there
is the response.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.208
You do not want to get home
on Valentine's Day

00:40:08.408 --> 00:40:10.291
and say to your wife
or your sweetheart...

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:12.634
preferably they're
the same person...

00:40:12.834 --> 00:40:15.667
you don't say, "Here, honey,
I took the low bid."

00:40:15.867 --> 00:40:16.966
It doesn't work.

00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:20.083
Price is...
to a degree, is immaterial.

00:40:20.283 --> 00:40:22.258
If you've got
an economic castle,

00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:25.250
people are gonna come and wanna
take that castle away from you.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.800
You better have
a strong moat.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.750
You better have a knight in the
castle that knows what he's doing.

00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:32.508
You're not buying an asset,

00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:35.000
you're buying a name,
you're buying a brand,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.675
you're buying
a real franchise here,

00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:42.834
and Charlie was more responsible
for that than anybody.

00:40:43.034 --> 00:40:45.342
????

00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:47.504
Warren:
We were mental partners

00:40:47.704 --> 00:40:49.467
right from the moment we met.

00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:51.837
Woman: I wanna know,
going back 50 years,

00:40:52.037 --> 00:40:54.208
what it was like
when you first met Warren.

00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:55.875
Well, I thought
he was a prodigy...

00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:58.217
and I got a lot
of criticism.

00:40:58.417 --> 00:41:01.792
My wife said,
"Why are you paying such enormous respect

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:04.750
"to that young man
with a crew cut

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.062
who won't eat vegetables?"

00:41:07.262 --> 00:41:09.175
Warren:
He's ungodly smart.

00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:12.375
He's got a much broader
intellect than I do,

00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:14.800
and he's magnificent
at being able

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.358
to condense important ideas
into just a very few words.

00:41:19.558 --> 00:41:23.917
If you're not interested
in the economic scene right now,

00:41:24.117 --> 00:41:25.583
you're mentally dead.

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:27.050
Charlie has no tact.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.796
Woman: All right,
let's talk a little bit about bankers.

00:41:29.996 --> 00:41:32.542
Charlie, on Friday,
compared them to heroin addicts.

00:41:32.742 --> 00:41:34.437
Yeah, well,
that's colorful Charlie,

00:41:34.637 --> 00:41:36.333
but I would not
have chosen that.

00:41:36.533 --> 00:41:38.091
Loomis:
I once wrote of him

00:41:38.291 --> 00:41:39.917
that when
they handed out humility,

00:41:40.117 --> 00:41:41.675
he didn't get
his fair share.

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:46.125
The ideal way to run a
headquarters is to have one man,

00:41:46.325 --> 00:41:48.175
preferably over 80,

00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:51.296
sitting in an office
by himself.

00:41:51.496 --> 00:41:54.217
Anything else
is pure frippery.

00:41:54.417 --> 00:41:56.583
Warren:
He's always honest in what he tells me,

00:41:56.783 --> 00:41:58.417
so I... I listen to him.

00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:02.250
Munger:
We never had an argument.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.542
We just...

00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:09.217
We just kinda
roll with it easily.

00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:13.442
Suppose Warren doesn't wanna do
something that I would've done,

00:42:13.642 --> 00:42:17.667
and suppose that happens four
times over 40 years or something.

00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:19.959
What the hell difference
does it make to me?

00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:21.383
????

00:42:21.583 --> 00:42:23.917
Net, the record is
working out is fine.

00:42:28.458 --> 00:42:33.125
Both of us know that we've
done better by having ethics.

00:42:33.325 --> 00:42:34.425
Warren's not interested

00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:36.458
in making money
by cheating people.

00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:40.550
Loomis:
Warren's opinions

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.133
of Wall Street
investment bankers

00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:46.566
would not endear him
to their mothers.

00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:50.000
He feels that they're,
for the most part,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.675
not out for their clients.

00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:55.125
They're out for their own
business interests.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.667
Warren: In the late 1960s,
there were just a flood

00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:02.883
of accounting
shenanigans and mergers

00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:06.834
built upon false accounting
and misleading people.

00:43:07.034 --> 00:43:09.792
It was a time
when a lot of charlatans

00:43:09.992 --> 00:43:11.467
were prevailing in Wall Street

00:43:11.667 --> 00:43:13.650
and were being applauded
by Wall Street.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.834
I understood what
the game was about,

00:43:16.034 --> 00:43:17.091
but I didn't want
to play in it,

00:43:17.291 --> 00:43:21.133
so I closed down the
partnership at the end of 1969,

00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:25.166
and I took on the title of
Chairman for Berkshire Hathaway.

00:43:25.366 --> 00:43:28.091
????

00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:30.254
Munger: Well, I think
the modern Berkshire

00:43:30.454 --> 00:43:32.417
is pretty much
all a reflection of Warren.

00:43:32.617 --> 00:43:34.841
????

00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:38.920
I have constructed
a business that fits me.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.800
It's kind of crazy
to spend your life painting

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.917
if you're painting a subject
you don't want to look at.

00:43:45.117 --> 00:43:48.208
I've gotten to paint
my own painting in business

00:43:48.408 --> 00:43:50.708
on an unlimited
canvas in a way.

00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.291
It's a different
sort of place.

00:43:55.875 --> 00:43:57.175
I work with a great
group of people

00:43:57.375 --> 00:44:00.834
that make my life very easy
and that take good care of me.

00:44:01.034 --> 00:44:03.000
Come. Okay.

00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:06.383
We have 25 people
in the office,

00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:12.208
and if you go back, it's the exact same 25,
the exact same ones.

00:44:13.542 --> 00:44:15.504
We don't have any
committees at Berkshire.

00:44:15.704 --> 00:44:17.467
We don't have
a public relations department.

00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:20.125
We don't have investor relations.
We don't have a general council.

00:44:20.325 --> 00:44:21.800
We don't have
a human relations department.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.250
We just don't go for anything that
people do just as a matter of form.

00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:29.250
It's exactly the life I like,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.800
and it's not work to me.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.166
It's just a form
of play, basically.

00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:45.383
Oh, I...
I like things quiet.

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:47.050
I shut the door,
actually, at the office,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.400
'cause I don't want to hear
anybody talking outside.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.750
Woman on TV:
Broad distinctions between his views

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.479
and the belt-tightening
proposals.

00:44:53.679 --> 00:44:55.114
Warren:
And I still probably spend

00:44:55.314 --> 00:44:56.550
five or six hours
a day reading.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.417
Woman on TV:
...look at what's trending today.

00:44:58.617 --> 00:44:59.634
Our quick round-up...

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:02.125
Howard: Well,
what's amazing is the stuff he remembers.

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:05.091
It's like a little computer,
you know?

00:45:05.291 --> 00:45:08.417
I keep thinking the hard drive will
run out of space, but it doesn't.

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:13.000
Melinda Gates:
He's one of the smartest people we know.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.917
So I was at a couple
of the family dinners

00:45:15.117 --> 00:45:16.646
at the Gates house
where Mary, Bill's mom,

00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.375
was trying to convince him
to come out

00:45:18.575 --> 00:45:20.133
to the family place
at Hood Canal

00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:22.295
to meet Warren Buffett,
and he was resisting

00:45:22.495 --> 00:45:24.258
because he was
really busy with Microsoft.

00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:27.959
And finally he said, "Mom,
okay, I'll come for lunch."

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:29.717
????

00:45:29.917 --> 00:45:31.959
Bill Gates:
So the two of us flew out there

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:33.550
somewhat reluctantly,
'cause you know,

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.300
buying and selling stocks...
which is how I thought of Warren...

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.792
wasn't of particular interest to me
and didn't seem like value added.

00:45:40.992 --> 00:45:42.883
It turned out
that was completely wrong.

00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:46.316
We knew that day that
we'd be very close friends.

00:45:46.516 --> 00:45:49.750
In fact, we just couldn't
get enough of each other.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.008
????

00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:52.759
Warren:
Shortly after I met Bill Gates,

00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:55.983
Bill's dad asked each of us to
write down on a piece of paper

00:45:56.183 --> 00:45:59.208
one word that would best describe
what had helped us the most.

00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:01.834
Bill and I, without any
collaboration at all,

00:46:02.034 --> 00:46:03.333
each wrote the word "focus."

00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:05.133
????

00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:08.733
Well, focus has always been a
strong part of my personality.

00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:12.133
If I get interested in something,
I get really interested.

00:46:12.333 --> 00:46:14.883
If I get interested in a new subject,
I want to read about it,

00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:18.500
I want to talk about it, and I want to
meet people that are involved in it.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.050
Bill:
We both love to work hard.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.545
You know, neither of us
like frivolous things.

00:46:24.745 --> 00:46:28.126
You know he doesn't know
much about cooking,

00:46:28.326 --> 00:46:31.508
or art, or...
a huge range of things.

00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:36.000
I can't tell you the color of the
walls in my bedroom or my living room.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.300
We're on a satellite phone.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.208
I don't have a mind that relates
to the physical universe well.

00:46:40.408 --> 00:46:41.675
Man:
Warren checking the DOW.

00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:45.792
But the business universe I...
I think I understand reasonably well.

00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.625
Warren's ability to size
up people and businesses,

00:46:50.825 --> 00:46:52.717
it's a pretty magical thing.

00:46:52.917 --> 00:46:55.508
He is the best at that,
anybody we know.

00:46:55.708 --> 00:46:59.542
We... we should all try to be
20% as... as good at that.

00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:05.217
Warren:
I like to sit and think,

00:47:05.417 --> 00:47:07.717
and I spend
a lot of time doing that.

00:47:07.917 --> 00:47:10.542
And sometimes it's
pretty unproductive but...

00:47:10.742 --> 00:47:14.917
but I find it enjoyable
to think about...

00:47:15.117 --> 00:47:16.417
particularly about...
about business

00:47:16.617 --> 00:47:17.717
or investment problems.
They're easy.

00:47:17.917 --> 00:47:19.717
It's the human problems
that are the tough ones.

00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:22.358
Sometimes there aren't any good
answers with human problems.

00:47:22.558 --> 00:47:25.000
There's... there's almost always
a good answer with money.

00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:35.250
????

00:47:38.458 --> 00:47:40.583
Susie:
He was sort of a genius.

00:47:41.667 --> 00:47:44.879
I think sometimes
geniuses are,

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:48.291
by default,
lonely and isolated.

00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:55.083
He was not
really well adjusted.

00:47:55.283 --> 00:47:57.717
He was just this funny...

00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:02.083
I mean,
humorous guy who maybe had a moat around him,

00:48:02.283 --> 00:48:06.834
because he was afraid
and he didn't know anyone

00:48:07.034 --> 00:48:09.250
that he wanted to let in.

00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:15.959
And to this day,
I mean, I don't know...

00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:19.091
Well, nobody
knows him like I do,

00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:22.959
and probably any wife
would say that, but...

00:48:23.159 --> 00:48:25.708
????

00:48:27.959 --> 00:48:30.425
Howard:
He's a loner in a sense.

00:48:30.625 --> 00:48:33.425
And it's difficult to connect
on an emotional level,

00:48:33.625 --> 00:48:38.667
because I think that that's not
his basic mode of operation.

00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:43.925
He was there... physically,

00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:47.917
but he was upstairs
reading all the time.

00:48:50.166 --> 00:48:53.717
I always told my mother
we have to talk in sound bytes.

00:48:53.917 --> 00:48:58.175
I learned that early on,
that if you start going into some long thing,

00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:01.500
unless you've explained to him ahead of
time that it's going to be a long thing

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.667
and you need him to hang in there,
you lose him.

00:49:05.867 --> 00:49:07.959
You lose him
to whatever giant thought

00:49:08.159 --> 00:49:09.508
he has in his head at the time

00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:12.583
that he was probably thinking
about before you came in

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.500
and really wants
to get back to.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.375
????

00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:20.841
Peter:
He's not like the rest of us.

00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:24.333
I don't think my dad ever
took anybody for granted,

00:49:24.533 --> 00:49:26.800
but you are
a little bit blind, I think,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.375
sometimes to what other people
might be doing behind the scenes,

00:49:30.575 --> 00:49:33.250
and my dad's gotten
a little bit of a pass.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.634
????

00:49:35.834 --> 00:49:38.291
Susie:
Warren can't find the light switch,

00:49:38.491 --> 00:49:40.175
and it's probably my fault.

00:49:40.375 --> 00:49:44.041
One time, years ago
when the kids were little,

00:49:44.241 --> 00:49:46.050
I was feeling really sick.
I had the flu,

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.091
so I lay down on the bed,
and I said to Warren,

00:49:48.291 --> 00:49:51.542
"Will you get me a pan?
Or something from the kitchen.

00:49:51.742 --> 00:49:54.592
I may not get to the bathroom.
I feel so sick."

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:58.792
He said, "Okay."
So he trottles down to the kitchen,

00:49:58.992 --> 00:50:02.383
and I hear this bang,
bip, boom, bang!

00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:06.383
And he comes up,
and he brings me a colander.

00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:10.917
I looked at it, and I said, "Look,
honey, this has holes in it."

00:50:11.117 --> 00:50:13.979
"Oh, oh, okay."
So he ran down,

00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:16.841
all this banging
and everything.

00:50:17.041 --> 00:50:21.708
And he comes up and he puts the
colander on a cookie sheet.

00:50:26.417 --> 00:50:31.291
Physical proximity to Warren doesn't
always mean that he's there with you.

00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.050
????

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.792
He's so cerebral, you see?

00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:42.750
That's why I learned
to have my own life.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.342
We were
two parallel lines and...

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:49.875
but very connected when
he was open to connecting.

00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:55.458
Susie Jr.: I did make a joke at one point.
I said, you know,

00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:57.500
we could make
a tape of Mom yelling,

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.342
"Bye, Warren,
I'll be back later!"

00:50:59.542 --> 00:51:03.959
And then have the door slam,
and he would just think she was here.

00:51:04.159 --> 00:51:06.625
I don't think he knew what she
was doing most of the time.

00:51:06.825 --> 00:51:09.258
????

00:51:09.458 --> 00:51:10.925
Once Howie and I
were both gone,

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:15.208
as we've gotten older, she started
to see the writing on the wall here

00:51:15.408 --> 00:51:17.437
and just started
trying to figure out

00:51:17.637 --> 00:51:19.760
how she could
at least have some more,

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.083
as she called it,
a room of her own.

00:51:22.283 --> 00:51:26.583
????

00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:31.091
Warren:
The worst mistakes involve

00:51:31.291 --> 00:51:34.667
not understanding other people
as well as you might.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.508
Well, she left Omaha in 1977,

00:51:47.708 --> 00:51:51.333
and there really isn't much
to say about that.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.342
It was devastating for him,
and I came home,

00:52:04.542 --> 00:52:09.542
because I-I... I can't say
I was mad at her exactly,

00:52:09.742 --> 00:52:12.383
but I kept thinking,
"How can you leave him?

00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:17.175
He's so...
he can't function by himself."

00:52:17.375 --> 00:52:21.567
So my mother...
she'd asked a bunch of her friends

00:52:21.767 --> 00:52:25.959
to sort of look in on him,
and Astrid was one of them.

00:52:26.159 --> 00:52:28.375
Susie: So I called Astrid.
I said, "Astrid,

00:52:28.575 --> 00:52:30.792
"will you take Warren...
make him some soup?

00:52:30.992 --> 00:52:33.187
"Go over there
and look after him,

00:52:33.387 --> 00:52:35.383
because he's not
gonna make it."

00:52:35.583 --> 00:52:39.917
And it took him a while to figure it out,
but he figured it out.

00:52:40.117 --> 00:52:41.841
I said, "I'm not leaving you,

00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:45.667
because I'll be wherever you
want me when you want me."

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.634
Howard:
My mom moved to San Francisco,

00:52:49.834 --> 00:52:53.462
and I think one of the reasons it
was important for her to leave Omaha

00:52:53.662 --> 00:52:57.291
was because she just felt like she was
kinda trapped in this environment,

00:52:57.491 --> 00:52:59.467
that everybody knew
who she was,

00:52:59.667 --> 00:53:03.217
that she couldn't have
her own identity.

00:53:03.417 --> 00:53:05.883
Peter: He knew that there was
something she needed to do

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:11.667
and that she really recognized
that the money gave us all and her

00:53:11.867 --> 00:53:15.542
a choice in a lot of ways that
a lot of people didn't have.

00:53:15.742 --> 00:53:19.217
Munger: There was a time
Warren was getting criticized.

00:53:19.417 --> 00:53:23.375
Here was this very, very rich man
who was getting richer every year,

00:53:23.575 --> 00:53:26.125
and really wasn't giving
a lot of money away,

00:53:26.325 --> 00:53:28.875
and there was terrific
criticism by some people,

00:53:29.075 --> 00:53:31.208
which Warren never said
anything about.

00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:34.425
Warren:
The biggest thing in making money is time.

00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:39.166
You don't have to be particularly smart,
you just have to be patient.

00:53:39.366 --> 00:53:41.091
Susie didn't want
to wait as much as I did,

00:53:41.291 --> 00:53:45.542
but she never quite appreciated
compounding like I did.

00:53:45.742 --> 00:53:48.250
Susie:
That is a disagreement we have.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.675
I run a foundation now.

00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:54.000
I think we should be
giving more money away,

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.000
but I understand
why we don't...

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.717
because it's... business.

00:53:59.917 --> 00:54:04.500
To me the crux of it is,
that it wasn't the money itself.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.312
You can see that
in the way he lives.

00:54:07.512 --> 00:54:09.925
I mean, he doesn't buy
huge paintings

00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:12.425
or build big houses
or anything like that.

00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:17.500
It's all mental with him,
and the money is his scorecard.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.008
????

00:54:19.208 --> 00:54:21.342
And he used to say to me,

00:54:21.542 --> 00:54:24.166
"Everybody can read
what I read.

00:54:24.366 --> 00:54:26.217
It's a level playing field."

00:54:26.417 --> 00:54:28.800
And he loves that,
because he's competitive.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.545
And he's sitting there
all by himself in his office,

00:54:32.745 --> 00:54:36.314
reading these things
that everybody else can read,

00:54:36.514 --> 00:54:40.083
but he loves the idea
that he's gonna win. Ha!

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.333
Munger:
I'll tell you how you do it.

00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:48.041
Have you ever seen a juggler

00:54:48.241 --> 00:54:50.300
juggle 25 milk bottles?

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.800
How did
he ever get to do that?

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.041
The answer is he started with one bottle,
then two, then three

00:54:56.241 --> 00:54:58.875
and just kept doing it,
and pretty soon he was at 25,

00:54:59.075 --> 00:55:00.966
and that's the way we did it.

00:55:01.166 --> 00:55:03.754
So, basically,
we started out with cash

00:55:03.954 --> 00:55:06.542
and ended up buying
a bunch of businesses,

00:55:06.742 --> 00:55:08.258
including insurance companies.

00:55:08.458 --> 00:55:13.125
Loomis: Insurance is, in itself,
a profitable business,

00:55:13.325 --> 00:55:15.592
but it has
the additional advantage

00:55:15.792 --> 00:55:18.962
of creating something
that's called "float."

00:55:19.162 --> 00:55:22.333
Float is the money
that hangs around Berkshire

00:55:22.533 --> 00:55:24.634
while a claim is waiting
to be paid.

00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:29.458
And Warren turned out
to have a extraordinary ability

00:55:29.658 --> 00:55:32.008
to use the money
thrown off by the float

00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:36.166
to buy companies that fed
the growth of Berkshire.

00:55:38.917 --> 00:55:42.291
Man: In 1983,
Mrs. B cashed in on her business

00:55:42.491 --> 00:55:45.383
by selling control
for $55 million

00:55:45.583 --> 00:55:48.250
to a company owned
by investor Warren Buffett.

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.708
????

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:58.500
Loomis:
Warren was quite an expert about newspapers.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.375
He got interested
in the "Post,"

00:56:00.575 --> 00:56:01.592
because he recognized it

00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:04.917
as a greatly
undervalued company.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.717
Kay Graham:
He had to write me a letter.

00:56:07.917 --> 00:56:11.041
"Dear Ms. Graham,
I've just bought 5% of your company,

00:56:11.241 --> 00:56:12.592
"and I mean you no harm,

00:56:12.792 --> 00:56:14.425
"and I think
it's a great company.

00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:16.750
"I know it's Graham owned
and Graham run,

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.050
and that's fine with me."

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:22.634
And I thought, "Whoa,
this guy's really terrific."

00:56:22.834 --> 00:56:27.041
He used to come to board meetings
with about 20 annual reports

00:56:27.241 --> 00:56:29.342
and he would take me
through these annual reports.

00:56:29.542 --> 00:56:33.358
It was like going to business
school with Warren Buffett.

00:56:33.558 --> 00:56:37.158
Kay Graham did introduce Warren
to the world of Washington,

00:56:37.358 --> 00:56:40.959
entirely different group than
he had ever dealt with before.

00:56:42.625 --> 00:56:45.841
Peter:
It was clear that working with Kay

00:56:46.041 --> 00:56:50.375
gave him a different kind of confidence,
and he was the star.

00:56:51.917 --> 00:56:53.192
Woman:
Everyone wants to hear

00:56:53.392 --> 00:56:54.667
what Warren Buffett
has to say.

00:56:54.867 --> 00:56:56.217
Man:
The Oracle of Omaha

00:56:56.417 --> 00:56:59.458
building his image
and having some fun.

00:56:59.658 --> 00:57:01.467
????

00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:03.166
Man 2:
Berkshire shares have increased

00:57:03.366 --> 00:57:05.008
more than
2,000% in value.

00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:08.083
Man 3: One of the largest market
capitalizations in the world,

00:57:08.283 --> 00:57:09.467
and it could grow
a lot larger

00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:12.625
since Warren Buffett shows
no sign of slowing down.

00:57:12.825 --> 00:57:14.091
Woman 2:
So how did he do it?

00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.004
By investing in what he
knows and understands...

00:57:17.204 --> 00:57:19.917
good old-fashioned American
brands like Coca-Cola,

00:57:20.117 --> 00:57:21.675
Fruit of the Loom,
and Dairy Queen.

00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:24.342
What inspired you?
This inspired me!

00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:26.792
Buy what you like, is that what it is?
Yeah absolutely.

00:57:26.992 --> 00:57:29.217
????

00:57:29.417 --> 00:57:32.525
Today, the Coca-Cola
Company will sell

00:57:32.725 --> 00:57:35.634
almost two billion
eight-ounce servings

00:57:35.834 --> 00:57:38.091
of one form or another
of Coca Cola products.

00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:42.041
Now if you get an extra penny a day,
a penny a serving,

00:57:42.241 --> 00:57:43.258
that's $20 million a day,

00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:47.504
that's $7.3 billion a year
from one penny more.

00:57:47.704 --> 00:57:51.523
When you own Coca Cola,
you own a little piece

00:57:51.723 --> 00:57:55.542
of the minds of billions
and billions of people.

00:57:57.041 --> 00:57:58.733
That is really good.

00:57:58.933 --> 00:58:00.425
????

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.733
Man:
Who's got the most $100 bills these days?

00:58:02.933 --> 00:58:05.346
Well,
his name is Warren Buffett in this country,

00:58:05.546 --> 00:58:07.959
and he has just displaced
his friend Bill Gates

00:58:08.159 --> 00:58:10.959
as the richest businessman
in the world.

00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:20.458
And the purpose of Wednesday's
meeting was to discuss

00:58:20.658 --> 00:58:22.520
Buffett's company,
Berkshire Hathaway's plan

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.383
to purchase railroad giant
Burlington Northern,

00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:29.417
valued at $26 billion. This would be
Buffett's largest acquisition ever.

00:58:33.417 --> 00:58:36.046
Munger: He's created Berkshire
from virtually nothing

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:38.875
into hundreds of billions
of dollars of market cap.

00:58:39.075 --> 00:58:42.217
Nobody else has
a record like that.

00:58:42.417 --> 00:58:45.550
Gottesman:
He wanted to have an outstanding reputation

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:50.000
that he'd never really upset the
apple cart when he bought a business,

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.917
that he kept
the management in place.

00:58:53.458 --> 00:58:56.125
He was establishing
a reputation

00:58:56.325 --> 00:58:59.175
that paid off later in life.

00:58:59.375 --> 00:59:02.542
It's been building and building
ever since I've known him.

00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:06.834
Warren:
It takes 20 years to build a reputation,

00:59:07.034 --> 00:59:08.959
then it takes
five minutes to lose it.

00:59:09.159 --> 00:59:11.708
????

00:59:12.917 --> 00:59:15.900
Loomis:
When Warren made his investment in Salomon,

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:19.083
I was one of the people,
along with many, many others,

00:59:19.283 --> 00:59:21.467
who were quite amazed,
because he had taken

00:59:21.667 --> 00:59:27.208
a very critical tone in talking about
investment bankers and about their greed.

00:59:27.408 --> 00:59:30.133
And here he was
investing in one,

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:34.375
Salomon Brothers,
that was known to be a member of the club.

00:59:36.792 --> 00:59:40.046
Gottesman:
Warren and Charlie were on the board,

00:59:40.246 --> 00:59:43.500
and Charlie couldn't stand
what was going on there

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.800
and didn't like
the culture at all.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.166
And shortly after they got involved,
the thing exploded.

00:59:59.875 --> 01:00:03.634
Warren:
In 1991 on a terrible day in August,

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:08.834
I got a call,
and the two top officers of Salomon

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:11.208
were on the other end,
and they said that...

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:13.834
that... "We have problem."

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.879
Announcer:
This is "NBC Nightly News."

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:20.759
Good evening.
It is the kind of scandal

01:00:20.959 --> 01:00:23.008
that rocks Wall Street
and raises questions,

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:26.008
questions about the integrity
of our financial institutions.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:30.291
Man: The giant securities firm of
Salomon Brothers under investigation

01:00:30.491 --> 01:00:32.375
for improper trading
of treasury bonds.

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.708
Man 2:
Salomon admitted it exceeded the limit

01:00:35.908 --> 01:00:37.300
of trading
in government bonds,

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.041
once by buying bonds
in the name of a customer

01:00:40.241 --> 01:00:41.675
who didn't even know
about the deal.

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:45.500
Salomon Brothers is under investigation
by the Treasury Department,

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.834
the Federal Reserve, the SEC,
and the Justice Department.

01:00:49.034 --> 01:00:51.917
But more important than
the fate of the firm itself

01:00:52.117 --> 01:00:54.104
is the impact
their actions could have

01:00:54.304 --> 01:00:56.291
on the public trust
and on the credibility

01:00:56.491 --> 01:00:58.291
of the American
market worldwide.

01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:00.175
????

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:03.175
Warren:
The company owed $150 billion.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.041
It owed more money
than any other private company

01:01:06.241 --> 01:01:07.717
in the United States
at the time.

01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:13.041
And that night I met with the man that
ran the Federal Reserve of New York,

01:01:13.241 --> 01:01:15.958
who was the sheriff
in effect, and I said, you know,

01:01:16.158 --> 01:01:18.354
"I've never really owed
very much money before."

01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:20.750
I said,
"I've got a little mortgage on a house,

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:23.634
but 150 billion is
a little staggering."

01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:26.000
And I was hoping he would say,
"Well, don't worry, Warren.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.883
We'll give you
a few weeks to breathe."

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:32.417
And he... he said to me,
"Prepare for any eventuality."

01:01:32.617 --> 01:01:35.166
????

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:41.542
Woman: Earlier today,
the US Treasury Department

01:01:41.742 --> 01:01:43.550
announced it had suspended
Salomon Brothers

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.125
from participating
in the auction of new issues.

01:01:46.325 --> 01:01:47.759
Man:
It was one more jolt

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:50.125
for a scandal-scarred
Wall Street.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.258
Loomis:
The Fed was in effect saying,

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:57.667
"You're an evil force,
and we don't want you trading our bonds."

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:03.217
It was a huge turning point
for Warren.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:06.542
And he believed that,
at that particular point,

01:02:06.742 --> 01:02:09.467
his reputation
was on the line.

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:12.592
Gottesman:
Warren had 24 hours to make up his mind

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:15.759
as to whether he was going
to go forward or just bow out.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:20.166
And I think at that point, Salomon
Brothers could have gone into bankruptcy.

01:02:20.366 --> 01:02:23.834
And Warren stepped up
and took responsibility.

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:31.250
Okay. I'm Warren Buffett.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:34.592
I was... elected...

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:37.467
Interim Chairman
of Salomon, Inc.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:40.046
a few hours ago at a board
of directors meeting.

01:02:40.246 --> 01:02:42.625
Man:
Why was it necessary for you to step in

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:44.771
and what is your mandate
of leadership?

01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:47.052
I think that
it was necessary to step in

01:02:47.252 --> 01:02:49.133
because I would do
whatever was needed,

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:52.750
dig out any bit of information
about what's happened in the past,

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:54.417
and I would do everything
I could to make sure

01:02:54.617 --> 01:02:55.675
that things
exactly right in the future.

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:57.966
Man 2: Mr. Buffett,
are you satisfied that...

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:02.300
I had to convince the Treasury
that what was done in the past

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.041
was awful and stupid,
and they had every right to be furious at us,

01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:09.208
but this firm
employed 8,000 people,

01:03:09.408 --> 01:03:11.770
and it was going
to go out of business

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:14.333
unless they let us
continue, basically.

01:03:14.533 --> 01:03:16.508
????

01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:21.000
Warren believed that there was
a too-big-to-fail scenario.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.592
The term was not used then,

01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:26.375
but he believed that Salomon
was too big to fail.

01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:28.717
And if Salomon went down,

01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:32.917
it would take other important
parts of Wall Street with it.

01:03:33.117 --> 01:03:35.508
????

01:03:35.708 --> 01:03:38.208
Warren:
We had this death knell from the Treasury,

01:03:38.408 --> 01:03:40.175
so I called the Treasury.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:42.708
Nick Brady was
the Secretary.

01:03:42.908 --> 01:03:45.175
I'm pleading for my life.

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:47.300
And I'm sure my voice was
cracking and everything else,

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.008
and I said, "Nick,
this is the most important day of my life."

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:55.250
And I really did feel that it was
going to be a colossal disaster.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.175
He wasn't sure
I was right at all...

01:03:58.375 --> 01:04:00.379
in fact,
he probably thought I was wrong...

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:02.583
but he knew that I felt
what I was saying.

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:06.291
So, the Treasury
modified its order,

01:04:06.491 --> 01:04:07.854
and in effect, of course,

01:04:08.054 --> 01:04:09.417
it was quite an endorsement.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:12.792
It was huge.

01:04:12.992 --> 01:04:16.300
????

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.050
Munger:
It saved Salomon.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:22.133
Nick Brady went with Warren,
because he trusted him.

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:25.792
It shows how having a good reputation
is really helpful in life.

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:29.587
Warren:
I thank you for the opportunity

01:04:29.787 --> 01:04:31.458
to appear
before this subcommittee.

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.587
I would like to start
by apologizing

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.592
for the acts that
have brought us here.

01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:40.625
A nation has a right to expect
its rules and laws to be obeyed,

01:04:40.825 --> 01:04:43.375
but I also have asked
every Salomon employee

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:46.125
to be his or her
own compliance officer.

01:04:46.325 --> 01:04:48.258
After they first obey all rules,

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:50.759
I then want employees
to ask themselves

01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:54.458
whether they are willing
to have any contemplated act

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.925
appear the next day
on the front page

01:04:57.125 --> 01:05:00.417
of their local paper
to be read by their spouses,

01:05:00.617 --> 01:05:01.917
children, and friends.

01:05:02.959 --> 01:05:04.300
If they follow this test,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.091
they need not fear
my other message to them:

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:10.417
Lose money for the firm,
and I will be understanding.

01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:12.583
Lose a shred of reputation
for the firm,

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:14.374
and I will be ruthless.

01:05:14.574 --> 01:05:16.166
I welcome your questions.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.008
Warren:
It's been 50 years

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:42.250
since I formally took control
of Berkshire Hathaway,

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:45.175
and, step by step,
we've created something

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:49.583
that is kind of what I dreamt
we might create over time,

01:05:49.783 --> 01:05:51.133
but it took a lot
of time to do it.

01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:53.708
Never seemed like we were making
that much progress on any one day,

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:56.375
but compound interest works.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:59.917
Woman:
When you think back 50 years ago

01:06:00.117 --> 01:06:01.300
when you founded
this company,

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.875
did you ever imagine it would be the
fifth-largest company in the world?

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:08.754
No, I...
I didn't, but if I was thinking about it,

01:06:08.954 --> 01:06:11.542
I wouldn't have thought
in terms of being the fifth,

01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:13.416
or the fourth,
or the third.

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:15.091
You would've wanted
number one.

01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:18.625
Oh! I mean, if you're gonna dream,
you might as well dream.

01:06:18.825 --> 01:06:21.467
...two, three.

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:25.008
Bill Gates wins.
Bill Gates wins.

01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:27.834
Warren: Well,
a Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting is

01:06:28.034 --> 01:06:31.041
partly a fun festival.
It's sort of a Mardi Gras

01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:32.800
for people
to come every year.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.467
It's a chance for us
to have a lot of fun

01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:38.750
and meet the people that have
entrusted us with their money.

01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:46.792
Munger: Well, we used to have
just 30 people in a cafeteria,

01:06:46.992 --> 01:06:50.250
and now we have
this huge public spectacle.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:54.795
Munger:
Celebration is part of making

01:06:54.995 --> 01:06:57.583
a group of people
work well together.

01:06:57.783 --> 01:06:59.175
It's a celebration.

01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:01.342
Warren:
??We are glad ??

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:04.983
??You're here
at our meeting ??

01:07:05.183 --> 01:07:08.425
??Be sure to check out
our wares ??

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:12.959
??We'll sell you See's Candy
and Dilly Bars ??

01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.708
??And insurance
for all of your cars ??

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:20.458
??For its buy, buy,
buy all you see ??

01:07:20.658 --> 01:07:25.625
??At the Berkshire show! ??

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.759
????

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:32.708
Man:
All right! Woo!

01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:36.796
He truly loves
to do what he does.

01:07:36.996 --> 01:07:39.925
Love you, Warren!
Aw, yeah.

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:43.834
Loomis:
I think investors who own Berkshire Hathaway,

01:07:44.034 --> 01:07:46.792
they see themselves
as a part of a community.

01:07:46.992 --> 01:07:48.125
Woman:
One, two, three.

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:54.458
There are more long-term holders
of Berkshire than any company.

01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:56.729
People consider it a religion.

01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:58.800
Man:
Okay, right here.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.458
Warren:
They don't buy it with the idea

01:08:00.658 --> 01:08:02.091
they're gonna sell it
next week.

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:05.375
I think most of them buying it with the
intent of holding it for their lifetime,

01:08:05.575 --> 01:08:07.625
just like they'd buy a farm
or buy an apartment house.

01:08:07.825 --> 01:08:10.875
At Berkshire, everybody gets
the same information

01:08:11.075 --> 01:08:13.917
from the comprehensive
annual report.

01:08:14.117 --> 01:08:15.383
We don't meet
with the analysts.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.717
I'm not interested in what an
analyst thinks about Berkshire.

01:08:17.917 --> 01:08:20.667
I'm interested in what the owners
of Berkshire think about Berkshire.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.625
Munger:
He came out of a private partnership

01:08:25.825 --> 01:08:28.841
where people he knew
were trusting him.

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:31.917
And he had his relatives
in the partnership,

01:08:32.117 --> 01:08:33.300
and they were not rich.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.675
And as it got bigger,
he started treating

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:38.083
everybody else the way
he treated his relatives.

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:42.550
Warren:
In terms of our feeling

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:44.708
toward the people
who are shareholders,

01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:46.008
we regard them
as our partners.

01:08:46.208 --> 01:08:49.091
They're not some
faceless group of people.

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:52.375
And that's why at the annual meeting,
I love seeing 40,000 of them.

01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:55.959
It gives real meaning to what
we're doing every day.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.817
Let's try.
??If you know... ??

01:09:00.017 --> 01:09:02.959
Men:
??Susie like I know Susie ??

01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:06.050
??Oh, oh, oh, what a gal ??

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:09.208
We just have a lot of love
and respect for each other.

01:09:09.408 --> 01:09:10.508
And that's never changed.

01:09:10.708 --> 01:09:13.750
??Oh, oh... ??Susie:
I don't go to most things in Omaha,

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:16.417
because I think
Astrid lives there with him,

01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:17.792
and that's for her to do.

01:09:19.208 --> 01:09:21.250
And then we do
all kinds of things.

01:09:25.125 --> 01:09:26.917
Susie Jr.
: Strange as it may seem to people,

01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:28.300
I always think,
you know, "Who cares?

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.917
"If it's working between the
people who are directly involved,

01:09:31.117 --> 01:09:32.050
who cares
what anyone thinks?"

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.875
And my mother and Astrid
were very close, you know.

01:09:35.075 --> 01:09:37.091
They really,
really loved each other,

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:40.542
and I think that my mother
was glad that she was there,

01:09:40.742 --> 01:09:41.925
'cause she...
she loved my dad.

01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:44.004
She wanted him
taken care of and happy,

01:09:44.204 --> 01:09:45.883
and there's
no one better than Astrid.

01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:48.583
She's just... she loves my dad.
She wouldn't care if he had one cent.

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:50.300
All:
??..back where you belong ??

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.375
Well, Astrid has lived
with me for a long time.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.966
She's done wonders for me.

01:09:56.166 --> 01:09:58.583
It worked well,
but I don't think it'll work

01:09:58.783 --> 01:10:00.750
for lots of other people
necessarily.

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:04.592
Susie and I loved each other,
we admired each other,

01:10:04.792 --> 01:10:07.458
and we were totally in sync
with what the other was doing,

01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:09.875
but we were
two different individuals.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:14.966
????

01:10:15.166 --> 01:10:19.083
Susie: The first time Warren
came out to San Francisco...

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:22.150
we took a walk,
and he looked around,

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:24.417
and he doesn't...
he's not very visual.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:27.941
He was looking around,
and he said,

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:30.708
"This really is...
this is your city."

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:42.583
I am so drawn to color,
light, form, and nature,

01:10:42.783 --> 01:10:46.500
that he thought
it was a good place for me.

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:49.671
Warren:
Over the years I've developed

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.467
a better understanding
of human nature.

01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.383
I can learn a lot about
investments out of a book,

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:57.375
but I don't think you can learn
as much about human beings.

01:10:57.575 --> 01:10:58.759
You really need
some experiences,

01:10:58.959 --> 01:11:03.250
and I'm wiser in that respect
than I was 40 or 50 years ago,

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:05.791
even though
I can't rattle off numbers

01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:08.333
the same way
I used to be able to.

01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:10.750
????

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:18.500
Well, I think that what we do
reflects who we are,

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.750
and that's true for everybody
in this room.

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:23.175
And if you do the work I do,

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:25.875
you meet the best
human beings in the world.

01:11:26.075 --> 01:11:27.800
People who
have made a choice

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.296
not to make money,
but to serve other human beings.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.592
I think it's the best kind
of life anyone could have.

01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:39.583
I was with her in Arizona at this "Fortune"
Most Powerful Women's Conference,

01:11:39.783 --> 01:11:42.041
and she told me she had
a biopsy the day before,

01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:44.083
and I didn't really think
much of it.

01:11:44.283 --> 01:11:46.008
????

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:49.375
Then we got home,
and the biopsy results were not good.

01:11:49.575 --> 01:11:51.208
It was stage four
oral cancer.

01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:55.959
Howard:
I was on my way to a board meeting in India,

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:57.750
and I remember
saying to her,

01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:59.542
"I'll see you
when I get back."

01:11:59.742 --> 01:12:01.300
And she rarely cried,

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.250
and she just
started crying and said,

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:04.592
"No, you need to stay here,

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:07.208
and you need to come out
for the operation."

01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:10.759
Susie Jr.:
So we were all there,

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.583
and the day she was
going into the surgery,

01:12:13.783 --> 01:12:16.925
that morning,
my dad...

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:20.000
It's funny, he...
there's some of it he just can't...

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.217
you know, he just can't...

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:24.625
the thought of something happening
to her was just, for him...

01:12:24.825 --> 01:12:27.625
you know,
was just the worst thing that could happen.

01:12:27.825 --> 01:12:28.717
????

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:31.083
Peter:
She knew it was going to be really difficult.

01:12:31.283 --> 01:12:34.895
She knew the recovery
was going to be brutal,

01:12:35.095 --> 01:12:38.708
so I think that she had
that surgery for others.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.425
It was...
quite a big surgery.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:48.625
She couldn't talk,
she couldn't swallow, she couldn't eat.

01:12:48.825 --> 01:12:51.917
But she came out,
and I really was with her

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:53.708
for the next
four months or so.

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:56.417
And my dad came out
every weekend.

01:12:56.617 --> 01:12:58.625
????

01:13:02.834 --> 01:13:05.458
And in a few months
she was doing better.

01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:18.508
She and my dad had gone
to Cody, Wyoming,

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:21.458
which they did every year
with a bunch of friends.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.500
And my dad called. This was,
I don't know, 8:00 at night or something,

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.646
and he said,
"Something happened to Mom.

01:13:34.846 --> 01:13:37.792
I'm in an ambulance.
You need to come."

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.191
Howard: I actually thought
something had happened to my dad.

01:13:44.391 --> 01:13:47.083
I don't know why I thought that,
but I... I guess I thought

01:13:47.283 --> 01:13:48.759
my mom had
had this recovery,

01:13:48.959 --> 01:13:53.291
it was successful,
and why would anything happen to her?

01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:56.792
????

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:00.166
It was horrible.

01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:02.800
And a total shock.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.675
You know, she'd been fine.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.733
She'd been fine.
They went off to Cody,

01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:08.592
she was fine,
and they were having dinner,

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:11.625
and you know,
she didn't feel well after dinner,

01:14:11.825 --> 01:14:14.333
and... she had the stroke.

01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:22.625
We went into the hospital room,
and my dad was sitting there.

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.625
He'd been sitting there
all night, holding her hand.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.550
I was so proud of him,

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.712
because when
it came down to it,

01:14:31.912 --> 01:14:33.675
he knew what
he was supposed to do,

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:36.542
and he did it,
which was nothing.

01:14:36.742 --> 01:14:39.708
????

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.041
So my dad went to sleep,

01:14:43.241 --> 01:14:44.550
and I sat with her.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.375
And I just kept
putting my hand on her heart

01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:49.792
to see if she was
breathing, and...

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:54.708
At one point, you know,
I didn't feel anything,

01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:56.645
so I went out,
I got the nurse,

01:14:56.845 --> 01:14:58.781
and I said,
"Can you come in here?"

01:14:58.981 --> 01:15:00.717
And she said,
"No, she's gone."

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.417
So, I have to say one
of the worst moments of my life

01:15:03.617 --> 01:15:05.083
was waking my dad up
to tell him that.

01:15:05.283 --> 01:15:08.250
????

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:16.917
Warren:
It's a very strange thing, love.

01:15:17.117 --> 01:15:18.041
You can't get rid of it.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.667
If you try to give it out,
you get more back.

01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:27.083
If you try to hang onto it,
you lose it.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.208
Susie...
really put me together.

01:15:39.408 --> 01:15:40.133
She believed in me.

01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:42.091
She-she-she...
she put me together.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:46.291
And I would not only have turned out
to be the person I turned out to be,

01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:47.717
but I would not have...

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.792
I actually wouldn't have been as successful
in business without that, and...

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:53.250
she made me more
of a whole person.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:55.959
????

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:05.125
Peter: He went dark,
essentially, quiet and inward

01:16:05.325 --> 01:16:06.750
for a certain amount
of time.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:09.175
????

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:12.258
You know, my dad is
a solitary guy,

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:16.792
and he had lived, essentially,
a solitary life in a lot of ways.

01:16:19.166 --> 01:16:22.233
I think it came down
to him figuring out

01:16:22.433 --> 01:16:25.500
how he was gonna
get through this tunnel

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.583
and get out the other side.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.133
In my head
at the time, I thought,

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.625
"God, I don't know
if he'll ever get out of bed."

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:40.625
But he did.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.383
Welcome.
I'm Patty Stonesifer,

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:58.166
the CEO of the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation.

01:16:58.366 --> 01:16:59.966
And we appreciate
you coming today,

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:03.358
especially since I sent a very
vague and very late notice

01:17:03.558 --> 01:17:06.750
to ask you to come to a
conversation with Bill and Melinda

01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:09.291
on the future on philanthropy.

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:11.717
So, lets get on with it.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:15.841
I have the pleasure
of introducing a good man

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:20.667
whose great decision is going to
change the world, Warren Buffett.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.125
????

01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:33.050
Man:
A remarkable decision tonight

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.208
from one of the richest men
in the world.

01:17:35.408 --> 01:17:37.175
Mega-billionaire
Warren Buffett says

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:40.208
he is giving away most of
his fortune away to charity.

01:17:40.408 --> 01:17:41.875
Woman:
Buffett has pledged to give away

01:17:42.075 --> 01:17:43.258
the bulk of his fortune

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.941
to the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation

01:17:46.141 --> 01:17:48.425
and giving more
than 15% of his money

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:53.375
to foundations started by his three
children and his late wife, Susan.

01:17:53.575 --> 01:17:56.425
Man 2: One global health activist
called what Buffett did today

01:17:56.625 --> 01:18:02.383
one of the most remarkably selfless
acts that history will ever record.

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:06.500
That's a better hand than I get
at a Berkshire Hathaway meeting.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.467
I'd like to thank you
for coming.

01:18:08.667 --> 01:18:12.959
It... it's a great day for me.
It's a great day for my family.

01:18:13.159 --> 01:18:16.208
My wife Susie and I had planned
that whatever I made

01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:17.675
would go back to society,

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:20.250
and, originally, I thought
she would outlive me

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:22.854
and that she'd make
a big decision on it.

01:18:23.054 --> 01:18:25.258
But since her death,
I had to rethink

01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:27.525
the best way to get
the money into society

01:18:27.725 --> 01:18:29.592
and have it used
in the most effective way,

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:34.050
and I had a solution
staring me in the face.

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:38.000
It was completely out of the blue.
I mean amazing.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.959
The largest single gift
ever given was

01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:44.550
what he gave away that day.

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:47.583
I'd like to ask the people
representing those...

01:18:47.783 --> 01:18:49.667
various foundations
to come out.

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:56.125
The first three letters are
easy to sign, I just sign "Dad."

01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:02.542
????

01:19:11.041 --> 01:19:13.166
Howard:
When he wrote the letter to us,

01:19:13.366 --> 01:19:14.634
he put something
in that letter

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.342
that was
incredibly important to me,

01:19:16.542 --> 01:19:19.962
which was exactly how
our foundation behaves,

01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:22.898
which is,
if you're gonna try to bat a thousand,

01:19:23.098 --> 01:19:25.634
you won't do very many things
that are important.

01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:29.542
But if you're willing to
basically strike out a few times,

01:19:29.742 --> 01:19:32.542
you can really change
something big.

01:19:32.742 --> 01:19:35.342
I.C.C.N.!

01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:36.841
Warren: Well,
I feel terrific about the fact

01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:39.750
that my three children
each run a separate foundation

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:42.583
that combines
their special interests,

01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:44.258
whether it's early education

01:19:44.458 --> 01:19:48.291
or whether it's farming in areas
where people's techniques for using

01:19:48.491 --> 01:19:51.208
small plots of land could use
a lot of improvement.

01:19:51.408 --> 01:19:53.417
All kinds of ways...
vaccines, you name it.

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.550
Man:
More powerful than Buffett's gift

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.917
is the message he's sending
to other wealthy Americans,

01:20:00.117 --> 01:20:02.562
that those who have
the least in this world

01:20:02.762 --> 01:20:05.208
should benefit from
those who have the most.

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:13.291
Warren: In my entire lifetime,
everything that I've spent

01:20:13.491 --> 01:20:16.834
will be quite a bit less
than one percent

01:20:17.034 --> 01:20:17.675
of everything I've made.

01:20:17.875 --> 01:20:20.083
The other 99% plus
will go to others,

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:22.291
because it has
no utility to me.

01:20:22.491 --> 01:20:24.208
????

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:32.083
So, it's silly for me
to not transfer that utility

01:20:32.283 --> 01:20:33.542
to people who can use it.

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:37.000
It's doing me no good.

01:20:42.166 --> 01:20:44.083
Susie Jr.:
I am so proud of what we do.

01:20:46.125 --> 01:20:47.592
I almost cry
at every board meeting,

01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:51.417
because I just think
she would be so proud.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.983
And that is my biggest job,
in my opinion,

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.417
is to make sure
that every penny gets spent

01:20:57.617 --> 01:20:58.708
the way she would
want it spent.

01:21:01.959 --> 01:21:04.750
Susie: Whoever you are in this life,
you don't want to think

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:09.083
you wasted a lot
of your energy, love,

01:21:09.283 --> 01:21:12.208
and time
on something useless.

01:21:12.408 --> 01:21:13.634
????

01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:17.500
I always thought I'd marry a minister,
a doctor, or somebody

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:22.333
out doing
some valuable service

01:21:22.533 --> 01:21:24.217
to human beings.

01:21:24.417 --> 01:21:29.166
And the fact that I married somebody
who makes just piles of money

01:21:29.366 --> 01:21:32.500
is really the antithesis
of what I ever thought,

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.500
but I know what he is,

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:38.583
and... he is...

01:21:39.792 --> 01:21:42.375
There's no finer human being
than who he is.

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:49.792
????

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.817
Warren:
The truth is that I'm here

01:21:57.017 --> 01:21:58.846
in my position
as a matter of luck.

01:21:59.046 --> 01:22:00.875
Hey!
How are you doing, Grandpa?

01:22:01.075 --> 01:22:02.759
Hey, Grandpa!
Okay.

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:04.759
Warren:
When I was born in 1930,

01:22:04.959 --> 01:22:09.717
the odds were probably 40:1 against
me being born in the United States.

01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:14.500
I did win the ovarian lottery on that
first day, and on top of that, I was male.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.133
Put that down
as another 50/50 shot

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:22.500
and now the odds are 80:1 against being
born a male in the United States,

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.000
and it was enormously
important in my whole life.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.300
To think that that makes me
superior to anyone else

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.834
as a human being is just...
I can't follow that line of reasoning.

01:22:33.792 --> 01:22:35.458
Perfect!
Okay, good luck.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:43.250
I think I was lucky to have been
standing alongside Warren Buffett

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:45.175
while he was
becoming Warren Buffett.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:50.542
He has developed over the years.
He's broadened.

01:22:50.742 --> 01:22:53.291
His values extend
through all of his life.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:57.592
He wants to lead a life
that he and his father,

01:22:57.792 --> 01:23:01.375
if his father was still living,
would say was a good one.

01:23:01.575 --> 01:23:03.217
????

01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:07.542
I think he's going to end up in the
history books a hundred years from now.

01:23:07.742 --> 01:23:10.791
I'm not sure what role
he's going to be assigned.

01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:14.041
Will he be famous
for what he did as an investor

01:23:14.241 --> 01:23:16.759
or as a philanthropist?

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:21.375
But Warren said that his ambition
in life is to be a teacher.

01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:24.920
Warren:
The world is a great movie to watch,

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.251
but you don't want
to sleepwalk through life.

01:23:27.451 --> 01:23:29.583
The important thing to do
is to look for the job

01:23:29.783 --> 01:23:31.834
you would take
if you didn't need a job

01:23:32.034 --> 01:23:33.717
and life is wonderful then.

01:23:33.917 --> 01:23:36.462
I mean, you'll jump out
of bed in the morning

01:23:36.662 --> 01:23:39.208
because you're really
looking forward to the day.

01:23:39.408 --> 01:23:42.634
I have...
for over 60 years,

01:23:42.834 --> 01:23:43.966
I've been able
to tap dance to work

01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:46.875
just 'cause I'm doing
what I love doing and...

01:23:47.075 --> 01:23:49.417
and I just feel
very, very lucky.

01:23:49.617 --> 01:23:51.500
Okay, class dismissed.

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:58.291
????

01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:12.417
Night.

01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:14.625
Kunhardt:
Do you fear death?

01:24:14.825 --> 01:24:17.008
Warren:
No, I don't.

01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:20.834
I've had a terrific life.
I feel... you know, it's gonna happen,

01:24:21.034 --> 01:24:23.375
and I have no idea
what happens after it.

01:24:23.575 --> 01:24:24.675
I'm an agnostic, so I...

01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:26.841
you know, it may be
terribly interesting.

01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:28.834
It may not be interesting
at all. We'll find out.

01:24:29.034 --> 01:24:31.500
But physically,
I'm pretty well depreciated.

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.458
I'm getting down
to salvage value.

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:41.217
But it really doesn't make
any difference at all.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:44.500
It doesn't interfere with my work.
It doesn't interfere with my happiness.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.041
It doesn't interfere
with my thinking.

01:24:46.241 --> 01:24:51.050
????

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:55.166
I don't feel any diminution
in my enjoyment of life

01:24:55.366 --> 01:24:56.592
or enthusiasm
for life at all.

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:59.917
In fact, in a sense,
the game that I'm in

01:25:00.117 --> 01:25:01.959
gets more interesting
all the time.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:06.500
It's a competitive game.
It's a big game,

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.625
and I enjoyed
the game a lot.

01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:20.333
????

01:26:03.875 --> 01:26:09.458
Warren:
??Somewhere over the rainbow ??

01:26:09.658 --> 01:26:14.091
??Way up high ??

01:26:14.291 --> 01:26:20.250
??There's a land
that I heard of ??

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:25.175
??Once in a lullaby ??

01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:31.000
??Somewhere over the rainbow ??

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.437
??Skies are blue ??

01:26:35.637 --> 01:26:39.675
??And the dreams ??

01:26:39.875 --> 01:26:43.108
??That you dare to dream ??

01:26:43.308 --> 01:26:46.342
??Really do come true ??

01:26:46.542 --> 01:26:48.983
??One day I'll wish
upon a star ??

01:26:49.183 --> 01:26:51.625
??And wake up where
the clouds ??

01:26:51.825 --> 01:26:55.291
??Are far behind me ??

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.837
??Where troubles melt ??

01:26:59.037 --> 01:27:00.398
??Like lemon drops ??

01:27:00.598 --> 01:27:01.949
??Oh, way above ??

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:03.662
??The chimney tops ??

01:27:03.862 --> 01:27:06.643
??That's where ??

01:27:06.843 --> 01:27:09.625
??You'll find me ??

01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:16.583
??Somewhere over the rainbow ??

01:27:16.783 --> 01:27:20.917
??Blue birds fly ??

01:27:21.834 --> 01:27:26.796
??Birds fly over the rainbow ??

01:27:26.996 --> 01:27:31.959
??Why then, oh, why can't I? ??

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.667
??Somewhere over the rainbow ??

01:27:58.867 --> 01:28:03.008
??Blue birds fly ??

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:08.462
??Birds fly over the rainbow ??

01:28:08.662 --> 01:28:13.717
??Why then, oh, why can't I? ??

01:28:13.917 --> 01:28:19.208
??If happy little bluebirds
fly beyond the rainbow ??

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:24.025
??Why, oh, why ??

01:28:24.225 --> 01:28:27.012
??Can't I? ??

01:28:27.212 --> 01:28:30.000
Good night, Susan.
