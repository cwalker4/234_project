00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:13.055
IN MY GRANDFATHER'S TIME,
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:16.959
THE NIGHT SKY IS
THE GREATEST SHOW AROUND.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.128
IT PLAYS WEEK AFTER WEEK.

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:24.333
EVEN ON SUNDAYS,
ASSUMING THE WEATHER HOLDS.

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:29.539
PART OF ITS POWER IS
ITS INFINITE MYSTERY.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:34.310
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE STARS
COME FROM OR WHY THEY SHINE.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.479
FEW BELIEVE
WE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.648
WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF--

00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:41.684
WHAT THE TRUE NATURE
OF MATTER REALLY IS.

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:45.154
BUT THEN, WITHIN A FEW YEARS,
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

00:03:45.154 --> 00:03:48.190
THERE ARE REVOLUTIONS
IN ASTRONOMY AND PHYSICS

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.793
AND LONG-CHERISHED IDEAS
ARE SHATTERED

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.263
ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE
AND SPACE AND TIME

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:56.432
AND EVEN REALITY ITSELF.

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:59.035
THE ONLY THING
THAT REMAINS THE SAME

00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:02.071
IS THE GLORY OF THE VIEW.

00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.048
Osgood:
FROM THE MOMENT
THE TELESCOPE IS INVENTED

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:13.783
IT'S OUR WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.988
IN THE 18th AND 19th CENTURIES

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:22.458
EVER LARGER
AND MORE ELABORATE TELESCOPES

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.627
REVEAL EVER MORE STARS.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:32.435
BY THE END OF THE 19th CENTURY

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:35.905
TELESCOPES ARE SO LARGE
AND REVEAL SO MANY STARS

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:39.809
ASTRONOMERS ARE WORKING OVERTIME
JUST TO CATALOGUE THEM.

00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:45.014
THERE SEEMS LITTLE NEED TO BUILD
EVEN BIGGER INSTRUMENTS

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:48.050
IF ALL THEY CAN DO IS
FIND MORE STARS TO CATALOGUE.

00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:58.027
BUT GEORGE ELLERY HALE
DISAGREES.

00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:00.196
HE'S PASSIONATELY CONVINCED

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:03.232
A BIG ENOUGH TELESCOPE
WILL CHANGE ASTRONOMY

00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:05.835
IN WAYS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO ANTICIPATE

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.437
AND HE'S DETERMINED
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:17.113
THAT PASSION BRINGS HIM TO MOUNT
WILSON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:21.450
E AIR IS ALMOST ALWAYS
FREE OF TURBULENCE AND CLOUDS.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.345
IT'S THE PERFECT SPOT
FOR AN OBSERVATORY.

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:28.824
WITH FUNDS FROM THE LIKES

00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:32.294
OF STEEL TYCOON AND
PHILANTHROPIST ANDREW CARNEGIE

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:35.331
HALE SETS OUT IN 1908
TO BUILD ON MOUNT WILSON

00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:37.500
THE WORLD'S LARGEST TELESCOPE.

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.139
THE INSTRUMENT HE ENVISIONS
WILL BE ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.440
OF ANY THEN IN USE.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.211
IT WILL COLLECT AND FOCUS LIGHT
WITH A MIRROR 100 INCHES WIDE.

00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:57.453
HALE'S ENTHUSIASM IS
INFECTIOUS AND PERSUASIVE.

00:05:57.453 --> 00:05:59.622
IT ALSO MASKS THE ENORMITY

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:03.526
OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE
HE'S UNDERTAKING.

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.695
Man:
NOBODY IS POURING GLASS,
MOLTEN GLASS

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:07.863
THE SIZE THAT
IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY.

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:10.032
NOBODY IS CREATING THE KINDS
OF BEAMS AND GIRDERS

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:13.069
AND THE SUPER GOING TO BE N
ECESSARY.

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.237
THESE THINGS WEIGH HUNDREDS,
THOUSANDS OF TONS.

00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:16.972
YOU ALSO HAVE THE DIFFICULTY

00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:19.575
THAT THEY'RE LOCATED
ON MOUNTAINTOPS.

00:06:19.575 --> 00:06:22.178
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE ROADS.

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:25.648
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE LIVING
QUARTERS FOR THE ASTRONOMERS.

00:06:25.648 --> 00:06:28.250
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
MACHINE SHOPS ON SITE.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.985
IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON.

00:06:29.985 --> 00:06:32.154
THESE ARE ALMOST KIND
OF TECHNOLOGICAL KINGDOMS

00:06:32.588 --> 00:06:33.889
IN THEIR OWN RIGHT

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.926
AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN DESIGNED
ON THIS SCALE BEFORE.

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:43.432
Osgood:
THINGS SEEM TO GO WRONG
FROM THE START.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:48.204
THE MIRROR HAS TO BE THE LARGEST
SOLID PIECE OF GLASS EVER MADE.

00:06:48.204 --> 00:06:49.939
A FRENCH GLASSMAKER POURS

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.409
ENOUGH GREEN GLASS FOR
10,000 CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.144
INTO A HUGE MOLD

00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:59.048
AND THEN PACKS THE WHOLE THING
IN MANURE TO SLOWLY COOL IT.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.253
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT COMES OUT FLAWED.

00:07:04.687 --> 00:07:06.856
TWICE MORE THEY TRY

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:10.760
AND EACH TIME, THE GIANT DISKS
CRACK AS THEY COOL.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.362
LACKING THE MONEY TO TRY AGAIN

00:07:13.362 --> 00:07:16.832
HALE ORDERS HIS OPTICIANS
TO GRIND THE FIRST

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:19.869
IN THE HOPE ITS FLAWS
AREN'T FATAL.

00:07:21.604 --> 00:07:24.206
IT TAKES FOUR YEARS
OF GRINDING AND POLISHING

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.375
TO FINISH THE MIRROR...

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.411
AND EVEN LONGER TO BUILD

00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:32.014
T OF THE TELESCOPE
AND ITS DOME.

00:07:36.786 --> 00:07:38.954
HUNDREDS OF TONS
OF STEEL AND CONCRETE

00:07:38.954 --> 00:07:40.689
ARE HAULED UP THE MOUNTAIN ROAD

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:44.160
AT A CAUTIOUS
TEN MILES PER HOUR.

00:07:48.063 --> 00:07:51.534
EVEN AT THAT SPEED,
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:08.017
THE STEEL SECTIONS
OF THE TELESCOPE ITSELF

00:08:08.017 --> 00:08:10.619
ARE BUILT AT
AN EAST COAST SHIPYARD.

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:14.523
SOME ARE SO BIG THEY MUST BE
SHIPPED BY BOAT TO CALIFORNIA.

00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:16.692
WORLD WAR I HAS BROKEN OUT

00:08:16.692 --> 00:08:19.728
AND GERMAN SUBMARINES
ARE A CONSTANT THREAT.

00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:24.934
LONG PRONE TO BOUTS
OF DEPRESSION

00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:32.741
HALE'S WORRIES ABOUT THE PROJECT
BEGIN TO AFFECT HIS HEALTH.

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.910
THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.079
BY A COMPANION--

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.248
SORT OF DESCRIBED
AS A LITTLE GREEN ELF

00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:42.284
WHO MIGHT COME TO HIS BED
OR SIT ON HIS SHOULDER

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:44.887
PERHAPS TO GIVE HIM ADVICE
ABOUT HOW TO RUN HIS LIFE

00:08:44.887 --> 00:08:47.489
AND HOW TO RAISE MONEY,
WHO TO TALK TO.

00:08:47.489 --> 00:08:49.225
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.430
THE ELF PERHAP WORK OUT SOME
OF THIS STRESS.

00:08:57.032 --> 00:09:00.936
Osgood:
WHATEVER IT IS
THAT CARRIES HALE THROUGH

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.141
ON NOVEMBER 2, 1917, THE
100-INCH TELESCOPE IS FINISHED.

00:09:13.082 --> 00:09:16.118
ITS 100 TONS
OF IRON AND STEEL MOVE

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:19.588
WITH THE PRECISION
OF A FINE WATCH.

00:09:27.396 --> 00:09:31.734
ITS 9,000-POUND MIRROR
CAN DETECT A CANDLE

00:09:31.734 --> 00:09:34.336
5,000 MILES AWAY.

00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:41.710
WHAT HALE HAS BUILT IS ONE OF
THE MARVELS OF THE 20th CENTURY.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.048
IT WILL REIGN FOR DECADES AS
THE BEST TELESCOPE IN THE WORLD

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:49.518
AND PROVE BEYOND DOUBT
THE WORTH OF BIG TELESCOPES.

00:09:54.723 --> 00:09:56.892
TO SPEND A NIGHT HERE

00:09:56.892 --> 00:09:59.929
IS THE DREAM OF ASTRONOMERS
THE WORLD OVER.

00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:04.700
Christianson:
YOU WOULD OPEN THE DOME--
A KIND OF ROLLING LIKE THUNDER.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.170
YOU WERE ALONE ON THE MOUNTAIN
WITH A TELESCOPE.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.942
IT'S JUST YOU AND THE UNIVERSE
OR YOU AND GOD, SO TO SPEAK.

00:10:18.147 --> 00:10:21.145
Baliunas:
YOU'D SIT AT THE PLATFORM
AT THE TELESCOPE

00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:22.918
GUIDING, MAKING
VERY FINE ADJUSTMENTS

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:26.388
ON THIS MAGNIFICENT INSTRUMENT
WITH A LITTLE HAND PADDLE

00:10:26.388 --> 00:10:30.292
WITH YOUR EYE STARING DOWN
ONTO THE ILLUMINATED CROSS HAIRS

00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:35.064
AND WORK THERE
EIGHT, TEN, 12 HOURS.

00:10:35.064 --> 00:10:36.799
OFTENTIMES IT WAS
EXTREMELY COLD.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.534
IN WINTER THEY WORE HEAVY COATS.

00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:41.136
SOMETIMES THEY WORE BEARSKIN
OR SHEEPSKIN COATS.

00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:44.173
YOU COULD LITERALLY HAVE YOUR
TEARS FREEZE TO THE EYEPIECE

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:47.209
AND THEY WANTED HOT COFFEE
BUT HALE WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:49.378
HE THOUGHT IT WAS POISONOUS
TO THE SYSTEM.

00:10:49.378 --> 00:10:51.547
20 HOURS...

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:56.318
Osgood:
COFFEE ISN'T ALL THAT
HALE KEEPS OFF THE MOUNTAINTOP.

00:10:56.318 --> 00:10:59.355
IN THE 1920s, I WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN ALLOWED TO WORK UP HERE.

00:10:59.355 --> 00:11:01.523
IN FACT, I WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN WELCOME

00:11:01.523 --> 00:11:04.126
EVEN AS A WIFE OR A VISITOR
OF ANY OF THE SCIENTISTS.

00:11:04.126 --> 00:11:05.861
HALE IN HIS DAYS AT YERKES

00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:08.464
HAD FOUND THAT THE WIVES
OF SOME OF THE ASTRONOMERS

00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:11.500
BECAME A DISTRACTION TO THEIR
MONASTIC SCHOLARLY STUDIES

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.536
AND SO THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY
BANNED FROM THE MOUNTAINTOP.

00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:22.778
Osgood:
IRONICALLY, WITHOUT THE
CONTRIBUTION MADE BY A WOMAN

00:11:22.778 --> 00:11:25.381
THE FIRST GREAT DISCOVERY MADE
WITH THE 100-INCH

00:11:25.814 --> 00:11:27.549
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:30.586
Man:
THE CLOSEST A WOMAN
COULD GET TO THE FIELD

00:11:30.586 --> 00:11:33.622
WAS, AT THE TIME, AT
THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY

00:11:33.622 --> 00:11:37.526
WHERE MAJOR DATA-COLLECTING
PROJECTS WERE IN PROGRESS.

00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:40.996
HIRED ON
TO HELP TO ANALYZE THE DATA
WHERE MAJOR DATA-COLLECTING
PROJECTS WERE IN PROGRESS.WERE

00:11:40.996 --> 00:11:43.599
TO DO ALL THE MENIAL TASKS

00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:46.201
THAT WERE BELOW
THE DUTIES OF THE MEN.

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:53.081
Osgood:
HENRIETTA LEAVITT IS
ONE OF A DOZEN WOMEN

00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:57.479
WHO STUDIED TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATES

00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.516
TAKEN BY MEN
AT DISTANT OBSERVATORIES.

00:12:00.516 --> 00:12:04.853
LEAVITT'S TASK IS TO EXAMINE
PLATES TAKENS

00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:08.323
AND LOOK FOR STARS
THAT VARY IN BRIGHTNESS.

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:13.962
SHE NOTICES A PATTERN IN ONE
CLASS OF STARS CALLED "CEPHEIDS"

00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:16.131
AND REALIZES
THE TIME IT TAKES THEM

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:17.866
TO REACH THEIR
MAXIMUM BRIGHTNESS

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:20.903
CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE
HOW FAR AWAY THEY ARE.

00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:24.807
IT'S A LANDMARK DISCOVERY.

00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:29.144
BEFORE LEAVITT, ASTRONOMERS
COULDN'T CALCULATE THE DISTANCE

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:31.313
TO ANY BUT THE CLOSEST STARS.

00:12:32.614 --> 00:12:34.349
Tyson:
WHAT HENRIETTA LEAVITT DID

00:12:34.349 --> 00:12:38.687
WAS PROVIDE ONE OF THE FIRST
AND STILL TO THIS DAY

00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:43.459
ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL
YARDSTICKS IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:49.098
IT IS THE MEASURE BY WHICH
ALL DISTANCES ARE DETERMINED.

00:12:49.098 --> 00:12:52.568
WITHOUT THAT, WE'D BE CLUELESS.

00:12:58.207 --> 00:13:01.677
Osgood:
ALL THE ASTRONOMERS GEORGE HALE
BRINGS TO MOUNT WILSON

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.846
WILL, AT SOME POINT
IN THEIR CAREERS

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:06.448
MAKE USE OF LEAVITT'S
CELESTIAL YARDSTICK.

00:13:06.448 --> 00:13:09.918
BUT THERE'S ONE FOR WHOM IT
WILL HAVE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE--

00:13:10.352 --> 00:13:11.653
EDWIN HUBBLE.

00:13:11.653 --> 00:13:14.256
A STAR ATHLETE IN COLLEGE

00:13:14.256 --> 00:13:17.292
HUBBLE HAD WON
A RHODES SCHOLARSHIP

00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:21.196
AND STUDIED LAW AT OXFORD
UNIVERSITY IN ENGLAND.

00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:24.666
UPON RETURNING HOME, HOWEVER

00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:26.835
HE DECIDES AGAINST
BECOMING A LAWYER

00:13:26.835 --> 00:13:29.004
AND HEADS OFF TO GRADUATE SCHOOL

00:13:29.004 --> 00:13:31.607
TO TAKE SERIOUSLY
A FASCINATION WITH THE STARS

00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:33.775
THAT HE HAS FELT
SINCE CHILDHOOD.

00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:39.414
WHEN HUBBLE ARRIVES
AT MOUNT WILSON IN 1919

00:13:39.414 --> 00:13:42.017
HE'S A SMART BUT ARROGANT
29-YEAR-OLD

00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:44.620
WHO HAS TAKEN PAINS
TO ADOPT WHAT HE SEES

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.788
AS THE PROPER IMAGE
OF AN ASTRONOMER.

00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:48.524
Christianson:
WHAT HE TRIES TO DO

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.692
IS TO CREATE THIS
PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF

00:13:50.692 --> 00:13:52.861
AS A KIND OF
NATURAL-BORN PATRICIAN.

00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.596
HE TRIES TO LOSE
HIS MISSOURI ROOTS

00:13:54.596 --> 00:13:57.199
BECAUSE I THINK HE'S EMBARRASSED
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

00:13:57.199 --> 00:13:58.934
HE SEES THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN

00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:01.970
AS BEING THE PROTOTYPE
OF WHAT HE WANTS TO BECOME.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.705
HE WEARS ENGLISH TWEEDS.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:06.742
HE WEARS KNICKERS, WHICH
HAVE GONE OUT OF FASHION

00:14:06.742 --> 00:14:08.911
EXCEPT ON THE GOLF COURSE.

00:14:08.911 --> 00:14:10.646
HE SMOKES A PIPE.

00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:13.248
HE SPOKE WITH
AN AFFECTED BRITISH ACCENT.

00:14:13.248 --> 00:14:17.586
HE HAD DUELING SCARS, WHICH
WERE SAID TO BE SELF-INFLICTED

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:19.755
WHEN WHISPERED AMONG THE STAFF.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:24.960
Christianson:
HE LOVES BEING SEPARATE

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.563
AND APART FROM
HIS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.041
AND HE PLAYS THAT TO THE HILT.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:33.635
Osgood:
IN TIME

00:14:33.635 --> 00:14:36.672
MOST OF HUBBLE'S PERSONALITY
QUIRKS ARE OVERLOOKED

00:14:36.672 --> 00:14:38.407
BECAUSE HE'S
AN EXCELLENT ASTRONOMER

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:41.009
WITH A GIFT FOR ASKING
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:47.950
HUBBLE WANTS TO UNLOCK
THE SECRETS OF THE NEBULAE--

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.685
FAINT, FUZZY SMEARS OF LIGHT

00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:53.589
THAT HAVE PUZZLED ASTRONOMERS
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.830
EVEN WITH HALE'S
MAGNIFICENT 100-INCH

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.734
THEIR TRUE NATURE ELUDES HIM
FOR FOUR LONG YEARS.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.373
FINALLY, IN OCTOBER OF 1923

00:15:11.373 --> 00:15:14.329
WHILE PHOTOGRAPHING
ONE OF THE SPIRAL ARMS

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:16.578
OF THE GREAT NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA

00:15:16.578 --> 00:15:18.313
HUBBLE CATCHES A BREAK.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:21.350
Baliunas:
HE TOOK A 40-MINUTPHIC PLA
TE

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.952
AND DEVELOPED IT THE NEXT DAY
AND LOOKED AT IT

00:15:23.952 --> 00:15:27.422
AND THOUGHT HE SAW
WHAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS A "NOVA."

00:15:27.422 --> 00:15:30.459
THAT WAS ANOTHER HOT TOPIC--
THAT IS, WHAT WERE NOVAE?

00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:33.061
WHAT WERE STARS
THAT BRIGHTENED UNEXPECTEDLY?

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:34.796
SO, HIS CURIOSITY PIQUED

00:15:34.796 --> 00:15:37.833
HE DECIDED THE NEXT NIGHT--
WHICH WAS A BETTER NIGHT--

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:39.134
TO TAKE ANOTHER EXPOSURE

00:15:39.134 --> 00:15:40.869
AND TOOK A DEEPER
PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE.

00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:45.207
Osgood:
THIS PLATE HAS WHAT HE BELIEVES
ARE THREE NOVAE.

00:15:45.207 --> 00:15:48.243
YET AN EVEN GREATER SURPRISE
AWAITS HIM.

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:52.147
WHEN HE GOT DOWN TO THE MOUNTAIN
AND BEGAN TO COMPARE THE PLATES

00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:54.316
WITH THOSE THAT
HAD BEEN TAKEN EARLIER

00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:56.918
HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE
OF THE THREE NOVAE

00:15:56.918 --> 00:15:59.955
WAS NOT IN FACT A NOVA
BUT IT WAS A CEPHEID

00:15:59.955 --> 00:16:02.124
AND IT'S A EUREKA MOMENT.

00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:06.028
HE WRITES IN CAPITAL LETTERS
ON THE SLIDE ITSELF

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:08.630
"V-A-R!"

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.233
FOR "VARIABLE STAR."

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:13.835
Osgood:
HUBBLE KNOWS INSTANTLY--

00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:17.739
THANKS TO HENRIETTA LEAVITT'S
DISCOVERY ABOUT CEPHEIDS--

00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:20.776
THAT THIS STAR
AND THE SYSTEM IT'S A PART OF

00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:22.511
MUST BE VERY FAR AWAY

00:16:22.511 --> 00:16:26.415
AND THE UNIVERSE MUST BE FAR
LARGER THAN ANYONE HAD DREAMED.

00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:32.487
Man:
YEAH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A GOOD MOMENT FOR HIM.

00:16:32.487 --> 00:16:33.789
(chuckling)

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:37.259
WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT
THE DISTANCE TO M-31--

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:40.295
THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY,
ONE OF, IT TURNS OUT

00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:44.633
OUR NEAREST NEIGHBORS-- IS
ABOUT TWO MILLION LIGHT-YEARS.

00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:48.970
SO PEOPLE HAD BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE SCALE OF OUR GALAXY--

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.441
10,000, 20,000, 30,000
MAYBE 100,000 LIGHT-YEARS.

00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:56.778
WHAT THIS MEANT WAS THAT M-31
AND ALL THOSE OTHER GALAXIES

00:16:56.778 --> 00:16:59.381
WERE NOT PART OF OUR SYSTEM;

00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:01.550
THEY WERE THEMSELVES
BIG SYSTEMS

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.152
EQUAL TO THE MILKY WAY.

00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:09.791
Osgood:
THERE ARE, IN FACT,
BILLIONS OF GALAXIES

00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:13.695
EACH ONE CONTAINING HUNDREDS
OF BILLIONS OF STARS.

00:17:15.864 --> 00:17:20.202
HUBBLE'S DISCOVERY OF THE
STUNNING SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE

00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:23.672
AND THE MULTITUDE OF STARS
AND STAR SYSTEMS

00:17:23.672 --> 00:17:25.841
THAT CAN BE FOUND WITHIN IT

00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:29.311
CHANGES FOREVER
OUR PICTURE OF THE COSMOS.

00:17:37.986 --> 00:17:41.022
THAT DISCOVERY ALONE
WOULD HAVE MADE HUBBLE

00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:43.625
ONE OF THE GRAT ASTRONOMERS
OF THE CENTURY.

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:46.661
BUT HE CONTINUES TO STUDY
DISTANT GALAXIES

00:17:46.661 --> 00:17:48.830
AND MAKES AN EVEN
GREATER DISCOVERY.

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:55.337
FOR FIVE YEARS, HE GATHERS DATA
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF GALAXIES

00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:58.807
RECORDING WHERE THEY'RE HEADED
AND HOW FAST.

00:18:00.108 --> 00:18:04.012
IF A GALAXY IS MOVING AWAY,
ITS LIGHT IS STRETCHED.

00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:07.916
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
WAVE CRESTS GETS LONGER;

00:18:07.916 --> 00:18:10.085
THE LIGHT APPEARS REDDER.

00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:13.121
THE FASTER IT'S MOVING,
THE REDDER THE LIGHT.

00:18:13.121 --> 00:18:15.724
IF A GALAXY IS MOVING CLOSER

00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:20.061
THE LIGHT IS COMPRESSED
AND APPEARS BLUER.

00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:22.230
AFTER MANY YEARS,
HUBBLE COULD SIT DOWN

00:18:22.664 --> 00:18:25.267
AND LOOK AT THIS
GREAT QUANTITY OF INFORMATION

00:18:25.267 --> 00:18:27.002
AND HE PLOTTED A CHART.

00:18:27.002 --> 00:18:28.737
HE PLOTTED FOR THE NEBULAE

00:18:28.737 --> 00:18:30.906
THE MOTIONS
AGAINST THE DISTANCES

00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:34.376
AND HE FOUND SOMETHING TRULY
AMAZING-- A STRAIGHT LINE.

00:18:34.376 --> 00:18:41.750
HE FOUND THAT THE DISTANCE
OF A GALAXY

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.352
IT TURNS OUT,
THE VELOCITY'S TWICE AS BIG.

00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:46.087
U GO THREE TIMES AS FAR OUT
IT TURNS OUT,
THE VELOCITY'S TWICE AS BIG.YO

00:18:46.087 --> 00:18:47.823
THE VELOCITY'S
THREE TIMES AS BIG.

00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:50.859
WE LIVE IN A WORLD-- I MEAN,
A BIG WORLD, A UNIVERSE--

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.028
WHERE EVERYTHING'S RUSHING APART

00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:55.630
AND IT'S HAPPENING IN A WAY
WE CALL HUBBLE'S LAW

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.100
WHERE THE VELOCITY IS
PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISTANCE.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.137
AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE.

00:19:02.137 --> 00:19:03.872
HOW COULD THAT BE

00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:06.475
WHEN THE WHOLE HISTORY
OF HUMAN THOUGHT ASSUM

00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:08.210
JUST TOOK FOR GRANTED--

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.680
THAT THE UNIVERSE IS THIS FIXED
THING, AND HOW COULD IT CHANGE?

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.415
THE UNIVER IS EVERYTHING.

00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:15.584
HOW COULD IT HAVE
AN EVOLUTIONARY PATH?

00:19:15.584 --> 00:19:17.752
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD
AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE

00:19:17.752 --> 00:19:19.921
THAT MIGHT MEAN
IT HAD A BEGINNING.

00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:22.090
IT MIGHT MEAN IT'LL END.

00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:26.428
THIS IS A DISCOVERY
FOR THE AGES.

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:52.888
BEFORE EDWIN HUBBLE'S DISCOVERY

00:19:52.888 --> 00:19:56.358
EVEN THE GREAT PHYSICIST
ALBERT EINSTEIN ASSUMED

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:59.394
THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS FIXED AND ETERNAL.

00:19:59.394 --> 00:20:02.430
HIS ORIGINAL EQUATIONS
FOR GENERAL RELATIVITY

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.599
HAD PREDICTED A CHANGING COSMOS.

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:08.069
BUT EINSTEIN WAS UNABLE
TO BELIEVE HIS OWN THEORY

00:20:08.069 --> 00:20:11.973
SO HE ADDED WHAT HE CALLED
A "COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT"

00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:14.142
TO BRING THE UNIVERSE TO REST.

00:20:14.142 --> 00:20:16.311
YEARS LATER, IN 1931

00:20:16.311 --> 00:20:19.347
EINSTEIN TRAVELS TO MOUNT WILSON
TO MEET HUBBLE.

00:20:19.347 --> 00:20:23.577
WHILE THERE, EINSTEIN DECLARES
THAT HIS COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT

00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:27.155
IS THE GREATEST BLUNDER
OF HIS SCIENTIFIC CAREER.

00:20:27.155 --> 00:20:28.456
OF COURSE, BY THIS TIME

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.360
EINSTEIN CAN AFFORD TO ADMIT
TO A MISTAKE OR TWO.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.662
HE'S ALREADY RENOWNED

00:20:33.662 --> 00:20:36.698
AS ONE OF HISTORY'S
GREATEST SCIENTISTS--

00:20:36.698 --> 00:20:40.602
THE MAN WHO REDEFINES GRAVITY,
SPACE AND EVEN TIME.

00:20:45.373 --> 00:20:49.277
Osgood:
AT THE AGE OF 22,
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

00:20:49.277 --> 00:20:52.314
ALBERT EINSTEIN
IS LIVING IN ZURICH

00:20:52.314 --> 00:20:54.482
AND FACING AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.

00:20:54.482 --> 00:20:57.953
HE DREAMS OF BECOMING
A PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS

00:20:57.953 --> 00:21:00.121
BUT HE CAN'T GET A JOB.

00:21:00.121 --> 00:21:02.724
HE HAS ALIENATED MOST
OF HIS COLLEGE TEACHERS

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:05.760
AND THEY WON'T GIVE HIM
THE RECOMMENDATIONS HE NEEDS.

00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:11.399
IN EARLY 1902, HE MOVES TO BERN.

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:13.134
HE'S TIRED OF SCRAPING BY

00:21:13.134 --> 00:21:15.737
WITH WHAT HE CAN EARN
GIVING PRIVATE LESSONS

00:21:15.737 --> 00:21:17.038
AND A FRIEND'S FATHER

00:21:17.472 --> 00:21:20.025
HAS OFFERED TO HELP HIM
GET A JOB THERE.

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:22.243
IT'S WITH
THE SWISS PATENT OFFICE.

00:21:22.243 --> 00:21:25.280
HE'S A TECHNICAL CLERK,
THIRD CLASS

00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:30.485
REVIEWING APPLICATIONS
FOR PATENTS ON NEW INVENTIONS.

00:21:30.485 --> 00:21:34.389
Man:
EINSTEIN WAS A PERFECT FIT
FOR HIS PATENT WORK.

00:21:34.389 --> 00:21:36.558
AND THOSE PATEED

00:21:36.558 --> 00:21:39.160
WERE, IN MY VIEW,
ABSOLUTELY FORMATIVE

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.895
OF HIS SCIENTIFIC STYLE.

00:21:40.895 --> 00:21:43.932
HE'D SIT DOWN EVERY DAY
WITH STACKS OF DOCUMENTS

00:21:43.932 --> 00:21:48.703
AND HIS JOB WAS TO STRIP AWAY
ALL THE COMPLICATIONS...

00:21:48.703 --> 00:21:50.005
TO TAKE A PATENT LIKE THIS

00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:53.041
AND FIGURE OUT, DID THIS VIOLATE
THE BASIC LAWS OF PHYSICS?

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:54.776
WHAT WAS ITS CENTRAL IDEA?

00:21:54.776 --> 00:21:56.077
WAS THAT CENTRAL IDEA NEW?

00:21:56.077 --> 00:21:58.246
OR WAS IT SOMETHING
THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN?

00:21:58.246 --> 00:22:01.282
AND THOSE SORTS OF DECISIONS
WHICH HE MADE EVERY DAY

00:22:01.282 --> 00:22:03.018
LOOKING AT THESE NEW DEVICES

00:22:03.018 --> 00:22:06.054
SHAPED HIS SENSE OF HOW
TO STRIP DOWN A PHYSICAL PROBLEM

00:22:06.488 --> 00:22:08.223
DOWN TO ITS ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS.

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:09.524
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES?

00:22:12.994 --> 00:22:16.464
THAT COMPELS EINSTEIN
TO REEXAMINE

00:22:16.464 --> 00:22:19.934
FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS
OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS

00:22:19.934 --> 00:22:22.971
INCLUDING IDEAS
ABOUT SPACE AND TIME

00:22:22.971 --> 00:22:26.007
THAT SEEM TO EVERYONE ELSE
INESCAPABLE.

00:22:26.007 --> 00:22:27.308
(gunshot)

00:22:29.477 --> 00:22:31.646
IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY

00:22:31.646 --> 00:22:35.550
EVERYONE FROM PHYSICISTS
TO SPORT

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.454
THAT A MILE IS A MILE,
NO MATTER WHERE THE RACE IS RUN;

00:22:39.454 --> 00:22:43.792
THAT THE RUNNER WHO FINISHES
IN 4? MINUTES IS FASTER

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:46.394
THAN THE ONE
WHO FINISHES IN FIVE.

00:22:46.394 --> 00:22:48.129
(crowd cheering)

00:22:50.732 --> 00:22:52.033
COMMON SENSE TELLS US

00:22:52.033 --> 00:22:55.070
THAT TIME AND SPACE
ARE THE SAME EVERYWHERE

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.106
AND FOR EVERYONE.

00:22:58.106 --> 00:23:01.576
INDEED, THAT WAS
ISAAC NEWTON'S STARTING POINT

00:23:01.576 --> 00:23:04.179
WHEN HE WROTE DOWN
HIS LAWS OF MOTION AND GRAVITY

00:23:04.612 --> 00:23:05.914
IN THE 17th CENTURY--

00:23:05.914 --> 00:23:08.516
LAWS THAT SEEM
TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING

00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:12.420
FROM THE FLIGHT OF AN ARROW
TO THE ORBITS OF PLANETS.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.360
BUT EINSTEIN IS WILLING,
WHERE OTHERS ARE NOT

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.096
TO QUESTION EVERYTHING--

00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:24.566
EVEN OUR COMMON-SENSE VIEW
OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:23:24.566 --> 00:23:31.940
Einstein (dramatized):
ALL I HAVE TRIED TO DO IN
MY LIFE IS ASK A FEW QUESTIONS:

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.277
COULD GOD HAVE CREATED
THE UNIVERSE ANY OTHER WAY

00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:38.880
OR HAD HE NO CHOICE?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.085
AND HO
UNIVERSE IF I HAD THE CHANCE?

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.857
Osgood:
EINSTEIN IS DRIVEN
TO ASK SUCH QUESTIONS

00:23:48.857 --> 00:23:50.592
BY A PROBLEM HE SEES

00:23:50.592 --> 00:23:53.194
WITH THE TRADITIONAL DESCRIPTION
OF LIGHT.

00:23:53.194 --> 00:23:55.363
Galison:
HE KNEW FROM MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS

00:23:55.363 --> 00:23:59.701
FROM THE GREAT CLASSICAL PHYSICS
THAT HAD PRECEDED HIM

00:23:59.701 --> 00:24:03.171
THAT LIGHT COULD BE
UNDERSTOOD AS A WAVE

00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:06.207
AND THAT EVERY TIME
YOU SAW A WAVE OF LIGHT

00:24:06.207 --> 00:24:10.979
IT WAS ALWAYS TRAVELING BY YOU
AT SOME ENORMOUSLY FAST SPEED

00:24:10.979 --> 00:24:13.148
LIKE 186,000 MILES A SECOND.

00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.316
SO WE WERE ALWAYS
IN THE POSITION

00:24:15.316 --> 00:24:17.485
OF SOMEBODY, SAY,
STANDING ON THE BEACH

00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:19.654
WATCHING A TRAIN OF WAVES GO BY.

00:24:19.654 --> 00:24:22.257
AND WITH ANY KIND OF WAVE
THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN

00:24:22.257 --> 00:24:23.558
OR EINSTEIN HAD EVER SEEN

00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:27.028
YOU COULD ALWAYS CATCH UP
W YOU WENT FAST ENOUGH.

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:30.064
IF YOU HAD A BUNCH OF WAVES
GOING DOWN A CANAL

00:24:30.064 --> 00:24:32.667
AND YOU GOT ON YOUR HORSE
AND RODE ALONGSIDE IT

00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:34.836
YOU'D SEE THE WAVE JUST FROZEN

00:24:34.836 --> 00:24:38.306
AS IF IT WAS NOT MOVING,
BECAUSE YOU'D BE MOVING WITH IT.

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:40.909
AND EINSTEIN'S THOUGHT
TO HIMSELF WAS THIS:

00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:43.511
WHP
TO A LIGHT WAVE?

00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:46.548
WHAT IF I WENT AS FAST
AS LIGHT WAS GOING?

00:24:46.548 --> 00:24:47.849
WOULD I SEE IT STILL

00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:50.885
THE WAY THE HORSEMAN SEES
THE WAVES IN THE CANAL

00:24:51.319 --> 00:24:52.620
IF HE CATCHES UP TO IT?

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.789
AND THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:57.826
"WELL, THAT WOULD BE
SUCH A STRANGE SIGHT.

00:24:57.826 --> 00:25:01.729
"IT DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO
ANYTHING ANYONE'S EVER SEEN--

00:25:01.729 --> 00:25:03.031
A STILL WAVE OF LIGHT."

00:25:06.067 --> 00:25:10.405
Osgood:
EINSTEIN IS CONVINCED
THAT LIGHT WOULDN'T BE LIGHT

00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:12.140
IF YOU COULD CATCH UP TO IT.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.044
BUT IN CLASSICAL PHYSICS,
YOU CAN CATCH UP TO ANY WAVE

00:25:16.044 --> 00:25:17.779
AND LIGHT IS A WAVE.

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:20.815
HOW COULD IT BE THAT
THERE WAS A WAVE MOVING ALONG

00:25:20.815 --> 00:25:22.550
THAT YOU COULDN'T CATCH UP TO?

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.719
HE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:27.755
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO ARTICULATE THE PROBLEM FULLY.

00:25:27.755 --> 00:25:29.924
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG.

00:25:39.033 --> 00:25:41.636
ARE SATISFIED
WITH THE STOCK ANSWERS

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:45.106
AND NEVER GIVE THEM
ANOTHER THOUGHT AS ADULTS.

00:25:45.106 --> 00:25:49.010
BUT BECAUSE I WAS
A LATE DEVELOPER

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.781
I FIRST PONDMPLE QUESTIONS
AS AN ADULT

00:25:54.215 --> 00:25:58.553
AND SO PROBED THEM
MORE DEEPLY AND TENACIOUSLY

00:25:58.987 --> 00:26:01.155
THAN ANY CHILD WOULD DO.

00:26:06.794 --> 00:26:10.698
Osgood:
IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY
THE PROBLEM HE SEES WITH LIGHT

00:26:10.698 --> 00:26:13.735
EINSTEIN USES A SERIES
OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:16.337
THAT TAKE PLACE ONLY
IN HIS IMAGINATION

00:26:16.337 --> 00:26:19.374
LIKE A JOURNEY ON A TRAIN.

00:26:21.976 --> 00:26:24.145
Man:
FROM JAMES CLERK MAXWELL'S
EQUATIONS

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:27.181
WE KNOW THAT THE LIGHT
REFLECTED FROM MY FACE

00:26:27.181 --> 00:26:29.350
TRAVELING TOWARD THIS MIRROR

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.953
MUST MOVE AT 186,000 MILES
PER SECOND.

00:26:31.953 --> 00:26:33.254
"OKAY," EINSTEIN SAID

00:26:33.254 --> 00:26:36.291
RAIN WERE
MOVING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT?"

00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:45.833
Osgood:
ONE POSSIBILITY IS THE TRAIN
CATCHES UP TO THE LIGHT WAVES

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:48.002
SO THEY NEVER REACH THE MIRROR.

00:26:48.002 --> 00:26:51.472
BUT EINSTEIN IS CONVINCED
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN--

00:26:51.472 --> 00:26:53.641
LIGHT CAN'T STAND STILL.

00:26:56.678 --> 00:27:00.581
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN IFSEE MY
REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR?

00:27:00.581 --> 00:27:04.052
WELL, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,
EVERYTHING IS JUST FINE

00:27:04.052 --> 00:27:07.088
BUT FOR THE PERSON STANDING
OUTSIDE OF THE TRAIN

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:08.389
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:10.992
THAT PERSON SEES THE TRAIN
MOVING BY

00:27:10.992 --> 00:27:12.727
AT 186,000 MILES PER SECOND

00:27:12.727 --> 00:27:15.763
AND, THEREFORE, THE LIGHT
REFLECTED FROM MY FACE

00:27:15.763 --> 00:27:17.498
TRAVELING TOWARD THE MIRROR

00:27:17.498 --> 00:27:20.101
MUST BE TRAVELING
AT TWICE THAT RATE

00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:21.836
OR 372,000 MILES PER SECOND.

00:27:23.571 --> 00:27:27.909
Osgood:
372,000 MILES PER SECOND
IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:31.379
ADDED TO THE SPEED OF THE TRAIN
CARRYING THE LIGHT.

00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:33.982
PHYSICISTS HAVE ADDED SPEEDS
THIS WAY

00:27:33.982 --> 00:27:35.717
SINCE THE DAYS OF GALILEO.

00:27:37.018 --> 00:27:38.319
BUT EINSTEIN CONCLUDES

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:40.922
THIS SIMPLE ADDING OF VELOCITIES
IS WRONG

00:27:40.922 --> 00:27:43.958
BECAUSE THE SPEED OF LIGHT
NEVER CHANGES.

00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.561
IT'S ALWAYS
186,000 MILES PER SECOND

00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:49.163
EVEN IF ITS SOURCE IS IN MOTION.

00:27:49.163 --> 00:27:50.898
WHETHER ON OR OFF THE TRAIN

00:27:50.898 --> 00:27:53.935
YOU HAVE TO GET
THE SAME MEASUREMENT

00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:55.670
FOR THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.272
THE STUNNING
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS

00:27:58.272 --> 00:28:00.008
THAT SOMEONE OFF THE TRAIN

00:28:00.008 --> 00:28:02.610
MEASURES RULERS ON THE TRAIN
AS SHORT

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.646
AND CLOCKS ON THE TRAIN
AS RUNNING SLOW.

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.418
IN A FLASH OF BRILLIANCE

00:28:10.418 --> 00:28:15.189
EINSTEIN PROPOSES THAT DISTANCE
AND TIME ARE NOT ABSOLUTE--

00:28:15.189 --> 00:28:19.093
THAT A FOOT AND A SECOND
E TRAIN

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:23.431
ARE NOT THE SAME AS A FOOT
AND A SECOND MEASURED OFF.

00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:26.901
DISTANCE AND TIME ARE RELATIVE.

00:28:26.901 --> 00:28:28.636
HOLD ON,
WE'RE TAKING OFF.

00:28:28.636 --> 00:28:31.672
Osgood:
FORTUNATELY, THIS PHENOMENON

00:28:32.106 --> 00:28:34.709
IS ONLY NOTICEABLE
CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

00:28:40.782 --> 00:28:42.083
IMAGINE YOURSELF

00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:45.119
ALONGSIDE EARLY 20th-CENTURY
SCIENCE-FICTION SWASHBUCKLER

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:46.421
FLASH GORDON.

00:28:47.722 --> 00:28:50.324
WHEN NOT FIGHTING THE BAD GUYS

00:28:50.324 --> 00:28:52.927
OR TRYING TO ESCAPE
FROM SOME MONSTER

00:28:52.927 --> 00:28:57.698
YOU'RE DASHING AROUND THE GALAXY
AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS.

00:28:57.698 --> 00:29:01.602
WHILE YOU ARE, YOUR CLOCK
AND THOSE BACK ON EARTH

00:29:01.602 --> 00:29:03.771
ARE RUNNING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:07.241
ASSUMING YOU'VE BEEN GONE
FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR

00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:08.976
WHEN YOU GET BACK

00:29:08.976 --> 00:29:13.314
EVERYONE YOU KNEW WOULD HAVE
BEEN DEAD THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:17.218
IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE
OF RELATIVE TIME.

00:29:19.821 --> 00:29:22.423
BUT EINSTEIN ISN'T FINISHED
QUITE YET.

00:29:22.423 --> 00:29:24.158
HE STILL HAS TO CONJURE UP

00:29:24.158 --> 00:29:26.761
THE MOST FAMOUS EQUATION
OF THE CENTURY:

00:29:27.195 --> 00:29:30.105
E EQUALS MC-SQUARED.

00:29:30.105 --> 00:29:31.966
EINSTEIN REALIZED

00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:35.002
THAT NOT ONLY DOES TIME
SLOW DOWN THE FASTER YOU GO;

00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:37.605
HE ALSO REALIZED
THAT WHEN OBJECTS MOVE

00:29:37.605 --> 00:29:39.340
THEY GET HEAVIER AS THEY MOVE.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.641
IT WAS A CURIOSITY.

00:29:41.075 --> 00:29:43.678
WHY SHOULD OBJECTS GET HEAVIER
AS THEY MOVE?

00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:45.413
AND THEN HE SUDDENLY REALIZED

00:29:45.413 --> 00:29:48.883
THAT THE REASON WHY OBJECTS
GET HEAVIER AS THEY MOVE

00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:52.787
IS BECAUSE THE ENERGY OF MOTION
IS BEING CONVERTED INTO MASS.

00:29:52.787 --> 00:29:55.389
NOW, THINK ABOUT THAT
FOR A MOMENT.

00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:58.860
THE ENERGY OF MOTION
IS BEING CONVERTED INTO MASS.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.462
THIS MEANS THAT ENERGY
IS TURNING INTO MASS

00:30:01.462 --> 00:30:03.631
AND MASS IS TURNING INTO ENERGY.

00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:07.101
AND EINSTEIN QUICKLY WROTE
DOWN... IT'S ONLY ONE STEP--

00:30:07.101 --> 00:30:13.608
QUICKLY WROTE DOWN THE EQUATION
THAT RELATES ENERGY TO MATTER

00:30:13.608 --> 00:30:16.210
AND IT IS EXACTLY
E EQUALS MC-SQUARED.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.114
Osgood:
EINSTEIN'S THEORY
OF SPACE AND TIME

00:30:20.114 --> 00:30:22.717
IS CALLED SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:24.886
PHYSICISTS ARE INTRIGUED

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:27.922
BUT LITTLE CHANGES
IN EINSTEIN'S LIFE.

00:30:27.922 --> 00:30:30.525
WITH A GROWING FAMILY TO SUPPORT

00:30:30.525 --> 00:30:32.693
HE REMAINS AT THE PATENT OFFICE

00:30:32.693 --> 00:30:37.465
AND MOVES ON TO ANOTHER EVEN
GREATER INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE.

00:30:39.634 --> 00:30:40.935
SPECIAL RELATIVITY APPLIES

00:30:40.935 --> 00:30:43.104
TO OBJECTS MOVING
AT CONSTANT SPEED.

00:30:43.104 --> 00:30:47.008
BUT MOST MOVEMENT
INVOLVES ACCELERATION--

00:30:47.008 --> 00:30:49.610
SPEEDING UP OR SLOWING DOWN.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.514
SO EINSTEIN SETS OUT
TO EXTEND RELATIVITY

00:30:53.514 --> 00:30:56.025
TO COVER ACCELERATED MOTION.

00:30:56.025 --> 00:30:57.418
IT TURNS OUT TO BE

00:30:57.418 --> 00:31:01.322
E HARDEST PROBLEMS ANY
SCIENTIST HAS EVER TAKEN ON.TH

00:31:01.322 --> 00:31:04.358
EINSTEIN STRUGGLES WITH IT
FOR TEN YEARS.

00:31:04.358 --> 00:31:06.093
Kaku:
NOW, MOST OF US PHYSICISTS

00:31:06.093 --> 00:31:09.130
WHEN WE GRAPPLE WITH A PROBLEM
THAT WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.299
WE GIVE UP AND SAY,
"GOD IS MALICIOUS!

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:12.600
"HE'S A NASTY GOD.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.070
HE'S GIVING US PROBLEMS
THAT NO HUMAN CAN UNDERSTAND."

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.673
EINSTEIN DIDN'T HAVE
THAT PHILOSOPHY AT ALL.

00:31:18.673 --> 00:31:20.408
HE DIDN'T SAY
THAT GOD WAS MALICIOUS

00:31:20.408 --> 00:31:23.878
TEASING HUMANS WITH PROBLEMS
THAT WERE BEYOND HUMAN KEN.

00:31:23.878 --> 00:31:26.480
HE SAID GOD IS SUBTLE,
THAT ONLY IF WE DARE

00:31:26.914 --> 00:31:29.951
TO PENETRATE... PENETRATE
INTO THE ESSENCE OF THINGS

00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:31.686
THEN WE WOULD FIND THE ANSWER.

00:31:31.686 --> 00:31:36.023
Osgood:
TO GET TO THE ESSENCE
OF ACCELERATED MOTION

00:31:36.023 --> 00:31:39.927
EINSTEIN ONCE AGAIN TURNS
TO A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT.

00:31:41.662 --> 00:31:46.000
IMAGINE THIS ELEVATOR
WERE LOCATED IN DEEP SPACE...

00:31:49.036 --> 00:31:51.205
AND UNIFORMLY
ACCELERATING UPWARD.

00:31:51.205 --> 00:31:54.675
WITH NO WINDOWS AND NO
CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD

00:31:54.675 --> 00:31:57.712
EINSTEIN SAID IT WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO DETERMINE

00:31:58.145 --> 00:31:59.447
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MOVING.

00:31:59.447 --> 00:32:01.182
"BUT AH," YOU MIGHT SAY

00:32:01.182 --> 00:32:03.784
"I FEEL THE PRESSURE
ON MY FEET."

00:32:03.784 --> 00:32:05.519
BUT HIS RESPONSE TO THAT
WOULD BE

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:08.556
"BUT HOW DO YOU DETERMINE
WHETHER THAT PRESSURE IS CAUSED

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:10.725
"BY THE ELEVATH SPACE

00:32:10.725 --> 00:32:12.460
"WITH UNIFORM ACCELERATION

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.195
"OR BY THE ELEVATOR
SIMPLY SITTING

00:32:14.195 --> 00:32:15.930
"ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.099
AND YOUR FEELING
THE EFFECTS OF GRAVITY?"

00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:23.304
Osgood:
"THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE," SAYS EINSTEIN

00:32:23.304 --> 00:32:28.075
"MEANS ACCELERATION AND GRAVITY
MUST SOMEHOW BE THE SAME."

00:32:28.075 --> 00:32:33.209
HE CONCLUDES AFTER A SERIES OF
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX CALCULATIONS

00:32:33.209 --> 00:32:37.618
THAT THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE
IF SPACE AND TIME ARE CURVED.

00:32:39.787 --> 00:32:43.691
ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN'S THEORY
OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

00:32:43.691 --> 00:32:46.294
THE CURVATURE OF SPACE IS CAUSED

00:32:46.727 --> 00:32:49.330
BY THE PRESENCE
OF MASSIVE OBJECTS.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.932
NEWTON HAD IT RIGHT
THAT A BODY IN MOTION

00:32:51.932 --> 00:32:54.535
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION
IN A STRAIGHT LINE--

00:32:54.535 --> 00:32:57.138
THE SHORTEST DISTANCE
BETWEEN TWO POINTS--

00:32:57.138 --> 00:32:59.740
BUT IN CURVED SPACE

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:04.945
THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN
TWO POINTS IS A CURVED LINE.

00:33:04.945 --> 00:33:08.849
AN OBJECT EXPERIENCES
ACCELERATION AROUND THE CURVE

00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:11.018
AS GRAVITY.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.657
THE EARTH ORBITS THE SUN NOT
BECAUSE OF A MYSTERIOUS FORCE

00:33:16.657 --> 00:33:20.127
BUT BECAUSE THE SUN
CURVES THE SPACE AROUND IT.

00:33:20.127 --> 00:33:22.296
THE EARTH IS SIMPLY TRAVELING

00:33:22.296 --> 00:33:25.333
THE SHORTEST PATH
THROUGH CURVED SPACE.

00:33:29.236 --> 00:33:34.442
EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GENERAL
RELATIVITY PERFECTLY DESCRIBES

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:37.912
THE MOTIONS OF PLANETS,
STARS AND GALAXIES

00:33:37.912 --> 00:33:40.514
BOTH IN SPACE AND IN TIME.

00:33:40.514 --> 00:33:42.683
SUDDENLY PHYSICS
COULD SAY SOMETHING

00:33:42.683 --> 00:33:44.852
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:46.587
IT COULD ASK QUESTIONS

00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:50.491
ABOUT WHETHER THE UNIVERSE AS
A WHOLE HAD A CERTAIN CURVATURE;

00:33:50.491 --> 00:33:53.094
WHETHER IT WOULD COME BACK IN
ON ITSELF;

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:55.262
WHETHER IT WOULD
EXPAND OUT FOREVER.

00:33:55.262 --> 00:33:59.600
GENERAL RELATIVITY HAD A SCOPE
AS INFINITE AS THE UNIVERSE.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.769
THE WORLD IS NOT THE SAME PLACE

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:04.372
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND
THESE THEORIES.

00:34:04.372 --> 00:34:07.408
SPACE AND TIME ARE
SOMEHOW THE SAME THING.

00:34:07.408 --> 00:34:10.878
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM MY
EXPERIENCE AS I GO THROUGH LIFE

00:34:10.878 --> 00:34:13.481
AND I CAN NEVER GO BACK
TO LOOKING AT THINGS

00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:16.517
THE WAY THEY WERE
BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD THIS THEORY.

00:34:27.795 --> 00:34:29.964
IN 1921, ALBERT EINSTEIN
IS AWARDED

00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:32.133
THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR PHYSICS

00:34:32.133 --> 00:34:35.169
BUT IT ISN'T FOR HIS WORK
ON RELATIVITY.

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:39.507
APPARENTLY, THAT'S TOO WEIRD FOR
THE AWARDS COMMITTEE TO ACCEPT.

00:34:39.507 --> 00:34:43.411
INSTEAD, EINSTEIN IS HONORED
FOR OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS

00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:46.447
INCLUDING A PAPER
ON THE NATURE OF LIGHT.

00:34:46.447 --> 00:34:50.351
THIS PAPER ULTIMATELY LEADS TO
A SECOND REVOLUTION IN PHYSICS

00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:54.255
ONLY THIS TIME, IT'S TOO WEIRD
FOR EINSTEIN HIMSELF TO ACCEPT.

00:34:54.255 --> 00:34:57.725
IT'S CALLED "QUANTUM MECHANICS."

00:34:57.725 --> 00:35:01.195
QUANTUM MECHANICS COMES OUT
OF THE STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND

00:35:01.195 --> 00:35:02.496
THE STRUCTURE OF ATOMS.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:06.400
WHAT PHYSICISTS IN
THE EARLY 20th CENTURY LEARN IS

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.437
THAT IN THE WORLD
OF THE VERY SMALL

00:35:09.437 --> 00:35:12.473
THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE
IS COMMONPLACE.

00:35:12.473 --> 00:35:19.847
THINGS DON'T EXIST
UNTIL SOMEONE LOOKS AT THEM.

00:35:19.847 --> 00:35:22.016
TO GET FROM POINT "A"
TO POINT "B."

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.486
UNCERTAINTY AND CHANCE ARE WOVEN

00:35:25.486 --> 00:35:28.522
INTO THE VERY FABRIC
OF EXISTENCE.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.896
ONE OF THE KEY FIGURES
IN THE QUANTUM REVOLUTION

00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:38.933
IS A YOUNG DANE
WITH A TENDENCY TO MUMBLE.

00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:44.138
HE'S THE SCIENTIST ON THE RIGHT.

00:35:44.138 --> 00:35:46.307
HIS NAME IS NIELS BOHR.

00:35:49.777 --> 00:35:53.681
AND FROM CHILDHOOD,
IT'S PHYSICS THAT CONSUMES HIM.

00:35:53.681 --> 00:35:58.018
ONCE WHILE PLAYING GOALIE
IN AN IMPORTANT SOCCER GAME

00:35:58.018 --> 00:36:01.489
HE STARTS SCRIBBLING EQUATIONS
ON A GOALPOST.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.260
ONLY THE SCREAMS
OF AN ARDENT FAN

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.995
SNAP HIM OUT OF HIS REVERIE

00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:12.766
IN TIME TO STOP AN OPPOSING
PLAYER'S POTENTIAL GOAL.

00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:15.369
AT SCHOOL,
HE'S AN EXCELLENT STUDENT

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:20.140
THOUGH HE SEEMS TO HAVE
A SERIOUS PHOBIA ABOUT WRITING.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.442
AS A GRADUATE STUDENT

00:36:21.876 --> 00:36:25.779
HE DICTATES HIS ENTIRE DOCTORAL
DISSERTATION TO HIS MOTHER

00:36:25.779 --> 00:36:29.250
CAUSING A FAMILY FIGHT
WHEN HIS FATHER INSISTS

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.720
THAT THE BUDDING Ph.D.
LEARN TO WRITE FOR HIMSELF.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.021
HE NEVER DOES.

00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:38.359
AFTER HIS MARRIAGE,
HIS WIFE GETS THE JOB.

00:36:40.961 --> 00:36:44.431
IN 1912, SHORTLY AFTER
RECEIVING HIS DOCTORATE

00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:46.166
BOHR TRAVELS TO ENGLAND.

00:36:47.468 --> 00:36:50.070
ES TO ERNEST RUTHERFORD'S
BOHR TRLABORATORYNGLAND. COM

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.541
JUST ONE YEAR AFTER RUTHERFORD
MAKES A STARTLING DISCOVERY

00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:55.276
ABOUT ATOMS.

00:36:57.444 --> 00:37:01.782
ATOMS HAD BEEN SEEN AS AMORPHOUS
BLOBS OF POSITIVE CHARGE

00:37:01.782 --> 00:37:04.818
STUDDED THROUGHOUT
WITH NEGATIVE ELECTRONS.

00:37:04.818 --> 00:37:06.554
"IN FACT," RUTHERFORD SAYS

00:37:06.554 --> 00:37:09.590
"THEY'RE MORE LIKE
LITTLE PLANETARY SYSTEMS."

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.494
ALL THE POSITIVE CHARGE
AND VIRTUALLY ALL THE MASS

00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:15.663
IS CONCENTRATED
IN A TINY NUCLEUS

00:37:15.663 --> 00:37:17.831
AROUND WHICH
THE ELECTRONS ORBIT

00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:20.000
LIKE PLANETS AROUND THE SUN.

00:37:22.169 --> 00:37:29.977
THIS IS THE COURTYARD
AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY

00:37:29.977 --> 00:37:32.146
IMAGINE AN ATOM THIS SIZE.

00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:35.182
IF WE THINK OF THAT
BEING THE SIZE OF AN ATOM

00:37:35.182 --> 00:37:37.785
THEN THE SIZE OF THE NUCLEUS
WOULD ONLY BE

00:37:37.785 --> 00:37:39.520
ONE MILLIMETER IN DIAMETER.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.990
THAT'S A BIT SMALLER
THAN THIS LITTLE GRAIN OF SAND

00:37:43.424 --> 00:37:45.593
THAT I'VE GOT IN MY HAND HERE.

00:37:45.593 --> 00:37:47.328
IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT IT MEANS IS

00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:49.496
ATOMS ARE ESSENTIALLY
EMPTY SPACE.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.231
HOW CAN WE RECONCILE THAT

00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:52.967
WITH THE FACT THAT
MATTER IS MATTER

00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:55.135
AND MY HANDS DON'T GO
THROUGH ONE ANOTHER?

00:37:55.135 --> 00:37:57.738
THAT'S CRAZY, BECAUSE
IF IT'S MOSTLY EMPTY SPACE

00:37:57.738 --> 00:37:59.907
THEY SHOULD PASS
RIGHT THROUGH ONE ANOTHER.

00:37:59.907 --> 00:38:01.642
WELL, WHAT WE UNDERSTAND NOW
IS IN FACT

00:38:01.642 --> 00:38:04.244
THAT THE REASON MY HANDS
DON'T GO THROUGH ONE ANOTHER

00:38:04.244 --> 00:38:05.980
IS THAT WHILE THE SPACE IS EMPTY

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.582
WHAT IT'S FILLED WITH
IS REALLY ELECTRIC FIELDS.

00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:09.883
WHEN THE ELECTRONS COME

00:38:09.883 --> 00:38:12.486
WITHIN A VERY SMALL DISTANCE
OF EACH OTHER

00:38:12.486 --> 00:38:14.137
THEY BEGIN TO REPEL EACH OTHER

00:38:14.137 --> 00:38:17.257
SO WE HAVE THE ILLUSION
THAT THINGS ARE SOLID

00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:19.426
WHEN ACTUALLY WE HAVE
THIS TREMENDOUS VACUUM

00:38:19.426 --> 00:38:22.029
GIVEN BY THE FACT THAT
THE ATOM IS BASICALLY EMPTY.

00:38:22.029 --> 00:38:23.764
NOW, THIS MEANS

00:38:23.764 --> 00:38:26.367
THAT I'M NOT REALLY SITTING
IN THIS CHAIR AT ALL.

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:29.403
THE ATOMS OF MY BODY
ARE ABOUT ONE ANGSTROM

00:38:29.837 --> 00:38:32.439
HOVERING OVER THE ATOMS
OF THIS CHAIR.

00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:38.512
Osgood:
RUTHERFORD'S CONCEPTION
OF THE ATOM IS A BREAKTHROUGH

00:38:38.512 --> 00:38:42.416
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE FINDS
A PARADOX AT THE HEART OF IT.

00:38:42.416 --> 00:38:45.452
SEE, THE PROBLEM WAS
THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A NUCLEUS

00:38:45.452 --> 00:38:48.489
WITH A POSITIVE CHARGE
AND ELECTRONS IN ORBIT ABOUT IT

00:38:48.489 --> 00:38:51.959
THEN WE KNOW THAT THE ELECTRONS
SHOULD VERY RAPIDLY ORBIT

00:38:51.959 --> 00:38:53.694
INTO THE NUCLEUS.

00:38:53.694 --> 00:38:56.296
IT SHOULD DO IT
IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

00:38:58.032 --> 00:39:01.068
THAT'S A VERY SECURE PREDICTION
OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS

00:39:01.068 --> 00:39:02.369
AND THAT'S CATASTROPHIC.

00:39:02.369 --> 00:39:04.972
WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU
IS THAT ATOMS CAN'T EXIST.

00:39:04.972 --> 00:39:07.065
IT MEANS THAT YOU AND I
WOULD NOT EXIST.

00:39:10.177 --> 00:39:11.912
WITH THE LARGE VOLUMES
THAT THEY HAVE.

00:39:13.213 --> 00:39:16.250
Osgood:
WHEN NIELS BOHR ARRIVES
IN MANCHESTER

00:39:16.684 --> 00:39:20.154
RUTHERFORD IS READY TO ABANDON
HIS MODEL OF THE ATOM

00:39:20.154 --> 00:39:22.322
BUT BOHR SEES A WAY TO SAVE IT.

00:39:23.624 --> 00:39:24.925
HE WAS SO EXCITED.

00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:26.660
HE CANCELED HIS HONEYMOON.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.564
HE HAD TO DELAY HIS WEDDING,
CANCEL THE HONEYMOON

00:39:30.564 --> 00:39:34.902
AND HIS POOR FIANCEE, INSTEAD OF
GOING ON A LUXURIOUS HONEYMOON

00:39:34.902 --> 00:39:37.938
HAD TO TAKE DICTATION
AS HER HUSBAND DICTATED

00:39:37.938 --> 00:39:41.408
ONE OF THE GREATEST MASTERPIECES
IN PHYSICS

00:39:41.408 --> 00:39:46.613
BECAUSE HE HIMSELF COULD NOT GET
HIMSELF TO WRITE DOWN THE PAPER.

00:39:46.613 --> 00:39:49.216
Longair:
WHAT HE PROPOSED WAS

00:39:49.216 --> 00:39:51.819
THAT YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW
THE ELECTRONS TO MOVE

00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:53.554
IN ANY ORBIT ABOUT THE NUCLEUS

00:39:53.554 --> 00:39:56.156
AS YOU COULD
ACCORDING TO CLASSICAL THEORY

00:39:56.156 --> 00:39:58.759
BUT ONLY TO OCCUPY CERTAIN
VERY WELL DEFINED ORBITS

00:39:58.759 --> 00:40:00.494
ABOUT THE NUCLEUS.

00:40:00.494 --> 00:40:03.530
THERE WOULD BE AN ORBIT HERE,
AN ORBIT HERE, AN ORBIT HERE

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.868
BUT THERE WOULD NOT EXIST
ORBITS BETWEEN THESE.

00:40:10.037 --> 00:40:12.639
Man:
THERE'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:15.676
IN BETWEEN EXISTS NOTHING.

00:40:15.676 --> 00:40:17.411
AND THAT'S VERY NON-NEWTONIAN.

00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:20.013
IF YOU TAKE THE EARTH
AND YOU WOULD...

00:40:20.013 --> 00:40:23.484
YOU COULD MOVE THE EARTH
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE SUN.

00:40:23.484 --> 00:40:25.219
NO PROBLEM.

00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:27.821
WE'D HAVE A DIFFERENT ORBIT,
WE'D BE STABLE

00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:30.858
WE'D HAVE A DIFFERENT TIME
TO GO AROUND THE SUN.

00:40:30.858 --> 00:40:32.593
NO PROBLEM.

00:40:32.593 --> 00:40:36.497
THAT YOU CANNOT DO WITH
AN ELECTRON AROUND A NUCLEUS.

00:40:36.497 --> 00:40:40.400
YOU CANNOT JUST CHANGE THE ORBIT
BY A LITTLE BIT.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.437
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE IT
BY, SO TO SPEAK, A LOT.

00:40:43.437 --> 00:40:48.208
Osgood:
BOHR'S IDEA THAT ELECTRONS
CAN HAVE ONLY CERTAIN ORBITS

00:40:48.208 --> 00:40:51.245
DRAWS INSPIRATION
FROM OTHER NEW THEORIES

00:40:51.245 --> 00:40:56.016
THAT SUGGEST HEAT AND LIGHT COME
IN UNITS THAT CAN'T BE DIVIDED

00:40:56.016 --> 00:40:58.137
CALLED "QUANTA."

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:04.691
IS PRACTICALLY SACRILEGIOUS.

00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:08.595
IN FACT, MOST PHYSICISTS
DISAPPROVE OF BOHR'S THEORY.

00:41:08.595 --> 00:41:11.632
WHENEVER THEY MEET,
THEY SCOFF AT THE IDEA

00:41:11.632 --> 00:41:15.969
THAT AN ELECTRON CAN BE
IN SOME PLACES BUT NOT OTHERS;

00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:19.873
THAT MATTER COMES IN SOME SIZES
BUT NOT OTHERS.

00:41:19.873 --> 00:41:24.211
Physicist (dramatized):
IF IT'S NOT NONSENSE,
AT LEAST IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:30.717
Physicist 2 (dramatized):
THIS IS JUST A CHEAP EXCUSE
FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:41:30.717 --> 00:41:35.055
Physicist 3 (dramatized):
THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE TOO BOLD,
TOO FANTASTIC.

00:41:35.489 --> 00:41:36.790
THEY CAN'T BE RIGHT.

00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:40.694
Osgood:
IN TIME, TWO CAMPS EMERGE:

00:41:40.694 --> 00:41:42.429
A GROUP AROUND BOHR

00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:46.333
WHICH BELIEVES IN HIS SO-CALLED
QUANTUM THEORY OF MATTER;

00:41:46.333 --> 00:41:48.936
AND THOSE WHO CLING
TO THE CLASSICAL VIEW.

00:41:48.936 --> 00:41:52.406
NO LESS THAN THE TRUE PICTURE
OF NATURE IS AT STAKE.

00:41:53.707 --> 00:42:00.214
IN 1926, WERNER HEISENBERG,
A 25-YEAR-OLD GERMAN PHYSICIST

00:42:00.214 --> 00:42:04.117
COMES UP WITH A MATHEMATICAL
DESCRIPTION OF ATOMS

00:42:04.117 --> 00:42:08.455
THAT GOES A LONG WAY
TOWARD LEGITIMIZING BOHR'S VIEW.

00:42:08.455 --> 00:42:11.925
CLASSICAL PHYSICISTS
REMAIN UNCONVINCED.

00:42:11.925 --> 00:42:15.829
HEISENBERG'S MATHEMATICAL
MATRICES ARE TOO COMPLEX

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:19.299
AND THE MYSTERIOUS COMINGS
AND GTRONS

00:42:19.733 --> 00:42:21.902
GINE.
AND THE MYSTERIOUS COMINGS
AND GTRONSST TOO HARD TO IMA

00:42:24.504 --> 00:42:28.408
WITHIN A YEAR, AN AUSTRIAN NAMED
ERWIN SCHRODINGER

00:42:28.408 --> 00:42:30.143
OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE.

00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:33.614
Kaku:
SCHRODINGER HAD
THIS BEAUTIFUL THEORY

00:42:33.614 --> 00:42:35.349
OF THE ELECTRON AS A WAVE.

00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:37.517
IT WAS SMEARED OUT
OVER SPACE AND TIME.

00:42:37.517 --> 00:42:39.253
IT WASN'T A PARTICLE AT ALL.

00:42:39.253 --> 00:42:41.337
PHYSICISTS LOVED THIS IDEA.

00:42:41.337 --> 00:42:42.723
WE HAD A PHYSICAL PICTURE.

00:42:42.723 --> 00:42:44.892
WE COULD LOOK INSIDE THE ATOM.

00:42:44.892 --> 00:42:47.060
PHYSICISTS KNEW
HOW TO CALCULATE WITH WAVES.

00:42:47.494 --> 00:42:50.530
THEY CALCULATED WAVES
AS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN COLLEGE.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.567
THEY KNEW HOW WAVES WENT AROUND
AND FORMED ORBITS

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:56.603
SOPPEAL
OF THE SCHRODINGER PICTURE WAS

00:42:56.603 --> 00:42:59.206
THAT IT WAS PICTORIAL,
IT WAS ALMOST NEWTONIAN

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.676
IT WAS CONTINUOUS--
NONE OF THIS QUANTUM BUSINESS--

00:43:02.676 --> 00:43:04.845
AND YOU COULD CALCULATE WITH IT.

00:43:08.315 --> 00:43:09.616
Osgood:
SO, WHICH IS IT?

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:12.653
IS MATTER MADE UP
OF WAVES OR PARTICLES?

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:15.255
THEY SEEM TO BE
COMPLETE OPPOSITES.

00:43:15.255 --> 00:43:17.424
WAVES CAN PASS
THROUGH ONE ANOTHER

00:43:17.858 --> 00:43:20.027
SOMETIMES CANCELING EACH OTHER

00:43:20.027 --> 00:43:23.497
SOMETIMES MAKING
EVEN BIGGER WAVES.

00:43:23.497 --> 00:43:30.437
BUT PARTICLES, ON THE OTHER HAND

00:43:30.437 --> 00:43:33.473
THEY CAN'T CANCEL
EACH OTHER OUT.

00:43:34.775 --> 00:43:37.377
SO THESE TWO PICTURES CLASHED
WITH EACH OTHER

00:43:37.377 --> 00:43:39.980
AND THEY DEBATED
AND THEY HAD ARGUMENTS

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.582
AND THEY YELLED AND SCREAMED
AT EACH OTHER.

00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:45.185
IN FACT, ONE DAY
HEISENBERG WAS SO WORRIED

00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:49.957
THAT HE SIMPLY CAME DOWN
WITH HIVES AND HAY FEVER

00:43:49.957 --> 00:43:53.427
WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
THE RIVAL PICTURE WAS CORRECT.

00:43:55.162 --> 00:43:59.066
Osgood:
IN 1926, BOHR AND HEISENBERG
INVITE SCHRODINGER

00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:01.668
TO BOHR'S NEW INSTITUTE
IN COPENHAGEN

00:44:01.668 --> 00:44:04.705
TO TRY AND WORK OUT
THEIR DIFFERENCES.

00:44:04.705 --> 00:44:06.873
HEISENBERG WRITES
ABOUT THE VISIT.

00:44:06.873 --> 00:44:12.079
Heisenberg (dramatized):
THOUGH BOHR WAS AN UNUSUALLY
CONSIDERATE AND OBLIGING PERSON

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:15.549
HE WAS ABLE IN SUCH A
DISCUSSION TO INSIST FANATICALLY

00:44:15.983 --> 00:44:18.585
AND WITH ALMOST
TERRIFYING RELENTLESSNESS

00:44:18.585 --> 00:44:22.055
ON COMPLETE CLARITY
IN ALL ARGUMENTS.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.694
HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP,
EVEN AFTER HOURS OF STRUGGLING

00:44:27.694 --> 00:44:29.863
UNTIL SCHRODINGER HAD ADMITTED

00:44:29.863 --> 00:44:33.767
THAT HIS INTERPRETATION
WAS INSUFFICIENT.

00:44:33.767 --> 00:44:36.729
EVERY ATTEMPT FROM
SCHRODINGER'S SIDE

00:44:36.729 --> 00:44:38.972
TO GET ROUND THIS BITTER RESULT

00:44:38.972 --> 00:44:41.575
WAS SLOWLY REFUTED,
POINT BY POINT

00:44:41.575 --> 00:44:44.177
IN INFINITELY
LABORIOUS DISCUSSIONS.

00:44:47.647 --> 00:44:50.250
Osgood:
BOHR'S WIFE NURSES SCHRODINGER

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.419
WHEN HE FALLS ILL
FROM EXHAUSTION.

00:44:52.419 --> 00:44:54.154
SHE BRINGS HIM TEA AND CAKE

00:44:54.154 --> 00:44:56.757
EVEN AS HER HUSBAND SITS
ON THE EDGE OF THE BED

00:44:56.757 --> 00:44:58.492
CONTINUING THE ARGUMENT.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.697
STILL, SCHRODINGER CLINGS
TO HIS CLASSICAL VIEW

00:45:03.697 --> 00:45:05.432
WEARILY NOTING AT ONE POINT:

00:45:05.866 --> 00:45:08.902
"IF ONE HAS TO GO ON
WITH THESE DAMN QUANTUM JUMPS

00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:13.673
THEN I'M SORRY I EVER STARTED
TO WORK ON ATOMIC THEORY."

00:45:13.673 --> 00:45:16.276
THE ESSENCE OF
THE BOHR-HEISENBERG PICTURE

00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:18.445
WAS THAT THE ELECTRON
WAS A PARTICLE.

00:45:18.445 --> 00:45:21.481
HOWEVER, THERE WAS A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:24.084
WITH REGARDS TO WHERE
THE PARTICLE WAS.

00:45:24.084 --> 00:45:26.686
NOW, ONE DAY HEISENBERG
WAS SO PARALYZED

00:45:26.686 --> 00:45:28.855
WORRYING ABOUT
ALL THESE PROBLEMS

00:45:28.855 --> 00:45:30.590
THAT HE TOOK A WALK IN THE PARK.

00:45:31.024 --> 00:45:33.627
OUTSIDE HIS INSTITUTE,
THERE'S A FAMOUS PARK

00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:35.362
AND LATE AT NIGHT

00:45:35.362 --> 00:45:38.832
HE WALKED THROUGH THE PARK
WONDERING, "HOW CAN IT BE?

00:45:38.832 --> 00:45:41.001
"HOW CAN IT BE THAT
YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW

00:45:41.001 --> 00:45:43.170
WHERE THE ELECTRON IS?"

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.905
AND THEN IN A FLASH
HE UNDERSTOOD

00:45:44.905 --> 00:45:47.507
BECAUSE TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE AN ELECTRON IS

00:45:47.507 --> 00:45:49.676
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.

00:45:49.676 --> 00:45:52.279
TO LOOK AT IT, YOU HAVE
TO SHINE A LIGHT ON IT

00:45:52.279 --> 00:45:54.448
BUT WHEN YOU SHINE A LIGHT ON IT

00:45:54.448 --> 00:45:56.616
THAT DISTURBS
WHERE THE ELECTRON IS.

00:45:56.616 --> 00:46:00.520
SO THE VERY FACT OF OBSERVING
AN OBJECT CHANGES ITS LOCATION.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.123
THEREFORE HE REALIZE
THAT UNCERTAINTY

00:46:03.123 --> 00:46:05.292
IS AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF HIS PICTURE.

00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:09.629
Osgood:
HEISENBERG CALLS HIS INSIGHT
THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.

00:46:09.629 --> 00:46:11.798
IN A CLEAR, MATHEMATICAL WAY

00:46:11.798 --> 00:46:15.268
IT SAYS THE MORE YOU KNOW
ABOUT A PARTICLE'S POSITION

00:46:15.268 --> 00:46:19.172
THE LESS YOU CAN KNOW
ABOUT ITS SPEED AND DIRECTION.

00:46:19.172 --> 00:46:21.341
AND THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE--

00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:25.245
THE MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT
A PARTICLE'S SPEED AND DIRECTION

00:46:25.245 --> 00:46:29.149
THE LESS YOU CAN KNOW ABOUT
WHERE IT IS AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

00:46:29.149 --> 00:46:31.318
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
HAD THAT IDEA

00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:35.222
HE REALIZED THAT HE COULD MERGE
THE SCHRODINGER PICTURE

00:46:35.222 --> 00:46:37.824
WITH THE BOHR-HEISENBERG
PICTURE TO GIVE US

00:46:37.824 --> 00:46:40.861
THE MODERN-DAY THEORY
OF THE QUANTUM PRINCIPLE.

00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.331
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ELECTRON
IS A POINT PARTICLE

00:46:44.331 --> 00:46:46.500
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
QUITE WHERE IT IS

00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:49.970
AND THE PROBABILITY
OF FINDING IT AT ANY GIVEN POINT

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.572
IS GIVEN BY A WAVE--
THE SCHRODINGER WAVE.

00:46:53.006 --> 00:46:55.175
SO WE NOW HAVE
THIS BEAUTIFUL SYNTHESIS

00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:57.777
OF WAVES AND PARTICLES.

00:46:57.777 --> 00:47:03.416
HEISENBERG'S PRINCIPLE, INDEED,
IS VERY, VERY NONINTUITIVE.

00:47:03.416 --> 00:47:06.887
FRANKLY SPEAKING,
I'D CALL IT BIZARRE.

00:47:06.887 --> 00:47:09.055
BUT YOU CAN SEE IT AT WORK.

00:47:09.055 --> 00:47:11.658
SUPPOSE I HAVE
A LASER BEAM HERE

00:47:11.658 --> 00:47:13.827
AND I USE A LASER BEAM
BECAUSE IT'S BRIGHT

00:47:13.827 --> 00:47:17.731
BUT I COULD USE ANY OTHER LIGHT,
FOR THAT MATTER.

00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:23.803
AND I MAKE HERE AN OPENING--
A SLIT, A VERTICAL SLIT.

00:47:23.803 --> 00:47:29.442
AND HERE GOES THE LASER BEAM
RIGHT THROUGH THE SLIT.

00:47:29.442 --> 00:47:34.648
LIGHT GOES ON, LIGHT GOES ON

00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:36.816
AND HERE I PROJECT THIS

00:47:36.816 --> 00:47:40.287
ONTO THIS WALL OR SCREEN,
PROJECTION SCREEN.

00:47:40.287 --> 00:47:42.022
AND WHAT DO I SEE?

00:47:42.022 --> 00:47:45.058
WELL, YOU SEE
EXACTLY WHAT YOU PREDICT.

00:47:45.058 --> 00:47:48.528
YOU SEE HERE THIS LASER SPOT
FROM THIS BEAM.

00:47:48.528 --> 00:47:51.131
BUT NOW I'M GOING
TO MAKE THIS VERTICAL SLIT

00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:53.300
NARROWER AND NARROWER
AND NARROWER.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.468
WELL, NOW WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO SEE?

00:47:55.468 --> 00:47:58.505
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
EXACTLY WHAT YOU PREDICT.

00:47:58.505 --> 00:48:03.710
YOU'RE GOING TO CUT OFF
THE EDGES OF THE CIRCLE

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:08.048
AND THE SPOT GETS NARROWER
AND NARROWER AND NARROWER

00:48:08.048 --> 00:48:12.385
BUT NOW YOU COME TO THE POINT
TH

00:48:12.385 --> 00:48:15.855
IS ONLY ONE-HUNDREDTH
OF AN INCH WIDE.

00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:18.024
AND NOW
HEISENBERG'S PRINCIPLE COMES IN

00:48:18.024 --> 00:48:20.193
BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW

00:48:20.193 --> 00:48:25.398
SO PRECISELY
IN THE HORIZONTAL DIRECTION

00:48:25.398 --> 00:48:28.435
THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT
IS NO LONGER DETERMINED--

00:48:28.435 --> 00:48:30.604
ACCORDING
TO HEISENBERG'S PRINCIPLE.

00:48:30.604 --> 00:48:32.772
AND SO NOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:48:32.772 --> 00:48:35.375
IT'S GOING TO SPREAD OUT
IN A HORIZONTAL PLANE

00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:39.279
AND THEREFORE WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE ON THIS PROJECTION SCREEN

00:48:39.279 --> 00:48:41.448
IT'S GOING TO GET WIDER.

00:48:41.448 --> 00:48:45.352
EXTREMELY NONINTUITIVE,
BECAUSE WHAT AM I DOING?

00:48:45.352 --> 00:48:47.520
I'M MAKING THE SLIT NARROWER

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.689
AND NARROWER AND NARROWER
AND NARROWER

00:48:49.689 --> 00:48:51.858
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE ULTIMATELY?

00:48:51.858 --> 00:48:55.328
THAT THE BEAM, HORIZONTALLY,
BECOMES WIDER AND WIDER

00:48:55.328 --> 00:48:58.798
AND WIDER AND WIDER
AND WIDER AND WIDER AND WIDER.

00:48:58.798 --> 00:49:01.835
NOW, THAT IS VERY NONINTUITIVE

00:49:01.835 --> 00:49:04.871
BUT IT'S THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS.

00:49:05.305 --> 00:49:09.209
ACCORDING TO THE QUANTUM THEORY,
EVEN THE MOST BIZARRE EVENTS

00:49:09.209 --> 00:49:11.378
HAVE A PROBABILITY
OF TAKING PLACE.

00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:13.980
THERE'S A CERTAIN PROBABILITY
THAT I WILL DISSOLVE

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.450
AND SIMPLY REMATERIALIZE ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THAT BRICK WALL.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:18.752
NOW, YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELF

00:49:18.752 --> 00:49:21.788
"WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE--
WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE DISSOLVE

00:49:22.222 --> 00:49:24.824
AND REMATERIALIZE ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF BRICK WALLS."

00:49:24.824 --> 00:49:26.559
BUT WE ACTUALLY
GIVE THIS PROBLEM

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:29.162
TO OUR GRADUATE STUDENTS,
TO OUR Ph.D. CANDIDATES.

00:49:29.162 --> 00:49:31.765
WE ASK THEM TO CALCULATE,
USING THE QUANTUM THEORY:

00:49:31.765 --> 00:49:33.933
"WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY

00:49:33.933 --> 00:49:37.404
THAT YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF A BRICK WALL?"

00:49:37.404 --> 00:49:40.440
NOW, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT LONGER

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.609
THAN THE LIFETIME
OF THE UNIVERSE

00:49:43.043 --> 00:49:45.211
FOR SUCH AN EVENT TO TAKE PLACE.

00:49:45.211 --> 00:49:46.513
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY--

00:49:46.946 --> 00:49:48.248
YOUR ATOMS ARE NOT
GOING TO DISSOLVE

00:49:48.682 --> 00:49:50.417
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO REMATERIALIZE

00:49:50.417 --> 00:49:51.718
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF BRICK WALLS

00:49:51.718 --> 00:49:53.887
BUT THERE IS A PROBABILITY
YOU CAN CALCULATE

00:49:53.887 --> 00:49:55.188
FOR THAT EVENT HAPPENING.

00:49:55.188 --> 00:49:58.224
AND THEN YOU CAN
ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION

00:49:58.224 --> 00:50:00.827
"DO I UNDERSTAND IT?"

00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:05.165
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, "UNDERSTANDING."

00:50:05.165 --> 00:50:07.334
I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

00:50:07.334 --> 00:50:11.237
PHYSICS DESCRIBES THINGS,
DESCRIBES PHENOMENA

00:50:11.237 --> 00:50:14.201
AND AS LONG AS IT IS PREDICTABLE

00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:17.310
AS LONG AS THAT FORMALISM
APPLIED IN A CERTAIN SITUATION

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.479
GIVES YOU THE RIGHT ANSWER,
WHO CARES?

00:50:19.479 --> 00:50:22.082
WHO CARES WHAT THE MEANING IS
OF UNDERSTANDING?

00:50:22.082 --> 00:50:23.817
I THINK I LEAVE THAT UP
TO PHILOSOPHERS

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.853
AND I THINK THEY DON'T HAVE
A CLUE EITHER, OF COURSE

00:50:26.853 --> 00:50:29.022
BUT THEY... YOU KNOW.

00:50:30.757 --> 00:50:34.661
Osgood:
THERE ARE SOME PHYSICISTS
WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT

00:50:34.661 --> 00:50:38.131
THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS
REPRESENTS THE FULL STORY

00:50:38.131 --> 00:50:39.866
OF THE SUBATOMIC WORLD.

00:50:39.866 --> 00:50:42.469
THE MOST FAMOUS
IS ALBERT EINSTEIN.

00:50:42.469 --> 00:50:48.541
Einstein (dramatized):
QUANTUM MECHANICS
IS VERY WORTHY OF REGARD

00:50:48.541 --> 00:50:54.180
BUT AN INNER VOICE TELLS ME
THAT THIS IS NOT THE TRUE JACOB.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.952
THE THEORY YIELDS A LOT,
BUT IT HARDLY BRINGS US

00:50:58.952 --> 00:51:02.422
ANY CLOSER TO THE SECRET
OF THE OLD ONE.

00:51:02.422 --> 00:51:10.663
IN ANY CASE, I AM CONVINCED
THAT HE DOESN'T THROW DICE.

00:51:10.663 --> 00:51:15.001
HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE
WERE BIG PATCHES OF THE WORLD

00:51:15.001 --> 00:51:18.037
ABOUT WHICH WE COULD NOT KNOW,
AND HIS IDEA

00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:22.375
FROM EARLY ON IN HIS LIFE ALL
THE WAY TO THE END OF HIS LIFE

00:51:22.375 --> 00:51:24.110
WAS THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.014
A SET OF EQUATIONS
DETERMINISTIC, CAUSAL, ORDERED

00:51:28.014 --> 00:51:29.749
FORMULATED IN SUCH A WAY

00:51:29.749 --> 00:51:33.653
THAT THEY COULD TELL US
EVERYTHING ABOUT A FUTURE

00:51:33.653 --> 00:51:36.689
IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE PRESENT.

00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:38.858
AND QUANTUM MECHANICS
WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.

00:51:39.292 --> 00:51:40.953
HE COULDN'T STAND THAT IDEA.

00:51:44.063 --> 00:51:49.269
Osgood:
THE WORLD'S GREATEST PHYSICISTS
GATHER IN BRUSSELS IN 1927.

00:51:49.269 --> 00:51:51.438
EINSTEIN CHALLENGES BOHR

00:51:51.438 --> 00:51:55.341
AND THE IDEA THAT
UNCERTAINTY RULES THE WORLD.

00:51:55.341 --> 00:51:58.378
WERNER HEISENBERG WRITES
IN HIS DIARY.

00:51:58.378 --> 00:52:02.282
Heisenberg (dramatized):
WE ALL STAYED
AT THE SAME HOTEL.

00:52:02.282 --> 00:52:04.884
THE DISCUSSION USUALLY
STARTED AT BREAKFAST

00:52:04.884 --> 00:52:08.354
WITH EINSTEIN SERVING US UP
AN IMAGINARY EXPERIMENT

00:52:08.354 --> 00:52:11.825
BY WHICH HE THOUGHT
HE HAD DEFINITELY REFUTED

00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:13.560
THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.295
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY

00:52:15.295 --> 00:52:17.464
WE WOULD HAVE DISCUSSIONS
ON THE MATTER

00:52:17.464 --> 00:52:21.367
AND AS A RULE, BY SUPPERTIME
WE WOULD HAVE REACHED THE POINT

00:52:21.367 --> 00:52:23.536
WHERE NIELS BOHR
COULD PROVE TO EINSTEIN

00:52:23.536 --> 00:52:25.705
THAT EVEN HIS LATEST EXPERIMENT

00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:28.308
FAILED TO SHAKE
THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE.

00:52:30.043 --> 00:52:32.645
EINSTEIN WOULD LOOK
A BIT WORRIED

00:52:32.645 --> 00:52:35.248
BUT BY NEXT MORNING
HE WAS READY

00:52:35.248 --> 00:52:40.887
WITH A NEW IMAGINARY EXPERIMENT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THE LAST.

00:52:40.887 --> 00:52:44.791
Osgood:
ONE OF EINSTEIN'S CHALLENGES
IS SO CLEVER

00:52:44.791 --> 00:52:50.430
IT HAS BOHR DEEPLY CONCERNED FOR
THE FUTURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.032
PHYSICIST LEON ROSENFELD WRITES.

00:52:53.032 --> 00:52:56.069
Rosenfeld (dramatized):
BOHR DID NOT SEE THE SOLUTION.

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:58.671
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SIGHT

00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:02.575
OF THE TWO ANTAGONISTS
LEAVING THE HALL--

00:53:02.575 --> 00:53:06.913
EINSTEIN, A TALL MAJESTIC
FIGURE, WALKING QUIETLY

00:53:06.913 --> 00:53:09.516
WITH A SOMEWHAT IRONIC SMILE

00:53:09.516 --> 00:53:13.419
AND BOHR TROTTING NEAR HIM,
VERY EXCITED.

00:53:16.456 --> 00:53:20.360
DURING THE WHOLE EVENING,
BOHR WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.396
GOING FROM ONE SCIENTIST
TO ANOTHER

00:53:23.396 --> 00:53:27.300
TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM
THAT IT COULDN'T BE TRUE

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.071
THAT IT WOULD BE THE END OF
PHYSICS IF EINSTEIN WERE RIGHT.

00:53:34.674 --> 00:53:38.578
Osgood:
BOHR SPENDS A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
IN HIS HOTEL ROOM

00:53:38.578 --> 00:53:42.048
BEFORE HE DISCOVERS A FLAW
IN EINSTEIN'S ARGUMENT.

00:53:42.048 --> 00:53:45.084
IRONICALLY, IT INVOLVES
A SUBTLE APPLICATION

00:53:45.084 --> 00:53:47.687
OF EINSTEIN'S
OWN THEORY OF RELATIVITY.

00:53:49.422 --> 00:53:51.591
BOHR AND EINSTEIN ARE
AN ASTONISHING PAIR

00:53:51.591 --> 00:53:53.326
IN MANY WAYS.

00:53:53.326 --> 00:53:56.362
THEY LOVED EACH OTHER, THEY
LOVED TALKING TO EACH OTHER

00:53:56.362 --> 00:53:58.965
THEY LOVED ENGAGING
WITH EACH OTHER'S IDEAS

00:53:58.965 --> 00:54:02.435
AND YET THEY WANTED SUCH UTTERLY
DIFFERENT THINGS FROM PHYSICS

00:54:02.869 --> 00:54:05.038
THAT THEY NEVER REALLY
COULD SEE EYE TO EYE.

00:54:05.038 --> 00:54:11.544
Osgood:
"GOD DOES NOT THROW DICE" WAS
EINSTEIN'S UNSHAKABLE PRINCIPLE

00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:16.316
ONE THAT HE WOULD NOYBODY TO C
HALLENGE...

00:54:16.316 --> 00:54:20.219
TO WHICH BOHR COULD ONLY
COUNTER: "NOR IS IT OUR BUSINESS

00:54:20.219 --> 00:54:23.690
TO PRESCRIBE TO GOD
HOW HE SHOULD RUN THE WORLD."

00:54:28.461 --> 00:54:30.630
EINSTEIN AND BOHR

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.534
HAVE THEIR LAST BATTLE ABOUT
QUANTUM MECHANICS IN 1933.

00:54:34.534 --> 00:54:38.004
BY THIS TIME, BOTH RELATIVITY
AND QUANTUM THEORY

00:54:38.004 --> 00:54:41.474
ERSALLY ACCEPTED
BY THIS TIME, BOTH RELATIVITY
ANBY PHYSICISTSORYST UNIV

00:54:41.474 --> 00:54:45.812
AS THE MOST POWERFUL IDEAS THEY
HAVE FOR EXPLAINING THE WORLD.

00:54:45.812 --> 00:54:48.848
NOW ATTENTION SHIFTS
TO ANOTHER CHALLENGE--

00:54:48.848 --> 00:54:51.451
FIGURING OUT WHAT GOES ON
INSIDE THE ATOM.

00:54:51.451 --> 00:54:55.355
PHYSICISTS WANT TO KNOW
WH NUCLEUS TOGETHER.

00:54:55.355 --> 00:54:57.957
THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF PROTONS, ELECTRONS

00:54:57.957 --> 00:55:00.126
AND THE
NEWLY DISCOVERED NEUTRONS

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.162
MAKE UP EVERYTHING
IN THE UNIVERSE

00:55:03.162 --> 00:55:05.331
OR IF THESE PARTICLES

00:55:05.331 --> 00:55:08.368
ARE MADE UP OF SOMETHING
EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTAL.

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:12.271
IN THE PROCESS, WHAT BEGINS
AS AN INTELLECTUAL QUEST

00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:14.874
TURNS OUT TO HAVE
EXPLOSIVE CONSEQUENCES.

00:55:20.947 --> 00:55:26.152
IN THE EARLY 1930s, ALBERT
EINSTEIN EMIGRATES TO AMERICA

00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:28.755
TO ESCAPE THE RISING TIDE

00:55:28.755 --> 00:55:32.225
OF FASCISM
AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN GERMANY.

00:55:32.225 --> 00:55:36.996
BEFORE THE DECADE ENDS, MANY
OF EUROPE'S FINEST SCIENTISTS

00:55:36.996 --> 00:55:39.599
ARE FORCED TO MAKE
THE SAME JOURNEY.

00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:44.370
AMONG THE LAST TO LEAVE
IS NIELS BOHR.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.840
HE ARRIVES
IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1939

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.877
BRINGING WITH HIM STUNNING NEWS.

00:55:53.913 --> 00:55:55.648
IN HITLER'S GERMANY

00:55:55.648 --> 00:55:58.685
TWO SCIENTISTS HAVE SPLIT
AN ATOM OF URANIUM

00:55:58.685 --> 00:56:00.853
RELEASING IN THAT MOMENT

00:56:00.853 --> 00:56:04.323
SOME OF THE TREMENDOUS
ENERGY BOUND UP IN MATTER.

00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:11.698
USING SIMPLE EQUIPMENT
WIDELY AVAILABLE

00:56:11.698 --> 00:56:16.469
THEY PRODUCE THE FIRST EVIDENCE
FROM A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT

00:56:16.469 --> 00:56:19.505
OF EINSTEIN'S FAMOUS EQUATION:
E EQUALS MC-SQUARED.

00:56:22.323 --> 00:56:24.058
I WAS IN BERKELEY

00:56:24.058 --> 00:56:26.660
AND PEOPLE HAD GONE
TO THE MEETING IN WASHINGTON

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.130
WHERE BOHR BROUGHT HIS NEWS,
AND THEY CALLED UP AND SAID

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:32.299
"GOSH, THIS IS AMAZING--
CAN YOU DO IT?"

00:56:32.299 --> 00:56:35.769
AND IN A DAY OR TWO,
TWO OR THREE PEOPLE HAD DONE IT.

00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:37.938
I COULD SEE
THE BIG SPIKES OF FISSION

00:56:37.938 --> 00:56:42.276
ON THE OSCILLOSCOPE SCREEN

00:56:42.276 --> 00:56:46.180
EVERYBODY KNEW THIS WAS GOING
TO BE A WARTIME DEVICE.

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:52.253
Osgood:
AT A SUPER-SECRET FACILITY
DEEP IN NEW MEXICO SCRUBLAND

00:56:52.686 --> 00:56:53.988
THE U.S. ARMY ASSEMBLES A TEAM

00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:56.542
OF AMERICAN AND TRANSPLANTED
EUROPEAN PHYSICISTS--

00:57:00.494 --> 00:57:08.302
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:14.375
WE WERE GALVANIZED BY THE NOTION
THAT THE GERMANS WERE AHEAD

00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:17.411
BECAUSE THEY HAD SPENT A LOT
OF MONEY, THEY WERE VERY GOOD

00:57:17.411 --> 00:57:20.447
THIS WAS DISCOVERED IN GERMANY,
THEY HAD ABLE PEOPLE.

00:57:20.447 --> 00:57:23.484
ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT THEY HAD LOST SO MUCH

00:57:23.484 --> 00:57:25.653
BY DESTROYING THE COMMUNITY
AS THEY HAD DONE.

00:57:25.653 --> 00:57:27.821
IT WAS LUCKY.

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:34.762
Osgood:
AMERICANS HAVE THE TALENT AND
PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED RESOURCES.

00:57:34.762 --> 00:57:38.232
IN LESS THAN FIVE YEARS,
$2 BILLION CREATES

00:57:38.232 --> 00:57:42.136
A NUCLEAR PROJECT THE SIZE
OF THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY.

00:57:44.305 --> 00:57:47.775
YET UNTIL THE VERY END,
NO ONE CAN SAY FOR SURE

00:57:47.775 --> 00:57:55.583
THE PRODUCT
OF ALL THIS EFFORT WILL WORK.

00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:58.185
RELATIVITY, E EQUALS MC-SQUARED,
WAS KNOWN

00:58:00.354 --> 00:58:03.390
BUT IT WAS NOT KNOWN
HOW TO PUT IT ALL TOGE

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:06.860
SO THESE PHYSICISTS, SOME OF
THE BRIGHTEST MINDS OF THE WORLD

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:10.331
WERE CONCENTRATED AT LOS ALAMOS
NOT TO DISCOVER NEW PHYSICS

00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:14.234
BECAUSE THAT WAS ALREADY DONE BY
THE BOHRS AND BY THE EINSTEINS;

00:58:14.234 --> 00:58:15.970
THEY WERE ASSEMBLED TO SEE

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.572
WHETHER OR NOT
IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK.

00:58:20.307 --> 00:58:22.910
WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT
THE PLUTONIUM SPHERE

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.079
IN CONTACT WITH A HIGH EXPLOSIVE

00:58:25.079 --> 00:58:27.681
I WAS QUITE SCARED
ABOUT HIGH EXPLOSIVE.

00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:29.416
AND ROGER WARNER

00:58:29.416 --> 00:58:31.934
WHO WAS IN CHARGE
OF THAT PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY

00:58:31.934 --> 00:58:35.055
HE WAS CALM AND HE SAID,
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:58:35.489 --> 00:58:38.525
"YOU CAN'T RUN VERY FAR
IN A MILLISECOND ANYHOW

00:58:38.525 --> 00:58:42.429
SO YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS IF IT GOES OFF WRONGLY."

00:58:45.899 --> 00:58:49.370
IT WAS A NEW WORLD--
EVERYONE COULD SEE THAT.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.840
MAYBE IT WOULD BE THE END
OF THE WAR, THAT WAS VERY GOOD

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.442
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT WAS
GOING TO COME AFTER THAT?

00:58:55.442 --> 00:58:56.744
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

00:58:56.744 --> 00:58:58.912
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
MORE THAN WE DID.

00:59:00.648 --> 00:59:04.118
Kaku:
IT WAS THIS FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE
OF TAKING THEORY

00:59:04.118 --> 00:59:06.286
THEORIES THAT WERE EQUATIONS

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.246
AND BUILDING SOMETHING
OF ENORMOUS POWER

00:59:09.246 --> 00:59:11.492
THE POWER OF THE SUN.

00:59:12.793 --> 00:59:16.263
BUT JUST LIKE THE OPENING
OF PANDORA'S BOX

00:59:16.263 --> 00:59:19.299
PERHAPS HUMANITY WAS NOT READY
FOR COSMIC FIRE;

00:59:19.299 --> 00:59:21.468
PERHAPS HUMANITY WAS
NTURE ENOUGH

00:59:21.902 --> 00:59:25.806
TO HANDLE THE POWER OF THE SUN
NOW BEING PLACED ON THE EARTH.

00:59:44.826 --> 00:59:48.730
THERE'S A UNIVERSE UP THERE
THAT WE CAN'T SEE WITH OUR EYES

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:51.766
EVEN IF WE HAVE SOMETHING
1,000 TIMES LARGER THAN THIS.

00:59:51.766 --> 00:59:54.803
WE HAVE TO TURN TO
A DIFFERENT KIND OF TELESCOPE--

00:59:54.803 --> 00:59:57.839
ONE WITHOUT LENSES OR MIRRORS
OR ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS

00:59:57.839 --> 01:00:00.442
ASTRONOMERS HAVE RELIED UPON
FOR CENTURIES.

01:00:00.442 --> 01:00:04.345
THIS INVISIBLE UNIVERSE
HAS TO BE SEEN WITH TELESCOPES

01:00:04.345 --> 01:00:08.249
THAT USE RADIO WAVES, X RAYS,
INFRARED RAYS OR GAMMA RAYS.

01:00:08.249 --> 01:00:11.719
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE GIVES
OFF RADIATION OF SOME KIND.

01:00:12.153 --> 01:00:15.190
FOR EXAMPLE, THE GLAZE ON
THIS TEACUP EMITS GAMMA WAVES.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.792
IMAGINE THAT IT IS A GALAXY

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:20.829
AND THIS GEIGER MULTITUBE
A CRUDE RAY TELESCOPE.

01:00:21.262 --> 01:00:26.034
(tube clicking rapidly)

01:00:26.468 --> 01:00:28.636
IN THE SECOND HALF
OF THE 20th CENTURY

01:00:28.636 --> 01:00:31.673
ASTRONOMERS START EXPLORING
THE HEAVENS WITH INSTRUMENTS

01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:35.577
THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF RADIATION.

01:00:35.577 --> 01:00:36.878
AND WHEN THEY DO

01:00:36.878 --> 01:00:40.348
IT'S LIKE LIFTING A VEIL
FROM THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:49.023
Osgood:
ONE OF THE MOST SURPRISING
DISCOVERIES

01:00:49.023 --> 01:00:50.325
OF POST-WAR AS

01:00:50.325 --> 01:00:54.229
IS MADE WITH THIS DEVICE, BUILT
OUTSIDE CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND.

01:00:55.964 --> 01:00:59.434
IT MAY LOOK LIKE 4 1/2 ACRES
OF LAUNDRY LINE

01:00:59.434 --> 01:01:01.603
BUT IT'S REALLY
A RADIO TELESCOPE.

01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:05.507
AS THE EARTH ROTATES

01:01:05.507 --> 01:01:10.278
MILES OF ANTENNA WIRE RECEIVE
RADIO SIGNALS DAY AND NIGHT.

01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:16.351
WHEN IT GOES INTO OPERATION
IN 1967

01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:18.953
JOCELYN BELL GETS THE TASK
OF RUNNING IT.

01:01:20.567 --> 01:01:23.725
WITHIN MONTHS, THE YOUNG
GRADUATE STUDENT NOTICES

01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:25.894
SOMETHING SHE'S NEVER
SEEN BEFORE.

01:01:27.195 --> 01:01:30.665
IT'S A FUNNY BLIP ON ONE
OF THE LONG ROLLS OF CHART PAPER

01:01:30.665 --> 01:01:33.268
USED TO RECORD
WHAT THE TELESCOPE SEES.

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.605
THE FIRST FEW TIMES I SAW IT

01:01:37.605 --> 01:01:40.208
I JUST PUT A QUESTION MARK BY IT
AND PASSED ON.

01:01:43.678 --> 01:01:45.413
I THINK MINE

01:01:45.413 --> 01:01:48.883
THINGS THAT IT CAN'T RESOLVE,
THINGS THAT IT CAN'T COPE WITH

01:01:48.883 --> 01:01:51.920
BECAUSE THIS CURIOUS
LITTLE SIGNAL

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.691
OCCUPIED ABOUT A QUARTER
OF AN INCH IN 400 FOOT.

01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:01.462
AND YET, SOMEHOW MY BRAIN STORED
THAT WAY, WAY BACK SOMEWHERE

01:02:01.462 --> 01:02:03.198
BUT IT STORED IT.

01:02:03.198 --> 01:02:06.668
AND AFTER IT HAD DEALT WITH
THIS PROBLEM A COUPLE OF TIMES

01:02:06.668 --> 01:02:08.403
AND IT FACED IT THE THIRD TIME

01:02:08.403 --> 01:02:11.439
IT SAID, "I'VE SEEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE."

01:02:13.608 --> 01:02:16.644
Osgood:
SHE IMMEDIATELY CALLS
HER THESIS ADVISOR

01:02:16.644 --> 01:02:18.379
RADIO ASTRONOMER ANTONY HEWISH.

01:02:18.813 --> 01:02:23.151
HE'S INTRIGUED, BUT CAUTIONS
THE SIGNAL IS PROBABLY MAN-MADE.

01:02:26.187 --> 01:02:27.922
BELL GOES BACK TO HER CHARTS

01:02:27.922 --> 01:02:30.959
AND FIGURES OUT WHEN THE SIGNAL
SHOULD COME AGAIN.

01:02:33.127 --> 01:02:36.164
SHE SETS HER INSTRUMENTS
TO RECORD A MORE DETAILED IMAGE

01:02:36.164 --> 01:02:39.200
AND DISCOVERS THE SIGNAL
IS A STRING OF PULSES

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.237
EXACTLY ONE AND A THIRD
SECONDS APART.

01:02:44.839 --> 01:02:47.875
NEVER BEFORE HAS A TELESCOPE
OF ANY KIND

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:52.213
FOUND SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:55.250
HEAVENLY BODIES
DON'T JUST PULSE ON AND OFF.

01:03:00.021 --> 01:03:02.190
LOOK AT THE SUN--
IS THE SUN DOING THIS?

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:04.359
LOOK AT THE MOON--
IS THE MOON DOING THIS?

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:06.961
LOOK AT ALL THE STARS
IN THE SKY.

01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:09.130
LOOK AT THEM
WITH YOUR NAKED EYE.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:12.166
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE GO...

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:15.203
AND ONE WAY OUT--
IT DIDN'T EXPLAIN EVERYTHING--

01:03:15.203 --> 01:03:16.938
BUT ONE WAY OUT WAS TO SAY

01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:21.276
WELL, MAYBE IT'S LITTLE GREEN
MEN SENDING A SIGNAL TO US.

01:03:30.818 --> 01:03:34.289
I THINK THEY WERE
TOTALLY SHELL-SHOCKED

01:03:34.289 --> 01:03:36.457
THAT THIS POSSIBILITY EXISTED.

01:03:36.457 --> 01:03:40.795
THEY REALIZED IT WOULD BE
THE DISCOVERY OF THE CENTURY.

01:03:40.795 --> 01:03:42.530
IF WE GET IN TOUCH...

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:45.133
SOMEHOW RECEIVE SIGNALS
FROM CIVILIZATIONS.

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:50.338
Bell-Burnell:
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU HAVE
REALLY PICKED UP SIGNALS

01:03:50.772 --> 01:03:53.374
FROM ANOTHER CIVILIZATION?

01:03:53.374 --> 01:03:59.013
DO YOU TELL THE PRESIDENT,
THE PRESS OR THE POPE FIRST?

01:04:02.917 --> 01:04:05.463
Osgood:
BEFORE THEY CAN TELL
ANYONE ANYTHING

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.460
SHE HEADS OUT TO THE ANTENNA
ON A COLD NOVEMBER NIGHT

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.761
TO CHECK IT OUT.

01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:16.798
AND I CAME OUT ON MY SCOOTER

01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:19.400
SLITHERING ALL OVER THE PLACE
ON THE ICE

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.135
AND WHEN I GOT HERE

01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:24.172
THE MACHINERY WASN'T WORKING
PROPERLY BECAUSE OF THE COLD.

01:04:24.172 --> 01:04:29.377
BUT I FLICKED SWITCHES,
I KICKED IT, I CURSED IT

01:04:29.377 --> 01:04:30.244
I BREATHED HOT AIR ON IT

01:04:30.678 --> 01:04:32.413
AND I GOT IT TO WORK
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:34.148
AND IT WAS
THE RIGHT FIVE MINUTES

01:04:34.148 --> 01:04:35.883
AND IT WAS THE RIGHT SETTING

01:04:35.883 --> 01:04:38.052
SO IT WAS LOOKING
AT THE RIGHT BIT OF SKY.

01:04:38.052 --> 01:04:42.390
AND IN CAME
FOOP, FOOP, FOOP, FOOP

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:45.426
VERY LIKE THE FIRST LOT,
BUT NOT TOTALLY THE SAME.

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:47.161
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT--

01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:50.198
ONE AND A QUARTER SECONDS
INSTEAD OF ONE AND A THIRD.

01:04:50.198 --> 01:04:52.800
AND THAT SETTLES
THE LITTLE GREEN MEN QUESTION

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.535
BECAUSE IT'S SO UNLIKELY

01:04:54.535 --> 01:04:57.138
THERE'LL BE TWO LOTS
OF LITTLE GREEN MEN

01:04:57.138 --> 01:04:58.439
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE SKY

01:04:58.439 --> 01:05:02.777
BOTH DECIDING TO SIGNAL
TO AN INCONSPICUOUS PLANET

01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:05.380
AND USING A NOT
VERY INTELLIGENT WAY

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.681
OF DOING IT ALSO.

01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:08.850
SO IT HAD TO BE
SOMETHING STELLAR.

01:05:10.151 --> 01:05:13.187
Osgood:
THE NEWS OF BELL'S PULSING STARS
SPREADS RAPIDLY

01:05:13.187 --> 01:05:14.922
THROUGH THE ASTROPHYSICS
COMMUNITY.

01:05:14.922 --> 01:05:18.393
IT IS CLEARLY
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.

01:05:18.393 --> 01:05:20.995
WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY PULSE
IS A REAL MYSTERY.

01:05:20.995 --> 01:05:22.730
...FORMED IN A ROTATING MEDIUM

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.899
SO IF YOU TAKE
A LARGE OBJECT COLLAPSING

01:05:24.899 --> 01:05:25.767
IT ROTATES ENOUGH

01:05:25.767 --> 01:05:27.502
AND YOU GO BACK
TO THE OLD ARGUMENT

01:05:27.831 --> 01:05:29.237
THAT MAYBE IT BREAKS UP.

01:05:29.237 --> 01:05:30.972
PERHAPS IT'S A WHITE DWARF.

01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:32.707
PERHAPS THE RESIDUE DOESN'T...

01:05:32.707 --> 01:05:36.177
Osgood:
FINALLY, A PHYSICIST CONNECTS
WHAT BELL HAS FOUND

01:05:36.177 --> 01:05:40.081
WITH AN OLD THEORY
ABOUT THE DEATH THROES OF STARS.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.286
THIS THEORY, LONG ASSUMED
TO BE UNTESTABLE, PREDICTS

01:05:45.286 --> 01:05:48.756
THAT WHEN A LARGE ENOUGH STAR
RUNS OUT OF NUCLEAR FUEL

01:05:48.756 --> 01:05:53.094
IT WILL COLLAPSE AND CRUSH
THE ATOMS WITHIN IT.

01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:58.299
WHAT'S LEFT IS LIKE
NOTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE--

01:05:58.299 --> 01:06:03.504
AN INCREDIBLY DENSE OBJECT MADE
ALMOST ENTIRELY OF NEUTRONS.

01:06:04.806 --> 01:06:08.276
EVERY OPEN SPACE
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF--

01:06:08.276 --> 01:06:12.180
BETWEEN ELECTRONS IN THE ATOMS--
IS SQUEEZED OUT

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.348
AND IT BECOMES ONE HUGE NUCLEUS.

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:19.120
AND ELECTRONS ARE PUSHED INTO
THE PROTONS, FORMING NEUTRONS.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.289
THAT'S WHY WE CALLED THEM
NEUTRON STARS.

01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:28.229
A NEUTRON STAR HAS TYPICALLY
A RADIUS OF ABOUT...

01:06:28.229 --> 01:06:30.398
TEN KILOMETERS, SIX MILES.

01:06:30.398 --> 01:06:33.000
BUT THE AMOUNMATTER
IN A NEUTRON STAR

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.603
IS A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN THE TOTAL MASS...

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:38.206
ISTHE TOTAL MATTERRE
THAT WE HAVE IN THE SUN.

01:06:40.374 --> 01:06:43.845
A SPOONFUL OF THIS
NEUTRON STAR MATTER WOULD WEIGH

01:06:44.278 --> 01:06:46.447
IF YOU LIKE THE WORD "WEIGHING"

01:06:46.447 --> 01:06:48.616
IN POUNDS,
IT'S TWO TIMES 10 TO THE 11.

01:06:48.616 --> 01:06:57.725
IT'S A TWO WITH 11 ZEROS POUNDS,
IN ONE SPOONFUL.

01:07:01.629 --> 01:07:05.967
Osgood:
NEUTRON STARS CAN ROTATE
UP TO 700 TIMES A SECOND.

01:07:05.967 --> 01:07:08.569
AS THEY DO, THEIR POWERFUL
MAGNETIC FIELDS

01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:10.304
RIP THROUGH SPACE

01:07:10.304 --> 01:07:14.642
BLASTING RADIO WAVES OUTWARD
LIKE A GALACTIC LIGHTHOUSE.

01:07:17.678 --> 01:07:20.715
IT'S THAT BEACON
THAT JOCELYN BELL SEES

01:07:20.715 --> 01:07:22.884
WITH HER RADIO TELESCOPE.

01:07:33.728 --> 01:07:37.198
THEORY HAD SAID
THAT NEUTRON STARS ARE POSSIBLE

01:07:37.198 --> 01:07:41.102
BUT FOR DECADES, ASTRONOMERS
AND PHYSICISTS CLUNG TO THE VIEW

01:07:41.102 --> 01:07:43.704
THAT THEY'RE JUST TOO WEIRD
TO BE REAL.

01:07:44.138 --> 01:07:46.741
BELL'S DISCOVERY
IS DRAMATIC CONFIRMATION

01:07:46.741 --> 01:07:49.777
THAT THE UNIVERSE IS STRANGER
AND MORE FANTASTIC

01:07:49.777 --> 01:07:53.681
THAN ANYTHING WE EXPERIENCE
IN OUR CORNER OF THE COSMOS.

01:07:58.452 --> 01:08:00.621
THE REALITY OF NEUTRON STARS

01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:04.959
STIRS EXCITEMENT THAT
BLACK HOLES MAY ALSO BE REAL.

01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:07.562
THEY ARE PERHAPS
THE MOST FANTASTIC

01:08:07.562 --> 01:08:11.032
AND UNLIKELY PREDICTION
EVER MADE BY PHYSICISTS.

01:08:14.936 --> 01:08:19.707
WORLD WAR I HAD JUST BROKEN OUT
WHEN ALBERT EINSTEIN PUBLISHES

01:08:19.707 --> 01:08:22.310
HIS GENERAL THEORY
OF RELATIVITY.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.478
AMONG THOSE FIGHTING
ON THE RUSSIAN FRONT

01:08:24.478 --> 01:08:26.519
IS A GERMAN ASTRONOMER
AND PHYSICIST

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.816
NAMED KARL SCHWARZSCHILD.

01:08:28.816 --> 01:08:33.154
WITH THE WAR RAGING AROUND HIM,
SCHWARZSCHILD DISCOVERS

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:36.624
THAT EINSTEIN'S EQUATIONS
PREDICT THE EXISTENCE

01:08:36.624 --> 01:08:39.226
OF A STAR SO UNIMAGINABLY DENSE

01:08:39.226 --> 01:08:42.263
THAT EVEN LIGHT
CANNOT ESCAPE IT.

01:08:43.998 --> 01:08:48.336
FROM THE BENDS
EINSTEIN HIS CALCULATIONS.

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:51.806
JUST WEEKS AFTER RECEIVING
EINSTEIN'S REPLY

01:08:51.806 --> 01:08:54.408
SCHWARZSCHILD DIES
ON THE FRONT LINES.

01:08:57.783 --> 01:09:00.915
EINSTEIN MARVELS
AT SCHWARZSCHILD'S WORK.

01:09:00.915 --> 01:09:04.819
BUT HE NEVER ACCEPTS THAT
SUCH A STAR COULD REALLY EXIST.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:08.289
AS HE PUTS IT,
"IT JUST DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT."

01:09:17.398 --> 01:09:21.736
THROUGH THE 1960s, MOST
SCIENTISTS AGREE WITH EINSTEIN.

01:09:21.736 --> 01:09:25.206
BUT THE PUBLIC IS COMPLETELY
TAKEN WITH THE IDEA

01:09:25.206 --> 01:09:28.242
OF A DARK STAR FROM WHICH
ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE

01:09:28.242 --> 01:09:31.278
WHERE TIME AND SPACE
CEASE TO EXIST.

01:09:37.351 --> 01:09:39.086
WE ARE FALLING.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.821
TOWARDS WHAT? I WONDER.

01:09:40.821 --> 01:09:43.858
ZEN, PUT FORWARD
COORDINATE 890 ON VISUAL.

01:09:43.858 --> 01:09:44.725
Zen:
CONFIRMED.

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:47.328
Woman:
BUT THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

01:09:47.328 --> 01:09:49.497
ZEN, USE LONG-
RANGE INTENSIFIER.

01:09:51.232 --> 01:09:53.834
THREE GUESSES,
IF Y

01:09:55.136 --> 01:09:57.304
A BLACK HOLE.

01:09:57.304 --> 01:10:01.208
MY GOD, WE'RE FALLING
INTO A BLACK HOLE.

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:06.847
Osgood:
THE EXISTENCE
OF A REAL BLACK HOLE

01:10:06.847 --> 01:10:09.884
IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR PHYSICISTS TO ACCEPT

01:10:09.884 --> 01:10:15.089
YET MANY HAVE TO ADMIT

01:10:15.089 --> 01:10:18.125
SHOULD ALSO CREATE BLACK HOLES.

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:23.330
WHEN A STAR HAS BURNED UP
ALL ITS NUCLEAR FUEL

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.933
AND THERE IS NO LONGER HEAT
THAT PUSHES IT OUT

01:10:25.933 --> 01:10:29.403
THE CORE COLLAPSES AND
AND THERE IS NO LONGER HEAT
IT CAN FORM A NEUTRON STAR...T

01:10:29.403 --> 01:10:32.440
THIS COLLAPSE CAN BE SO STRONG

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.645
DEPENDING UPON THE ORIGINAL MASS
OF THE STAR, THAT IT OVERSHOOTS

01:10:38.079 --> 01:10:40.247
AND DOESN'T BECOME
A NEUTRON STAR

01:10:40.247 --> 01:10:45.019
BUT BECOME EVEN SMALLER, AND
THEN IT CAN BECOME A BLACK HOLE.

01:10:45.019 --> 01:10:48.055
IF YOU TAKE THE EARTH,
TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:51.525
AND YOU TAKE A VISE, A BIG VISE,
AND YOU SQUEEZE THE EARTH--

01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:54.562
THE EARTH HAS A RADIUS
OF 6,400 KILOMETERS--

01:10:54.562 --> 01:10:56.731
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE RADIUS
THREE CENTIMETERS

01:10:57.164 --> 01:10:58.899
THE EARTH WOULD BECOME
A BLACK HOLE.

01:10:58.899 --> 01:11:00.201
THREE CENTIMETERS-- THIS BIG.

01:11:00.634 --> 01:11:03.671
THEN IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY
FURTHER COLLAPSE ONTO ITSELF.

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:06.273
NOTHING COULD STOP IT, AND
IT WOULD BECOME A BLACK HOLE.

01:11:06.273 --> 01:11:09.744
AND LIGHT COULD NEVER LEAVE IT.

01:11:09.744 --> 01:11:11.912
BECAUSE THEY ALL GO
AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

01:11:16.684 --> 01:11:20.154
Osgood:
FINDING SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T GIVE OFF LIGHT--

01:11:20.154 --> 01:11:24.058
OR ANY OTHER KIND OF RADIATION--
IS TRICKY, TO SAY THE LEAST.

01:11:24.439 --> 01:11:26.227
IT'S NOT UNTIL THE EARLY '70s

01:11:26.227 --> 01:11:29.697
THAT ASTRONOMERS STUMBLE
ON THE FIRST INDIRECT EVIDENCE

01:11:29.697 --> 01:11:32.733
OF A BLACK HOLE.

01:11:32.733 --> 01:11:36.637
THE FIRST CLUE COMES
WHEN X-RAY TELESCOPES REVEAL

01:11:36.637 --> 01:11:39.673
AN AREA OF INTENSE
VIOLENCE AND TEMPERATURE

01:11:39.673 --> 01:11:41.842
IN THE CONSTELLATION CYGNUS.

01:11:41.842 --> 01:11:44.879
PAUL MURDIN IS ONE
OF MANY ASTRONOMERS

01:11:44.879 --> 01:11:47.047
WHO BEGIN TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA.

01:11:47.047 --> 01:11:51.385
WORKING WITH LOUISE WEBSTER,
HE FINDS A SUPERGIANT STAR

01:11:51.385 --> 01:11:53.988
ORBITING SOMETHING
THEY CAN'T SEE.

01:11:56.157 --> 01:11:59.627
LOGICALLY, THE SUPERGIANT
MUST BE CIRCLING

01:11:59.627 --> 01:12:02.229
A MUCH SMALLER AND DENSER STAR--

01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:06.567
ONE SO DENSE ITS GRAVITY IS
SUCKING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MATTER

01:12:06.567 --> 01:12:08.302
FROM ITS LARGER COMPANION.

01:12:08.736 --> 01:12:11.338
ONLY THIS COULD PRODUCE
THE INTENSE X RAYS

01:12:11.338 --> 01:12:13.507
OTHER ASTRONOMERS HAD DETECTED.

01:12:15.242 --> 01:12:17.411
FURTHER MEASUREMENTS REVEAL

01:12:17.411 --> 01:12:20.014
GRAVITY
FURTHEMUST BE GREATERREVEAL'S

01:12:20.014 --> 01:12:22.616
THAN ANYTHING DISCOVERED BEFORE.

01:12:22.616 --> 01:12:25.653
THE ONLY EXPLANATION
IS A BLACK HOLE.

01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:33.894
THERE IS STILL NO ABSOLUTE PROOF
THAT BLACK HOLES EXIST

01:12:33.894 --> 01:12:36.063
BUT FROM THE 1970s ON

01:12:36.063 --> 01:12:39.533
MOST SCIENTISTS HAVE COME
TO ACCEPT THEM AS REAL--

01:12:39.533 --> 01:12:41.702
INCREDIBLY STRANGE, BUT REAL.

01:12:41.702 --> 01:12:43.871
Lewin:
WHEREAS WITH A NEUTRON STAR

01:12:43.871 --> 01:12:46.473
AT LEAST YOU CAN IMAGINE
IT HAS A SURFACE

01:12:46.473 --> 01:12:48.642
AND YOU CAN LAND
ON THAT SURFACE.

01:12:48.642 --> 01:12:52.546
AND OKAY, IT IS A MIND-BOGGLING
MAGNETIC FIELD, ALL RIGHT

01:12:52.546 --> 01:12:54.281
BUT SO BE IT, IT'S THERE.

01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:56.884
AND OKAY, IT ROTATES
700 TIMES PER SECOND.

01:12:56.884 --> 01:12:59.486
BUT A BLACK HOLE HAS NO SURFACE

01:12:59.486 --> 01:13:03.824
SO YOU CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT
A SURFACE THAT ROTATES AROUND.

01:13:03.824 --> 01:13:08.596
IT DOESN'T EXIST, AND THERE IS
NOTIMETHAT YOU CAN DEFINE.

01:13:08.596 --> 01:13:10.764
THAT'S PRETTY BIZARRE.

01:13:10.764 --> 01:13:14.235
THAT GOES BEYOND,
TOTALLY BEYOND MY IMAGINATION

01:13:14.235 --> 01:13:16.403
I'LL BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU.

01:13:16.403 --> 01:13:19.006
BUT YET, IT'S ONE
OF MY SPECIALTIES.

01:13:19.006 --> 01:13:21.175
I MEASURE THEM, I FIND THEM.

01:13:21.175 --> 01:13:23.777
CAN I ENVISION THEM?

01:13:23.777 --> 01:13:25.512
NO.

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:31.585
Osgood:
CURRENT THEORY HOLDS

01:13:31.585 --> 01:13:34.622
THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS OF
BLACK HOLES IN THE UNIVERSE

01:13:34.622 --> 01:13:38.092
INCLUDING ENORMOUS ONES AT
THE CENTER OF MOST GALAXIES.

01:13:42.863 --> 01:13:46.767
THESE ARE SO LARGE,
THEY MUST HAVE DEVOURED MILLIONS

01:13:46.767 --> 01:13:49.370
PERHAPS EVEN BILLIONS OF STARS.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.876
BUT EVEN THE BIRTH AND GROWTH
OF BLACK HOLES

01:13:55.876 --> 01:13:57.611
AREN'T NEARLY AS FANTASTIC

01:13:57.611 --> 01:14:00.648
AS THE CREATION OF
THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.

01:14:06.287 --> 01:14:08.022
Osgood:
FOR MOST OF HUMAN EXISTENCE

01:14:08.455 --> 01:14:10.624
THE QUESTION OF HOW
EVERYTHING BEGAN

01:14:10.624 --> 01:14:13.661
IS ONE THAT ONLY RELIGION
DARED TO ANSWER.

01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:15.829
BUT
DISCOVERY

01:14:15.829 --> 01:14:20.601
THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING,
SOME SCIENTISTS BEGIN TO BELIEVE

01:14:20.601 --> 01:14:23.575
THAT THEY TOO MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO OFFER.

01:14:23.575 --> 01:14:26.240
THEIR REASONING GOES
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.975
IF THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING

01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:30.577
THEN IN THE PAST,
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SMALLER.

01:14:30.577 --> 01:14:31.879
GO FAR ENOUGH BACK

01:14:32.313 --> 01:14:34.915
AND EVN
CRUNCHED TOGETHER

01:14:34.915 --> 01:14:37.084
IN A POINT OF INFINITE DENSITY.

01:14:37.084 --> 01:14:39.687
OUR UNIVERSE BEGAN, THEY SUGGEST

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:41.422
WHEN THAT POINT EXPLODED

01:14:41.422 --> 01:14:44.892
CREATING THE EXPANSION
LL SEE TODAY.

01:14:44.892 --> 01:14:49.663
THIS VISION COMES TO BE CALLED
THE BIG BANG THEORY OF CREATION.

01:14:49.663 --> 01:14:53.567
AT THE START OF THE 1960s,
SCIENTISTS ARE EQUALLY DIVIDED

01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:55.302
BETWEEN THIS BIG BANG THEORY

01:14:55.302 --> 01:14:58.772
AND A COMPETING NOTION
THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ETERNAL

01:14:58.772 --> 01:15:00.507
CALLED THE STEADY-STATE THEORY.

01:15:00.507 --> 01:15:03.978
BUT THERE'S NO REAL HARD
EVIDENCE FOR EITHER ONE.

01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:06.146
IN FACT, ALMOST NO ONE EXPECTS

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:08.315
THE DEBATE WILL EVER
BE RESOLVED.

01:15:11.785 --> 01:15:13.954
IN THE EARLY '60s, ROBERT DICKE

01:15:13.954 --> 01:15:16.557
AN ASTROPHYSICIST
AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY

01:15:16.557 --> 01:15:19.159
COMES UP WITH WHAT HE THINKS
IS A WAY TO TEST

01:15:19.159 --> 01:15:22.629
WHETHER OR NOT THE UNIVERSE
STARTED WITH A BIG BANG.

01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:24.798
HE'S CONVINCED
THAT IF IT HAPPENED

01:15:24.798 --> 01:15:28.702
THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE SHOULD BE
FILLED WITH RADIATION

01:15:28.702 --> 01:15:30.871
LEFT FROM THE MOMENT
OF CREATION.

01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:34.775
Man:
BOB DICKE'S REASONING
WAS QUITE INTERESTING.

01:15:34.775 --> 01:15:38.679
HE REASONED THAT IF THE UNIVERSE
HAD GONE THROUGH

01:15:38.679 --> 01:15:40.414
THIS BIG BANG PHASE

01:15:40.414 --> 01:15:43.017
IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HOT
AND VERY DENSE

01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:46.487
AND THERE MUST HAVE A LOT OF
HEAT RADIATION

01:15:46.487 --> 01:15:47.788
VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE

01:15:47.788 --> 01:15:50.391
AND HE COULDN'T FIND
ANY THEORETICAL WAY

01:15:50.391 --> 01:15:52.559
TO GET RID OF THIS RADIATION.

01:15:52.559 --> 01:15:53.861
IT MUST STILL BE AROUND.

01:15:53.861 --> 01:15:56.897
IT MUST STILL BE AROUND.OOLE
D OFF BECAUSE
THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED

01:15:56.897 --> 01:16:00.367
BUT IT MUST STILL BE AROUND
AND IN THE MICROWAVE BAND

01:16:00.367 --> 01:16:02.102
THE BAND WHERE RADAR WORKS.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.476
Osgood:
IT'S A TRULY AMAZING
POSSIBILITY--

01:16:09.476 --> 01:16:11.211
15-BILLION-YEAR-OLD HEAT

01:16:11.211 --> 01:16:13.814
TRANSFORMED BY
THE EXPANSION OF SPACE

01:16:13.814 --> 01:16:15.549
INTO LOW-LEVEL RADIO STATIC

01:16:15.549 --> 01:16:18.585
THAT PERMEATES EVERY CORNER
OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:16:18.585 --> 01:16:21.622
IF IT'S THERE,
THE ONLY COSMOLOGICAL THEORY

01:16:21.622 --> 01:16:25.526
THAT CAN EXPLAIN HOW IT
GOT THERE IS THE BIG BANG.

01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:29.430
NICE THING ABOUT
DICKE'S THEORY IS...

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.900
Osgood:
DICKE CONVINCES DAVID WILKINSON
AND ANOTHER YOUNG PHYSICIST

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:34.635
TO BUILD AN ANTENNA

01:16:34.635 --> 01:16:37.237
AND SEARCH FOR THIS COSMIC
BACKGROUND RADIATION.

01:16:37.237 --> 01:16:40.274
...FIT ON A VERY SPECIFIC CURVE
CALLED THE BLACK BODY CURVE.

01:16:40.274 --> 01:16:42.876
Wilkinson:
WE WEREN'T IN ANY
PARTICULAR HURRY

01:16:43.255 --> 01:16:45.479
BECAUSE BOB DICKE'S IDEA
WAS SO ORIGINAL.

01:16:45.479 --> 01:16:47.214
WE WEREN'T TOO WORRIED

01:16:47.214 --> 01:16:50.250
ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE
GETTING THERE BEFORE WE DID.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.853
SO WE CHARGED AHEAD
RATHER SLOWLY.

01:16:52.853 --> 01:16:55.889
WE HAD NO MICROWAVE EQUIPMENT
AT ALL.

01:16:55.889 --> 01:16:58.492
WE HAD TO ORDER THINGS NEW.

01:16:58.492 --> 01:17:01.962
WE WENT DOWN TO ARCH STREET
IN PHILADELPHIA

01:17:01.962 --> 01:17:05.866
AND DUG AROUND IN
THE WORLD WAR II SURPLUS SHOPS

01:17:05.866 --> 01:17:08.469
TO FIND THINGS THAT WERE CHEAP.

01:17:08.469 --> 01:17:12.372
BOB DICKE IS A RATHER
FRUGAL EXPERIMENTALIST

01:17:12.372 --> 01:17:16.710
SO IF WE COULD FIND IT IN
THE JUNK SHOP, WE DID THAT.

01:17:18.743 --> 01:17:21.915
Osgood:
THIS IS THE ANTENNA
THAT RESULTED.

01:17:21.915 --> 01:17:24.952
IT'S CAREFULLY CALIBRATED
USING SUPER-COLD HELIUM.

01:17:25.385 --> 01:17:27.121
WHILE WILKINSON IS BUILDING IT

01:17:27.121 --> 01:17:30.157
TWO OTHER SCIENTISTS,
JUST 30 MILES AWAY

01:17:30.157 --> 01:17:31.892
ARE SETTING UP AN EXPERIMENT

01:17:31.892 --> 01:17:35.362
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE BIG BANG.

01:17:38.398 --> 01:17:40.567
WITH COLLEAGUE ARNO PENZIAS

01:17:40.567 --> 01:17:44.037
BOB WILSON PLANS TO USE
THIS MICROWAVE ANTENNA

01:17:44.037 --> 01:17:45.772
TO STUDY OUR GALAXY.

01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:47.941
UNAWARE OF DICKE'S IDEA.
TO STUDY OUR GALAXY. HE'S

01:17:47.941 --> 01:17:50.978
IN FACT, HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN THE BIG BANG

01:17:50.978 --> 01:17:55.315
BUT PREFERS A UNIVERSE
WITH NO BEGINNING OR END.

01:17:55.315 --> 01:17:57.050
Man:
I LIKED THE STEADY STATE.

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:59.653
IT'S PHILOSOPHICALLY SATISFYING

01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:04.424
BECAUSE THERE'S NO END
TO THE UNIVERSE IN THE FUTURE.

01:18:04.424 --> 01:18:08.328
IT GOES ON FOREVER IN THE SAME
SORT OF STATE THAT IT IS.

01:18:08.328 --> 01:18:10.931
AND THERE'S NO BEGINNING
FOR IT, EITHER.

01:18:10.931 --> 01:18:13.534
SO PHYSICISTS GENERALLY
LIKE STEADY STATE

01:18:13.967 --> 01:18:17.004
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE
TO HAVE TO HAVE A TIME

01:18:17.004 --> 01:18:19.606
BEYOND WHICH THEY
CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:18:21.341 --> 01:18:24.811
Osgood:
WILSON AND PENZIAS ARE THEN
JUST GETTING STARTED

01:18:24.811 --> 01:18:26.547
ON THEIR SCIENTIFIC CAREERS.

01:18:26.547 --> 01:18:28.715
THEY HAVE NO DESIRE
TO CONFRONT A PROBLEM

01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:32.186
AS DIFFICULT AS WHETHER OR NOT
THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING.

01:18:32.186 --> 01:18:36.957
THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME
SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.897
Wilson:
DOING SCIENCE BY OURSELVES
WAS A GREAT NEW ADVENTURE.

01:18:43.897 --> 01:18:46.500
WE SORT OF HAD A CHANCE
AT BELL LABS

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.970
TO BECOME SCIENTISTS--
YOU KNOW, IN THE REAL SENSE--

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:53.874
AND MAKE USE OF
THIS UNIQUE INSTRUMENT

01:18:53.874 --> 01:18:58.212
AND, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
DEVOTED OURSELVES TO IT.

01:19:00.814 --> 01:19:03.417
Osgood:
WILSON AND PENZIAS BELIEVE

01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:06.887
THE HOLMDEL ANTENNA WILL MAKE
A GREAT RADIO TELESCOPE

01:19:06.887 --> 01:19:09.056
BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED TO REJECT

01:19:09.056 --> 01:19:11.225
ALL EXTRANEOUS SIGNALS,
OR NOISE.

01:19:12.526 --> 01:19:15.895
VERY FIRST TIME
ALL EXTRANEOUS SIGNALS,
THEY USE ITUT FROM THE

01:19:15.895 --> 01:19:20.767
EXTRANEOUS NOISE IS EXACTLY
WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE PICKING UP.

01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:23.370
Wilson:
EVERY TIME WE STARTED UP

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:25.105
WE SAW THE SAME NOISE LEVEL.

01:19:25.105 --> 01:19:27.274
EVERYWHERE IN THE SKY WE POINTED

01:19:27.274 --> 01:19:29.443
WE SAW THE SAME NOISE LEVEL.

01:19:29.443 --> 01:19:33.780
Osgood:
IT ISN'T A LOT OF NOISE,
BUT THEY FEAR IT'S ENOUGH

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.383
TO COMPROMISE
SOME OF THEIR RESEARCH.

01:19:36.383 --> 01:19:39.419
SO THEY DECIDE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING IT

01:19:39.419 --> 01:19:41.154
AND GET RID OF IT.

01:19:43.323 --> 01:19:45.926
THEY CHECK TO SEE
IF IT'S THERE AT NIGHT.

01:19:45.926 --> 01:19:51.131
THEY CHECK TO SEE IF IT'S THERE
IN DIFFERENT SEASONS.

01:19:52.866 --> 01:19:55.035
THEY CHECK ALL POSSIBLE
GROUND-BASED SOURCES

01:19:55.035 --> 01:19:57.204
OF RADIO NOISE.

01:19:59.373 --> 01:20:02.409
THEY CHECK THE ANTENNA ITSELF
AND TAPE ALL ITS JOINTS.

01:20:04.578 --> 01:20:08.048
THEY DOUBLE-CHECK EVERY PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT IN THE SYSTEM.

01:20:08.048 --> 01:20:11.084
AND THE NOISE IS ALWAYS THERE.

01:20:15.856 --> 01:20:18.025
WITH FEW ALTERNATIVES
LEFT TO TRY

01:20:18.025 --> 01:20:20.983
THEY DECIDE TO CHECK
A REAL LONG SHOT.

01:20:24.965 --> 01:20:27.567
Wilson:
A SET OF PIGEONS
HAD STARTED ROOSTING

01:20:27.567 --> 01:20:31.038
UP IN THE THROAT OF THE THING,
AND OF COURSE THEY'D COATED IT

01:20:31.038 --> 01:20:33.206
WITH THE SAME WHITE
PIGEON DROPPINGS

01:20:33.206 --> 01:20:36.243
THAT YOU SEE ON STATUES
AND SO FORTH IN THE CITY.

01:20:36.243 --> 01:20:38.845
WE GOT A LADDER
FROM THE CARPENTERS

01:20:38.845 --> 01:20:42.749
AND A COUPLE OF PUSH BROOMS
AND SOME SCRUB BRUSHES

01:20:42.749 --> 01:20:44.918
AND SCRAPED OFF
THE DIFFICULT ONES

01:20:44.918 --> 01:20:47.954
AND SWEPT THE WHOLE THING OUT.

01:20:51.425 --> 01:20:53.160
Osgood:
THEY CHECK AGAIN

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.630
AND REALIZE THEY COULD HAVE
LEFT THE PIGEONS ALONE.

01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:59.666
A YEAR OF THIS STRUGGLE
HAS LEFT THEM CONVINCED

01:20:59.666 --> 01:21:01.401
THE ANTENNA IS FINE.

01:21:01.401 --> 01:21:04.871
THE ONLY POSSIBILITY LEFT,
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

01:21:05.305 --> 01:21:08.342
IS THAT EVERY CORNER
OF THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED

01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:10.077
WITH THE SAME NOISE.

01:21:10.077 --> 01:21:14.414
DESPERATE, THEY BEGIN CALLING
OTHER ASTRONOMERS FOR HELP

01:21:14.414 --> 01:21:17.017
AND ONE SUGGESTS
CALLING BOB DICKE.

01:21:17.017 --> 01:21:20.053
AND THE PHONE RANG,
AND BOB PICKED IT UP

01:21:20.053 --> 01:21:23.523
AND IT WAS TWO GUYS FROM
BELL LABS WHO HAD A PROBLEM

01:21:23.523 --> 01:21:27.861
WHICH AT FIST DIDN'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH US.

01:21:27.861 --> 01:21:30.030
WE DIDN'T LEARN VERY MUCH
ON THE TELEPHONE

01:21:30.464 --> 01:21:33.066
BUT THEY AGREED TO COME OUT
AND SEE WHAT WE HAD DONE

01:21:33.066 --> 01:21:35.235
AND TELL US ABOUT
WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND.

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:38.271
UH, HE HUNG UP THE PHONE

01:21:38.271 --> 01:21:40.874
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.

01:21:40.874 --> 01:21:42.175
THESE ARE HIS EXACT WORDS.

01:21:42.175 --> 01:21:44.778
HE SAID, "WELL, BOYS,
WE'VE BEEN SCOOPED."

01:21:46.513 --> 01:21:50.417
Osgood:
ROBERT WILSON AND ARNO PENZIAS
HAD ALREADY HEARD

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:52.152
THE ECHO OF THE BIG BANG.

01:21:52.152 --> 01:21:55.188
THEIR ANNOYING BACKGROUND NOISE
WAS, IN FACT

01:21:55.188 --> 01:21:59.092
NOTHING LESS THAN A WHISPER
FROM CREATION ITSELF.

01:22:05.599 --> 01:22:09.069
IN THE BEGINNING,
SOME 15 BILLION YEARS AGO

01:22:09.503 --> 01:22:12.973
THE UNIVERSE EXPLODED
FROM A SINGLE POINT.

01:22:17.744 --> 01:22:24.684
LESS THAN ONE MINUTE LATER, IT'S
A MILLION BILLION MILES ACROSS.

01:22:24.684 --> 01:22:26.853
IT STILL HAS
AN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE

01:22:26.853 --> 01:22:28.588
OF A BILLION DEGREES.

01:22:37.264 --> 01:22:40.734
THE UNIVERSE CONTINUES
TO EXPAND AND COOL.

01:22:40.734 --> 01:22:43.770
GRADUALLY, GRAVITY
DRAWS TOGETHER ATOMS

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:49.409
AND THEN CLUMPS OF ATOMS.

01:22:49.409 --> 01:22:51.578
AND GALAXIES ARE CREATED.

01:23:26.279 --> 01:23:30.617
EVENTUALLY, AROUND SOME
OF THE STARS, PLANETS FORM

01:23:30.617 --> 01:23:34.521
AND ON AT LEAST ONE,
LIFE BEGINS.

01:23:49.703 --> 01:23:54.040
IF EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE
BEGAN IN A SINGLE POINT

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.643
IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER
WHAT IT TOOK

01:23:57.077 --> 01:24:00.981
TO GO FROM SUCH ULTIMATE
SIMPLICITY TO ALL OF THIS.

01:24:00.981 --> 01:24:04.451
MANY PHYSICISTS BELIEVE
THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME

01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:08.788
THERE WAS ONLY A SINGLE PARTICLE
GOVERNED BY A SINGLE FORCE.

01:24:08.788 --> 01:24:12.692
FROM THAT STARTING POINT, WITHIN
A TINY FRACTION OF A SECOND

01:24:12.692 --> 01:24:15.729
PARTICLES LIKE PROTONS
AND ELECTRONS EVOLVED

01:24:16.162 --> 01:24:19.633
AND FORCES LIKE GRAVITY
AND MAGNETISM CAME INTO BEING

01:24:19.633 --> 01:24:22.669
BUT DID THE UNIVERSE
HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS?

01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:25.705
COULD IT HAVE TURNED OUT
ANY OTHER WAY?

01:24:25.705 --> 01:24:29.175
PERHAPS IF WE CAN WORK BACK
TO THE MOMENT OF CREATION

01:24:29.609 --> 01:24:31.778
TO THAT ULTIMATE PARTICLE
AND FORCE

01:24:31.778 --> 01:24:35.682
WE'LL COME TO UNDERSTAND WHY
THE UNIVERSE IS THE WAY IT IS

01:24:35.682 --> 01:24:37.417
AND EVEN TO EXPRESS IT

01:24:37.417 --> 01:24:40.453
IN WHAT PHYSICISTS CALL
"THE FINAL THEORY"

01:24:40.453 --> 01:24:44.791
WHICH, IT'S HOPED, CAN BE
CAPTURED IN A SINGLE EQUATION

01:24:45.225 --> 01:24:47.394
THAT CAN FIT ON A T-SHIRT.

01:24:47.394 --> 01:24:50.864
THIS MAY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

01:24:58.238 --> 01:25:01.274
WHEN WE LOOK AT NATURE,
WE SEE THE COMPLEXITIES

01:25:01.274 --> 01:25:03.443
THE DIFFERENCES AMONG THINGS.

01:25:04.744 --> 01:25:07.781
BUT SCIENTISTS TEND
TO LOOK FOR THE CONNECTIONS

01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:10.817
THE SIMPLICITY THAT LIES
AT THE HEART OF IT ALL.

01:25:14.287 --> 01:25:17.757
Man:
THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT NATURE,
THE SIMPLER IT LOOKS.

01:25:17.757 --> 01:25:20.360
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK
WE WILL FIND A FINAL THEORY

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.963
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I CAN IMAGINE
THINGS GETTING

01:25:22.963 --> 01:25:25.999
INFINITELY MORE COMPLICATED,
COMPLICATION WITHOUT END

01:25:25.999 --> 01:25:28.055
I CAN'T IMAGINE
SIMPLICITY WITHOUT END.

01:25:28.055 --> 01:25:30.770
THE WHOLE PROGRESS
OF PHYSICS HAS BEEN

01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:34.240
TOE
DESCRIPTION OF NATURE

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.409
AND HOW SIMPLE CAN THINGS GET?

01:25:36.409 --> 01:25:38.578
SIMPLICITY MUST
FINALLY TERMINATE.

01:25:38.578 --> 01:25:40.747
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING SO SIMPLE

01:25:40.747 --> 01:25:46.820
THAT WE CAN'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING MORE SIMPLE.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.815
Osgood:
BUT IN THE YEARS
FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II

01:25:49.815 --> 01:25:51.157
PHYSICISTS ARE STUNNED

01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:55.495
TO FIND THEIR DREAM OF ULTIMATE
SIMPLICITY SLIPPING AWAY.

01:25:55.495 --> 01:25:58.098
EXPERIMENTS MEANT
TO REVEAL SIMPLICITY

01:25:58.098 --> 01:25:59.833
FIND EVER GREATER COMPLEXITY.

01:26:05.038 --> 01:26:08.074
Newsreel announcer:
BERKELEY CALIFORNIA,
HOME OF THE BEVATRON.

01:26:08.508 --> 01:26:10.677
THE B.E.V. STANDS FOR
BILLIONS OF ELECTRON VOLTS...

01:26:10.677 --> 01:26:13.279
WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL
ATOM SMASHER.

01:26:15.015 --> 01:26:18.051
Osgood:
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF THE ERA OF BIG SCIENCE.

01:26:19.352 --> 01:26:21.521
GIANT ATOM SMASHERS ARE BUILT

01:26:21.521 --> 01:26:24.991
TO ACCELERATE SUBATOMIC
PARTICLES TOS

01:26:25.425 --> 01:26:27.594
AND SMASH THEM INTO OTHER ATOMS.

01:26:27.594 --> 01:26:31.498
Galison:
EACH NEW ACCELERATOR BUILT
AFTER THE WAR WAS MORE POWERFUL

01:26:31.498 --> 01:26:33.667
THAN THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE.

01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:36.703
EACH WAS ABLE TO RAM PARTICLES
INTO EACH OTHER HARDER

01:26:36.703 --> 01:26:40.607
AND TO SHOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AT A SMALLER AND SMALLER SCALE.

01:26:40.607 --> 01:26:42.776
IT WAS JUST
LIKE THE TELESCOPES.

01:26:42.776 --> 01:26:44.944
WITH EACH NEW TELESCOPE
THAT WAS BUILT

01:26:44.944 --> 01:26:48.415
YOU COULD SEE FURTHER OUT
INTO SPACE, GATHER MORE LIGHT

01:26:48.415 --> 01:26:50.583
RESOLVE OBJECTS MORE PRECISELY.

01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:52.318
WITH EACH NEW ACCELERATOR

01:26:52.318 --> 01:26:54.921
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE
DEEPER INTO MATTER

01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:59.693
MORE PRECISELY, BETTER
RESOLUTION, SMALLER SCALE.

01:26:59.693 --> 01:27:01.861
Osgood:
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE TRACKS

01:27:01.861 --> 01:27:04.898
OF THE OBJECTS PRODUCED
IN THESE ACCELERATORS

01:27:04.898 --> 01:27:07.067
REVEAL A MULTITUDE
OF NEW PARTICLES

01:27:07.067 --> 01:27:09.235
THAT SEEM JUST AS FUNDAMENTAL

01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:12.272
AS THE FAMILIAR PROTCTRON.

01:27:12.272 --> 01:27:16.176
Kaku:
WE WERE LITERALLY DROWNING
IN SUBATOMIC PARTICLES.

01:27:16.176 --> 01:27:18.778
ONE YEAR,
OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATION

01:27:18.778 --> 01:27:23.116
J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, FATHER
OF THE ATOMIC BOMB, STATED

01:27:23.116 --> 01:27:24.417
THAT THE PHYSICIST

01:27:24.417 --> 01:27:27.887
WHO DOES NOT DISCOVER
A NEW PARTICLE THAT YEAR

01:27:27.887 --> 01:27:30.924
SHOULD WIN
THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS.

01:27:30.924 --> 01:27:33.960
THERE WERE HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF PARTICLES

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.430
WHICH LOOKED JUST AS
ELEMENTARY AS THE PROTON.

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:40.900
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT
IF ELEMENTARY MEANT ANYTHING

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.937
EITHER THERE WAS SOMETHING
MORE ELEMENTARY

01:27:45.672 --> 01:27:47.841
OR PERHAPS THEY WERE
ALL ELEMENTARY--??

01:27:48.274 --> 01:27:49.142
A FRIGHTENING IDEA.

01:27:50.877 --> 01:27:54.347
Osgood:
AMONG THE PHYSICISTS UNHAPPY
WITH ALL THIS COMPLICATION

01:27:54.347 --> 01:27:57.383
IS A BRASH YOUNG THEORIST
NAMED MURRAY GELL-MANN.

01:27:59.552 --> 01:28:00.854
BY THE AGE OF 25

01:28:01.287 --> 01:28:04.758
GELL-MANN IS ALREADY WELL KNOWN
IN THE WORLD OF PHYSICS

01:28:05.191 --> 01:28:08.228
FOR HIS ENCYCLOPEDIC INTERESTS
AND KNOWLEDGE

01:28:08.228 --> 01:28:09.963
HIS QUICK AND CREATIVE MIND

01:28:09.963 --> 01:28:12.999
AND HIS FREQUENTLY ABRASIVE
PERSONAL STYLE.

01:28:14.615 --> 01:28:16.469
A COLLEAGUE SAYS OF HIM

01:28:16.469 --> 01:28:20.373
AY HAS NO
PARTICULAR TALENT FOR PHYSICSRR

01:28:20.373 --> 01:28:24.711
BUT HE'S SO SMART,
HE'S A GREAT PHYSICIST ANYWAY."

01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:27.747
THE IMPORTANT THING IS FIRST TO
STEEP YOURSELF IN THE PROBM

01:28:27.747 --> 01:28:30.784
TO LOOK AT THE PUZZLE,
ALL THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.

01:28:30.784 --> 01:28:33.820
Osgood:
BY LOOKING FOR PATTERNS
AND SYMMETRIES

01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.121
GELL-MANN FINDS A WAY

01:28:35.121 --> 01:28:37.724
TO ORGANIZE ALL THE NEWLY
DISCOVERED PARTICLES

01:28:37.724 --> 01:28:39.025
INTO FAMILIES.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.363
THEN, INSPIRED
BY A CHANCE ENCOUNTER

01:28:43.363 --> 01:28:46.833
DURING A VISIT TO COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK

01:28:46.833 --> 01:28:49.435
HE TAKES A GIANT STEP
TOWARD SIMPLICITY.

01:28:51.604 --> 01:28:55.074
Kaku:
OVER LUNCH, A PHYSICIST
APPROACHED HIM AND SAID

01:28:55.074 --> 01:28:58.978
"ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR
THEORIES COULD BE EXPLAINED

01:28:58.978 --> 01:29:02.882
BY POSTULATING THREE EVEN
MORE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES?"

01:29:02.882 --> 01:29:06.786
WELL, EYONE AT THAT TABLE
DISMISSED THAT IDEA IMMEDIATELY

01:29:06.786 --> 01:29:11.124
AND THEY P TO
THIS PHYSICIST WHAT WAS WRONG.

01:29:11.124 --> 01:29:14.160
YOU WOULD HAVE FRACTIONALLY
CHARGED PARTICLES

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.329
AN OUTRAGEOUS, RIDICULOUS IDEA

01:29:16.763 --> 01:29:18.064
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNEW

01:29:18.064 --> 01:29:22.402
THAT PARTICLES WERE EITHER
PLUS ONE OR MINUS ONE IN CHARGE

01:29:22.402 --> 01:29:24.571
NEVER ONE-THIRD OR TWO-THIRDS.

01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:28.908
Osgood:
BUT OVER THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOW

01:29:28.908 --> 01:29:33.246
GELL-MANN GROWS TO LOVE THE IDEA
OF THIS DEEPER LEVEL OF REALITY.

01:29:33.246 --> 01:29:36.282
THE FACT NO ONE'S EVER SEEN
PARTICLES THIS BIZARRE

01:29:36.282 --> 01:29:38.451
HE DECIDES ISN'T HIS PROBLEM.

01:29:41.921 --> 01:29:50.163
IN EARLY 1964, GELL-MANN
PROPOSES TO THE WORLD

01:29:50.163 --> 01:29:51.898
HE CALLS "QUARKS."

01:29:51.898 --> 01:29:55.368
HIS THREE QUARKS COULD COMBINE
IN DIFFERENT WAYS

01:30:00.139 --> 01:30:02.742
IT WOULD SIMPLIFY,
ORGANIZE

01:30:02.742 --> 01:30:05.345
IT WAS A GREAT
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE.

01:30:05.345 --> 01:30:08.381
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT NO ONE
HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING

01:30:08.381 --> 01:30:10.116
THAT LOOKED LIKE A QUARK.

01:30:11.417 --> 01:30:13.152
NOW, WHAT ARE THE QUARKS?

01:30:13.152 --> 01:30:15.321
ARE THEY ACTUALLY REAL OBJECTS?

01:30:15.321 --> 01:30:19.225
WELTAL FRIENDS
ARE MAKING A SEARCH FOR THEM

01:30:19.225 --> 01:30:20.960
IN ALL SORTS OF PLACES.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.430
ONE ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPIST
FRIEND OF MINE CALLS ME UP

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:27.901
SOMETIMES AT MIDNIGHT HIS P
ROGRESS

01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:30.503
IN A SEARCH FOR QUARKS
IN SEAWATER.

01:30:30.503 --> 01:30:33.973
MOST THINGS WITH CURIOUS
CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR IN THE OCEAN

01:30:33.973 --> 01:30:35.708
END UP EATEN BY OYSTERS.

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:37.877
(laughter)

01:30:37.877 --> 01:30:40.046
AND SO NOW
HE'S GRINDING UP OYSTERS...

01:30:40.046 --> 01:30:41.347
(laughter)

01:30:41.347 --> 01:30:44.384
AND LOOKING FOR THE ATOMIC
LEVELS IN THE OYSTERS.

01:30:44.817 --> 01:30:46.986
SO FAR, THOUGH, NO QUARKS.

01:30:46.986 --> 01:30:50.023
Kaku:
PHYSICISTS WERE FACED
WITH A PARADOX:

01:30:50.456 --> 01:30:51.758
WHERE WERE THE QUARKS?

01:30:51.758 --> 01:30:53.493
EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED

01:30:53.493 --> 01:30:57.397
WE COULD NOT FIND ANY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE FOR THE QUARKS

01:30:57.397 --> 01:30:59.999
AND IN FACT,
SOME PHYSICISTS EVEN BEGAN

01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:03.036
TO DOUBT THE CORRECTNESS
OF THE THEORY.

01:31:03.036 --> 01:31:04.337
HOWEVER, OVER THE YEARS

01:31:04.771 --> 01:31:06.940
INDIRECT EVIDENCE BEGAN
TO TRICKLE IN

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.675
CONFIRMING THIS THEORY.

01:31:08.675 --> 01:31:13.012
AND NOW WHEN EXPERIMENTERS
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE PROTON

01:31:13.012 --> 01:31:21.254
THEY SEE STRONG EVIDENCE
OF THE QUARKS INSIDE.

01:31:21.254 --> 01:31:22.989
FOR STARTERS, THEY'RE SO SMALL

01:31:22.989 --> 01:31:26.893
IT'S HARD TO APPLY TO THEM
OUR NORMAL NOTIONS OF SIZE.

01:31:26.893 --> 01:31:29.495
HEM
AS POINTS. E T

01:31:30.797 --> 01:31:31.664
POINTS? COME ON!

01:31:31.664 --> 01:31:32.966
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, POINTS?

01:31:32.966 --> 01:31:35.568
HOW CAN SOMETHING HAVE
A MASS AND A CHARGE

01:31:35.568 --> 01:31:36.869
AND BE A POINT?

01:31:36.869 --> 01:31:39.038
WELL, IT TAKES A LITTLE...

01:31:39.038 --> 01:31:42.508
A FEW MUSCLES IN THE MIND
THAT HAVN

01:31:42.508 --> 01:31:44.677
BUT IF YOU WORK ON THEM
FOR A WHILE

01:31:44.677 --> 01:31:46.846
YOU CAN IMAGINE SUCH AN OBJECT.

01:31:46.846 --> 01:31:49.882
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

01:31:49.882 --> 01:31:53.786
REMEMBER THE CHESHIRE CAT
SITTING ON THE TREE, SMILING

01:31:53.786 --> 01:31:58.124
AND ALICE IS NOTICING

01:31:58.124 --> 01:32:00.727
WHEN THE CAT DISAPPEARS,
THE SMILE IS LEFT BEHIND?

01:32:00.727 --> 01:32:02.462
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

01:32:02.462 --> 01:32:05.932
WELL, IN A WAY YOU CAN LOOK
AT THAT AS YOU TAKE A QUARK

01:32:05.932 --> 01:32:07.667
AND IT'S SPINNING,
AND IT HAS A...

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:09.402
IT'S SPHERICAL, IF YOU LIKE

01:32:09.402 --> 01:32:11.571
AND IT HAS MASS
AND CHARGE AND SPIN

01:32:11.571 --> 01:32:15.041
AND ALL THESE OTHER PROPERTIES
THAT WE LIKE TO MEASURE ABOUT IT

01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:17.643
BUT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES,
IT'S SHRINKING

01:32:17.643 --> 01:32:19.812
AND FINALLY, IT... POOF!
SHRINKS TO A POINT

01:32:19.812 --> 01:32:22.415
LEAVING BEHIND ITS SPIN,
ITS CHARGE, ITS MASS

01:32:22.415 --> 01:32:25.451
AND IF IT HAS A SMILE,
LEAVING BEHIND ITS SMILE.

01:32:25.451 --> 01:32:27.620
THAT'S THE IDEA
OF POINT PARTICLES.

01:32:32.392 --> 01:32:35.862
Osgood:
WITH QUARKS, PHYSICS' JOURNEY
INTO THE HEART OF MATTER

01:32:35.862 --> 01:32:38.031
TAKES A GIANT STEP
TOWARD ITS GOAL

01:32:38.031 --> 01:32:41.934
OF FINDING AN ULTIMATE PARTICLE
FROM WHICH EVERYTHING IS MADE.

01:32:41.934 --> 01:32:45.838
INSTEAD OF HUNDREDS OF
FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES IN NATURE

01:32:45.838 --> 01:32:48.875
NOW THERE ARE SIMPLY THREE:
ELECTRONS, QUARKS

01:32:48.875 --> 01:32:52.345
AND NEUTRINOS, TINY PARTICLES
WITH ALMOST NO MASS

01:32:52.345 --> 01:32:55.381
THAT RARELY INTERACT
WITH THE STUFF WE'RE MADE OF.

01:33:02.755 --> 01:33:05.792
THE SEARCH FOR A SINGLE
FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLE

01:33:05.792 --> 01:33:08.828
IS MATCHED BYR A SINGLE FORC
E

01:33:08.828 --> 01:33:11.864
THAT GOVERNS THE BEHAVIOR
OF EVERYTHING.

01:33:14.033 --> 01:33:16.202
THIS WAS ALBERT EINSTEIN'S
GREAT QUEST

01:33:16.636 --> 01:33:18.805
FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS
OF HIS LIFE.

01:33:18.805 --> 01:33:21.841
MORE THAN ONCE,
HE THOUGHT HE HAD DONE IT

01:33:21.841 --> 01:33:24.877
ONLY TO LEARN HIS SOLUTION
WAS FATALLY FLAWED.

01:33:28.347 --> 01:33:31.818
WHEN EINSTEIN WAS WORKING
ON UNIFICATION

01:33:31.818 --> 01:33:36.155
HE RECOGNIZED TWO FORCES:
GRAVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM.

01:33:36.155 --> 01:33:40.927
BUT TODAY, PHYSICISTS HAVE
TO DEAL WITH TWO OTHERS:

01:33:40.927 --> 01:33:43.963
THE STRONG FORCE
AND THE WEAK FORCE.

01:33:43.963 --> 01:33:47.867
THE WEAK FORCE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR MANY FORMS OF RADIOACTIVITY.

01:33:47.867 --> 01:33:50.903
THE STRONG FORCE HOLDS
OUR NUCLEUS TOGETHER.

01:33:50.903 --> 01:33:54.807
THE NUCLEUS IS FULL OF PROTONS,
WHICH ALL HAVE POSITIVE CHARGES.

01:33:55.241 --> 01:33:58.277
THE NUCLEUS IS FULL OF PROTONS,
WHICH ALL HAVE POSITIVE CHARGES.
AND IF THERE WAS NOTHING
TO HOLD THEM TOGETHER

01:33:58.277 --> 01:34:01.314
THE ELECTRIC FORCES
WOULD MAKE THEM FLY APART

01:34:01.314 --> 01:34:03.483
BECAUSE EQUAL CHARGES
ARE REPELLED.

01:34:03.483 --> 01:34:06.953
THE STRONG FORCE
PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING.

01:34:09.555 --> 01:34:12.592
Osgood:
ONE OF THE PHYSICISTS
WHO PLAYS A KEY ROLE

01:34:12.592 --> 01:34:15.628
IN THE QUEST FOR UNIFICATION
IS STEPHEN WEINBERG.

01:34:15.628 --> 01:34:20.399
HIS SPECIALTY IS THE TWO FORCES
WITHIN THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS:

01:34:20.399 --> 01:34:23.002
THE WEAK AND THE STRONG.

01:34:23.002 --> 01:34:26.906
Weberg:
LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PHYSICISTS,
I GOT STARTED WITH CHEMISTRY.

01:34:26.906 --> 01:34:29.431
I HAD A HAND-ME-DOWN
CHEMISTRY SET

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:32.545
THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY AN OLDER COUSIN.

01:34:32.545 --> 01:34:36.015
FIRST I JUST LIKED TO PLAY WITH
THE POWDERS AND THE LIQUIDS

01:34:36.015 --> 01:34:38.618
AND MAKE COLORED SMOKE
AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:34:38.618 --> 01:34:40.353
AND GRADUALLY,
JUST READING ABOUT IT

01:34:40.786 --> 01:34:41.654
I BECAME AWARE

01:34:42.088 --> 01:34:44.690
THAT WHAT WENT ON INSIDE AN ATOM
WAS SOMETHING

01:34:44.690 --> 01:34:48.161
THAT COULDN'T BE EXPLAINED
IN TERMS OF ORDINARY THINGS

01:34:48.161 --> 01:34:52.064
THAT I KNEW ABOUT
IN EVERYDAY LIFE.

01:34:52.064 --> 01:34:55.101
THERE WAS SOMETHING
STRANGE AND WONDERFUL

01:34:55.101 --> 01:34:57.703
ABOUT PHYSICS,
WHICH WAS THE SCIENCE

01:34:57.703 --> 01:35:00.306
THAT GOVERNED WHAT GOES ON
IMS.

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:06.812
Osgood:
THAT FEELING ABOUT PHYSICS
STAYS WITH WEINBERG

01:35:08.981 --> 01:35:12.018
IN THE LATE '60s,
HE'S STRUGGLING UNSUCCESSFULLY

01:35:12.018 --> 01:35:14.187
TO USE CERTAIN
MATHEMATICAL IDEAS

01:35:14.187 --> 01:35:16.355
TO MAKE SENSE
OF THE STRONG FORCE

01:35:16.355 --> 01:35:19.392
THE ONE THAT HOLDS
ATOMIC NUCLEI TOGETHER.

01:35:20.693 --> 01:35:22.862
Weinberg:
AND THEN AT A CERTAIN POINT

01:35:22.862 --> 01:35:25.464
I THINK WHEN I WAS DRIVING
MY CAR TO M.I.T.

01:35:25.464 --> 01:35:28.501
I REALIZED, MY GOODNESS,
THIS KIND OF MATHEMATICAL IDEA

01:35:28.501 --> 01:35:30.670
ALTHOUGH IT'S A COMPLETE LOSER

01:35:30.670 --> 01:35:33.272
AS FAR AS THE STRONG FORCES
ARE CONCERNED

01:35:33.272 --> 01:35:36.309
IS JUST WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE
A THEORY OF THE WEAK FORCE.

01:35:36.309 --> 01:35:39.779
AND TO MY SURPRISE, ALTHOUGH
CERTAINLY NOT MY DISAPPOINTMENT

01:35:39.779 --> 01:35:41.514
WHAT CAME OUT AT THE END

01:35:41.514 --> 01:35:43.683
WAS NOT JUST THE THEORY
OF THE WEAK FORCES

01:35:43.683 --> 01:35:46.285
BUT, INEVITABLY,
A UNIFIED THEORY

01:35:46.285 --> 01:35:48.888
OF WEAK AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES.

01:35:48.888 --> 01:35:52.358
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
FROM FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES

01:35:52.358 --> 01:35:54.527
WE NOW HAD THREE
FUNDAMENTAL FORCES

01:35:54.527 --> 01:35:58.864
AND THIS CHANGED THE ENTIRE
TERRAIN OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS.

01:35:58.864 --> 01:36:01.901
Osgood:
IN ORDER TO TEST
WEINBERG'S THEORY

01:36:02.335 --> 01:36:06.239
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY SPENDS
A STAGGERING $150 MILLION

01:36:06.239 --> 01:36:08.407
TO MODIFY AND MAKE MORE POWERFUL

01:36:08.407 --> 01:36:11.010
ITS LARGEST PARTICLE
ACCELERATOR.

01:36:12.311 --> 01:36:16.215
THE PROT??S ARE IN THE MACHINE.

01:36:16.215 --> 01:36:19.252
WE'RE NOW IN THE COUNTDOWN.

01:36:27.927 --> 01:36:32.265
Osgood:
IN THE SUBATOMIC SHRAPNEL
CREATED IN THESE COLLISIONS

01:36:32.265 --> 01:36:34.433
LIES THE EVIDENCE THAT CONFIRMS

01:36:34.433 --> 01:36:37.470
THE CORRECTNESS
OF ELECTRO-WEAK UNIFICATION.

01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:41.374
THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES
ARE NOW THREE.

01:36:41.374 --> 01:36:45.655
BUT JUST AS THREE TYPES
OF PARTICLES DOESN'T SATISFY

01:36:45.655 --> 01:36:48.314
NEITHER DOES THREE FORCES.

01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:53.085
IN THE MID-1980s

01:36:53.085 --> 01:36:55.254
WORK BEGINS ON WHAT
MOST PHYSICISTS BELIEVE

01:36:55.254 --> 01:36:58.724
IS THE KEY TO GETTING EVEN
CLOSER TO THE HEART OF MATTER.

01:37:00.459 --> 01:37:05.665
IT'S CALLED THE SUPERCONDUCTING
SUPERCOLLIDER, OR S.S.C.

01:37:07.833 --> 01:37:10.870
WITH AN UNDERGROUND
PARTICLE RING 50 MILES LONG

01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:14.774
IT'S DESIGNED TO RE-CREATE
THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE

01:37:14.774 --> 01:37:18.678
IN ITS FIRST
TRILLION-TRILLION-TRILLIONTH
OF A SECOND.

01:37:20.846 --> 01:37:22.581
IT WAS TO BE A DEVICE SO LARGE

01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:24.750
IT WOULD ENCLOSE TOWNS
INSIDE IT.

01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:26.919
IT WAS A MACHINE
THAT WOULD REQUIRE BUSES

01:37:26.919 --> 01:37:29.088
TO GET FROM ONE PART TO ANOTHER.

01:37:29.088 --> 01:37:32.124
IT WAS A MACHINE THAT
WOULD SHIP VOLUMES OF DATA

01:37:32.124 --> 01:37:34.727
EQUIVALENT TO THE ENTIRE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

01:37:34.727 --> 01:37:37.330
OUT TO DISTANT LABORATORIES
AROUND THE WORLD

01:37:37.330 --> 01:37:39.065
WITH AMAZING FREQUENCY.

01:37:39.065 --> 01:37:40.800
THE DETECTORS, THE SITES

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.402
WHERE THE ACTUAL PHYSICS
WOULD BE CONDUCTED

01:37:43.402 --> 01:37:45.137
WOULD COST
A BILLION DOLLARS APIECE

01:37:45.137 --> 01:37:47.740
AND HAVE SOMEWHERE NEAR
A THOUSAND PHYSICISTS

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.343
AND PROBABLY AN EQUIVALENT
NUMBER OF TECHNICIANS

01:37:50.343 --> 01:37:52.078
AT EACH ONE.

01:37:53.813 --> 01:37:57.717
Osgood:
BUT IN 1993, AFTER
AN INVESTMENT OF $2 BILLION

01:37:57.717 --> 01:38:01.620
CONSTRUCTION ON THE S.S.C.
IS HALTED.

01:38:03.789 --> 01:38:07.693
YEARS OF ESCALATING COSTS HAVE
ERODED CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT.

01:38:07.693 --> 01:38:12.031
THE MESSAGE TO SCIENTISTS IS,
FIND ANOTHER WAY TO HUNT

01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:16.369
FOR THE ULTIMATE PARTICLE
AND THE ULTIMATE FORCE.

01:38:16.369 --> 01:38:18.971
PHYSICISTS ARE DEVASTATED.

01:38:21.047 --> 01:38:23.743
Galison:
WHEN THE AMERICAN PARTICLE
PHYSICS COMMUNITY

01:38:23.743 --> 01:38:25.478
GAMBLED ON THE S.S.C.

01:38:25.478 --> 01:38:28.948
THEY HAD ESSENTIALLY TO SHUT
DOWN PROGRAM AFTER PROGRAM

01:38:28.948 --> 01:38:32.418
IN THE HOPES THAT THEY COULD
CONVINCE THE POLITICIANS

01:38:32.418 --> 01:38:34.153
THAT BY MAKING THESE SACRIFICES

01:38:34.153 --> 01:38:36.756
THEY SHOULD RECEIVE
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS

01:38:36.756 --> 01:38:40.226
NECESSARY TO BUILD THE
SUPERCONDUCTING SUPERCOLLIDER.

01:38:40.226 --> 01:38:41.961
WHEN THE S.S.C. WAS CANCELED

01:38:41.961 --> 01:38:44.563
THEY ESSENTIALLY
LOST EVERYTHING.

01:38:44.563 --> 01:38:48.033
(playing Bach sonata)

01:38:53.239 --> 01:38:57.143
Osgood:
EVEN STILL, THE SEARCH
FOR UNIFICATION GOES ON.

01:38:57.143 --> 01:38:59.311
IN THE 1980s,
THEORISTS PROPOSE

01:38:59.311 --> 01:39:01.480
THAT AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.517
ARE INFINITESIMALLY
SMALL VIBRATING STRINGS.

01:39:04.517 --> 01:39:06.685
STRING THEORY, QUITE SIMPLY

01:39:06.685 --> 01:39:09.288
IS THE MOST EXCITING IDEA
TO HIT PHYSICS

01:39:09.288 --> 01:39:11.891
SINCE THE DAYS
OF EINSTEIN AND BOHR.

01:39:11.891 --> 01:39:14.493
IT MAY WELL BE
THE FINAL THEORY--

01:39:14.493 --> 01:39:17.530
THE ONE THAT EXPLAINS
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

01:39:21.434 --> 01:39:23.169
Kaku:
THE PYTHAGOREANS BELIEVED

01:39:23.169 --> 01:39:25.337
THAT MUSIC WAS THE LANGUAGE
OF NATURE;

01:39:25.337 --> 01:39:27.506
THAT THE HARMONIES
ON A VIOLIN STRING--

01:39:27.506 --> 01:39:30.109
WHICH THEY WORKED OUT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY--

01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:31.844
WERE THE HARMONIES
OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:39:31.844 --> 01:39:35.314
AND THEY THOUGHT THAT ALL AROUND
US, SURROUNDING US WAS MUSIC--

01:39:35.314 --> 01:39:36.615
THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.

01:39:36.615 --> 01:39:39.218
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IDEA
NEVER GOT ANYWHERE

01:39:39.218 --> 01:39:41.821
BECAUSE THAT COULDN'T
EXPLAIN THE ELEMENTS.

01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:45.291
NOW WE THINK THAT IF I HAVE
A SUPER-POWERFUL MICROSCOPE

01:39:45.291 --> 01:39:47.026
AND COULD PEER INTO AN ELECTRON

01:39:47.026 --> 01:39:52.665
I WOULD SEE
A VIBRATING VIOLIN STRING.

01:39:52.665 --> 01:39:54.834
IT CHANGES INTO GRAVITY.

01:39:54.834 --> 01:39:56.569
IT CHANGES INTO LIGHT.

01:39:56.569 --> 01:39:58.304
SO, IN OTHER WORDS

01:39:58.304 --> 01:40:00.906
OUR BODIES ARE NOTHING
BUT COLLECTIONS OF STRINGS.

01:40:00.906 --> 01:40:03.075
AND THE LAWS GOVERNING
THESE STRINGS

01:40:03.075 --> 01:40:05.244
ARE THE HARMONIES
OF THE STRINGS

01:40:05.244 --> 01:40:06.979
AND THEY ARE THE LAWS
OF PHYSICS.

01:40:10.449 --> 01:40:13.486
Osgood:
THEORISTS USUALLY
IMAGINE STRINGS

01:40:13.486 --> 01:40:15.654
AS INCREDIBLY SMALL
CLOSED LOOPS

01:40:15.654 --> 01:40:18.691
MORE LIKE RUBBER BANDS
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

01:40:18.691 --> 01:40:22.161
ORDINARY MATTER,
EVEN SPACE, TIME AND ENERGY

01:40:22.161 --> 01:40:25.631
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN
THE VIBRATIONS OF STRINGS.

01:40:27.366 --> 01:40:32.137
TO PHYSICISTS THEY ARE
BEAUTIFUL, ELEGANT, SIMPLE--

01:40:32.137 --> 01:40:35.174
EVERYTHING THEY DREAM ABOUT.

01:40:35.174 --> 01:40:36.909
THEN WHEN I INTEGRATE...

01:40:36.909 --> 01:40:40.813
Osgood:
BUT THE MATHEMATICS NEEDED TO
DESCRIBE THEM IS ANYTHING BUT.

01:40:40.813 --> 01:40:42.548
A-B-C-D...

01:40:42.548 --> 01:40:43.849
MY CLAIM IS THAT

01:40:43.849 --> 01:40:46.452
THIS THING I WRITE ON
THIS SIDE OF THE EQUATION

01:40:46.452 --> 01:40:48.621
IS A SUPER-SYMMETRIC DEFINITION
OF AN INDEX

01:40:48.621 --> 01:40:51.657
AND THE STATEMENT IS THAT
THE TOPOLOGY OF THE SUPERSPACE

01:40:51.657 --> 01:40:52.958
CAN ONLY BE GENERATED

01:40:52.958 --> 01:40:55.127
BY THE TOPOLOGY
OF THE BOSONIC MANIFOLD.

01:40:55.127 --> 01:40:58.597
Gates:
MATHEMATICS FOR
A THEORETICAL PHYSICIST

01:40:58.597 --> 01:41:01.200
REALLY IS AN EXTRASENSORY ORGAN.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:04.670
I CANNOT MAKE MYSELF
AS SMALL AS AN ATOM;

01:41:04.670 --> 01:41:07.706
I CANNOT MAKE MYSELF
THE SIZE OF A PROTON.

01:41:07.706 --> 01:41:09.441
BUT WITH MATHEMATICS

01:41:09.441 --> 01:41:11.610
I HAVE AN ACCURATE
REPRESENTATION OF THAT

01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:13.345
I HAVE AN ACCURATE
REPRESENTATION OF THAT CAN
USE MY MIND

01:41:13.345 --> 01:41:15.514
TO ACTUALLY LOOK
AT THOSE SMALL THINGS.

01:41:15.514 --> 01:41:16.815
THE FUNNY THING...

01:41:16.815 --> 01:41:19.852
Osgood:
ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS
ABOUT STRING THEORY

01:41:20.286 --> 01:41:21.587
IS THAT IT ONLY WORKS

01:41:22.021 --> 01:41:23.756
IF THERE ARE TEN
OR MORE DIMENSIONS.

01:41:23.756 --> 01:41:25.491
CROSS E-8
HETEROTIC THEORY.

01:41:25.491 --> 01:41:28.527
SOME PEOPLE SAY TO US,
"BUT THAT'S NOT COMMONSENSICAL.

01:41:28.527 --> 01:41:29.828
THAT VIOLATES COMMON SENSE."

01:41:30.262 --> 01:41:31.564
WELL, WHY SHOULD COMMON SENSE

01:41:31.564 --> 01:41:33.732
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE UNIVERSE?

01:41:33.732 --> 01:41:36.769
WHY SHOULD THE UNIVERSE
CARE ABOUT YOUR COMMON SENSE?

01:41:36.769 --> 01:41:38.504
SO WE PHYSICISTS ARE PRISONERS.

01:41:38.938 --> 01:41:42.408
WE ARE PRISONERS OF EXPERIMENT,
PRISONERS OF OUR MATHEMATICS

01:41:42.408 --> 01:41:45.010
AND WE SIMPLY GO WHERE
THE MATHEMATICS...

01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:47.179
GO WHERE
THE EXPERIMENTS TAKE US.

01:41:47.179 --> 01:41:49.348
WITH STRING THEORY,
THEY'RE GOING WAY OUT.

01:41:49.348 --> 01:41:51.083
THEY'RE USING MATHEMATICS

01:41:51.517 --> 01:41:54.553
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICISTS HAVE
NEVER USED MATHEMATICS BEFORE.

01:41:54.987 --> 01:41:58.891
IN TEN DIMENSIONS, WE CAN LOOK
AT THE ENTIRE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA

01:41:58.891 --> 01:42:01.060
OF THE DIRAC MATRICES.

01:42:03.662 --> 01:42:05.831
MORE AND MORE ESOTERIC,

01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:08.000
AND, MOST UNFORTUNATELY OF ALL

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.904
FURTHER AND FURTHER REMOVED
FROM EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION.

01:42:11.904 --> 01:42:14.506
BUT IN A SENSE,
IT'S THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.

01:42:14.506 --> 01:42:17.109
IT'S THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE
OF UNIFYING EVERYTHING.

01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:19.712
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW

01:42:19.712 --> 01:42:22.748
IS UNDERSTANDING ALL FOUR
FUNDAMENTAL FORCES.

01:42:22.748 --> 01:42:25.351
THAT'S THE POWER OF THIS THEORY.

01:42:25.351 --> 01:42:28.387
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A THEORY
OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:42:28.387 --> 01:42:30.556
WILL IT GIVE ME BETTER
COLOR TELEVISION?

01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:32.291
THE ANSWER IS NO.

01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:34.893
IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
A BIGGER TOASTER.

01:42:34.893 --> 01:42:37.930
IT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
BETTER SLICED BREAD.

01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:40.532
BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU
IS A THEORY THAT WILL AFFECT

01:42:40.532 --> 01:42:43.135
THE FUTURE COURSE
OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION.

01:42:43.135 --> 01:42:47.906
YOUR
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN
WILL ONE DAY LIVE

01:42:47.906 --> 01:42:51.810
TO HARNESS THE POWER
OF THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY.

01:42:54.413 --> 01:42:57.883
Osgood:
NO ONE KNOWS IF STRING THEORY
IS THE FINAL THEORY

01:42:58.317 --> 01:43:01.787
BUT IF IT ISN'T, PHYSICISTS
ARE SURE TO KEEP SEARCHING.

01:43:07.426 --> 01:43:10.462
Lewin:
I THINK IT'S ALMOST
A RELIGIOUS BELIEF

01:43:10.462 --> 01:43:15.668
THAT THINGS MUST SOMEHOW...
VERY DEEP DOWN BE SIMPLE

01:43:15.668 --> 01:43:20.005
AND THAT WE ARE
TO SOME DEGREE BLIND

01:43:20.005 --> 01:43:23.042
AND DON'T SEE THE SIMPLICITY,
BUT ARE SEARCHING FOR IT.

01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:29.548
NOW, THAT'S WHAT PHYSICS
HAS BEEN DOING ALWAYS--

01:43:29.548 --> 01:43:34.319
VERY DIFFICULT PROCESSES,
VERY DIFFICULT PHENOMENON

01:43:34.319 --> 01:43:38.223
WHICH SEEMINGLY
ARE UNRELATED, CHAOTIC...

01:43:38.223 --> 01:43:42.995
THROUGH SIMPLE DESCRIPTIONS PULL
THEM TOGETHER AND UNIFY THEM.

01:43:42.995 --> 01:43:46.465
AND THAT WILL GO ON
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

01:43:51.670 --> 01:43:55.140
Osgood:
ASTRONOMERS WILL ALSO KEEP
TRYING TO SOLVE

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.309
THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE.

01:43:57.309 --> 01:43:59.044
ON A MOUNTAIN IN ARIZONA

01:43:59.044 --> 01:44:01.647
TEAM OF SCIENTISTS
ONIS SEARCHING THE SKYNA ONE

01:44:02.081 --> 01:44:04.683
FOR CLUES TO THE ULTIMATE FATE
OF THE COSMOS.

01:44:08.153 --> 01:44:10.756
AT THIS AND OTHER TELESCOPES
AROUND THE WORLD

01:44:10.756 --> 01:44:12.925
THEY'RE MEASURING LIGHT

01:44:12.925 --> 01:44:15.094
FROM STARS HALFWAY ACROSS
THE UNIVERSE.

01:44:16.829 --> 01:44:18.130
AND THIS IS SUPERNOVA...

01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:21.166
Osgood:
THEN, BOB KIRSHNER
AND HIS COLLEAGUES

01:44:21.166 --> 01:44:24.636
USE THOSE MEASUREMENTS
Osgood:
THEN, BOB KIRSHNER
WITH EINSTEIN'S EQUATIONSILL

01:44:24.636 --> 01:44:29.408
TO CALCULATE THE APPROXIMATE
MASS OF THE ENTIRE COSMOS.

01:44:29.408 --> 01:44:32.444
THIS IS NOT EASY.

01:44:38.951 --> 01:44:41.120
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.855
EXCEPT JUST SIT THERE
AND TAKE IT.

01:44:45.023 --> 01:44:47.626
Osgood:
IF KIRSHNER FINDS ENOUGH MASS

01:44:47.626 --> 01:44:50.662
IT MEANS THE UNIVERSE
WILL ONE DAY STOP EXPANDING
