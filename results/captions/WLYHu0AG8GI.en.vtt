00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.080
Left! Right! Debate Night!

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.760
Welcome back everyone

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.490
There's still more surprises in store,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.400
but right now the contestants are playing a round of "I Can Do This!"

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.790
And go!

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.110
Well, I can do this: phbhphh

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.560
Hoo HA! Hoo HA!

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.100
Well yeah, I can do this:

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.630
"Hep bah heva tubba too-pah peesa, hey hey yeah, everybody sing"

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.170
Mmm, I doubt you're quite THAT good

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.770
And I assume I can ask you to sing, Mr. Trump?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.890
Okay

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.960
I don't want no big, fat, ugly baby

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.150
I want a baby on fleek

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.260
uhhh, that's really nasty to squash a baby's self-confidence like that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.860
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I have to say: You Suck.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.420
Squawwwkkk

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.670
Well, that's just stupid

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.300
That is stupid.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170
We know what that sound means:

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.000
Mr. Trump, you've been selected for "Five Favorites"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.010
FIVE FAVORITES! (Cinco Favoritos!)

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.990
Let's begin

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.810
 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.200
Will Shatner

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.400
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.600
Elliott Gould

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.500
"cheep"

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.160
 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.620
Raw

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.910
 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.510
Lice

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.010
FIVE FAVORITES! (Cinco Favoritos!)

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.108
Well done, now Secretary Clinton a bonus question for you::

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:20.608
 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.310
It says here that you plan to put an appliance into dead blind people

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580
Well, don't think about the appliance

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.010
Sometimes everyone has to believe

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.190
That is a nonsense answer

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.950
It's nothing

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.990
Ummm, it makes sense if I say that it does

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:48.290
 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.320
It's Time to Act!

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.030
Get ready everybody, because it's Time to Act!

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.910
We'll provide various scenarios and situations

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.740
and both contestants will act these out

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.180
And Secretary Clinton, you're up first.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.130
 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.030
Hi Scott

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.820
 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.890
I will NOT give you a thousand; you'll take $25 for this dress

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.930
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.980
Hey, you can't talk about my friend. Amber makes me presents.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.640
And I think she's good at glitter

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.020
Well, I hope you find all your kids, you know i had PLANNED to help you find them

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.880
but it's really windy now

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.180
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.270
Uhhh. wait, this ain't the way to the car!

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.170
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:56.690
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.860
 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.080
Uh oh - I can't move - my face is frozen

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.380
Well done, Madam Secretary

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.130
Now it's time for Mr. Trump to have a spin at the game.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.690
 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.450
Look, Bill, it's a penguin

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.020
 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.010
But you have an old plane. Santos, look, you have an old plane.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.620
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.190
Where are your feathers? Where are your feathers?

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.110
Why can't you fly?

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.510
 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.600
Okay

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.740
 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.940
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.560
Got it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.810
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.980
 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.580
Hey Rocco.... Rocco, you want a shrimp?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.660
It's not normal shrimp

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.550
It's giant

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.640
Well maybe not THAT big

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.680
It's huge, okay?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.740
There you go! Nice job Mr. Trump

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.770
hey guys...

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.850
Two up top and two in the saddle

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.100
I drank it down, but it's tastes like wood

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.320
 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.920
Why don't you move to Africa?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.580
Yeah move to Africa. I wish that you would because I will never move to that country.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.090
 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.200
Yeah, she's winning and stuff. Did you catch that?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.030
Woo! Oh yeah!

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.060
 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.180
This is so fun, it's like going back to school in imported shoes and one perfectly matched pantsuit.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.260
I don't want to talk about this, actually,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.230
because it's time for "Honestly Now"

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.730
It's a chance for the contestants to share how they really feel about each other up on stage

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.650
It's rather vicious, yet a lot of fun too

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.670
So, looks like Mr. Trump is up first

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.800
Uh oh.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.150
I don't like how you look, I don't like your name, I don't like your anything

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.700
Well that is nice, 'cause I just hate you.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.890
And your fuzzy hair is silly

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.410
The cute guys like ME have a thing you want

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.310
And you know you want to lick my feet

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.790
You know you want to lick my feet!

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.060
And you should know you're not always so safe!

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.120
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.010
That's pscycho.... let's call the police because finally Donald said those words.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.990
Yeah, so....

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.700
Whoa, I just remembered I've got a dentist appointment so I'm just gonna wrap up right now

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.660
and eat my salad before I go

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.000
I rung a bell when the homies got hurt, ahhhhhhh

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.830
I need no one

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.110
Ahhhh, ah ha ha ahhh - DOH!

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.300
That's it

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.620
We've gots to go!

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.510
Left! Right! Debate Night!

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.980
Mr Trump, wasn't it you that said that black guys despise nutmeg?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.370
Well, you know, you look at it around the country and maybe they don't use it a lot

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.530
Whammy!

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:15.947
