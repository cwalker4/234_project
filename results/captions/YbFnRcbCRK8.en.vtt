00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.990
rev up your engines, today I'm going to
talk about why not to put exhaust

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.490
headers on your car's engine,
now exhaust headers serve one purpose

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
they allow the gas that has burned
inside your engine to come out the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.830
exhaust and then flow through the
catalytic converter through the muffler

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
and out the back and on the factory cars
they're called exhaust manifold, not

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.769
header, cuz cast-iron can take a lot of
heat it's strong it's not gonna break,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.660
plus they're relatively easy and cheap
to manufacture the exhaust manifold is

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
under this heat shield it keeps the heat
from getting in and damaging anything under

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.469
the hood and the design of the pipes
are for one main thing to get the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.210
exhaust gas to leave as fast as possible,
so the engine can have as most power as

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.870
it possibly can and to run the most
efficiently, now when I was a young

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
mechanic all vehicles were carburetored
practically and if you wanted more power

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.050
out of a car, you could change the stock
to fancy headers like the ones in the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.620
picture behind me and a fancy headers
would flow better

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.519
they had better heat characteristics,
they could be custom-made for each

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.350
engine to get more horsepower, and since
they were simple, carburetored engines all

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
you had to do was re-jet the carburetors,
put jets that were the right size so the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
air fuel mixture would remain perfect
since you changed how the exhaust flows

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.090
you have to change how the air intake
comes in to put fuel into the engine, now

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.850
back then if you had a stock Chevy 350
v8 engine and you put racing headers on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.740
them that were tuned correctly, you could
get maybe about 16 more horsepower out

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.189
of that big v8 engine, but you have to
realize that most of that horsepower

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.290
gain was at the really high rpms their
made more for racing than street driving

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.320
since the headers aren't made out of
cast iron, a lot of times they were

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.909
stainless steel, cast iron is thick
stainless steel is thin, so they can have

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.950
wider openings for the exhaust gas
the cast iron would be restricted down

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.930
because it's thick where the stainless
steel could be wide open and they'd flow

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.659
better,
so headers in and of themselves don't

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.890
give your engine extra horsepower, they
just allow your engine to get the most

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.090
horsepower out of its design that it
possibly can, while all modern cars are all

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.780
fuel injected 
and if you put headers on them you have

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.830
to do a lot of reprogramming, you have to
find a mechanic with a five gas analyzer

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.490
and a dynamometer and is able to
reprogram the computer to make it run

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.020
correctly for the new flow that it has,
and in the case of many modern cars if

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.770
you're driving them on the Street in the United
States the exhaust manifold has the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.709
catalytic converter built-in, so if you
remove the stock and put on these racing

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.430
headers you're eliminating a catalytic
converter, you're breaking the law

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.470
you can't take a Catalytic converter off a
car, so putting fancy headers on a modern

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.280
car that you're driving on the street
it's just not a very smart idea now I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.630
know people are gonna say, Scotty oh the
guys that are modding their cars they put

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.459
headers on, but yes that's generally the
last thing they do when they totally

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.440
modify a car to either race or to get a
ton of horsepower out of it and often in

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.070
places where they don't even do state
emissions testing, so they don't have to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.700
worry about having it passed an emission
test every year to be on the road, first

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.970
they'll rebuilt the entire engine to
make it stronger, then they'll put either

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.890
a turbocharger or supercharger on it,
then on top of that as the finale

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.500
they'll stick nice fancy headers on the
engine so it flows as well as it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.670
possibly can and it has the most power
that it possibly can, now I still see

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.030
guys trying to do it on street vehicles
here in Houston and then you see them

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.390
going down the street and they're shifting
gears you can hear the engine backfiring

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.530
and popping through the exhaust, it's
cause they just bolted headers on they

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.769
didn't change anything else and the car
doesn't run right it can actually cause

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.239
the Pistons to hole from pre-ignition
because they won't run right, and sure

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.510
they look cool when they're under the
hood, a lot of times they'll have them

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.010
all polished and shiny and some of the
guys will wrap the headers with heat

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.900
tape so they retain the heat better and
then they flow out faster for more power

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.040
and they'll remove the catalytic converter
sometimes even the muffler and have a

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.989
totally free-flowing exhaust, they like
that giant loud sound, which is fine on a

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.640
racetrack but in most places it's highly
illegal they put out too much noise the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.570
decibel level is too high there's laws
for that most states, so they won't pass

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.860
inspection because they're too noisy and
since the stock exhaust manifolds have

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.550
heat shields on them and the fancy ones
don't, you stick headers on

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.870
modern engine you can make the engine
compartment get way too hot, it'll mess

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.080
with the electronics and all the
wiring of a modern car

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.280
and since you generally driving on the
street, these modern engine designs their

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.789
stock are designed for generally
stop-and-go city traffic where they do

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.879
most of their driving, not going top-end
a 130-140 miles an hour, so

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.020
putting headers on any modern engine
it's a dumb thing to do for something

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.550
you're driving every day on the street,
so now you know why it's a dumb idea to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.349
put fancy headers on a modern car that
you're gonna drive every day, sure it's

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.219
certainly fine if you're building a race
car, for driving on the street that's

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.509
just stupid these days, because you're
not gonna gain that much horsepower for

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.990
the relatively large amount of money
you're gonna spend putting the headers

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.199
on and then having the system reprogram
to accept them correctly, so if you never

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.069
want to miss another one of my new car
repair videos, remember to ring that

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.129
Bell!
