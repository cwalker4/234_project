00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.930
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.930
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.160
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Brexit in the balance.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.789
The U.K. Parliament rejects Prime Minister
May's latest plan to leave the European Union

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.730
at the end of the month.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.940
Then: grounding the fleet.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.190
The U.S. continues to permit the Boeing 787
MAX jets to fly, as Europe and others countries

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.590
ban them from the skies.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710
And varsity blues.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.460
Dozens of parents and coaches are indicted,
after a federal investigation into widespread

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.860
college admissions fraud at elite universities.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.230
Plus, we return to the southern border, this
time in Mexico, to examine the harsh conditions

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.050
and uncertainty faced by migrant families
waiting to enter the U.S. legally.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.990
MARTIN SALGADO AMES, Director, Casa del Migrante
(through translator): Until a few months ago,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.030
the majority of the population that came to
this shelter were men, mainly men.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.710
But this started to change drastically when
violence and unemployment started to increase.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.479
Then entire families started crossing.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.040
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:20.920
(BREAK)

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.710
JUDY WOODRUFF: Britain's Parliament has issued
a stunning new statement on Brexit tonight:

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.150
It won't buy the prime minister's plan to
leave the European Union.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.320
What it will buy instead is anything but clear,
after rejecting her plan by nearly 150 votes.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.900
Special correspondent Ryan Chilcote reports
from London.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.320
THERESA MAY, British Prime Minister: If this
vote is not passed tonight, if this deal is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.650
not passed, then Brexit could be lost.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.540
RYAN CHILCOTE: The future of Britain's exit
from the European Union was on the line in

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.409
day-long debate, as was Prime Minister Theresa
May's political career.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.060
May spoke with a hoarse voice that underscored
her exhaustion from a last-ditch effort to

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.290
push her amended Brexit deal through Parliament.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.530
THERESA MAY: I believe it is absolutely imperative
for this House that we meet the decision that

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.219
was taken by the British people in June 2016,
that we deliver on that referendum, and that

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.099
we deliver Brexit for the British people.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.029
RYAN CHILCOTE: Her original Brexit plan suffered
a resounding defeat by a historic margin back

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.040
in January.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.849
MAN: The ayes to the right 242, the no's to
the left 432.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.739
RYAN CHILCOTE: With that weighing on her mind,
the prime minister made an 11th-hour trip

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.629
to Strasbourg, France, last night to seek
new concessions from the European Commission's

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.629
president.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.249
They reached legally binding changes on one
of the deal's main sticking points: the so-called

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:51.749
Irish backstop that would ensure the border
between E.U. member Ireland and the United

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.999
Kingdom's Northern Ireland remains open after
Brexit.

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:01.219
Britain's objective: for the U.K. not to be
tied to the E.U. and its trade rules indefinitely,

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.809
should they be unable to agree on the nature
of their future relationship.

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:11.519
Right now, the border between Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland is all but invisible.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.260
That means cars and goods can cross freely.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.620
May's original Brexit strategy would have
kept that border open.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.689
THERESA MAY: A joint instrument with comparable
legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.239
guarantee that the E.U. cannot act with the
intent of applying the backstop indefinitely.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.510
RYAN CHILCOTE: But that assurance also came
with a warning

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.719
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, President, European Commission:
In politics, sometimes you get a second chance.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.849
It is what we do with this second chance that
counts, because there will be no third chance.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.839
There will be no further interpretation of
the interpretations, and no further assurances

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:46.969
of the reassurances.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.939
RYAN CHILCOTE: Then, this morning, Britain's
attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, took the wind

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.449
out of May's sails, issuing a legal assessment
that the changes reduce, but do not eliminate

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.319
the risk the U.K. could remain trapped in
a trade union with the E.U.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.670
GEOFFREY COX, U.K. Attorney General: The question
for the House is whether, in the light of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.820
these improvements, as a political judgment,
the House should now enter into those arrangements.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.460
However, the matters of law affecting withdrawal
can only inform what is essentially a political

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.199
decision that each of us must make.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.530
RYAN CHILCOTE: The magnitude of that political
decision fueled passionate debate in Parliament.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.659
MAN: The honorable gentleman's cheeky, chappy
chortling and chuckling away from a sedentary

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.930
position, but it's been made perfectly clear
that the prime minister's not giving way.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.560
RYAN CHILCOTE: Opposition Labor Party leader
Jeremy Corbyn was among those who rejected

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
the deal.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.520
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor Party: After
three months of running down the clock, the

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.229
prime minister has, despite very extensive
delays, achieved not a single change to the

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.880
withdrawal agreement.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.259
Not one single word has changed.

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.229
RYAN CHILCOTE: Opponents again zeroed in on
the so-called Irish backstop.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.409
MAN: If, in December 2020, alternate arrangements
aren't found for the backstop, we will have

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.030
a hotel California Brexit, where we will have
checked out, but we won't be leaving.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.490
RYAN CHILCOTE: And, critically, many of May's
own allies, like Northern Ireland's Democratic

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.479
Unionist Party, refused to support the divorce
agreement.

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.129
With her coalition crumbling around her, Prime
Minister May's Brexit strategy failed to win

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.129
passage.

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:31.009
MAN: The ayes to the right 242, the no's to
the left 391.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.410
So the no's have it.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.560
The no's have it.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.470
RYAN CHILCOTE: This evening, Prime Minister
May voiced her own frustration after the fateful

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.470
vote.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.169
THERESA MAY: I profoundly regret the decision
that this House has taken tonight.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.009
I continue to believe that by far the best
outcome is that the United Kingdom leaves

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.610
the European Union in an orderly fashion with
a deal.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.900
RYAN CHILCOTE: As for the European Union and
its leaders, they're saying, look, there have

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.760
been months and months of negotiations.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.229
The U.K. decided to leave the European Union
two-and-a-half years ago.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.880
They're holding firm, and they're saying they're
not going to renegotiate the terms of the

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.130
U.K.'s exit from the E.U.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.130
-- Judy.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.389
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Ryan, what a spectacle.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.490
Tell us what's next.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.030
RYAN CHILCOTE: Well, tomorrow, the Parliament
is going to vote on whether the U.K. should

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.449
exit the European Union without a deal with
the E.U.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.150
She doesn't think that's a good idea.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.110
That said, there are people who support Brexit
that think it's a good idea, that actually

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.580
the U.K. would have more autonomy to pursue
the kind of trade deals it would like the

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.580
pursue.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.690
Now, if that didn't get supported, if the
parliamentarians say, no, we do have to have

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.860
a deal, then on Thursday, they will have another
vote where they will be asked whether the

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.819
deadline, the March 29 deadline, when the
U.K. is supposed to leave the E.U., whether

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.919
that should be extended, pushed back.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.840
So, two more votes coming quite possibly this
week.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.349
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Ryan, I know there
are a number of directions this could go,

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.360
but what are the options after this?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.960
RYAN CHILCOTE: So the two logical options
are, one, that the U.K. chooses to pursue

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.750
a new deal with the European Union.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.360
Now, right now, the E.U. is saying they're
not going to renegotiate the exit terms.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.990
However, the E.U. would love if the U.K. came
back with a softer Brexit, if they wanted

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.639
to leave the E.U., but have a closer relationship
after that with the European Union.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.849
That would require the prime minister to reach
across party lines, if you will, to the leader

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:43.289
of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, and do some
kind of deal that they have already said that

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:45.729
they would support, a softer Brexit.

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.370
That seems pretty difficult to imagine.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.830
You know, they really don't like one another.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.800
There isn't that kind of bipartisan love,
if you will, to see something like that happen.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.879
The other option is that this goes back to
the British people, a second referendum.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:05.110
They could be asked, do you support the prime
minister's deal that she reached with the

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.189
European Union?

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:10.560
Obviously, it's just been rejected by the
Parliament, but the people would be asked.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.370
Or do you think the U.K., in fact, now that
we know what we know, should remain in the

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.870
European Union?

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.310
Those are really the only two options on the
table -- Judy.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.349
JUDY WOODRUFF: The drama continues.

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:25.370
Ryan Chilcote, reporting for us from London,
thank you, Ryan.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.430
RYAN CHILCOTE: Thank you.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.490
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we continue our look at
today's vote and where the U.K. goes from

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.219
here with Sir Peter Westmacott.

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:39.400
He had a 40-year career in the British Diplomatic
Service and he served as his country's ambassador

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.150
to the United States.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.870
Sir Peter Westmacott, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:49.850
So, what does today's Parliament vote, rejecting
this latest plan, what does it mean for the

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.700
prospects of Britain leaving the E.U.?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.839
Is it now more likely or less likely?

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:59.410
PETER WESTMACOTT, Former British Ambassador
to the United States: Well, we are now in

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.990
a state of some political meltdown, as your
correspondent was just explaining.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.700
I think at the moment it means that it is
less likely that we leave on the 29th of March,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:16.440
as scheduled, because of today's vote, which
was resoundingly against Theresa May's package,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.310
but also because, tomorrow, parliamentarians
are very likely to vote heavily against the

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.380
idea of leaving with no deal.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.421
So, if you haven't got Theresa May's deal,
and you haven't got no deal, then what have

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:28.421
you got?

00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:32.800
Answer, on the third day, on Thursday, there
will be a vote about whether to ask for an

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.060
extension of the 29th of March deadline from
the European Commission.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.040
And at the moment, that is what is most likely
to happen in the near future.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.680
So I think leaving on the 29th of March is
feeling a little less likely than it was before

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
tonight's vote.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.550
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying parliamentarians
tomorrow likely to say, OK, we need some kind

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.140
of deal if we're going the leave, the question
is, what does it look like?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.970
PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, it's not even as clear
as that, I'm afraid, Judy.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.709
What the parliamentarians will like say is,
we don't like the idea of what is crashing

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:09.690
out with no deal, because it would be chaotic
in a whole lot of different ways.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.990
And neither the European Union nor the United
Kingdom is ready for that.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.440
But what they're not saying is what they would
like, and that's part of the prime minister's

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.520
frustration.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.300
She rushed off to Strasbourg over the weekend
to try and put a few improvements to her package,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.190
but, unfortunately, without checking first
with her own law officer, the attorney general,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.010
thought that the package would do the trick.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.470
And he then opined this morning, saying it
doesn't give the legal guarantees that she

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.209
had hoped for.

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:37.560
And so result was the Parliament said, this
isn't good enough.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.910
So we're a bit stuck in that sense.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.730
The most likely thing, therefore, is extending
the timetable, if the European side will agree.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.720
And a lot of the signs today -- this evening
-- since the vote, are that the European Commission

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.440
and the European member states are not giving
this away for nothing, that they will have

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.250
their own views as to how long the extension
might be.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.079
And there may be some conditions that are
not to the liking of the United Kingdom.

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:06.209
So you could still end up crashing out, but
it feels to me it is not so likely that it

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:11.389
will happen on the 29th of March because there
is likely to be a vote for an extension, if

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:13.590
the Europeans agree to it, on Thursday.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.829
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Westmacott, why has this
been so messy and so difficult?

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:21.880
What's at the core of what's going on here?

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:29.410
PETER WESTMACOTT: The core of it, Judy, is
that it was always going to be very, very

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.420
difficult.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.400
You can decide if you have got a box of eggs
in front of you whether you want to scramble

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.390
them, fry them, poach them or whatever it
is.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.790
But once you have scrambled them, unscrambling
eggs is really difficult and a hard thing

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.790
to do.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.019
And many of us, of course, said that at the
time.

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:45.970
But fast-forward to the results of the referendum.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.750
But one of the problems is that Theresa May
decided that, in order to get herself a fresh

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.529
mandate and a bigger majority, she would hold
a general election, when she didn't need to,

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:57.389
18 months or so ago.

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.130
And she lost her majority with it.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.410
And so now she's totally dependent on getting
any business done in the House of Commons

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.920
on 10 votes from Northern Irish members of
Parliament.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.850
And, frankly, it's clear that if the law officer
this morning, if the attorney general had

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.079
said it was OK legally, probably, those 10
Democratic Unionist Party M.P.s would have

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:23.600
said, we can live with it, and probably enough
of the Conservative Brexiteers would have

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.110
gone along with it as well.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.670
So she is somewhat held hostage by these 10
votes in Northern Ireland because of the fact

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.790
that she lost her majority earlier on.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.770
So that's made the government's position politically
extremely fragile all the way through.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.620
Added to that, I think the Conservative Party,
never mind the majority, or the lack of, has

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.110
had real difficulty working out amongst themselves
what sort of Brexit they want.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.380
They have been riven in two, indecisive, unable
to sort things out.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.390
And so there's been a great deal of muddle
over the last 2.5 years, to the frustration,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.540
I have to say, of a lot of the British people.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.980
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that any one person's
fault, or is it just the fault of the system?

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.420
PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, you can point the
finger of blame on lots of people.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.100
You can point the finger of blame, if you
wish to, at David Cameron for having called

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.280
the referendum in the first place, thinking
that he'd be able to win it if it happened.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.330
You can point the finger of blame, if you
want to, to the prime minister, because she

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.140
is the head of the government which has conducted
these negotiations, to no avail, over the

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.819
last 2.5, three years.

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:29.839
Or you can point the finger of blame to some
very hard-line Brexiteers, who promised a

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:33.649
certain number of things at the time of the
referendum and afterwards which turned out

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:35.649
to be neither true nor deliverable.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:40.310
And they have hung in there, making the prime
minister's life really extremely difficult.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.610
So -- and you can probably think of a whole
lot of other people who you can blame for

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.610
it.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.720
Some people would say the commission are being
intransigent.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.120
I don't actually buy that, because it was
the British people who asked to leave.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.920
And we're the ones who brought this upon ourselves.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.000
And we asked for this Irish backstop, which
is the proximate cause of the defeat of the

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.190
prime minister's package.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.000
And then we ask for it to be changed.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.990
So I think it's a little harsh to say that
the people in Brussels have been inflexible.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.440
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very quickly, finally,
why should the rest of the world pay close

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.529
attention to this, the United States, the
rest of the global economy?

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:18.019
PETER WESTMACOTT: I think it matters to the
United States for two principal reasons.

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:22.690
One is that the United Kingdom is a very business-friendly
economy, which is the obvious port of entry,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.209
especially for English-speaking peoples, to
the European single market.

00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:30.459
And we have had lots of inward investment
from companies building in the U.K., investing

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:32.610
in the U.K. to get access to the E.U.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.930
And if that is taken away by the terms of
the Brexit deal and -- or no deal, that will

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.930
be a problem.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.579
Secondly, I think the United Kingdom in the
European Union is a force, if you like, for

00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:45.660
the anglophone world.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.449
It has been a means of trying to ensure that
some of America's points of view, policies,

00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:53.449
preferences are transmitted to the European
Union.

00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:56.769
And I think that could be lost when we leave,
how we leave.

00:14:56.769 --> 00:14:59.649
And, thirdly, I think the European Union itself
is weakened.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.269
Of course, I would say this, wouldn't I?

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:04.180
but I hear it from my French and German and
other friends.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.050
If the U.K. is no longer there, and the only
two big powers in the European Union are France

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:12.070
and Germany, who often find it difficult to
agree on things, then I think the European

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.070
Union is weaker.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.819
And the people who are rubbing their hands
are the people who are in the Kremlin.

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:19.250
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are watching it all
very closely.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.930
Peter Westmacott, we thank you.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:28.250
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's other news: The
European Union and a growing list of nations

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:34.420
banned flights by Boeing's 737 MAX, after
an air disaster in Ethiopia.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.839
Sunday's crash left all 157 people on board
dead.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:43.870
In the U.S., Boeing defended the plane, and
the Federal Aviation Administration maintained

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.470
it is fit to fly.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.000
We will delve into the details after the news
summary.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.089
In Syria, Islamic State fighters are urging
supporters to launch vengeance attacks around

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:56.399
the world.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:00.699
Several hundred die-hard fighters are now
under siege in Eastern Syria.

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:03.529
They posted a recording on social media today.

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:10.250
It tells followers to -- quote -- "rise against
the crusaders, and take revenge for your religion."

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.839
The government of Venezuela announced today
that it is investigating opposition leader

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:17.410
Juan Guaido over a nationwide power blackout.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.570
The electrical outage began Thursday and continued
today.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.520
President Nicolas Maduro went on national
TV last night to blame the United States and

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.520
Guaido.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.990
The nation's chief prosecutor followed up
today.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.220
TAREK WILLIAM SAAB, Venezuelan Chief Prosecutor
(through translator): What happened last week,

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.949
this electrical sabotage, is not a casual
event.

00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:41.939
What I am telling all of you is that it is
part of a growing number of events, each time

00:16:41.939 --> 00:16:45.540
larger, to knock out a legitimately elected
government.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.060
Where are the supposed calls to dialogue,
agreement, coexistence?

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:54.269
JUDY WOODRUFF: Guaido blames corruption and
mismanagement for the blackout.

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:59.550
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
said last night that all remaining American

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.819
diplomats will leave Venezuela.

00:17:01.819 --> 00:17:05.070
He said their presence had become a constraint
on U.S. policy.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:10.370
And the American special representative, Elliott
Abrams, promised today that significant new

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.170
sanctions are coming soon.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:20.020
The United Nations reports that at least 535
people were killed in Western Congo over the

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.140
course of three days in December.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.090
Investigators say it happened in Yumbi territory
when members of one group attacked a rival

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.440
group with guns and gasoline.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.650
The report says that the campaign may amount
to crimes against humanity.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:41.200
Back in this country, there is word that apprehensions
along the U.S. border with Canada are growing.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.580
The Customs and Border Protection agency reports
that more than 4,300 people were detained

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.580
in 2018.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.630
That is up more than 40 percent from a year
earlier.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:57.600
During that same time, nearly 400,000 people
were apprehended along the U.S. border with

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.190
Mexico.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.090
President Trump is facing yet another investigation.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.960
It is widely reported that the New York state
attorney general's office has subpoenaed records

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.390
from two banks.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.440
They involved real estate projects and Mr.
Trump's attempt to buy pro football's Buffalo

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.960
Bills in 2014.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.930
His former lawyer Michael Cohen has told Congress
that the president routinely overstated his

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.160
wealth when he was dealing with banks.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.490
And on Wall Street today, stocks had a mixed
day.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:32.690
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 96 points
to close at 25554.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:37.620
The Nasdaq rose 33 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added eight.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.460
Still to come on the "NewsHour": how governments
and airlines worldwide are responding to the

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:49.720
Boeing crash; an on-the-ground report from
the Mexican side of the southern border; federal

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.820
investigators charge dozens for widespread
college admissions fraud; a Chicago activist

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:10.450
on ending gun violence; and much more.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.570
The push to ground the kind of Boeing 737
jet that crashed this weekend has grown around

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.570
the world.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:23.300
But here in the U.S., the FAA and the airlines
say they still believe in the plane's safety.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.600
There's a fair amount of criticism and questions
about that decision.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.980
John Yang begins with this report.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:36.040
JOHN YANG: Dozens of countries, including
all nations in the European Union, have grounded

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.570
the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and banned them from
their airspace.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:47.960
That's on top of at least 27 airlines that
have voluntarily taken the planes out of service.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:54.820
The actions come two days after an Ethiopian
Airlines 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.000
killing all 157 people on board.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.980
Chinese officials said their ban would last
until U.S. regulators act.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.020
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): The CAAC has clearly

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.170
stated that they will ask Chinese aviation
companies to lift the ban on commercial operation

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.800
of Boeing 737 MAX 8 unless they are assured
by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.170
and Boeing company that they have taken related
measures to guarantee safe travel.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.470
JOHN YANG: The FAA insists the planes are
safe.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.690
They say they are closely watching the probe
of the Ethiopia crash.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.100
U.S. investigators are on the ground, where
family and friends of the victims are sifting

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.590
through debris for remains and personal items.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:45.780
Sunday's tragedy is the second deadly accident
in five months where a 737 MAX 8 crashed just

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.330
after takeoff.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:54.550
In October, a Lion Air flight crashed, killing
all 189 people on board.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.920
The cause is still under investigation.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.590
Attention has focused on an automated flight
control feature designed to avoid what's called

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.460
a stall.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:10.690
A stall can happen if a plane's nose points
too high and loses the ability to fly.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:17.560
The 737 MAX 8's autopilot is designed to sense
when that is a danger and automatically push

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.910
the nose down.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.740
Pilots can override the system by shutting
the autopilot off.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:29.140
While insisting the plane is safe as it is
now, the FAA says it expects to order fixes

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.520
to the system no later than April.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.680
The changes have reportedly been delayed by
disagreements between Boeing and federal regulators

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.140
about how extensive they should be.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:47.570
About 350 Boeing 737 MAX 8's are in operation
worldwide; 58 of them are operated by two

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.780
U.S.-based airlines, Southwest and American.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.060
Both carriers are continuing to operate the
jets.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.970
On Capitol Hill, a growing number of lawmakers
say the FAA should ground the planes and look

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.480
into the issue.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.731
Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal:

00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:03.731
SEN.

00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:07.241
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), Connecticut: These
planes are accidents waiting to happen, until

00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:13.120
there is some assurance that either pilots
have been better trained or the problems with

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.090
the aircraft have been fixed.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:20.480
JOHN YANG: President Trump weighed in, saying:
"Airplanes are becoming far too complex to

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.480
fly.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.460
Pilots are no longer needed, but, rather,
computer scientists from MIT."

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.510
But the president didn't publicly call on
the FAA to act differently.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.530
We are joined by Mary Schiavo.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.350
She is a former Transportation Department
inspector general.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.500
She is now a lawyer representing survivors
and victims' families in airline accidents.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.470
That includes a case against Boeing stemming
from the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.610
Flight 370.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.970
Mary Schiavo, thanks so much for joining us.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:55.750
Just a little bit ago, the FAA put out a statement
repeating that they find no systematic performance

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.240
issues and no basis to order the grounding
of this aircraft.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.770
What is your reaction to that?

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.640
MARY SCHIAVO, Former Transportation Inspector
General: Well, the two planes have already

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640
crashed.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.650
We don't know the cause yet of the second
one, and FAA's own warnings to Boeing concerning

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:16.030
the repairs that were needed after the Lion
Air crash said that there was a risk of impact

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.150
with terrain.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.240
So, it's impossible to say that they're safe,
when two have already crashed and we don't

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.790
know why for the second one.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.630
It's completely impossible, oxymoronic.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:31.420
JOHN YANG: We should note that we asked the
FAA to give us someone to talk to, and they

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420
turned us down.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.430
But they say that that's precisely why, the
fact that they don't know the answer to what

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.960
caused these two crashes is precisely why
they are not ordering the grounding.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.100
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, if you don't know why
planes are falling out of the sky, what you're

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:52.470
doing is betting with passengers' lives and
other lives that it won't happen again.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.880
And that's not the purpose of safety regulations.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.030
The purpose of safety regulations -- remember,
an aircraft certification says that the plane

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.900
is safe to fly.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.400
It doesn't say, we don't know why it's falling
out of the sky, so we're going to leave it

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400
there.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.740
It's completely the opposite of what safety
regulators are supposed to do.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.830
JOHN YANG: And the FAA also says, it's safe
the fly now.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:22.400
But, at the same time, they're talking about
modifications to this stall-avoidance system.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.870
And we're also told that there are discussions
between Boeing and the FAA about the parameters

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.910
of this fix.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:34.790
Help us understand the relationship between
regulators and the regulated.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:40.400
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, unfortunately, you know,
in the case of the FAA and Boeing and other

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.170
manufacturers and major carriers, it's a very
symbiotic relationship.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:50.890
But the FAA has over the years really come
to defer to Boeing and other manufacturers,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.980
Airbus, et cetera, and to the airlines.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:00.540
And so on issues such as this, the FAA often
takes its cues and its direction from Boeing,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.150
not for sinister reasons, not because somebody
is on the take, but because Boeing has the

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.420
greater expertise.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.101
And, over the years, when I was inspector
general, we had many investigations, including

00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:16.980
on the certification of the 777, that showed
that the FAA just didn't have the firepower,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:22.400
didn't have the expertise and the training
and the ability to go toe to toe with Boeing

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.870
and other issues in manufacturers over complex
computer issues.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.950
And that's what this is.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:34.380
They put a computer modification on a plane
to keep it from stalling, didn't tell the

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.210
pilots and train them, and then after a second
one went down, now the FAA says they're going

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.380
to order Boeing to make changes to that computer
system by April.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.350
So, in the meantime, is it safe?

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.940
Well, not according to the FAA.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.250
It can cause impact with terrain.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.950
JOHN YANG: Impact with terrain, a euphemism
for a crash.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.380
You asked that question, is it safe?

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.650
You wrote in a blog today, earlier today,
that you wouldn't be comfortable flying on

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.950
this model aircraft.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.950
Why?

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:11.440
MARY SCHIAVO: Well, because we don't know
why two have fallen out of the sky, and we

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.490
don't know why.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.990
And to me that says you shouldn't be on it
until we do know why.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.210
And they will very soon.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:22.880
In some ways,this is just astonishing that
people have not been more proactive.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.070
Those black boxes are the best there are.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.600
They're the top-of-the-line models.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.620
They're the newest ones.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.510
They have probably downloaded them already.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:35.271
And literally within a week, we will know
a cause and can say -- at that point, we can

00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:37.770
say whether or not the airplane is safe.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.480
At this point, it's the whole reason we have
a black box, to solve the mystery, so we can

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.760
say whether it's safe or not.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.150
So, for me, no, I wouldn't get on it until
we know.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.720
JOHN YANG: And what advice would you give
to the traveling public?

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.280
MARY SCHIAVO: Oh, the traveling public.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.340
I mean, the Internet has blown up with this.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.010
The traveling public is already searching
for their own and making their own decisions.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.700
They're being smart consumers and voting with
their feet.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.630
They're all asking, how do I find out if my
plane is one of these, and can I re-book,

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.950
get off, or cancel?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.460
JOHN YANG: Mary Schiavo, former inspector
general at the Transportation Department,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.480
thank you very much.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.850
MARY SCHIAVO: Thank you.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:29.720
JUDY WOODRUFF: We continue our look now at
migrants crossing the southern U.S. border

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.610
and the policy decisions affecting their journey.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:38.660
Amna Nawaz traveled to Mexico, and the San
Luis port of entry, where families from Central

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:45.120
America and Mexico are facing a months-long
wait to enter the U.S. legally.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.780
AMNA NAWAZ: For thousands of migrants on their
way in or out of the United States, this is

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.670
a temporary haven, the Casa del Migrante shelter
in San Luis Rio Colorado in Mexico.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.840
MARTIN SALGADO AMES, Director, Casa del Migrante
(through translator): We give them food.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.380
We give them medical attention when they need
it, and they can spend up to three nights

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.380
here.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.480
AMNA NAWAZ: Martin Salgado Ames' family has
run this shelter for decades.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.140
MARTIN SALGADO AMES (through translator):
Until a few months ago, the majority of the

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:21.260
population that came to these shelters were
men, mainly men; 95, 97 percent were men.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.120
The families were in Mexico in their homes,
and the father went to find a job and send

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120
money.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.880
But this started to change drastically when
violence and unemployment started to increase.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.200
Then, entire families started crossing.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.300
AMNA NAWAZ: They come mostly from Honduras
and Guatemala, he says.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.070
But some are from other parts of Mexico, like
Carmen and her kids, 4-year-old Alison and

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.950
2-year-old Edwin, from Guerrero, Mexico, 1,800
miles away.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.620
Her husband, she says, has been working in
the U.S. for almost a year.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.740
She's struggled to provide for the family
alone.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.660
CARMEN, Mexico Migrant (through translator):
I want to cross to the other side, because

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.110
they say that you can pass with no problem.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.110
Nothing happens.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.170
So, I came, so I could pass and be with my
husband and work with him.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.070
We want to have money and a house.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.070
That's what we want.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:11.970
AMNA NAWAZ: Carmen came to the shelter to
feed and bathe her family and wash their few

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:12.970
clothes.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.640
She will then walk her kids an hour back to
the sidewalk camp they have called home for

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.120
the last seven weeks.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.750
CARMEN (through translator): Where I slept
before was a tarp and a mat that they gifted

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.750
me.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.750
It's very cold.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.570
And, yesterday, three women came and gave
me a tent that I'm going to sleep in with

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:29.570
my kids.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:35.710
AMNA NAWAZ: U.S. officials talk often about
the increase in illegal border crossings,

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.440
not the growing backup of families waiting
to enter legally.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:45.610
This is a line of more than 250 families,
over 1,000-people-long, sheltered under blue

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.540
tarps during hot days and sleeping on a freezing
sidewalk overnight.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.870
Many have been here for months, and most are
from Mexico.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.240
The U.S. port of entry is just a few yards
away.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.920
And more families join the line every day.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.990
MAN: Three or four families.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:04.880
AMNA NAWAZ: Added every day?

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.980
And how many families get to enter every day?

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.980
MAN: Average, one.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.650
AMNA NAWAZ: One family a day.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.630
Whoever is first maintains this list.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:17.870
We make our way down the line, talking to
family after family.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:18.870
How many kids does he have?

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.380
MAN: Three, and the other family, another
three.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.940
AMNA NAWAZ: Oh, there's two families living
under here.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.740
Mario says he and his family fled violence
in Guerrero.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.590
Rutilio and Josefina are also from Guerrero.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:39.640
They want a better education for their four
kids.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.110
Their two sons were actually born in the U.S.
after the family entered illegally years ago.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.110
So, wait a second.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.490
Two of his kids are U.S. citizens?

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.850
And they're still making them wait?

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.100
MARTIN SALGADO AMES: Yes, because the rest
of the family are from Mexico.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.070
AMNA NAWAZ: While we're there, family number
34 is allowed into the U.S. port of entry.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:01.410
So, the guys you see in the orange back there
are actually part of a Mexican federal agency

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.120
that does humanitarian work.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.260
They go and they help those families who are
waiting in line to get processed and escort

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.540
them up when it's their turn.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.350
They're taking a family up right now that's
been waiting for weeks, possibly months, in

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.450
that line.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.130
In response to our questions about the pace
of processing families, a U.S. Customs and

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.760
Border Protection spokesperson cited capacity
issues, saying they process undocumented persons

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.390
as expeditiously as possible, without negating
the agency's overall mission, which includes

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:35.630
counternarcotics, national security, and facilitation
of lawful trade, all requiring a careful balance

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.150
of their resources and space.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.721
But immigration advocates, like Laura Belous
of the Arizona-based Florence Project, worry

00:31:42.721 --> 00:31:47.510
the slow pace of legal entry may push people
to cross illegally instead.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.720
LAURA BELOUS, Attorney, Florence Project:
When I talk to clients about the reasons why

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.780
they come, the first thing that they talk
about is the harm., and the harm that was

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.940
so severe that really coming to the United
States was a last resort in terms of having

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.940
safety.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.370
Our clients often report that they have suffered
severe harm along the way in terms of assaults,

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.830
in terms of robbery.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.090
But they make that trip because they're looking
for safety.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.870
AMNA NAWAZ: Carmen, meanwhile, is stuck.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.220
She can't go home.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.150
But she also can't afford to wait in the line
much longer.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:20.450
CARMEN (through translator): I only have 200
pesos left, but I'm going to buy food soon.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.590
I don't have any left, because food is expensive
here.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.010
And I don't know if I'm going to have enough
for tomorrow.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:30.970
AMNA NAWAZ: Carmen, what you will do when
you run out of money?

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:43.120
CARMEN (through translator): Sometimes, my
kids ask for things, and I keep telling my

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.090
son that I don't have any money.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.870
Don't ask me for anything.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.370
My daughter, she understands.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:53.190
But my son, he starts crying, because all
he wants is his cereal and milk.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.490
I am all by myself.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.390
AMNA NAWAZ: Can you tell me about this?

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.600
At the shelter, Martin says all he can do
is try to ease their journey, wherever it

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.600
may lead.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.790
MARTIN SALGADO AMES: They stand right here,
and they pray, and they...

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.100
AMNA NAWAZ: What do they pray for?

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:11.150
MARTIN SALGADO AMES: To cross, and for their
lives -- life.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.290
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow, such a powerful story,
Amna.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.820
You were there at the border.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.620
How typical is what you found at this one
border crossing location?

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.960
AMNA NAWAZ: Unfortunately, it's not that unique.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.300
We know there is some version of this kind
of backup happening across the border.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.160
We saw it last summer when we were in El -- sorry
-- in El Paso.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.210
U.S. officials were standing at the international
boundary keeping people from entering because

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.700
of capacity issues.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.990
An inspector general report later found they're
doing what's called metering.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.510
That's limiting the amount of people who can
enter the ports of entry.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:47.870
And we now know there is a Trump administration
official policy that asks legal asylum seekers

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.140
to stay in Mexico.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.910
They can't come into the U.S. while their
immigration court cases are adjudicated.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.330
It's in place -- in two ports of entry right
now.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.060
And they have said they're going to expand
it across the border in the coming weeks.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.840
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you showed us some scenes
of what it's like for these people who are

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.840
waiting.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.400
They're living in tents, obviously, the mother
being emotional there.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.359
Tell us more about what these people are going
through.

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:13.579
AMNA NAWAZ: You know, the backup, Judy, is
basically taking a vulnerable population and

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:15.289
making them more vulnerable.

00:34:15.289 --> 00:34:18.759
What we couldn't show you, but what they did
tell us, was what happens when we're not there.

00:34:18.759 --> 00:34:21.899
Often, the kids are sent out to beg for money
during the day.

00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:25.760
At night, a lot of the women are forced to
prostitute themselves just to get money to

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.460
feed their kids and make ends meet.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.069
Most people can't afford to live in limbo
like that for very, very long.

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:35.470
But the big takeaway from all of this, Judy,
is what we found over both sides of the border,

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:39.649
is that the system isn't working for anyone,
not the U.S. officials who are trying to secure

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:43.740
the border without enough resources to do
so, and not the people on the other side,

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.069
the thousands and thousands of families, a
vast majority of whom are fleeing instability

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:51.750
and are not a criminal threat to the U.S.,
who want to cross the border.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:56.409
So, the question right now that both of those
groups are asking is, what can we do about

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:00.369
it with what we have, and what our lawmakers
going to do about it to try to change the

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:01.980
system to work for everyone?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is a side of the story
we don't get to see often enough.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.630
It's so important to do this, do this reporting.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.279
Amna, thank you very much.

00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:19.240
AMNA NAWAZ: Thanks, Judy.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:26.980
JUDY WOODRUFF: High school students and their
parents know all too well just how intense

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.170
the competition for college admissions can
be.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:34.510
But today's announcement from federal prosecutors
was still a shocker.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:39.940
They arrested and charged 50 people across
the U.S. for participating in a bribery and

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.970
cheating scam to get students into elite schools.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.269
The case was called Operation Varsity Blues.

00:35:47.269 --> 00:35:52.009
As William Brangham tells us for our weekly
education segment, Making the Grade, the scheme

00:35:52.009 --> 00:35:58.029
allegedly included wealthy parents, among
them well-known actresses, college coaches,

00:35:58.029 --> 00:36:01.609
and a dishonest college admissions counseling
program.

00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:06.059
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The scheme revolved in large
part around a college prep business, often

00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:07.900
referred to as the Key.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.430
The government said the company's founder,
William Singer, helped students cheat on standardized

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:18.930
tests, and paid roughly $25 million in bribes
to college athletic coaches so that kids could

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.900
enter college with fake athletic credentials.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.190
In some instances, the students didn't even
play the sport.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.490
To mask the fraud, some students faces were
actually Photoshopped onto another athlete's

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.490
body.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.720
Two well-known actresses, Felicity Huffman
and Lori Loughlin, allegedly paid into the

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.769
scheme for their children.

00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:42.819
Among the schools targeted were Yale, Georgetown,
Stanford, and UCLA.

00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:46.940
And here's how Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney
in Massachusetts, characterized this case:

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.980
ANDREW LELLING, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts:
This case is about the widening corruption

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:56.500
of elite college admissions through the steady
application of wealth, combined with fraud.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:02.670
Every year, hundreds of thousands of hardworking,
talented students strive for admission to

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.050
elite schools.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:08.809
As every parent knows, these students work
harder and harder every year, in a system

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:12.400
that appears to grow more and more competitive
every year.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.049
And that system is a zero-sum game.

00:37:15.049 --> 00:37:21.619
For every student admitted through fraud,
an honest, genuinely talented student was

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:22.619
rejected.

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:25.250
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on this, I'm joined
by Jeffrey Selingo.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.180
He's been covering higher ed in America for
20 years, including for "The Chronicle of

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:33.229
Higher Education," as well as in three of
his own books on the topic.

00:37:33.229 --> 00:37:34.229
Welcome back.

00:37:34.229 --> 00:37:35.229
JEFFREY SELINGO, Author, "College Unbound:
The Future of Higher Education and What It

00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:36.229
Means for Students": It's great to be here.

00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:38.410
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this is a jaw-dropping
bribery scandal.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.780
I just sort of am gobsmacked by the complexity
of this.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:48.050
It seems that the bribery falls into two categories
here, cheating on athletics and that role

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.990
in admissions, and cheating on standardized
tests.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.950
Can you explain how cheating on the testing
worked?

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.970
JEFFREY SELINGO: So, what they did was essentially
get doctor's notes to allow these students

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.680
to take the test by themselves with proctors
that were paid off.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.030
And those proctors either had somebody else
take the test for these students, or they

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.900
corrected the exam, so that the students would
get higher scores.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.990
Those scores were then reported to the universities,
who, of course, didn't really know who actually

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.990
took the test.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.140
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then -- so, obviously,
a higher test score helps you get into schools

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.140
no matter what.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:24.430
But the second part of this is that -- the
bribing of athletic coaches and the creating

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.839
of these sort of phony athletic resumes.

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:28.839
Can you explain a little bit?

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:31.380
JEFFREY SELINGO: I mean, this was the most
amazing one to me, because many of these students

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:35.779
didn't even play the sports they were purported
to play and that they recruited for.

00:38:35.779 --> 00:38:40.590
And every year, these coaches -- and these
are at high-level institutions, in some cases

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.299
at Division I institutions -- they're recruiting
athletes starting in their sophomore and junior

00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:46.299
year.

00:38:46.299 --> 00:38:50.960
So for these students to not have to play
these sports,and then to get in under that

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.170
pretense of those sports, I think, was absolutely
shocking and amazing to me.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.020
And these athletes are given tips in admissions,
right?

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.809
They -- all these colleges have to fill teams,
right?

00:39:00.809 --> 00:39:03.369
They need a starting pitcher on the -- on
the baseball team.

00:39:03.369 --> 00:39:05.259
They need rowers on the crew team, right?

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:06.680
So they need to fill these spots.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.869
And so, every year, athletes are given advantages
in admissions.

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:12.380
And, clearly, these students were as well.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.269
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How significant is that
advantage?

00:39:14.269 --> 00:39:15.269
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes.

00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:17.480
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, for people who are
not familiar with this, the role -- if you

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.849
really are a star athlete, can you get into
a school that would really traditionally be

00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:22.849
out of your league?

00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:23.849
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes, you can.

00:39:23.849 --> 00:39:27.819
I mean, in many of these schools, they are
basically the -- the athletic director or

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:31.670
the coaches come to the admissions team and
say, these are the students we really want.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.480
Now, will they accept the bottom of the bottom
in terms of academics?

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.799
Some schools will not.

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:40.460
Other schools will and just basically say,
we will give them kind of academic support

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.970
while they -- while they're here.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.569
But, basically, every other part of their
application could be pretty minimal, but as

00:39:46.569 --> 00:39:48.940
long as they have athletics on it, it really
does help.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.920
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the details that
you touched on here, I just find it so striking.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.700
This is the example in Yale.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.340
And this was a young woman in Southern California
who didn't play soccer.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.349
This -- the guy William Singer helped set
up a phony athletic profile, sort of pretending

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:06.430
that she played on a very competitive team
in Southern California.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:13.400
They then bribe the Yale soccer coach, $400,000,
to recruit this student, even though the coach

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.799
knew that the student had never even put her
foot on a ball.

00:40:15.799 --> 00:40:16.809
JEFFREY SELINGO: No, and it's amazing.

00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:19.540
I can't even imagine what these other athletes
on the team thought of this.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.940
But, more so, there was probably an athlete
or two that were in the recruiting system

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:27.589
for Yale that didn't get in because this student
or these students got in.

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:30.700
And that's not only true at Yale, but at these
other institutions.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.390
The U.S. attorney talked about it as a zero-sum
game.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:38.400
I mean, in admissions, to be honest with you,
I think that many more students are not admitted

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.519
who are qualified, because the admissions
rate at some of these places is like 8 to

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:43.519
10 percent.

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:47.549
But, in athletics, you're really competing
against one or two other people.

00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:50.799
And so, in those cases, I think they probably
took a spot of somebody.

00:40:50.799 --> 00:40:56.880
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At its core, really, this
is about wealthy parents who are trying to

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.380
buy in some ways even more influence for their
wealthy children, right?

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.200
JEFFREY SELINGO: I mean, what's amazing to
me is that, in some cases, it wouldn't really

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.789
matter where these kids went to college, right?

00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:11.650
They have both the means, the financial means,
but also the connections to live a great life

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.999
because of their parents, no matter where
they go.

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:18.020
So it's kind of shocking that they really
wanted that piece of paper from an elite college

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.029
-- an elite college, because, in many cases,
it wouldn't matter where they went.

00:41:22.029 --> 00:41:26.660
And what was interesting to me about the -- about
the ACT and the SAT is that, at many elite

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.660
colleges, including...

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.809
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These are the standardized
tests.

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:30.130
JEFFREY SELINGO: The standardized tests.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.420
At many elite colleges, including the University
of Chicago last year, they're diminishing

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.559
the use of these, right?

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:38.890
University of Chicago went what's called test-optional
last year, where students don't have to submit

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.029
test scores.

00:41:40.029 --> 00:41:44.109
And at many colleges that I followed over
the years, they kind of use the standardized

00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:45.829
test kind of as a check-in.

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:49.799
They're more interested in high school curriculum
and high school grades and other parts of

00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:50.819
the application.

00:41:50.819 --> 00:41:55.180
So the fact that they spent so much money
on standardized tests, thinking that would

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.339
get them into college, in many ways, they
were mistaken.

00:41:58.339 --> 00:42:03.339
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The criminality aside -- and
we can't emphasize how much that this is breaking

00:42:03.339 --> 00:42:09.019
the law with the bribes that were paid -- doesn't
this strike you that this is also an indictment

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:10.769
of the cutthroat nature of college applications?

00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:11.769
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes.

00:42:11.769 --> 00:42:12.769
Yes.

00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:17.060
I mean, we're seeing this more, that the seats
are scarce at these -- at the selective colleges

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.060
and universities.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.500
There are more people every year trying to
get into them.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.150
They represent about a third of applications
every year, even though they only represent

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.579
about 18 percent of students, the most elite
colleges.

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:29.609
So the competition to get into them is great.

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:34.670
And yet we know from research that, in many
ways, it doesn't matter where you go to college.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:40.519
It matters how you go to college, and being
really engaged in your studies and extracurricular

00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:44.180
activities, getting internships and other
types of activities matter more.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.900
But yet we want to get into these colleges
because we know the seats are scarce.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.109
We're worried about the future of the economy
and the future of our children.

00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:56.499
We want to make sure that they get -- have
all the same privileges that we had.

00:42:56.499 --> 00:42:59.700
And so every year, more and more people are
trying to get into these colleges.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.319
And we see this in their application totals,
right?

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:05.160
Everyone's up like 8, 10 percent every year.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.799
And they're getting tens of thousands of applications
and admitting in many cases fewer than 10

00:43:09.799 --> 00:43:12.580
percent, in some cases fewer than 5 percent
of applicants.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.329
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, as we see, people are
turning to devious means to try to get in.

00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:17.329
JEFFREY SELINGO: Exactly.

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:20.170
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jeffrey Selingo, thank you
very much.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:28.049
It was great to be with you.

00:43:28.049 --> 00:43:33.999
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be back shortly
with the story of a black, Jewish woman fighting

00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:36.349
to save lives on the streets of Chicago.

00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:40.440
But, first, take a moment to hear from your
local PBS station.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:49.779
It's a chance to offer your support, which
helps to keep programs like ours on the air.

00:43:49.779 --> 00:43:59.580
For those stations staying with us, a look
at a group that has been serving rural communities

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.690
in Eastern Kentucky for nearly half-a-century.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:08.650
Now, in the face of many leaving the area,
it's giving residents new reasons to stay.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.140
Jeffrey Brown brings us this encore story.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:19.599
JEFFREY BROWN: A cold winter day in the tiny
coal town of Hemphill in Letcher County, Kentucky,

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:23.360
hard-hit by the closing of nearby mines.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.339
But on this Friday, residents have gathered
in the basement of a shuttered-school-turned-community-center

00:44:29.339 --> 00:44:36.170
for free food, music, and a celebration of
a tiny, but empowering catering business run

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:42.299
by Gwen Johnson, whose mining family has lived
here for generations.

00:44:42.299 --> 00:44:46.160
GWEN JOHNSON, Founder, Hemphill Catering Company:
I was raised in a coal mine family, where

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.220
the pride was in the job, but you didn't really
own what you made.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:58.019
But with Hemphill Catering Company, we own
what we make.

00:44:58.019 --> 00:44:59.140
The community will.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:04.300
JEFFREY BROWN: The business was made possible
through the support of Appalshop, based in

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:10.549
nearby Whitesburg, an arts and culture institution
that, from its very beginnings, has made economic

00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:12.290
development part of its mission.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.700
ADA SMITH, Program Director, Appalshop: We
have been so inundated with, this is the way

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:20.049
your life is, these are the options, this
is what you're going to do if you stay here.

00:45:20.049 --> 00:45:24.470
JEFFREY BROWN: Ada Smith is a program director
at Appalshop, and grew up in Whitesburg.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:29.799
ADA SMITH: We can tell you, day in and day
out, how many young artists have been told,

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:31.960
if you really want to be an artist, you have
got to leave.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.960
So, you name it.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.549
If you want to be an engineer, you have to
leave.

00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:40.089
So, you know, on that level, I feel like Appalshop
has proven that other things can happen here.

00:45:40.089 --> 00:45:41.089
(LAUGHTER)

00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:45.410
JEFFREY BROWN: Appalshop dates back almost
50 years, created with the help of federal

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:50.290
funds during the so-called war on poverty
of the 1960s.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.820
It was a time when Appalachia was thrust into
the national spotlight.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:00.390
MAN: Beside these roads, the shacks of tar
paper and pine, which are the homes of a million

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.700
permanently poor.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:07.890
JEFFREY BROWN: Appalshop had two big goals:
to foster new skills and jobs and to give

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:15.450
local people a way to tell their own stories.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.250
Herb E. Smith, Ada's father, was a founding
member of Appalshop.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.170
His father, grandfather and brothers all worked
in the coal mines.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:29.140
HERB E. SMITH, Filmmaker: He began here in
1952, about when I was born, and he worked

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.499
here until '73.

00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:34.769
JEFFREY BROWN: But coal jobs were going away,
and so were local residents.

00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:38.119
HERB E. SMITH: I graduated from Whitesburg
High School in 1970.

00:46:38.119 --> 00:46:41.200
There were 170 of us graduated.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.920
By the end of the summer, less than 50 of
us were here, with no hopes of ever returning.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.920
Generations of people, thousands and millions
of people leave mining areas, and the people

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920
who remain miss them.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920
Miss them bad.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.369
JEFFREY BROWN: Trained at Appalshop and armed
with cameras, Smith and others took on a new

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:52.369
kind of work.

00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:53.369
HERB E. SMITH: It was a way to be a part of
the solution, and to kind of understand the

00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:54.369
place that we were a part of.

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:55.369
And, of course, we learned all kind of things
that we had no clue about.

00:46:55.369 --> 00:46:56.369
And we kind of fell in love with the place.

00:46:56.369 --> 00:46:57.430
JEFFREY BROWN: They produced scores of films,
documenting in frank detail the region they

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:58.430
called home.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:03.619
HERB E. SMITH: One of the ways I like to say
it is, we make films about the things we like

00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:06.980
here, and we make films about the things that
are challenging.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:12.710
WOMAN: The same system that brought prosperity
to some impoverished others.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:17.630
Some filmmakers wanted to show that contrast
to help bring about social change.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.249
Others mined the images the way the companies
had mined the coal.

00:47:21.249 --> 00:47:30.381
HERB E. SMITH: And then we want to make films
that hold out people like Ralph Stanley, people

00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:38.390
who have drawn from the wealth of the culture
of the region and made a living from it.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.520
JEFFREY BROWN: And Appalshop expanded well
beyond filmmaking.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:52.640
Its Roadside Theater, captured in this 1991
"NewsHour" report, continues to present plays

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.480
about life in the region.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:02.900
Its radio station, WMMT, offers a range of
music and news, with the help of some 50 volunteer

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.900
deejays.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.900
Local musicians offer after-school lessons
for kids learning to play bluegrass.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900
Downstairs, Appalshop's film vaults hold virtually
every minute of film and video from the last

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900
50 years, and now house historic photography
collections.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.809
The filmmaking continues with a new generation;
24-year-old Oakley Fugate grew up in a nearby

00:48:09.809 --> 00:48:13.170
town with a population of just 20.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.730
Without Appalshop, he says, his options were
limited.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:20.280
OAKLEY FUGATE, Filmmaker: When it comes to
artistic dreams and stuff like mine, they're

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.819
just kind of like, no, you need to do something
serious.

00:48:22.819 --> 00:48:27.410
Like, they don't -- they don't even consider
the possibility of you actually doing it.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:31.881
JEFFREY BROWN: But after a training program,
he's produced several documentaries, including

00:48:31.881 --> 00:48:35.590
a recent film spotlighting a transgender student
in Whitesburg.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.440
STUDENT: I'm not scared to the trans anymore.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.849
I'm not scared or ashamed of it.

00:48:42.849 --> 00:48:48.499
JEFFREY BROWN: Most important, says Ada Smith,
Appalshop continues its focus on how art and

00:48:48.499 --> 00:48:51.210
culture can stimulate a local economy.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.529
ADA SMITH: If people want to come downtown
for things.

00:48:53.529 --> 00:48:58.059
If there's music, if there's events, if there's
things to do, then, all of a sudden, there's

00:48:58.059 --> 00:48:59.059
more businesses.

00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:00.059
If people have an opportunity to try some
different things, then all of a sudden they

00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:01.059
are like, whoa, I could start a record store,
I could start a tattoo parlor, I could start

00:49:01.059 --> 00:49:02.059
a bar.

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:03.059
Like, your mind just opens up from an initial
nugget of trying something different.

00:49:03.059 --> 00:49:04.410
JEFFREY BROWN: Appalshop relies on federal
funding, including the NEA, foundations, and

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.130
private philanthropy.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.989
And all that, Smith says, only goes so far.

00:49:08.989 --> 00:49:15.910
ADA SMITH: I just really believe that there's
been a long history of only seeing rural communities

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:19.849
and economies as places to take from, and
not places to invest in.

00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:22.369
JEFFREY BROWN: And Appalshop says otherwise,
huh?

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:23.369
(LAUGHTER)

00:49:23.369 --> 00:49:24.369
ADA SMITH: yes.

00:49:24.369 --> 00:49:31.810
We feel like there's a lot of wealth and talent
and ideas that need to be given a chance.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:36.790
JEFFREY BROWN: Like those of Gwen Johnson
at the community center in Hemphill.

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:37.790
Her work is now part of an expanded support
network that Appalshop has helped build, with

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:38.790
more than a dozen businesses and organizations
in the area.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:42.059
Her site faced closure when funds from coal
taxes dried up, but with encouragement and

00:49:42.059 --> 00:49:48.390
support from Appalshop, including $5,000 in
seed money, Johnson was able to start a catering

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.920
company to help pay the bills.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920
GWEN JOHNSON: They're friends who kind of
stepped up to the plate and began to think

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920
outside the box, and sometimes they think
bigger than some of us have ever been allowed

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.920
to think.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.289
JEFFREY BROWN: She now employs local residents,
including recovering addicts from the Letcher

00:49:55.289 --> 00:49:56.380
County Drug Court.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.369
BRADLEY JOHNSON, Hemphill Catering Company:
And our applications, when they see our background,

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.079
it just goes to the very bottom, you know?

00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:08.540
And Gwen overlooks that and gives us a chance
to prove ourselves.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.980
And I really appreciate the opportunity.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:21.930
JEFFREY BROWN: And now, with another $15,000
from Appalshop, Johnson plans to build a brick

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:27.059
oven and open a bakery to serve healthier
breads to the community.

00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:29.609
She's calling it Black Sheep Bakery.

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:40.650
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jeffrey Brown
in Letcher County, Kentucky.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:50.759
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week's "NewsHour" Facebook
watch show, "That Moment When," features Tamar

00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:51.819
Manasseh.

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:56.329
She's the founder of MASK, Mothers and Men
Against Senseless Killing.

00:50:56.329 --> 00:51:01.309
Manasseh tells us how she is able to win people
over to her cause using her background, growing

00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:05.489
up as a Jewish woman of color on Chicago's
South Side.

00:51:05.489 --> 00:51:11.720
QUESTION: What does it feel like to have the
international media storm Chicago on its worst

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.779
days with the high number of shootings and
killings?

00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:16.509
TAMAR MANASSEH, Founder, Mothers and Men Against
Senseless Killings: I don't feel anything.

00:51:16.509 --> 00:51:18.790
I think the mayor should feel something.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.789
I think the superintendent of police should
feel something.

00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:27.499
People like me, who are out here every day,
who are trying to make the difference, who

00:51:27.499 --> 00:51:32.680
are making the difference, who do the work,
we see that our efforts are actually doing

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.460
something, even if the international media
doesn't recognize it.

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.700
It's not about that.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.420
It's about the lives that you save.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.339
When I leave here, I'm going to go home, I'm
going to put on some warm clothes, and I'm

00:51:43.339 --> 00:51:46.759
going to head to the block, because, tonight,
we're having a sukkah soiree.

00:51:46.759 --> 00:51:48.039
There's this idea.

00:51:48.039 --> 00:51:52.580
If we can find where bad things are going
to happen, if we know that bad things are

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:58.390
happening between these two warring factions,
you send some moms over there, you send some

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.569
moms over there, and we just sit there.

00:52:01.569 --> 00:52:06.000
And we have, hands down, the best sukkah on
the South Side of Chicago.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.089
No one would ever expect to see Jews of all
colors dancing to "Hava Nagila" played by

00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:16.770
a jazz band on a street corner in the middle
of the hood.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:18.720
But that's what you're going to see tonight.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.819
Being around a barbecue grill is going to
give us some time to talk, to get to know

00:52:22.819 --> 00:52:23.819
each other.

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:26.280
It takes time for food to get ready.

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.619
So, while we're talking, food's going to be
cooking.

00:52:28.619 --> 00:52:31.279
You're going to get to know me, and I'm going
to get to know you.

00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:34.430
And then, once the food comes off the grill,
we're going to be mid-conversation.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:37.869
So, you aren't going to just walk away, because
we're having a good conversation.

00:52:37.869 --> 00:52:39.589
And then you know what?

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.173
Tomorrow, you're going to come back and we're
going to do it again.

00:52:41.173 --> 00:52:44.920
And then you're going to come back the day
after, and we're going to do it again.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:50.170
And that's what built community around that
barbecue grill and around that corner.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.609
That's what did it.

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:56.220
It was food and good conversation and genuine
concern.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.930
It is the way that I bring people together.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.829
It is the way that I bridge the gap.

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:06.349
The most Jewish thing that I can do is sit
on a corner and make sure that people are

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:10.780
treated justly and make sure that they have
food, and make sure that everybody is treated

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.619
with respect and dignity.

00:53:12.619 --> 00:53:14.660
It is part of tikkun olam.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.890
It is a crack in the world.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.499
And if you see the crack, you have to try
to repair the crack.

00:53:19.499 --> 00:53:21.759
It's up to you to try to repair the flaw.

00:53:21.759 --> 00:53:23.170
That's what it is.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.589
Everybody else sees problems.
