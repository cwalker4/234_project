00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.603
If immigration reform
was the centerpiece

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.471
of your entire campaign

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:07.240
and you were maybe
going to shut down

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.508
the whole government over it,

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.843
it would help if you knew
any of those things

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.312
instead of this.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:14.714
Cancel the lottery program.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.982
They call it visa lottery.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.483
I just call it lottery.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.187
Where countries come in
and they put names in a hopper.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.622
They're not giving you
their best names.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.991
Common sense means they're not
giving you their best names.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.226
They're giving you people
that they don't want,

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.762
and then we take them
out of the lo-lottery.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.197
And where they do it by hand,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.832
where they put the hand
in a bowl,

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.601
like, probably
what's in their hand

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.503
are the worst of the worst.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:41.374
But they put people that
they don't want into a lottery,

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.810
and the United States
takes those people.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.045
You know,
sometimes Trump is so stupid

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:48.147
that it's not funny.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.817
The names are in a bowl?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.952
There's 15 million applications,

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.987
and it's all online.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.489
This is not some scam

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.291
where other countries
send America

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.059
their worst individuals, right?

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.795
People apply,
and then after vetting them,

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.031
the U.S. State Department
chooses who comes in.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.732
Trump makes it sound
like there's just some dude

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.435
on the local news like,
"Your lucky immigrants tonight:

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.305
"Rizwan, Shakir, Masiko,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.574
and your power immigrant,
El Chapo!"

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.576
(laughter)

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.079
So, either Trump is lying
about the visa lottery,

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:23.015
or he's a dumbass
who doesn't know how it works.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.151
And I really don't know
which one it is.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.120
So, let's move on
to the other immigration program

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.056
that Trump desperately wants
to end: chain migration,

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.791
which, according to him,

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.759
goes a little something
like this.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.995
Chain migration
is one of the disasters.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.964
-You allow one person in,
-Yeah.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.467
and that one person
brings in ten or 12 people.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.402
The individuals right now

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.371
who are receiving green cards,

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:49.208
they can bring in, say,
an elderly relative

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.078
who could immediately
go on to...

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.047
um, public assistance
if they become unable

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.782
to support themselves
financially.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:59.485
And then that person
can bring in a relative

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.320
who could bring in a relative
who can bring in a relative,

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.222
and that's why they call it
chain migration.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:07.059
Okay, okay, okay.
Slow down, daytime Dracula.

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:08.794
You've got everything
right there

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.429
except the facts.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:11.731
Because he makes it sound

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.167
like the minute an immigrant
gets a green card,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.568
they can bring
their whole village with them.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.036
Sort of like this.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.138
(whistles)

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:21.808
(all shouting)

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.617
For Trump,
that was based on a true story.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.586
But here's the thing.
If you have a green card,

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.521
you can't just bring
your whole family.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.723
You can only bring
your unmarried children

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.058
and your spouse.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.194
And even if you go on
to become a U.S. citizen,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.263
the time it takes to bring
your family is a lot longer

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.899
than Donny and the Trumpettes
make it sound.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:50.403
If you're a legal resident
filing for your adult child,

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.471
the wait time
for that adult child

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.540
is roughly nine years.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:58.044
If you're a U.S. citizen
filing for a sibling,

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.846
uh, the wait time
is roughly 13 years

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.114
for them to get a visa,

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.483
and that time is even longer

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:08.254
if you're from China, India
or the Philippines,

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.957
and so... a-and Mexico.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.325
And for some of them,
that wait time

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.060
pushes at 20 years.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.796
That's right,
it could take up to 20 years

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.966
to bring a foreign family member
to live with you in the U.S.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.400
Which, for some relatives,

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:23.836
is going to mean
some hard choices.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.905
It's like,
"Grandma, look, I love you.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.540
"But 20 years, I mean...

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.442
"It's a lot of paperwork,
and, I mean,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.410
"I don't know if you're going
to make it, and...

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:33.279
I'm just saying."

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.715
Look, the bottom line
is Trump wants

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.284
to cut immigration in half
by any means necessary.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.786
And, again,
not just illegal immigration.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.356
Legal, lawful immigration.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.691
Yeah, he wants
to kick the brown out of town.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:49.362
So if you're from El Salvador,
you ain't welcome no more.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.364
If you're from Haiti,
bye-bye, lady.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.765
If you're
from the Philippines...

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:56.135
Look, rhymes are not
what we're here for, all right?

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.971
The point is Trump wants
fewer immigrants

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.339
coming into the U.S.

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.041
And while facts
haven't always been his friend,

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:03.542
there's always one tool

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:06.712
he always knows
how to use: fear.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.781
People come in,

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:12.184
and they're not
necessarily good.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:13.986
Like the man that ran over...

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.122
the animal that ran over
many people

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.857
in New York City the other day.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.925
According to chain migration,

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.194
he may have as many as 22

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:25.331
to 24 people
that came in with him.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:28.668
-His grandfather,
his grandmother, -(booing)

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.204
his mother, his father,
his brothers, his sisters.

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:35.541
We have to end chain migration.

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:39.879
-We have to end chain migration.
-(cheering and applause)

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:42.148
Okay, once again,
that's not true.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.017
The New York bike terrorist
was here on a green card,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.219
so he couldn't bring
his grandmother,

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:51.157
his grandfather,
his brothers and sisters.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.359
But Trump is using
his fictionalized version

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:55.628
of the story to crack down
on all immigration.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.830
And, look, the truth is
I see what's happening here.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:00.232
First, they said no
to illegal immigrants,

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:04.036
and now they have a problem
with legal immigrants coming in.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.572
I mean, I know they say
they're not coming for us

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.441
if we're already here legally,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.842
but the way this is going,

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.511
we may want to get on Pornhub
one last time,

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.677
because time may be running out.
