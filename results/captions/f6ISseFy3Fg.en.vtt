00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.480
When Khalid Skah stepped on
the podium in 1992,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.560
two days after winning the
men's 10,000 metres,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.480
the Barcelona crowd made it
clear what it thought of the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.000
Moroccan's performance.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.320
The jeers that rained down on
Skah greeted one of the most

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.400
controversial victories in
modern Olympic Games history.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.080
In the minds of those fans,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.520
Skah was one of the all-time
Olympic Games sinners,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.720
alongside his team-mate and
alleged co-conspirator,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.800
Hammou Boutayeb.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.360
The men stood accused of
engineering a cynical triumph

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.320
that went beyond the limits
of acceptable race strategy.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120
Richard Chelimo of Kenya

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920
had been denied gold by his
archrivals

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.120
from North Africa,
who had run the race as a team.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.160
The accusations were far
from proven.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.520
Boutayeb's behaviour was
certainly unusual,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.560
but in the eyes of some
observers, he was innocent.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.200
Perhaps it was karma.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.720
The Kenyans themselves had
often been accused of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.640
some dubious team racing.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.720
Either way, Skah's triumph
felt very hollow indeed.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.560
In 1992, the Kenyans and
Moroccans were the kings of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.920
long-distance running.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.400
Morocco had the reigning
Olympic champion in its ranks,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.000
but Kenya dominated
the 10,000 metres at the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.120
World Championships the
previous year.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.880
Eight of the world's 11 fastest
men

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.360
over the distance were Kenyan.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480
In Barcelona, the scene was set
for the next battle.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520
The atmosphere was hostile.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.400
And by the time the race
was 6,500 metres old,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.280
all other parties slipped away.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.720
It was Chelimo verus Skah,
head-to-head.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.840
That, at least, was how it
seemed.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.080
But coming towards
the end of lap 22,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.800
the race leaders encountered
that man, Boutayeb.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520
He was second last, a back
marker,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.880
a man whose only job now was to
move aside and be lapped.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.400
But Boutayeb would not be
moved.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.640
And what happened over the next
few laps

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.640
was the source of
the controversy.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
Boutayeb wouldn't get out
of the way.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520
Chelimo and Skah overtook him,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.960
but then he overtook them right
back.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.200
They passed again,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.400
but Boutayeb run alongside
them,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.920
then he got back in front.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.840
What was Boutayeb doing
back there, anyway?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.080
He was 36,
but still an elite athlete.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.200
It looked like
a Moroccan conspiracy.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.120
The idea seemed to be too slow
down and distract Chelimo

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.600
with all the suspicious
shenanigans,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760
and then allow Skah to run
clear.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.880
Race officials thought it was
odd.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400
The chairman of the IAAF
technical committee

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.720
stepped onto the track

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.800
to try and hold back Boutayeb.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320
The crowd grew restless,
and booed what they saw.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.040
And even after Skah sprinted
clear of Chelimo

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.320
to cross the line first,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.080
and blew kisses to the
supporters,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.680
he found he had few.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960
They believed they had
witnessed a con.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.960
Almost immediately,
the authorities concurred.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.560
The IAAF disqualified Skah,
citing a breach of rule 143.2.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.920
But Skah said he had no idea
what Boutayeb had been up to.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.520
They weren't even friends.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.040
Skah said Boutayeb was an
animal and an imbecile.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.640
TRANSLATION: I think as a
former champion it was

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.040
an embarrassment for him
to be lapped.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.000
The authorities were stung by
claims

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.400
that they had been hasty.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.760
Skah said they were racist
and thieves.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.560
And the IAAF relented again.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.960
They reinstated Skah and gave
him the gold medal.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.440
But what was the truth?
Will we ever know?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.160
Chelimo said he heard Boutayeb
and Skah talking to each other

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.880
on the track.
What was being said?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.120
TRANSLATION: I was yelling at
him to go away.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.440
"You are making big troubles.
You are making big troubles."

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.360
But inside the big stadium
was 50,000 people yelling

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.960
and whistling, you cannot hear
anything.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360
The Kenyans threatened to walk
out.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.120
The credibility of the sport
was in jeopardy.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160
But Boutayeb remained silent,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.760
even as Skah stepped onto
the podium

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.360
to receive his medal.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.960
What could I do?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.520
It was my duty and obligation

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.320
to go out there and face it as
best

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080
as I could. I was smiling, but
very sad inside.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.400
My honour was at stake.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.320
And I would not go out and face
them if I had felt I had

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.560
dishonoured myself.
