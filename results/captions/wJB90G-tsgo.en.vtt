00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.639
So how many of you

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:02.139
How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family?

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.639
So how many of you

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.839
How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.630
Maybe there was some split

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.340
How many of you were raised perhaps like me where in your family?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.840
Maybe there was some split

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.759
mentalities around money

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.559
How many of you know what I'm talking about?

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.059
You know like maybe mom had a certain way of thinking and dad had a certain way of thinking

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.760
So how many of you guys know who my dad is?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.919
My mom and dad got married when they were like 22 years old, my dad flunked out of college

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.629
Right as a speech and communication major which is pretty awesome considering

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
he's like one of the greatest motivational and real estate training speakers ever right and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.120
His mindset because his mentor this is what his mentor said to him you want to make a lot of money go buy a rolls-royce

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.239
Go get a big fancy watch and go get a really expensive car and a real expensive house

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.129
And you will be motivated like crazy

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.659
And you will go do whatever it takes to be successful and guess what my dad did

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.529
He went up a big fancy car big watch. You know rolls-royce the whole nine yards and every day

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.019
He was like this. Holy shit. I gotta make money

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
My mom on the other hand

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.849
Grew up in an environment with a few more kids my grandfather. My mom's mom passed away when she was very young and she

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.258
Immediately had to go to work at like 14 years old by the time. She was 16

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.299
She was working at Disneyland as a Mouseketeer

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.659
You know Orange County, California, and she's doing great

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.779
But all of her money went back into the family

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.930
So she would work only to basically have no for herself benefit from it so in her mind

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.739
Every cookie in the cookie jar mattered you should be very

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.409
mindful with every single dollar

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.619
Imagine growing up in that house

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.919
This one is like it's not how much money

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
You just need to make sure there's at least one cookie in the cookie jar

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
we could divide it up six ways and my dad's like we should start a cookie factory and

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.509
finance the entire thing

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:05.459
Well, no surprise that relationship did not last long right my dad actually ended up marrying somebody who was ridiculously financially savvy

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.640
And I think she's somewhere inside the room who are you inside the realm?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.199
My my other mom somewhere inside her maybe you're running around the room

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.349
The bottom line was this I grew up with a completely messed up psychology when it came to money

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.650
And it wasn't until in my mid-20s when I met one of my mentors who he showed me something which I'm gonna

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.859
Show you, the bottom line is this guy's money is a tool nothing more nothing less say that out loud

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.240
Money is a tool nothing more

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.339
nothing less, listen if you're a jerk money makes you more of a jerk if

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.420
You are mother Teresa money makes you more mother Teresa

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.099
It is just a tool, but this is what I know how many of you know someone that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.890
doesn't have enough money, I

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.020
Don't know about you guys. I don't want to be that person and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.909
Not that I feel bad for them or less them all I think to myself is

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.609
That person was never taught what I'm about to teach you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.420
They never

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.560
understood that your money is a tool and just like an app on a phone if you don't use it and play the game

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.480
right and follow the steps. You don't get the results. It's not how much money you earn

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.760
It is what you do with the money that matters, you guys with me on this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.510
So I want you to write in your notes the following

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.949
There's been a lot of research on this and you've probably seen something like this before

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:37.260
Especially if you've ever met with a financial planner, or you know you've watched CNN financial. They all say the same thing write down

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.180
5, 15 and 80.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180
5, 15 and 80.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.029
5 percent 15 percent and 80 percent

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.260
Five percent 15 percent and 80 percent and as all the studies show it

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.089
Says five percent of the planet are basically

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.620
generational wealth

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.709
They have created generational wealth

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.290
It's not the top one percent guys somebody who is worth five million dollars

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.989
Who has paid off their home and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780
when they pass on they

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.640
Transfer all that wealth over. That's generational wealth you with me on this

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.760
Some of them are worth millions some of them ten some of them are hundreds some of them are now billions

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.630
But that's the 5% the 15% write this in your notes. You ready. They are the middle class

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.370
They got a house

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.889
They got a little savings. They go on a few vacations, and they're comfortable and there's nothing wrong with that 15%

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.219
But where do you think the 80% sets?

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.819
Darcy the 80% 80% 80% look around the room

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.660
potentially 80 percent of this room

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:03.369
I don't think so, but potentially with the numbers 80 percent of this room when they are older either A

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.549
have to work to make money or

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.339
B are dependent upon the government or their family to subsidize their lifestyle

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.179
80% 80%

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.360
80% some of your think to yourself my kids better be successful

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.210
5%

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.099
generational wealth and it starts at five million dollars and above fifteen percent comfortable my in-laws are

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.509
93 and 90 years old they have a million dollar net worth there in that 15 percent, house is paid for that they bought for

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
$11 300 years ago

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.399
right in Anaheim, California on Bruce Street

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.289
Paid that sucker off

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.459
Every time I talked to my father law you see my Ford stock

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.359
Right he's not he started buying Ford stock like in 1948

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.799
You with me like I had a dollar that I had two shares then three shares, but over time guess what he's in that 15%

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.469
How many of you know someone right now though?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.849
That based upon their money behaviors, and their money psychology

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.979
They're clearly going to end up in the 80%

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.649
Don't point out him if they're in this room and don't like you know make them wrong, but I'd like you to consider

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.889
Maybe they just never heard what I'm about to share with you

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.919
So I'm gonna show you guys a business strategy for your money you guys have for that a business strategy

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.829
I'm not gonna tell you what to invest in that's not my role

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.079
I'm going to show you ideas of what the very best people do, I'm gonna put it up on the big screen

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.330
Which means the team's gonna keep it here the whole time?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.849
And you're gonna take detailed copious notes, so here's the first thing. I want to show you

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.919
This is what 80% of real estate professionals do

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.949
80% of real estate professionals

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.210
They get a commission check and that check goes into their personal account

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.540
their personal account

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.830
80% they get a check and it goes into their personal account they go home

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.210
And maybe they say here honey, or here on by myself, and I put it in my account

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.080
But this personal account is not an LLC an S. Corp a limited light

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.869
You know limited partnership. It's not a corporation. It's a personal thing now. I'm not gonna

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.770
Ask you to raise your hands if that's you

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.069
But I am gonna say this to you I would like to thank you for paying lots in taxes

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.279
Thank you very much. I really appreciate you overpaying what you should be paying keep up the good work

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.840
So what's rule number one?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.140
Should I have a corporation yes, or yes?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.520
Yes, or yes?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.849
so check this out guys if you answered this, don't feel bad I will

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.100
teach this stuff at conferences

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.629
And I'm blown away by ten people in the room 10,000 people in the room the number of people that go

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.700
Yeah, I thought about doing that but like I don't know like which one do I pick I'm no expert

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.770
Here's what you do you call your

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:08.860
Accountant and say I think I need to get incorporated, which you recommend based on where I live

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.850
What country what state etc?

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.570
But rule number one is no one leaves this conference in 30 days if you are not incorporated

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:23.020
And you don't own your business and now your checks come to blankety-blank LLC not you personally

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.950
Cuz now you get all the tax advantages yes or no guys

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:34.030
But I got to tell you, this is what the 80% does and this is clearly bad. Let me show you

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
What the 15% do.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.169
I Want you to draw this out I

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.530
Want you to imagine a world, where and by the way? Did you guys notice the subtle little difference?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:54.319
This one says check this one says checks

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:57.709
Because people that get checks

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:02.779
Understand the following, I get the check it goes directly into my business account

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.860
Right I get it wired in from escrow. I don't get physical checks anymore the money

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.259
Just gets transferred over, you with me

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:16.129
Oh my a escrow company my title coming up won't do it great get the physical check

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.980
But it goes into a business account, which means now as you can see I'm gonna have four different

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.529
Accounts at my bank

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.730
Four different accounts at my bank. I'm get out my business account

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.990
I'm gonna have my tax account to me three accounts

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.550
Tax account business account and my home account my personal account

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:42.919
Here's the reality my friends if I if I can encourage and inspire

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:47.448
You know every single one of you to just do that and then

00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:51.258
Follow the rule you ready write this in your notes

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.329
above the tax account

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:59.299
I want you to write down let's let's do an imaginary check and I want you to show you how much money goes where

00:09:59.819 --> 00:10:01.938
so at the top, let's say, that's a

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.879
$10,000 check, just for easy numbers

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.750
$10,000 check so all of a sudden

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.789
$10,000 hits my business account and the first thing that happens is

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.670
instantaneously

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.319
3,300 of the 10,000 goes directly into my tax account

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:30.290
3300 automatically into my tax account because some of you think when you get a check for 10 grand that you actually have 10 grand

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.599
How many of you are in the state of California or New York or in the country of Canada

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.000
You get a check for 10 grand, and you're lucky if you get 4,500

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.839
That's the real deal now you're an entrepreneur you own your own business you're gonna start taking better write-offs

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.849
You're gonna pay more attention to your accountant

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:57.199
You're probably gonna have your uncle Larry who's done your taxes forever stop and actually hire a CPA who's gonna pay attention?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.309
But 3,300 bucks automatically goes there then

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:05.070
3,300 or less

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.070
goes into your business account and

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.219
This is where I run my business a check comes in I've got marketing a check comes in

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.150
I've got expenses a check comes in I've got my MLS dues

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.140
Everything that I need to run my business every check 3,300 3,300, and then what goes over here

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.190
3,400 bucks to my home

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:32.209
Now it sounds like you might need a home budget. What do you guys think?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.940
Because many times what do we do we get a check and we just start spending the money?

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:44.000
By the way if you look at this the very first one. This is the the cardinal sin

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.570
this is what poor people do they get a check and

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.390
They just start spending

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.180
Who knows someone like that say I?

00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:00.709
matter of fact the bigger the check the more they start spending and they never think about

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.549
Debt reduction because they'll do that later

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.119
Because I've worked so hard and this was such a challenging transaction

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:15.140
And that's why I'm going to overindulge and over and spend on myself, and we know the financial rollercoaster. You're actually putting yourself through

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.020
this my friends is

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:25.489
What the people do that take care of their money they know Uncle Sam or Revenue, Canada or Mexico?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.980
They're taking their money. No matter what so when I commit that Check comes in I don't say to myself

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.560
I get it all it automatically goes there

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:41.239
I leave a piece here, and the balance goes here makes sense so tell your buddy. Are you gonna do this yes or no?

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.520
Yes or no

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.909
Now here's what I know look up here guys

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.150
The number of clients that have done this and then I see them a year later

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:59.749
And they go I have $15,000 and my savings kind of never had that but more importantly I paid all my taxes

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.880
Like I'm on time

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.789
and I have money inside my business account and it's the end of the year and my accountant said I need to take a

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.409
Dividend so I'm getting a big chunk of change at the end of the year. This is awesome

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.089
Now I don't know about you guys, but I like is anybody like nice things

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.059
You know family trips vacations memories, holidays, you know maybe a new outfit

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:29.390
The challenge is if you keep that psychology without requiring or putting in the discipline

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.959
You know what you end up with a bunch of nice things and a shit ton of debt

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.700
So do me a favor tell your buddy. Do you know someone personally that has too much debt?

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.620
Anybody's anybody inside this room

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.050
Now listen there's smart Debt. There's bad, debt, and I'm not gonna go too in depth with you on this

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.370
But you know the difference you know credit card, debt at nineteen percent is dumb

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.529
Debt buying a house and getting a mortgage with three-and-a-half percent is really good debt

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.979
So we all know the difference, and I just want you to be mindful

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.270
I want you to take care of your money, but now did you guys get a photo of this?

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.339
Did you capture it are you sure?

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.890
Are you promising to do this?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.130
Okay, do you want to know what the wealthy agents do?

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.690
This is what the wealthy agents. Do it's a little more complex

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.760
It's a little more complex

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.719
I would get it up on the big screen over there guys and take a photo of it, but more importantly

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.149
I want you to draw the whole thing out in your notes

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.140
Draw the whole thing out on your notes, this is what the wealthy do

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.010
This is the stuff that no one taught me so all until Bill Mitchell

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.560
Pulled me aside and said what do you do with your money?

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.359
and I'm like I don't know I just get the check and I throw it inside my account and I spend it like crazy and

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.849
I never have any cash, and I'm always in trouble

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.600
Draw this out

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.010
So play a game with me you get a $10,000 check

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:05.089
The $10,000 check goes to what account?

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.450
to what account and

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.750
33% of it goes automatically where

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:17.539
To my tax account because I don't really have 10,000. I really have like you know

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:23.719
6,000 and change that's the real deal so 3300 automatically here

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.160
then I take another

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.540
3300 over here or less because I don't know your business expenses

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:37.189
But by the way guys here Marketing costs should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:43.100
Your marketing cost should be no more than 10% of your expected gross revenue

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.290
So a percentage that 3300 is gonna go for your direct mail and your

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:54.469
Marketing and your email and your Zillow leads and your Facebook ads and the prints and the brochures and everything else

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.020
But no more than 10%

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.139
No more than 10% got it?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:07.039
Because you're incorporated now your car and a piece of your house and all kinds of other things get written off

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:13.190
into or from this account so we like that but you might also have inside there ready guys a

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:19.850
Virtual assistant an assistant well, where is that person gonna be paid from you got a check for 10 grand

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.699
You didn't actually get 10 grand you got

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:31.699
6730 3300 goes inside here now I can pay my assistant it starts to work like clockwork you with me, but you can see

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.610
This is where it gets interesting

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:42.949
Some people call this other account your investment account. I like to think of it as my financial hub

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.629
It's where the money comes in and then it gets divided again

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:54.920
Now I'm not a financial planner nor do. I you know even would even attempt to be, but I'm giving you just an example

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.290
Of what that extra thirty four hundred dollars could go towards

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.090
So maybe you need because you do two deals a month you're like I need

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.479
Four grand a month to come into the home expenses

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:15.169
So I'm gonna take you know two grand of my thirty three hundred or the thirty four hundred. Where does the rest go?

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.590
Do you have a retirement account?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.760
Do you put money in the stock market or in bonds or whatever you believe in 401 K

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.050
Do you have an account where you just put cash?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.050
to buy real estate

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:41.749
Why not on every check take five percent of every check put into an account called cash for real estate

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.379
And you just watch that sucker grow like crazy over time

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.850
I'n two years, and also you're like I got 185 thousand bucks in cash sitting inside that account

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.159
I should go buy a duplex. I should go buy a four-plex. I now have the money to go do these deals

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.428
retirement account real estate cash account

00:17:58.429 --> 00:18:03.139
I use this because I did it you know with my kids a 529 B account which is a college fund

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:09.559
Cash account since we did real estate cash. What do we call this the fun account?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.159
The fun account you know the I'm gonna go spend this money on stupid stuff and

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.209
Throw it away later and not care or I'm gonna take this money, and I'm gonna use it for vacations and holidays

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:32.119
What action are you going to take in the next 30 days around this conversation? There's no more information. That's it?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.400
Tell your buddy What actions are you gonna take in the next 30 days do it right now?
