[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:06.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.648
MORAN CERF: Thank you.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.070
All right.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.140
So I'll spend the next 30
minutes, a little bit more,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.570
talking to you about
my work in the last 12

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.650
years, a neuroscientist.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.220
And I'll leave some
room afterwards

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.430
both for questions about how it
translates to business, which

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.140
is somewhat what I do
right now, but also

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.430
to what I call the
inspiration part where

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.920
I try to also tell you
why I think it's not

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.695
just a theoretical idea
that should be done by labs,

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.570
but also something that
would be in your life

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.130
in the coming years.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.850
OK.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.930
So maybe I should start
with something else.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.520
I tend to speak very fast,
especially when I get excited.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.980
So I need someone from the front
to raise your hand every time

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000
it becomes too fast,
you think, for yourself

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.860
or for the audience.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.700
So everyone gets to
raise their hand,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.780
but you maybe
channel everyone's--

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.570
OK.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.115
So the point of my talk--

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:11.990
I'm going to give it to
you in the beginning,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.614
and I'm going to
repeat it at the end--

00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.610
is to suggest that our
understanding of the brain

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.200
has evolved in
the last 10 years.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.220
And what it brought to
us is some new thinking

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.320
about our role in
controlling our behavior.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.620
So whereas we used to think
of the brain as the equivalent

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.260
of who we are-- as
us equals our brain--

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.297
we now have more
understanding of the fact

00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:37.880
that maybe in your brain there
is more than one entity, if you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.600
want, living with you and
governing your thoughts.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.090
And part of what we
call our consciousness

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.790
or us is a mechanism
that comes and takes

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850
all the historical
events in your memory

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.160
and weaves them
into a narrative.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.382
And what it does mostly
is looking at the past

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:56.840
and trying to kind of come up
with a story that is coherent

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.860
that can explain this behavior.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.430
And the reason it's important
and not just a theoretical idea

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.980
is because once we
accepted this idea,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.098
we can actually go into your
memory and change things.

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:09.139
And you will create a new
narrative for yourself.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.950
And you will never question this
understanding of who you are.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.840
And you will just
walk in your day

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.150
with different understandings
of who you are.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.140
So what we call
consciousness isn't just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.840
how we tell our story, isn't
just what we call the truth,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.370
isn't experience of the
reality that we go through.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.920
It's also a way for us to
make sense of the world.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.740
And in the context of both
psychology and business,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.020
when we try to talk
about changing behavior,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.690
many times we try to
teach people and give them

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.245
more information and think
that if we just give them

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:45.620
the right information,
everything

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.410
is going to be different.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.360
They're going to understand
and behave differently.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000
And now, we come up with
a totally different idea

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.750
of how we do that.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.030
We just change something in
your brain that leads you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.220
to just wake up with
a different behavior

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.130
and just carry that
forward and tell yourself

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.680
a story that it was
always what you wanted.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.410
So in many ways, this is not
a trivial thing to understand.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.140
That these three pounds
that sit between our ears

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.250
actually govern who we are
and everything that we do.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.470
They actually allow us to
change someone's behavior

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.550
by just changing small
indicators in there.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.810
And whereas I spend a lot
of my time thinking about

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.060
that, it's still hard
for me to accept what I'm

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.620
going to end this talk with.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.910
Which is that if you learn
to cope with your brain

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.500
as something that drives things
without you actually having

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.784
a full understanding
of why they happen,

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.200
but kind of explained
differently,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.130
you can actually
change your behavior.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.577
The best analogy I found
was one that I experienced

00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:46.910
when I was a little kid that
allowed me to kind of think

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.076
about the world differently.

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:51.600
So when I was a kid, I grew up
in Israel in the early '80s.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.680
And at that time, computers
were extremely inexpensive,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.394
and games were very scarce.

00:03:57.394 --> 00:03:59.060
So if you wanted to
play computer games,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.090
you would go to an arcade store
where they had this big machine

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.770
that you can play games.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.340
And I was a big fan of
this game that some of you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.470
may be still familiar with it.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.050
You play this little
Italian plumber below.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.670
And you're trying
to save the princess

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.710
that this vicious
gorilla kidnapped.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.850
And the gorilla
throws barrels at you

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.010
that you try to dodge
while climbing up.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.610
And I went to the arcade
store and played this game

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.340
for roughly 30 seconds,
doing a pretty good job.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.000
So I managed to get
to the second level

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.610
and kind of dodge a few barrels.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.570
When suddenly two words
appeared on the screen

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.490
that changed my view of control.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.560
And the two words
were insert coin.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.670
And what it meant was that I
wasn't playing the game at all.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.330
I was watching a video, a demo
of the game playing itself.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.400
And I was just
seeing it happening.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.560
But in my mind,
I was in control.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.814
So the movie was showing
how the game goes.

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.480
And the character was
moving up and down

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.110
and jumping above
barrels and so on.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.859
And I was actually the
joystick, but there

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:59.180
was no connection between
the joystick and the movie.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.740
But in my mind, there was.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.990
I was sure I'm in control.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.450
Now, granted, the intentions
for the movie and my intentions

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.350
were aligned.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.254
So it made sense for
me to try to go up

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:10.670
when the character moved up,
to go left when it went left,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.500
to press the jump button.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.840
Granted, there probably were
times where I tried to move

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.530
right and it moved left, or
tried to jump and it didn't.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.410
But because for the most
part the movie aligned

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.800
with my intentions, I was able
to tell myself a story that

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.960
says that I'm in control.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.520
And only when I was confronted
with reality in a way

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.260
that I couldn't really
resist any more,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.420
I said, OK, I guess I'm
just watching a movie.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.720
And the reason I'm
telling you this story

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.303
is because this, in my mind, is
the best analogy we have right

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.770
now to how the brain and
our consciousness work.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.570
Things happen to us.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.340
Behaviors occur.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.590
And we, after the fact,
come back and own them,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.610
claim that we had
agency, and try

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.250
to tell a story that made
us do those things as

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.990
if we wanted them.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.380
And this is hard to accept.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.937
I'm going to repeat that one
more time towards the end.

00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.520
But that is the message of what
we are understanding right now

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.140
about the brain, which is, for
the most part, things happen.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.223
And we can explain them
if we look at their brain.

00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:07.210
But we don't necessarily
explain them well if we ask you.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.710
So if we ask you
to tell us a story,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.640
you will come up with a story.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.223
If I ask you why you
did what you did,

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:12.640
you will always have an answer.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.840
But more and more,
we see that there

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.839
is misalignment between
the answer that you give

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.970
and what our brain tells us and
sometimes even how you actually

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.920
will explain your intentions.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.770
So this is a theoretical
idea, however,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.250
there are by now a few ways
for us to actually test that.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.750
So in one of the studies that
we're running right now that's

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.208
based on a study
that was done here

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.175
in New York a few years
ago, we essentially

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:37.510
are able to show people
the gap between the moment

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.094
that your brain made a
choice and the moment you

00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:41.260
come to explain this choice.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.630
And we can show you that those
are not necessarily aligned.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.980
And in fact, we
can change things,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.563
and you will still
defend your choice.

00:06:46.563 --> 00:06:51.090
So what we do in this
study, we essentially

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.010
bring people to the lab to
make very basic choices that

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.360
mean nothing to them.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.680
But they are continuous
and repeated.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.760
So the idea is if you're
a subject in the study,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.830
we bring you to the lab.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.170
You will sit down.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.720
And the guy in the back who
is running the experiment

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.347
will pull two cards.

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:08.930
And he would ask you
to make a choice.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.910
And the choice is--

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.587
which of the two people you see
here you find more attractive,

00:07:12.587 --> 00:07:14.420
the guy on the left or
the guy on the right?

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.580
So lets play it with you.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.288
Who do you find more
attractive-- the guy

00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:18.957
on the left, the
guy on the right?

00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:19.790
The guy on the left.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.762
Why?

00:07:20.762 --> 00:07:21.720
AUDIENCE: He's smiling.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.553
MORAN CERF: Smiling.

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:24.480
So this is one trial
out of about 100 trials

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.272
in this experiment.

00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:26.521
Let's say you are the subject.

00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:27.540
We show you two cards.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.350
You make a choice.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.730
We give you the card you choose.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.313
You hold it in your
hand, and you say,

00:07:31.313 --> 00:07:32.980
I like this guy
because he's smiling.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.150
Now, you don't know any of them.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.980
They mean nothing to you.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.040
It's many, many choices.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.730
It's all kind of arbitrary,
but you make them,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.270
and you always have an answer.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.470
So if you did this, we'd
pull a panel of cards,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.460
again, let you make a decision.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.870
Give the card,
experience, so on.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.624
So this is the experiment we
all expected, very simple.

00:07:48.624 --> 00:07:50.040
But there is
actually a twist here

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.050
that makes it more interesting.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.350
Because the guy in the back,
the guy that gives you the card

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.120
isn't just a regular guy.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.670
He's a magician that we hired.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.120
And he uses sleight of
hands in one out of every,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.960
say, 20 trials to give you
the card you didn't choose.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.550
So if you chose the
guy on the left,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.550
he would give you the card
with the guy on the right.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.790
And two interesting things
happen in this experiment.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.445
First, people rarely notice.

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:17.820
People rarely say,
you know what?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.122
I chose this one, and you
gave me the other one.

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:21.080
That's all interesting.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.430
But what's more
interesting is that when

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.260
they get the card
they didn't pick,

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.110
they go on and explain to us
why this was their choice.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.050
So you chose A. I give
you B. You take B,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.860
and you say I wanted B
because of so and so.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.820
Now, it's not
going to work if it

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.720
was a significant,
important choice.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.229
I can't replace
your wife or husband

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.270
and you would not notice.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.200
I can't replace your
career or your job.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.420
But we are playing with more
and more complex things.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.030
And it turns out we can
change a lot of things

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.560
that people think
they would never

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.600
be able to explain differently.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.769
So we can change people's
preferences on politics now.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:55.310
And it works.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.390
So not really Democrat,
Republican, vice versa,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.026
but on some nuanced choices like
gun control and maybe climate

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:03.900
change, we can actually
move you a little bit

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.600
just by changing what you
think you have chosen.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.040
And also, we basically can use
that in the context of business

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.370
to show you how little you know
about your business choices

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.996
when it comes to marketing.

00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:21.120
So for example, imagine
you go to the grocery store

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.860
to buy a variety of things.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.570
And you have a shopping
list and you go.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.210
And you, at some point, get to
the aisle with the toothpaste.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.800
And you say, OK, toothpaste
is an important choice.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.110
I'm going to actually give
this one a lot of attention.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.880
And you look at the two
options that you have there.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.400
Let's say Colgate and Crest.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.250
And you say, OK.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.880
The one on the left
is more expensive.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.350
But this one is a bit bigger.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.140
And this one is the minty,
but this one is whitening.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.630
And you kind of make a table of
all the things that you think

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.110
are important.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.130
Then you make a choice.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.990
You put it in your basket,
and you go on shopping.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.250
If I'm going to go
into your basket

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.450
at some point between
the moment you made

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.824
the choice and the moment you
get to the checkout counter

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.460
and replace the item
with the other option,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.547
chances are that you
won't notice this change.

00:09:55.547 --> 00:09:57.755
But not only that, when you
go outside, if I stop you

00:09:57.755 --> 00:09:59.338
and I say, hey,
there's a focus group.

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:01.470
We want to know why you
chose this versus that.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.270
You're going to come
up with an answer.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.186
And another thing is
that it's very, very hard

00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:08.780
for us to accept the fact
that memories in our mind

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.332
are not necessarily true.

00:10:10.332 --> 00:10:12.790
We're going to spend a lot of
time protecting our memories.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.490
In fact, there's a
lot of discussion

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.600
right now out there about fake
news and fake information.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.224
And people spend a lot of time
challenging and being skeptical

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:22.890
about things coming
in from the outside.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.299
They say, I don't really trust
this piece of information.

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:26.340
I'm going to validate it.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.420
I'm going to argue against it.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.250
If it's something that
we don't really like,

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.230
we're going to spend a lot
of mental efforts trying

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.510
to convince the person who gives
the thought that they're wrong

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.680
or that something is not
right about the fact.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.800
But we never ever challenge the
facts that all them are inside.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.700
This is something
that we protect.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.880
So if you leave this room
right now, and you go

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.900
have dinner with
your friends tonight.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.441
And at some point
one of your friends

00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:47.760
said, oh, it was amazing what we
did today when we played tennis

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.787
at 1:00 PM.

00:10:48.787 --> 00:10:49.620
You say, no, no, no.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.366
At 1:00 PM I was in
a talk in my office.

00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:52.240
And they say, no, no.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.560
At 1:00 PM, we were
playing tennis.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.429
You'd say, come on.

00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:56.220
I remember clearly.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.070
I was in this room.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.464
I can describe it to you.

00:10:58.464 --> 00:11:00.630
They're going to start
showing you evidence of video

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.812
of yourself playing tennis.

00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:03.270
People that were
there telling you,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.440
we were with you playing tennis.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.231
It's going to take a
lot of effort for them

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:08.340
to convince you that you
weren't where you were,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.360
because your mind is set to
protect what it thinks is true.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.520
That is kind of an essential
part of our reality.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.450
We don't challenge things
that are already inside.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.866
And in many ways,
this is what I'm

00:11:17.866 --> 00:11:20.130
going to argue is one of
the difficult things we need

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.470
to change right now, which is
the fact that our brain isn't

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.970
fully in control
of what's going on.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.719
But also that the
memories and the stories

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.600
that we tell ourself
are coming up afterwards

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.280
and aren't necessarily true.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.890
In fact, my students
made this T-shirt

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.348
that I really like
that says, don't

00:11:32.348 --> 00:11:34.185
believe everything you think.

00:11:34.185 --> 00:11:36.060
Which is kind of a joke,
but also the message

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.780
of today's talk, which is
that somehow what's inside

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.740
is not guaranteed.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.240
OK.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.810
Up to now, I kind of
give you philosophy.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.520
Let's talk a little bit
more about practical things

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.390
we do with people.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.910
So we look at the brain
and try to understand

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.760
how the brain actually
encodes information,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.670
how thoughts get inside and
into their brain as thought,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.295
and how we actually
talk about that.

00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:58.240
And I assume I don't
have to convince you

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.530
too much that the brain is
the seat of your thoughts

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.890
and your behaviors.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.450
But we have more and
more evidence right now

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.110
from people whose brains change.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.240
And with those changes,
their personality changes

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.970
that suggests that
actually really who we are

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.090
is in our brain, so much
so that it's stronger

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.120
than what we think is us.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.170
I'll give you an example.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.120
You may be familiar with a
story of a woman in San Diego.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.680
And I think eight years ago,
roughly calling the police

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.380
and saying, my husband that I've
been married to for the last 10

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.650
years became a pedophile.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.650
I don't know what to do.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.816
I'm really worried about
our four-year-old daughter.

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:37.250
You've got to come
and arrest my husband.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.590
And the police indeed come.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.690
And they find child
pornography on his computer.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.523
And they arrest him.

00:12:41.523 --> 00:12:42.400
And he goes to court.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.040
And as the trial begins, he
complains about a headache.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.460
And it's ignored on the first
day, ignored on the second day.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.430
On the third day, he has a
seizure in the courthouse.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.430
So they pick him up
and carry him quickly

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.410
to the emergency room where a
neurologist looks at his brain.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.620
And what they see is a
massive tumor pressing

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.740
on the left front part of his
brain that should have caused

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.870
him also pain but
definitely risked his life.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.940
So they sent him straight
from the emergency room

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.309
to the operating room
where a surgeon removed

00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:10.600
the tumor in a complex surgery.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.060
And then when he wakes up
after 12 hours of surgery,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.370
he no longer has a
tumor, but also he

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.100
is no longer a pedophile.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.850
He says, I don't know
what happened to me.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.320
It was embarrassing.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.400
And I'm ashamed.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.090
And I'm guilty.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.673
And I don't know
what to do with that.

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:24.950
And he goes to court.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.502
And in an unprecedented
ruling to that point,

00:13:27.502 --> 00:13:29.710
the judge in this court
actually sends him back home.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.560
And she writes in her ruling
that it wasn't his fault,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.410
it was his brain's
fault. Which kind

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.420
of calls for a
philosophical idea

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.520
of what's the difference
between me and my brain.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.489
And this story is
just one example

00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:43.780
of how a change in your brain
changes your personality.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.770
But actually, it
has a twist that

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.180
makes it even more interesting.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.820
Because 10 months later,
after the guy is sent home

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.790
on probation, the wife calls
a second time and says,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.950
my husband is a pedophile again.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.731
Can you do something about it?

00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:57.730
And he's being taken again
to the emergency room

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.660
where they look at his brain.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.770
And they say that part
of the tumor came back.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.603
But that's the side.

00:14:01.603 --> 00:14:03.300
And it's pressing
on the same area.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.050
And so he is going
into a second procedure

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.760
where they take it
out a second time.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.960
And again, he goes back
to his normal behavior.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.170
So this is like a
controlled experiment.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.530
We have it one way,
you have it one way.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.720
You change it, you
behave differently.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.160
And this is just one example
out of many, many examples

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.326
we have right now to the
effect that we can actually

00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:19.690
change your brain a
little bit, and even

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.904
against your
intentional desires,

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:23.320
you will become a
different person

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.760
in some aspects of your life.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.970
And it will be hard
for you to go back.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.489
OK.

00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:29.780
So now that we kind of accepted
that, the question is--

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.050
can we find who you
are in your brain?

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.550
Can we change your personality?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.070
And can we also tell you who
you are even when you say,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.910
no, I want the opposite, or
explain to you your choices

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.470
maybe even before you make them?

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.830
So for a while,
looking at the brain

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.460
was done in one of two big ways.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.410
In animals, we can, obviously,
look at the brain directly.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.580
We open the brain--

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.230
mice, rats.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.980
We stick electrodes
inside their head.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.860
And those electrodes
are fine microphones

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.450
that listen to the
activity of brain cells

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.800
in a very, very
accurate and precise way

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.910
and tell us, basically,
what the person is

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.850
or the animal is thinking about
in a very, very direct way.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.520
That's the ultimate way to study
the brain, looking directly

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.117
inside one.

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:11.200
We can do it with animals.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.090
We can't do it with humans,
for obvious reasons.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.210
So instead what we
do with humans is

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.740
we study the brain
from the outside

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.920
using imaging techniques.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.310
So we use big machines
that inject magnetic fields

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.200
or look at the activity
from the outside

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.730
and try to infer how the brain
works from looking outside.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.970
Now, if you were to somehow be
able to poke inside the brain

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.550
and see what's going on
there, what you will see

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.920
is a forest of cells
that look like these.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.749
And if you were
to listen to them,

00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:42.790
you would hear the sound
of cells speaking, which

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.230
is essentially perfect.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.200
So if you were to translate
the electrochemical chemical

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.450
activity of brain cells, how
they speak to each other,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.740
you would hear this.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.560
Basically, these are
electrical discharges of ions,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.320
of movement, of
cells, if you want,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.000
of ions from one
cell to another.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.500
If you put a
microphone next to them

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.791
and you translate it into
audio, this is how it sounds.

00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:07.390
So those bursts of
activity, those duddududd,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.450
what we call firing is
the language of the brain.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.410
Each cell, when
it speaks, speaks

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.490
by changing its firing frequency
from very low to very high.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.970
And if we can tell what
happened in the real world

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.560
while those cells
were firing, we

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.518
can actually decode what
you're thinking about.

00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.545
So if every time I show you a
picture of your mom, one cell

00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:28.670
fires, we would say that
this correlation indicates

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.670
that this is part of a network
of cells that code thinking

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.270
about your mom.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.770
OK.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.340
So this is how thoughts
look in the brain.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.940
And this is where
I also tell you

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.710
that I lied to you
a few minutes ago.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.309
And now I'm going to be
clear about what we do.

00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:43.850
So I told you that
there was actually

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.720
two ways to study the brain.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.800
With animals, we
can look inside.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.466
And with humans, we
look at the outside.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.400
But my lab is part of
a small group of labs,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.620
about five labs in the world,
that actually do what I just

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.036
said was impossible, which is
look at the brains of humans

00:16:54.036 --> 00:16:56.400
from the inside.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.450
What we do is we
open people's brains.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.994
We stick electrodes
inside their head.

00:17:01.994 --> 00:17:04.160
And we eavesdrop on the
activity of individual cells

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.010
in their brain while they
think, while they're awake,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.520
while they're talking, trying
to understand how it works.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.819
And I'm here to look for
volunteers for this project.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.599
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.130
What we do is we
work with patients

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.730
who undergo brain surgery
for clinical purposes.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.630
And we piggyback on
the clinical procedure

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.589
to also study the brain
for research purposes.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.339
So I'm going to show
you now how it looks.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.340
If you don't like
pictures of brains,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.140
this is the time to look away.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.320
I'm going to show it
for a brief moment,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.600
and I'm going to skip that.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.900
This is roughly how it looks.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.230
Electrodes on the surface of
the brain that are tiny enough

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.080
to be able to decode the
activity of individual cells

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.940
in the brains of a patient.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.530
When we wrap it up and close
it, it looks like that.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.320
So this is-- now you can
look back if you looked away.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.200
This is the gist of our studies.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.460
Patients come.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.620
Our patients typically
have a brain disorder

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.260
that they couldn't
resolve in any other way.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.830
In the last two
years, so to speak,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.130
is coming to a
clinical procedure

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.100
where the neurosurgeons are
going to open their brain

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.400
and try to identify
the spot in their brain

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.240
that is the main onset
location for their problem.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.400
So think of epilepsy,
for example.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.870
Epilepsy typically is
an anomaly in your brain

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.420
where one cell in your
brain, so to speak,

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.762
starts firing with no
reason, no provocation.

00:18:23.762 --> 00:18:25.470
Kind of like an
earthquake in your brain.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.122
And it speaks and
other cells answer.

00:18:27.122 --> 00:18:28.330
And other cells answer those.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.246
So those cells answer.

00:18:29.246 --> 00:18:31.190
And before long,
there is a cacophony

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.960
of cells speaking in your brain.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.050
And when those cells
speak in your brain,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.300
they actually lead to a
change in your behavior.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.220
So when cells speak
without any provocation,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.178
maybe you start shaking
or losing consciousness

00:18:42.178 --> 00:18:43.080
and falling down.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.050
And the risk, of course, is
that you maybe will have a car

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.460
accident if you drive your car.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.793
Or maybe you drop your baby
if you're holding your baby.

00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:51.050
So the risks are beyond
just epilepsy, the risk

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.310
for through life.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.100
Most patients with epilepsy
get treated with medications

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.649
that suppress the seizures.

00:18:56.649 --> 00:18:58.940
But if they can't respond
with medications or something

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.440
doesn't work, they
become candidates

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.080
for this procedure where we're
going to bring them to the lab,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.880
open their brain,
stick electrodes

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.740
in the area in their
brain where we think

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.200
or suspect the
seizure's onset are.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.974
We'll plug those
wires to a computer.

00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:12.890
And we'll start recording
their brain activity

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.840
24/7 for the next couple of
days while they sit there

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.480
and wait to have a seizure.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.370
Now, we want them
to have a seizure.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.745
Because when they
have a seizure,

00:19:20.745 --> 00:19:23.570
we can actually trace the
seizure's flow in their brain

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.534
as it goes and figure out
exactly where it started.

00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.950
And once we have enough seizures
to identify the location,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.732
we can actually take
out the electrodes,

00:19:30.732 --> 00:19:32.940
resect the part of their
brain that started seizures,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.820
close everything, and send
the patient away seizure free.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.700
So that's the clinical
purpose of this procedure.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.700
And what I do is I say
to the patient, you know,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.470
you're already here.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.020
You have electrodes
in your brain,

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.853
and we're recording
your acuity all the time

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.470
while you watch TV, read
books, talk to your friends.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.990
Do you mind also letting me
show you a picture of Colgate

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.656
and Crest and see how
you make decisions

00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:55.830
and understand how thinking
works in your brain?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.110
Now, patients are very
happy to participate,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.020
because they really can't
move their head much.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.600
And this is most of what
they do in the hospital is

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.620
talking to us.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.578
So now we have a chance
for us to actually look

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.270
at the brain of a
human from the inside

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.680
and eavesdrop on the activity
of cells in their brain

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.490
and see how thinking
looks from inside.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.073
So here is an example
of how it looks.

00:20:11.073 --> 00:20:12.330
So here is one patient.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.940
What you see here are
the images that they

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.575
see on a screen in
front of their eyes.

00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:17.950
And what I'm going
to play to you

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.170
is the sound of one cell
in their brain that codes

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:22.810
something.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.480
Try to see if you can
figure out for yourself what

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.230
this cell codes.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.240
What is the thought that
this cell responds to?

MORAN CERF: So this is the
cell in this woman's brain

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.395
that codes the thought
of Marilyn Monroe.

00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:55.770
Every time she thinks of
Marilyn Monroe, this cell fires.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.186
In fact, in your
brains right now,

00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:58.610
if you know what
Marilyn Monroe is

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.674
or who she is, or have
any concept of her,

00:21:00.674 --> 00:21:02.840
every time you think about
that, cells in your brain

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.399
come to life.

00:21:03.399 --> 00:21:04.940
And they do the same
thing right now.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.674
This is how a thought
looks inside the brain.

00:21:07.674 --> 00:21:10.090
Now, what's interesting is
that this is not just a thought

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.580
that's specific to this image.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.147
It's every representation of
the idea of Marilyn Monroe.

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.980
And we know it because
I can do many things.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.540
We can actually show her not
just one picture stimulus,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.710
we can actually show her,
for instance, movies.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.510
And you'll see that when she
sees a movie with Marilyn

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.760
Monroe, the same cell fires
in a different pattern

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.330
but the same idea.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.180
So you hear the cell again.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.590
You see different movies.

Hollywood has a dream.

00:21:41.604 --> 00:21:43.080
What's your dream?

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.032
- I have a dream that one day--

00:21:46.032 --> 00:21:49.968
- (SINGING) I wish
I had a man who--

MORAN CERF: And the
activities sustain

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.239
as long as the thought
is in this person's mind.

00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:55.880
And what's even
more remarkable is

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.337
that it doesn't have to
come from the outside.

00:21:59.337 --> 00:22:01.420
If you close your eyes and
imagine Marilyn Monroe,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.880
the same thoughts would
occur in your brain,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.100
and the same cells would fire.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.650
And we know that because we
tried that with our patients.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.525
One of my colleagues
actually had the patient

00:22:10.525 --> 00:22:12.880
sit there and just
recall from her memory

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.970
the clips she has
seen in the morning.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.700
What you're going to
see now is that when

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.380
the patient remembers Marilyn
Monroe, the same cell fires.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.100
And in fact, it fires
seconds before she speaks.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.710
So we see her thoughts
coming to her.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.376
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

[TAPPING SOUNDS]

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:32.710
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.293
MORAN CERF: This
means that we can now

00:22:34.293 --> 00:22:35.920
look inside the
patient's brain and see

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.207
how her thoughts emerge.

00:22:37.207 --> 00:22:38.790
And what's interesting
here isn't just

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.498
that we can decode
her thoughts, but also

00:22:40.498 --> 00:22:44.240
that we can decode them
earlier than she expresses them

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.370
and even earlier than she
thinks she thought them.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.990
So if you ask the
woman, when did you

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.530
think about Marilyn Monroe?

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.750
She would say, when I said
that or a fraction of a second

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.250
before.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.907
She wouldn't imagine
that in her brain

00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:57.240
there are cells that come to
life that code that thought

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.750
a second before she speaks.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.520
In fact, when I talk
to you right now,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.860
I don't really feel
that anything I'm saying

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.080
is being planned
in my mind before.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.390
I feel that whatever
I think it, I say it.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.910
And the reality is that you
and I are both witnesses

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.110
of my brain happening.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.360
It's just that I
own it, and I think

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.150
that I wanted to say it because
it came out of my mouth.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.450
We both experience whatever my
mind is saying in real time,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.270
but one of us thinks
that it must be something

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.880
that I really, really feel
comfortable with because it

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.950
came out of my mouth.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.236
And we don't experience
those processes that

00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:30.610
come up with the verb, and
the structure, and the vowels,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.318
and put them together,
and the adjective,

00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:33.760
and build it-- and
build the idea.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.740
We just see the bottom line.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.140
And we call this my thoughts.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.930
Now, once we find
thoughts in your brain,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:41.950
and we can actually
decode them, there's

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.670
a lot of stuff we
can do with it.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.010
Beyond just predict what
you're going to say,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.320
we can also do all kinds of
things that are now really

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.900
in the public eye
a lot, which is

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.790
connect your brain
essentially to machines

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.820
and have you connect or control
things on the outside world.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.490
So we can do things like have
the patient sit there in bed

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.434
and play games with her mind.

00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:01.600
So she just sits there and
thinks of Marilyn Monroe.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.130
And when she does,
the spaceship goes up.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.180
And you can have her
play a game where

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.556
she tries to avoid
obstacles just

00:24:05.556 --> 00:24:06.805
by thinking of Marilyn Monroe.

00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:07.720
And we can kind of--

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.660
punishing her or giving her
a reward for doing that.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.365
We can do that, of course,
to show that we can do it.

00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:14.740
But the idea behind
it is that we

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.510
can take people who
lost the ability

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.760
to control some
parts of their bodies

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.500
because the connection
was severed--

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.316
think of soldiers
who were hit, say,

00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:24.190
from the neck down and
now have no connection

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.780
from the mind to the arms.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.462
And we can now
read their thoughts

00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:29.420
and control a prosthetic
arm that will actually

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.340
activate their wheelchair, or
turn the channels on the TV,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.090
or write emails for
them, or do everything

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.770
that they can't do with
their motor activity

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.730
themselves just by thinking
their thoughts in their mind.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.280
And we can also do the
most interesting thing

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.640
that I could think of
in terms of neuroscience

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.680
right now, which is decode a
person's thought in real time.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.110
So our main work,
a few years ago,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.360
was one where we basically
had patients sit in bed,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.069
think on one of multiple
things that we found earlier

00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:57.360
in the morning in their brain--

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.954
Marilyn Monroe, Michael
Jackson, their mom, their dad,

00:24:59.954 --> 00:25:01.620
the Eiffel Tower,
anything we could find

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.870
in the morning in their brain.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.140
And we can just decode
and project their thoughts

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.790
on a screen in
front of their eyes.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.339
Now, what's really
interesting about that

00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:11.630
is, first, that we can do that.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.046
But also that once
we can do that,

00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:17.380
we can actually find
how early can we tell

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.340
what you're going to think?

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.570
And so at what point is your
brain taking those thoughts

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.760
and making them into
a conscious person?

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.760
At what point is your brain
calling all of that reality?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.992
And the interesting thing
is that it's not obviously

00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:30.950
happening in real time.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.010
In fact, it doesn't
happen necessarily at all.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.300
So here's an example.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.640
Here's a picture of
what you all see.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.660
It's kind of flickering.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.534
And I can tell you that
your brain is already

00:25:39.534 --> 00:25:40.715
upset at this picture.

00:25:40.715 --> 00:25:42.687
And it tells that something
is not right here.

00:25:42.687 --> 00:25:44.020
It's just that you don't listen.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.960
Your consciousness
isn't aware of it.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.890
So what you see here is actually
not just one but two pictures.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.510
They alternate.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.000
And there is one aspect
of the picture that

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.570
keeps changing and coming back.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.710
And I can tell you that
your brains all see it.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.490
In your brain, there is a
cell that right now fires

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.740
and stops and fires and stops.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.760
It just doesn't tell
your consciousness.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.390
Try to see if you can-- raise
your hand if you can see it.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:07.931
Don't say it.

00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:08.949
Just raise your hand.

00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:11.240
So those of you who don't
see it right now get nervous.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.720
You're starting to scan the
picture from top to bottom,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.510
left to right, maybe
the Canada flag.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.560
Maybe it's the shadow
of the soldier.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.520
You count the soldiers.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.936
You look at the number of
windows on the airplane.

00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:22.060
It's the engines in center.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.351
Here I'm going to point it out.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.499
The good thing is that once
you've seen it right now,

00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:31.540
you can never not see it.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:31.750
This is it.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.490
It's one time learning.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.989
So for the rest of your life,
it's going to be in your brain

00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:35.920
right now.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.804
And what's interesting
beyond the fact

00:26:37.804 --> 00:26:40.220
that it's a cool experiment
is the idea that in your brain

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.730
there is some cells
that code engines.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.220
And those cells were firing
and stopping and firing

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.460
and stopping all the time.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.970
It's just that somewhere
it didn't bubble up

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.970
into your consciousness.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.470
And you, even though
you wanted it,

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.928
couldn't get the
part of your brain

00:26:51.928 --> 00:26:53.230
that told it to give it to you.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.729
So somewhere in
your brain there was

00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:56.150
a gap between who
knows the answer

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.170
and who's actually in control.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.200
I'll show you another example.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.783
So if you felt smart
on the first one,

00:26:59.783 --> 00:27:03.297
you have a chance
to try another one.

00:27:03.297 --> 00:27:04.630
Raise your hand when you see it.

00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:10.879
This one is harder,
it seems, to people.

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:12.170
It actually correlates with IQ.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.090
If you didn't see
both, then, eh--

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.960
no.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.920
It does not correlate with IQ.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.740
OK.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.740
It's the leaves right here--

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.910
a little harder.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.910
So we can go on and on
with many other examples.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.618
But the point is
somewhere in your brain,

00:27:27.618 --> 00:27:29.920
someone knows something,
and it doesn't tell you.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.830
Now, if I know this person
in your brain saw something,

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.370
and I can find it in a
gap that's big enough,

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.374
I can actually not just find
it out but also change things.

00:27:39.374 --> 00:27:41.790
And where we're going with
that is one step further, which

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.350
is to see what happens
if I change something

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.669
before the time you
become aware of it

00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:48.710
and actually make you have
a different experience

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:49.550
of reality.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.560
So one of the things we
did with our patients--

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.390
we had them play a
game where we said,

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.730
we're going to have you
make simple choices.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.910
Again, very basic.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.454
We give them a wooden box
with two big red buttons--

00:27:58.454 --> 00:27:59.870
one on the left,
one on the right.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.240
And we tell them
this is an experiment

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.380
about making decisions.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.750
For the next 20 minutes, we
ask you to just sit here.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.125
And whenever you feel like,
press the buttons on the left

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:08.870
or on the right in random order.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:12.736
So left, right, right, left,
left, right, left, and so on.

00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:14.360
Nothing important,
just makes no sense.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.240
We're going to want to know how
your brain looks when you make

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.650
decisions to go left or right.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.720
That's it.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.960
But as always,
there's a twist here.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.700
We told the patient, by the way,
because we care about choices,

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.200
every time you press
a button, we're

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.690
going to turn the
lights on for a second

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.730
just to save the
data from your brain.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.440
This is how we know
that we are saving.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.630
So when we're saving,
please don't touch anything.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.171
Wait for it to turn
off, and then you

00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:37.140
can start on our trial.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.087
So important-- when the lights
are on, don't touch anything.

00:28:41.087 --> 00:28:42.670
And we let the patient
start the game.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.470
And for the first
maybe 50 trials,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:45.430
the patient just
presses the buttons,

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.429
and we just leave their
brain activity normally.

00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:49.930
But after 50 trials or so, when
we feel like we can actually

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:54.400
decode their thoughts far before
he or she are executing them,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.110
we actually start
the real experiment.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.660
Where if it's times zero, I
know that in four seconds,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.160
they are going to
press the buttons.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.721
I wait 3.9 and turn
them on on their own.

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.970
So when you press the buttons,
the light's already on.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.980
And there's a big
buzzer in the room.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.080
And we tell you,
what did you do?

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.980
You just ruined the experiment.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.070
We told you not to do one thing.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.950
Don't touch the button if
the lights are already on.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.480
I'm so sorry, doctor, it
kind of happened by itself.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.700
Never mind, you just
ruined everything.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.110
We're going to start and make
sure you don't do it again.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.370
What you see is this
unique experience,

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.340
the patient's experience,
where what they want to happen

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.690
has already happened.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.286
And they can try
to do it faster.

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:28.660
They can try to
kind of trick us.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.740
They go to the right
and then to the left.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.615
But it doesn't matter,
I'm inside their head.

00:29:31.615 --> 00:29:33.340
As soon as they
know, I already know.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.512
So here is kind of how it looks.

00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:39.480

[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:56.151 --> 00:29:57.650
MORAN CERF: And
what's remarkable is

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:01.041
this kind of experience that
we all can think about but not

00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:01.790
really believe it.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.240
When I tell you your thoughts
are known to me before, you

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.073
kind of say, that's
cool, but I don't really

00:30:06.073 --> 00:30:07.210
experience life like this.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.360
We call it the
illusion of free will.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.700
We all can talk about free
will as a philosophical idea,

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.650
but we actually believe
that we are in control.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:13.760
And these patients,
for the first time,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.800
have this unique
experience that they really

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.639
feel this experience
of not having control.

00:30:18.639 --> 00:30:19.680
You go to the restaurant.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.410
You see there's three
items on the menu--

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.267
steak, salmon, and salad.

00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:25.850
And you say I want steak-- say,
oh, sorry, we're out of salad.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.058
Oh, I was about to say salad.

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:27.650
Never mind.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.520
Steak or salmon.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.840
Oh, there's no salmon also.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.730
We basically eliminate
things from your life

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.040
before you made them.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.352
And this gives you this
experience of lack of control

00:30:37.352 --> 00:30:39.810
in a very unique way, which we
try to extend to psychology.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.870
What's interesting here
actually isn't that.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.670
What's interesting
is what happens next.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.190
So the fact that I can actually
change things in the world

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.530
before you experience them,
because I know them early

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.150
is cool, but not surprising.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.200
Once I find the cells, I
can do whatever I want.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.908
What actually is
interesting is if we can

00:30:53.908 --> 00:30:55.290
do something even more complex.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.800
So if I know at time
zero that in four seconds

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.746
you're going press the
button, I can wait 3.9 seconds

00:31:00.746 --> 00:31:02.120
and turn the button
on my myself,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.610
but I can also turn the lights
on as soon as I know it.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.440
And if I turn the lights
on when I know it,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.990
it's so early that
you don't even

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.090
know that you were
about to know something.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.756
And in fact, what
happens is the patient

00:31:12.756 --> 00:31:16.029
sits there and see lights
turning on, off, on, off.

00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:17.570
And they have no
understanding of why

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:18.480
those lights turn on and off.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.250
They don't know that it's
their brain who wanted it,

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.833
because the lights
turning on actually

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:23.870
stops their brain
from experiencing it.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.700
But their brain knows it,
because it sent the signal.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.680
So what happens is
that there was actually

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.690
a conversation here
between me and their brain

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.050
behind their back.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.050
And we know that it's
true because at some point

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.904
the cells in their
brain stops functioning.

00:31:34.904 --> 00:31:36.320
Because they kind
of see that they

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.542
set an action to be
happening, and it

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:39.750
didn't happen multiple times.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.730
So they just think
something doesn't work

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.980
and just moved to
a different-- will

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.170
tend to go back afterwards.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.706
So there's a unique
opportunity here

00:31:44.706 --> 00:31:46.580
to speak to someone's
brain behind their back

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.040
and really get a
sense of the person

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.400
and their unconscious mind.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.816
And the reason
it's interesting is

00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:54.750
because we live life through
the part of the brain that's

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.880
in the conscious part.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.370
And we call this me.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.667
We think this is us.

00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:00.500
And now, for the first
time, we can actually

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.960
give those patients access
to a part of their brain

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.000
that they normally
have no control over.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.820
Most of our brain is actually
not under our control.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.060
When you see the world,
it's already in color.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.360
Some part of your brain had to
add the color, decode shapes

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.080
and orientations.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.622
And when you see,
it's only in color.

00:32:16.622 --> 00:32:18.579
And if I tell you, please
make the world black,

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:19.250
you can't do it.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.821
Even though your brain has
the capacity to change color,

00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:23.570
you can't really turn
it off, because it's

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.040
happening under
the hood in places

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.140
that there are not access to.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.050
Even things that are
more accessible to us

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.280
are far from our control--

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.187
emotions.

00:32:32.187 --> 00:32:34.520
Emotions are something you
can actually kind of control.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.770
You have some access to them,
but they aren't really fully

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.600
under your control.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.680
You don't say, you
know, my mom is sick.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.760
I want to feel sad.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.891
I'm going to activate
sadness right now.

00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:43.390
OK.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.766
Deactivate sadness.

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:45.890
It's not working like this.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.370
They don't own us.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.370
We can control the inputs,
but at the same time,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.100
the emotions happen, and we
kind of are witnesses to them.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.450
Now, with these patients, for
the first time in history,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.820
we can actually put
electrodes in those places

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.640
where colors happen, where
emotions happen, where

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.410
breathing happens,
and teach them how

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.987
to control their brain in
a different experience.

00:33:02.987 --> 00:33:04.820
So we have now works
where we teach patients

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.140
how to control their emotions.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.790
We put in electrodes in the
emotional part of the brain

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.590
and tell them, using
feedback, that something

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.173
that they did right
now actually sends

00:33:11.173 --> 00:33:12.480
the feedback to the emotion.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.620
We tell them now learn how to
control your fear so you won't

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.930
feel afraid or actually
feel afraid and just change

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.560
the levels.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.060
We can actually let them
control their breathing.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.535
So up to now, we define
a person as alive

00:33:25.535 --> 00:33:27.410
or dead by looking at
the part of their brain

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.250
that controls their breathing.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.140
And if it's not active,
we call this person dead.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.430
With our patients,
whenever it works,

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.080
we can actually teach
them how to move

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.810
the control of their
breathing to a different part

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:35.180
of their brain.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.160
So they seem like they
are dead in many ways,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.480
but actually they are just
controlling their breathing

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.410
on a different parts.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.700
And the idea is that now we
unlock a lot more of our brain.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.210
All of our brain is active, but
only a small percentage of it

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.260
is under our control.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.210
And now with those electrodes, I
can put it in different places,

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.626
plus feedback from
those patients,

00:33:51.626 --> 00:33:54.770
we can actually teach
people how to control them.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.980
So I want to use
also the last five

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.730
minutes to talk about
something inspiring.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:02.570
And for that I have to
connect our work to what

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.600
we're doing right now and
where I think it's heading.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.370
First, a little bit of history--

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.370
so October 28, 2010, is when
the work I mentioned to you

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.510
right now came to life,
as in we published it.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.409
It was published in
a very high profile

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:16.850
journal, academic journal.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.350
And because of that, a
lot of people in the world

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.219
cared about our work.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.635
And journalists called me and
asked me questions about it.

00:34:21.635 --> 00:34:24.770
And one of them was a
journalist from BBC England who

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.560
said we're really curious about
how you can project people's

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.019
thoughts on the screen.

00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:29.810
Tell me about that.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.500
And I explained the
work a little bit.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.079
And then he says, what
else can you do with that?

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.870
Like if you can project
someone's thoughts,

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.210
can you project their emotions
on the screen, or maybe

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.639
their memories, or their dreams?

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.389
And I say, in theory,
it's possible.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.062
Thank you, bye.

00:34:42.062 --> 00:34:43.520
So the last thing
that happened was

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.739
that I told someone from
BBC that dream recording is

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:49.040
possible in theory.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.350
However, the theory was lost
quickly in the headline.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.934
And before long, the title was
dream recording is possible.

00:34:54.934 --> 00:34:57.800
And they were still kind
of in quotation marks

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.200
making it seemingly
maybe possible.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.010
But this didn't stay with
quotation marks very long.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.044
About five minutes into the
moment our work came out,

00:35:07.044 --> 00:35:08.960
the entire world was up
in arms about the fact

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.320
that scientists are
recording your dreams.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.610
And quickly, not just
recording your dreams,

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.170
but there were questions about--

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.510
how we did it, and how long
have we been doing that?

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.740
People started
calling me and saying

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.230
they want to subpoena me
because I've been involved

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.510
or approached by the CIA
to record their dreams

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.974
for the last couple of years.

00:35:27.974 --> 00:35:29.390
People called me
and asked me if I

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:33.200
can look at their spouse's
dreams, a lot of that.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.199
There was actually a
chef, not far from here,

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.740
who is a famous chef
in New York, who

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.031
said that he's been dreaming
of a recipe for years now,

00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:41.220
and he wants me to put
electrodes in his brain

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.700
and extract them.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.010
A big operating system
company called us

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.510
and wanted the option to build
a coding machine in the next OS.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.316
And when I told them
it doesn't exist,

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.690
they say I'm
playing hard to get,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.030
and they are going
to build their own.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.580
There were websites and
Wikipedia pages for the dream

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.330
recording machine.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:01.121
And the world was
excited about this thing.

00:36:01.121 --> 00:36:04.730
This was, in fact, for a
few days the number one

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.535
story on science and tech--

00:36:06.535 --> 00:36:07.340
the recording.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.465
And despite me saying to
everyone, it's impossible,

00:36:09.465 --> 00:36:11.460
the story had a life of its own.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.187
I was pretty frightened, as you
can imagine, from this thing.

00:36:14.187 --> 00:36:15.770
I called my dad, who
was a journalist,

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.930
and I said, Dad, how
do you kill a story?

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.260
And he said, son, no
one cares about science.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.635
Just turn off the
phone and wait.

00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:22.040
It's going to die on its own.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.440
It didn't happen.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.800
Because I didn't take calls,
it just came via email

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.690
and a lot more attention
was given to it.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.000
In fact, my not answering
just made it worse.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
The worst thing I did
was, because it came out

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.739
in October 28, three days
after it was Halloween,

00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:39.530
my students had the
idea that we were going

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.000
to go to a Halloween party.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.640
And I had the idea to
make a joke of this

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.400
and dress up like Sigmund Freud.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.920
So this is days of
really massive sharing.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.420
That picture came
out, and now there

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.260
was not just like a
headline, but also a picture

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.680
of me looking ridiculous.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.910
And this was kind of in my
life for about two weeks

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.870
as a career killing experience.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.894
But what was interesting is
that I spent a lot of time

00:37:05.894 --> 00:37:07.310
talking to the
news and explaining

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.230
to everyone that
recording is impossible,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.271
and that we didn't do it.

00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:12.560
And that it's not really
how our work could be done,

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.810
because we only look at
patients when they were awake.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.230
And nothing could work
when they were sleeping.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.880
And this story actually
died when Prince William

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.294
proposed to his girlfriend.

00:37:23.294 --> 00:37:25.210
And this was like a much
more important thing.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.030
And it was out of my life
for a number of years,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:33.280
until one day in April of 2013,
I got a call from BBC again.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.352
And they asked me to comment
again on dream recording.

00:37:37.352 --> 00:37:39.310
I said, we've been through
it before, you know,

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:39.940
it's not true.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.040
And look, this is the time to
actually correct the mistake.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.331
And they said, wait, wait stop.

00:37:43.331 --> 00:37:44.890
We know that you didn't do that.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.930
But we actually want to comment
on the work of Yuki Kamitani

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:47.846
from Japan who did it.

00:37:47.846 --> 00:37:49.450
So it turns out that
a group in Japan

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.239
didn't know that
it's impossible.

00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:52.822
And they just saw
that someone did it,

00:37:52.822 --> 00:37:54.405
and they just followed
up on our work.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.740
They actually wanted to
improve on the same technique

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.100
that we didn't use.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.079
And they were the first guys to
do what we said was impossible.

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:03.370
They were the first guys to
actually record the dreams.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.745
They did it in a technique
that was developed in Berkeley

00:38:05.745 --> 00:38:08.830
by a guy called Jack Gallant
where basically the idea is

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.350
that you put electrodes
next to a part of your brain

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.180
that decodes visual
activities-- and not really

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.720
the thoughts like we do, not
Marilyn Monroe, but just lines

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.560
and shapes.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.760
And essentially, when
people were awake,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.510
looked at their brain
activity in the back

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.540
and realized that they
could actually decode.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.670
On the left is a movie
that people were watching.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.211
And on the right is
what the computer

00:38:29.211 --> 00:38:31.612
suggests the person was seeing.

00:38:31.612 --> 00:38:33.070
And this was done
using FMRI, which

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.100
is a much more crude
tool than the one we use.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.210
Instead of looking at Marilyn
Monroe, you would see a person,

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.600
or you would see a woman.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.650
That's about it.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.300
But the idea is that
the group in Japan

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.360
could actually have
people go to a scanner

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.080
and lie down there while
their brain is being scanned.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.420
And fortunately,
from my experience,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.640
undergrads tend to fall
asleep in every study

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.624
that you put them.

00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:58.040
So it was very easy to get
them to fall asleep in the lab.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.590
And when they fall
asleep, a computer

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.214
basically looks at
their brain activity

00:39:01.214 --> 00:39:05.360
and tries to decode one of a
small number of categories.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.920
Is it text?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.586
Is it an object?

00:39:06.586 --> 00:39:07.650
Is it a person?

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.324
And we turned out to
be pretty good in being

00:39:10.324 --> 00:39:12.490
able to then wake up the
patient and ask the person,

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.730
tell me what you
think you dreamed of

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.340
and get a sense of the
narrative, if you want,

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.730
or at least kind of gist
of what they're dreaming.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.240
And this unlocks
one of the coolest,

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.260
I think, things in
human experiment

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.820
and the idea of
looking inside dreams.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.450
Now, dreams have fascinated
humans for the last--

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.470
for millennia.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.940
And not only are
they fascinating,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.227
but they also are in our mind
the kind of access to our soul.

00:39:38.227 --> 00:39:40.810
You know, if you wake up and you
tell your girlfriend that you

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.351
had a dream about
your ex-girlfriend,

00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:44.226
she's going to be upset
with your awake self.

00:39:44.226 --> 00:39:46.767
And you can say, no, it was my
brain that created this movie.

00:39:46.767 --> 00:39:47.620
I'm not responsible.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.310
But somehow we get blamed
for our brain's movies.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.620
And in that sense,
whether it's true or not,

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.720
we all think our
dreams mean a lot.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.640
There is entire
set of professions

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.960
that try to interpret dreams.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.520
The psychiatrist who spend--

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.680
psychologists spend
days on couches

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.849
with people trying to have
them tell their stories.

00:40:05.849 --> 00:40:08.140
And the reality is, whether
they mean something or not,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.700
we don't know the
full understanding.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.780
But for the first
time in history,

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.084
we can actually decode that.

00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:13.750
And that's remarkable,
because up to now

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.559
we had to rely on
your awake self

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:17.350
to tell us the story
of your dreaming self.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.910
And we know that the awake
self and the dreaming self

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.720
are not aligned.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.310
We don't know the
language you use

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.400
to tell your dreams,
for instance,

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.920
is the language of
your awake self.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.810
If you are blind
when you are awake,

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.200
you surely will tell your story
as if your dreams were not

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.980
with visuals.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.300
In the 1930s, people would
describe their dreams

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.500
in black and white.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.170
Only when TV and film
started to have colors would

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.360
people start describing
their dreams in color.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.220
Because somehow, in their
mind, a dream is a movie,

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.160
and so whatever it was,
movies in their mind,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.618
is how they described
their dreams.

00:40:46.618 --> 00:40:49.090
Which means that whatever
we have as awake people

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.160
is the language we use
to share our dreams.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.740
And this is unreliable.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.781
And for many, many
decades, we couldn't really

00:40:56.781 --> 00:40:58.280
know what's going
on in your dreams,

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.776
because we only
had the awake self.

00:40:59.776 --> 00:41:01.400
And now, for the
first time in history,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.470
we can actually look
inside your dreams

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.900
and actually decode the
content and compare first

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.170
to what your brain
tells me happens inside,

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.570
and what you say, but also
get access to something

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.030
that you might have
forgotten when you woke up.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.650
And this isn't just
a cool thing that

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.780
allows us to actually
project dreams and tell you

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.220
the story that you
had in mind and see

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.511
how they aligned to what it is.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.370
It also allows us
to change behavior.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.910
Because what we learned
in the last three years

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:29.900
is that when you're sleeping,
your brain isn't just resting.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.660
It's actually
overworking, if you want,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.820
and doing a lot of things.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.278
And one of those
things is actually

00:41:34.278 --> 00:41:37.800
choosing behavior
that it wants to save

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.300
and one that it
wants to eliminate.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.466
So that when you wake up,
you have a different story

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:42.060
to craft.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.518
And if you go back
to the beginning

00:41:43.518 --> 00:41:45.530
where I told you that all
our consciousness does

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.630
is taking memories and
building them into a narrative,

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.320
now we know when it happens.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.630
We know that at some
point during the night,

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.704
there is a window of time--
it happens every 90 minutes--

00:41:57.704 --> 00:41:59.870
where your brain essentially
looks at all the memory

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.710
it has for the day and chooses
which ones to encapsulate,

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.975
which ones to eliminate.

00:42:04.975 --> 00:42:07.100
And if we go to the brain
at this moment and change

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.080
something, we can actually
create a new memory

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.746
so that when you wake up, you're
going to build into a narrative

00:42:11.746 --> 00:42:13.650
and change your behavior.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:17.090
Now, just a theory, in one of
the studies that my colleague

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.170
did a few years ago in 2015.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.550
She took smokers
who come to the lab

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.330
and are asked to take a nap.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:24.830
That's all.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:25.490
They don't tell anything.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:26.520
They're going to take a nap.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.220
And when they get to
the specific window

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.440
when your brain
essentially assesses what's

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.870
important in life, she
sprayed the smell of nicotine

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.660
into their nose making
their brain focus right now

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.529
on smoking as a thought.

00:42:37.529 --> 00:42:39.320
And then immediately,
she sprayed the smell

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.944
of rotten eggs, which
is a smell that's

00:42:40.944 --> 00:42:43.250
known to scientists to
actually penetrate your brain

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.970
and make you have aversive
response without waking you up.

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:49.100
So she pairs in
this person's brain

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.774
the idea of nicotine and
bad experiences, multiple

00:42:51.774 --> 00:42:52.940
in different concentrations.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.146
Now when a person wakes up
after two hours, not only

00:42:55.146 --> 00:42:57.020
do they not know what
happened, they actually

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.510
think that it was
just a regular nap,

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.280
but their brain internalized
the conditioning.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.910
And for the week
after, they actually

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.770
don't smoke or
smoke very little.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.399
It functionally goes
back afterwards.

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:10.690
So we didn't find the solution
to changing it entirely,

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.670
but we find a way to start
teaching your brain things

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.880
that you will actually live
by afterwards without knowing

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.475
what happened.

00:43:17.475 --> 00:43:19.100
And of course, we
have to try right now

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.010
to do it repeatedly
and see if it sustains.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.490
Do it more strongly
and see if it actually

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.410
changes them entirely.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.660
But now we know when your brain
actually stores and creates

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.350
memories.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.794
Then if we come in
between and change things,

00:43:30.794 --> 00:43:32.210
you're going to
do the work for us

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.050
in making those
into a narrative,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.800
a conscious perception of
yourself never smoking or never

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.090
being in this room with us.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.730
And then you will
actually use that to tell

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.430
a different story of yourself.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.230
OK.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.210
So why am I telling
you all of that--

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.410
and with this I'm about to end--

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.511
because we kind of unlocked
the meaning of thoughts.

00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:54.760
We know the code of a thought.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.551
And we know how to find
them in your brain.

00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:59.500
We're now able to map them and
be able to project them outside

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.840
and actually use that to
get access to what you're

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.350
about to do before you do that.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.280
That's pretty cool.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.790
We can also look at that in
specific moments in your life

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.370
and change things that
are under the hood,

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.630
so you will only experience
them after the fact

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.713
and just defend them as
if they were your thoughts

00:44:13.713 --> 00:44:15.470
and live a life that
aligns with them.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.860
And we now can use that
to even look at your brain

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.590
and change your behavior
in a massive way, such

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.990
that you will actually
stop all kinds of behavior

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.830
that you don't like.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.620
And now we are playing with the
idea of actually coding dreams

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.745
into your mind and actually
going inside and making

00:44:28.745 --> 00:44:29.470
a story for you.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.184
So you can actually go to sleep
and buy the dream by Spielberg,

00:44:32.184 --> 00:44:33.850
and you know, have
that Spielberg dream.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.252
Or actually see if we can
align people's dreams.

00:44:36.252 --> 00:44:37.960
So take two people
who sleep side by side

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.220
and actually make sure
that they actually

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.607
have somehow related dreams.

00:44:40.607 --> 00:44:41.440
So you go on a date.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.210
And you come back home.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:43.251
And the date doesn't end.

00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:45.340
You actually continue
the dream together.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.362
Or the ultimate
goal of this work

00:44:47.362 --> 00:44:48.820
is to try to see
if we can actually

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.260
teach you a new thing
when you're dreaming.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.676
So you can go to
sleep and wake up

00:44:51.676 --> 00:44:54.190
knowing Kung Fu--
not working so far.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.449
But besides all of that
lies the coolest thing

00:44:56.449 --> 00:44:58.490
which I'm going to end
with, that I started with,

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.080
that I want to finish with.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.640
And that is the idea that
we now actually change

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.240
the center or the locus
of control in our brain.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.757
So we live life like the
character from the King Kong

00:45:12.757 --> 00:45:13.590
game that I showed--

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.490
Donkey Kong game
earlier thinking

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.110
that we are controlling
the character.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:19.210
And we give more and
more evidence to people

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.168
that we're not, but it
doesn't change anything.

00:45:21.168 --> 00:45:22.840
We still think that
we are in control.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.892
And it's because it's
hard for us to change it.

00:45:24.892 --> 00:45:26.350
It's hard for us
to accept the fact

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.650
that my brain has components
that make decisions,

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.400
and I'm aware of those
only after the fact

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.815
and just explain them.

00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:33.940
But there's a good analogy
here that I really like.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.820
It allows me to at least
accept it partially.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.454
And I think that
if you follow this,

00:45:38.454 --> 00:45:40.870
and if you just accept this
partial understanding that I'm

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.820
suggesting right now, it
will help you in the future.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.361
And then can take
questions about how

00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:45.980
we can actually implement this.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.930
And this is an analogy
from 408 years ago

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.930
when Galileo Galilei
pointed his telescope

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:56.110
to the moons of Jupiter and
tried to observe their orbit.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.906
What he saw was that the
planets were not orbiting--

00:45:59.906 --> 00:46:01.780
the moons weren't orbiting
the planet the way

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.430
he thought they should go.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.260
And the only way
to explain this was

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.280
to change the entire
making of the solar system

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.260
and put the sun in
the center and Earth

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.440
as the third planet from center.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.949
Now, this, to him, felt
like a failure of society.

00:46:15.949 --> 00:46:18.490
What does it mean that we are
not the center of the universe?

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.906
What does it mean that we are
not the most important thing

00:46:20.906 --> 00:46:21.570
in the world?

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.410
But once he accepted it, he was
able to see outside of what we

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.730
thought the world was before.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.760
He could see far outside
into the wild reaches

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.940
of the universe.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.360
And in the 400
years to follow, we

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.605
were able to explore
the big universe

00:46:35.605 --> 00:46:37.230
and see a lot more
of what's out there.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.570
Now, in the same way,
in the last 10 years,

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.030
beginning to understand
that we're not

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:44.550
the center of our own
universe, but in our own head,

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.880
there are many, many planets,
if you want, many voices.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.550
And the one we speak with is
not the most important one.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.300
It's just the one we
call us, because it's

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.180
the one we have
most control over.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.300
And if we begin to
understand that there's

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.633
other voices there, and that
we can actually give access

00:46:56.633 --> 00:46:59.860
to those voices using electrodes
or using other methods,

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.790
we can actually uncover
more of what's in your brain

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.360
and tell you what your dreams
mean, what your choices mean,

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.525
how you arrived at
them, and so on.

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:09.900
And in that sense,
we're not only

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.084
going to uncover the
mysteries of the brain,

00:47:12.084 --> 00:47:14.250
we're going to understand
the most interesting thing

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.770
in the universe, which is us.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:18.519
Thank you.

00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:22.012
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.810
All right.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.420
So now we can talk about
the philosophy of that,

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.087
or business, or on
anything that I want,

00:47:34.087 --> 00:47:36.420
which is to convince you that
there is a need for people

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.960
with the understanding of
machine learning and coding

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.557
in this field.

00:47:42.557 --> 00:47:43.390
I made it seem easy.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.700
It's just like listening
to brain activity.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.283
But the reality is that most of
the problems we have right now

00:47:47.283 --> 00:47:49.637
are just time series
that we need to decode.

00:47:49.637 --> 00:47:51.720
We know that something
happened in the real world,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.010
that the brain was
coding it, and we want

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.260
to know what connects what.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.530
So there's a room for a
lot of knowledge here.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.030
Questions?

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.430
Yes.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.050
AUDIENCE: There
is-- there's a ton.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.430
I have two, actually.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.380
One is maybe simpler to answer.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.870
It seems to me that
there is a huge need

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:12.409
for enhanced resolution
with noninvasive mechanisms.

00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:14.700
Can you tell us something
about the latest developments

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.300
in that?

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.008
MORAN CERF: Sure.

00:48:16.008 --> 00:48:18.000
So there is a big
movement right now.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.540
It tries to basically
use these results

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.210
and make things that go inside
your brain to control them.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.668
You probably heard about Brian
Johnson and Elon Musk trying

00:48:26.668 --> 00:48:28.290
to go there.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.690
Generally, we want to poke
inside our brain and control

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.540
things.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.030
The problem is that
the only way we

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.446
know how to get
in the brain right

00:48:34.446 --> 00:48:36.390
now is to dig a hole
in it and get inside.

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.600
And this is not something
that you all can try at home.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.754
So the science of
that is pretty easy.

00:48:41.754 --> 00:48:43.420
Look, we know the
language of the brain.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.130
We know how to do it.

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.713
The question is, how
do we get inside?

00:48:45.713 --> 00:48:50.300
The leading technique right
now that people look into

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:50.930
is ingestible.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.700
We are trying to create
pills that you will swallow.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.460
And they will travel inside
your blood brain barrier,

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:00.870
and get to your brain, and live
there, and do things for you

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:01.797
permanently.

00:49:01.797 --> 00:49:04.380
So we know how to create viruses
that can go in specific cells

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.590
and live there.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:09.240
And we try to find the
same way with pills.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.220
It's raising a lot of
ethical questions and so on.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.130
And it also--

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.329
I'm going make a prediction.

00:49:15.329 --> 00:49:17.370
I'll tell you how I think
it's going to work out.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.680
One Silicon Valley
rich guy is going

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.270
to just poke a hole inside
his or her person's brain

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:28.590
and stick a chip inside that
will connect their thoughts

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.110
straight to the World Wide Web.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.090
And this would allow
them to have advantages.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.100
They would do high frequency
trading inside their head

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.600
faster.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.320
They would solve
math problems faster.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.250
And they play chess
better than you,

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.921
because they have
access to that world.

00:49:39.921 --> 00:49:42.420
And everyone's going to think
they're insane for doing that.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.860
But then they're going to
think, oh, they have advantage,

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.680
I should do it the same.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.875
And within a few years, it's
going to become widespread,

00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:47.880
and everyone's going
to do it themselves.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.171
And then it becomes mainstream.

00:49:49.171 --> 00:49:52.050
It's not entirely
science fiction.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.650
It happened before in the
'50s or '40s, I think.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.540
The idea of a putting
silicon inside your breast

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.940
seemed like an outrageous idea.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.800
Who was going to put
something inside their breast?

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.960
I think that right now,
what is it, 70 years later,

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.330
one out of four
American girls age 16

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.409
ask for a breast implants
when she turns 16 birthday.

00:50:09.409 --> 00:50:10.950
So I think it's
quick from the moment

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.630
someone does it and looks
crazy to the moment we actually

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.560
all accept it.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.760
So that's my prediction.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.450
Very few, very soon,
inside of a brain.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.170
Second question, then we take--

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.360
AUDIENCE: So sorry--

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.540
I just really want to ask this.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.740
So it seems to me that a lot
of the studies and experiences

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.590
you've described deal
with decisions that

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:34.470
are not very consequential.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.630
Or to describe it differently--
that people do not

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:42.120
have a conscious
interest in modifying.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.460
And this kind of
thinking about this

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.770
makes me think about
thinking fast and slow.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:49.470
And you know, it doesn't seem
like their executive function,

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:52.290
the prefrontal cortex,
were involved there

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:55.620
or at least that they
tried to initiate them.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.120
So this description of
you living as a bystander

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.980
to decisions that
are already made

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.700
seems to me to be like a
partial description of reality

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.580
that applies to certain things,
but that you're probably

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.650
able to regain control if you
apply other parts of your brain

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:13.150
to.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:14.387
Is that correct?

00:51:14.387 --> 00:51:15.720
What can you tell us about that?

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.240
MORAN CERF: So up to now, we
try to change simple things,

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.280
like choice, so people
they don't know.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.245
And when we try even behavior,
like we change your life,

00:51:23.245 --> 00:51:25.092
and you pick the one
you like the most,

00:51:25.092 --> 00:51:27.300
and you pick your wife, and
we give you someone else,

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.980
you would notice right away.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.980
So it doesn't work with
consequential choices

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.950
on the behavioral part.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:34.549
However, the smoking experiment
is indicative with the fact

00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:36.090
that actually we
can change behaviors

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:40.054
that were at least something
that you were doing habitually.

00:51:40.054 --> 00:51:41.470
So the smoking
experiment-- we now

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.870
have one where we try to
make people eat healthy.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:44.920
Again, they go to sleep.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.780
They can nap.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.040
We essentially activate the
flavor of fat in their brain.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.790
When they wake up, we
say here's a buffet.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:51.664
Choose what you want.

00:51:51.664 --> 00:51:53.430
And they choose
themselves to eat healthy.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:56.580
This is starting to go in a
world that is a little bit more

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.000
like real life.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.170
But it's still not--

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:00.720
like it's still simple choices.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.340
I don't think we can have you
go to sleep a Republican, wake

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.210
up a Democrat, or vise versa--

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.300
yet.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.055
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:09.055 --> 00:52:09.959
MORAN CERF: Right.

00:52:09.959 --> 00:52:11.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks for that talk.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:12.550
It was mind blowing.

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.025
So I work in advertising.

00:52:15.025 --> 00:52:17.400
And you know, it's interesting
that you brought up, like,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.380
Sigmund Freud, because
advertising and public

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.870
relations and Sigmund
Freud and psychology

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:25.720
have done this work
for the past century.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.620
And all the examples that you
gave are really awe inspiring.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.700
And they were coming
from individuals wanting

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.420
to change their own behavior.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.970
But the field that
I'm in right now

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:39.820
is really interested in
cognitive behavioral theory,

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.880
choice architecture,
where it's not necessarily

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.480
I want to be a better person.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.550
It's like I have a product,
and I want you to buy it.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.800
And this terrifies
me, because it just

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.930
seems like one more
tool in the toolbox.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.700
And as exciting
as this is I just

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.680
have this disturbing
vision where

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.530
you have the rich dude
in Silicon Valley that

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.420
has super powers.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.430
And then 97% of
people on earth are

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.540
having choices made for them,
like the person that thinks

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.305
they're choosing the button.

00:53:13.305 --> 00:53:13.930
MORAN CERF: OK.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:15.096
AUDIENCE: How do you see it?

00:53:15.096 --> 00:53:17.360
MORAN CERF: That's
like a set up question.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:17.860
Absolutely.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.270
So this can be used to make
people stop smoking or eat

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.200
healthy, but it can
also make you wake up

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.890
and want Coca-Cola
better than Pepsi.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.000
And it works the same way.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.480
The brain doesn't know
what thought that you--

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.500
so it's absolutely risky.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.230
I mean, if I were to
choose my dream audience,

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.970
this would be this room,
because you, in many ways,

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.530
are the ones able to
navigate that choice.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.191
It would take forever until
what we found right now,

00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:49.690
how we did it, will turn into
a regulation by the government

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:50.606
and something that's--

00:53:50.606 --> 00:53:52.910
so then it's going to be
self-regulation for now.

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:55.090
The companies will have
to decide how to use that.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.100
And in the same way,
we understand that we

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.310
can make people eat healthy.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.530
We can also make them do things
that are not great for them.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.530
And what I would say if
I talked to my students,

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.730
I would say I hope I could speak
to people that actually have

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.440
the power to do it right now.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.770
So I mean historically--

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.380
I teach MBA students.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:20.690
And when I teach them, they're
still young and kind of pure.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.820
And we talk about
cognitive biases.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.230
And we talk about
behavioral changes.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:29.660
And they all are up in arms
when you speak about Proctor

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.980
and Gamble price is tied at
$6.99, but it's actually $7.00,

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.499
but it's fooling your senses.

00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:36.540
And then they go and work
for Proctor and Gamble,

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.720
and they do the same choices.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.350
Because it's like shoulders
and pressure and so on.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:48.030
I think that science is only
so good in offering options.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:50.280
And then the world has to
decide what to do with them.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.030
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any tips for someone

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.640
like me when somebody
comes and says,

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.120
this thing's going
to be amazing.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.786
It's going to drive
so many conversions.

00:54:56.786 --> 00:54:58.950
It's going to be so effective.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.627
Other than it just feels wrong?

00:55:02.627 --> 00:55:04.960
MORAN CERF: I will think of
a better one than right now,

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.060
because I think it's--

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.539
but I mean, you seem young.

00:55:07.539 --> 00:55:09.080
But I think in 20
years, you're going

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.880
to be the CEO of this company.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.340
So at least, let's agree that
when you're going to CEO,

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.590
you remember this moment.

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.050
So I'm optimistic.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.460
I think that the world is
actually getting better.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.793
So the fact that you asked
this question means that it's

00:55:23.793 --> 00:55:25.435
right away you see the problem.

00:55:25.435 --> 00:55:26.920
You see the potential.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.590
Is it opportunity
instead of threat?

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.780
And I think that's
a great first step.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.720
And the reality is
that every time I

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.920
give this talk with
a different version,

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.900
people face these
questions, which

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.760
means that we all
see that, and we're

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.600
both customers and
like companies.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.759
So if you do it to one
person in the evening,

00:55:44.759 --> 00:55:46.300
they're going to do
it the day after.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.550
So I think that--

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:51.540
historically, humans are
not great in using science

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.680
for good.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.690
We usually find
ways to exploit it.

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.080
But I'm optimistic still.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.680
So that's my thought.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.735
To ask questions?

00:55:59.735 --> 00:56:00.340
Great.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.006
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:56:01.006 --> 00:56:03.480
Thanks a lot for the
inspiration talk.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.130
I'm just wondering--
so would you

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:12.030
consider your experiment as a
counterexample to free will?

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.585
Do you have any response
from philosophers yet?

00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:15.210
MORAN CERF: OK.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:20.050
So I get asked a lot about free
will as a philosophical idea.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:23.890
And the reality is that we don't
have a good answer in the sense

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.369
that-- so we get you
beyond the moment

00:56:26.369 --> 00:56:27.410
you experience free will.

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:30.350
So if I ask you when you made
a choice to go left or right,

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:31.144
you would say now.

00:56:31.144 --> 00:56:32.810
And we show you that
this was a mistake.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.180
Surely the moment you made a
choice is not the moment that

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.055
really made a choice.

00:56:36.055 --> 00:56:38.470
We can go back
milliseconds, seconds,

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.734
before the choice was made and
predict it with high accuracy.

00:56:41.734 --> 00:56:43.650
But it doesn't mean that
there's no free will.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.190
It just maybe happened before.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.400
Maybe free will
happened at time zero,

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.284
and just you experienced
it as free will times four.

00:56:50.284 --> 00:56:51.700
So we don't have
the answer to it.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.949
It's like the Big Bang theory.

00:56:52.949 --> 00:56:54.880
We can go all the way
to the very beginning,

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.980
but we couldn't go beyond.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.680
I can tell you that we ask
questions of our subjects

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.010
in this experiment.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.787
And we can say that
there's psychology,

00:57:02.787 --> 00:57:04.370
like the patients
when they experience

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:05.994
that their choices
are being predicted,

00:57:05.994 --> 00:57:09.000
they do have all kinds of
questioning about more life,

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.680
like they become a little bit
more protective of rights.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.630
They defend criminals
a little bit different.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.820
It kind of brings big
questions about life.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:22.780
The counter answer is an example
that I read a few weeks ago.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:27.290
There is a gene that if you
carry this gene, I think,

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.640
you're nine times more likely
to be involved in a crime.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.850
Generally, I think nine
of the people in death row

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:34.614
carry this gene.

00:57:34.614 --> 00:57:36.280
And there's other
statistics about this.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.070
And it's the Y chromosome.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:41.504
So most bad things
are caused by men.

00:57:41.504 --> 00:57:42.920
So we can predict
when you're born

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.607
that you're going to be on
the side of potentially bad--

00:57:45.607 --> 00:57:47.440
it doesn't allow us to
do anything about it.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.231
We have to wait for
you to do those things.

00:57:49.231 --> 00:57:52.070
So when we came to judges with
our results and said, look,

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:54.790
we can actually help you decode
the intentions of people.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.130
And they said, look, you
guys, scientists came to us

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:00.200
in the 1920s with
phrenology, and you told us

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.892
that you can touch the scalp
and figure out when someone

00:58:02.892 --> 00:58:04.100
is going to do something bad.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.460
And then you came to us 10 years
after and you said, no, no.

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:07.251
This was a mistake.

00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:08.514
EEG's the right way to go.

00:58:08.514 --> 00:58:10.430
And then you came to us
in the '70s with FMRI.

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.263
And now you're coming
to us with your tools.

00:58:12.263 --> 00:58:14.200
We're going to wait a
few decades before we're

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.000
going to let you actually
predict behavior,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.870
because you change your mind.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:17.953
And I think they're right.

00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:19.840
I think that we can
predict to some extent,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.173
but we're still making mistakes.

00:58:21.173 --> 00:58:23.830
And that's enough to not be
a useful tool to really drive

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:25.904
a car with just your thoughts.

00:58:25.904 --> 00:58:27.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.030
MORAN CERF: Sure.

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:29.145
Last one.

00:58:29.145 --> 00:58:29.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:33.220
So I'm asking a
couple of questions.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:37.330
The first one is in terms of
identifying people's thoughts

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:38.555
and intentions.

00:58:38.555 --> 00:58:41.200
Where the state of other--

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.480
so is it actually-- is
it mostly about trying

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.600
to identify what
areas of the brain

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.150
get activated when people think
some things or have some ideas?

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:52.430
Or on the other
side, you are looking

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:56.140
at something like the
feed that you sent to us,

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.359
we'd send to your cardio
muscles or whatever.

00:58:58.359 --> 00:59:00.150
Is that the two main
things that are there,

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:04.900
or is there something much
more advanced than there, too?

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.214
MORAN CERF: So the
neuroscience of our work

00:59:07.214 --> 00:59:09.130
has kind of two angles--
one very applicative,

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.170
one very theoretical.

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.120
So the application is we're
trying to be really, really

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.190
good in decoding thoughts
so we can teach you

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:17.580
how to control things
outside of general behavior.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.350
So we want to help people
that smoke to stop smoking.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.230
We want to help people who
cannot move their arms control

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:25.290
a robotic arm or a
wheelchair and move around.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:26.290
This is the application.

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.272
And then we just try to
improve the accuracy.

00:59:29.272 --> 00:59:31.730
If right now, we can predict
your choice 9 out of 10 times,

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:33.340
I want to get to 10 out of 10.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.060
That's that.

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.274
The other angle is neuroscience.

00:59:36.274 --> 00:59:38.190
The fact that we found
out how the brain coded

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:43.932
a thought in those electrical
chemical spikes is still crude.

00:59:43.932 --> 00:59:45.890
Sometimes you heard that
it goes from [TAPPING]

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.320
to [RAPIDLY TAPPING].

00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.750
But we don't know
exactly why is it

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:51.460
that speed and not that speed.

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:55.210
And presumably this carries
the most interesting part

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:56.770
of our life.

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:58.450
The brain doesn't
randomly spike.

00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.800
Every spike means something.

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.342
So we now try to not
just be binary and say

01:00:02.342 --> 01:00:03.800
Marilyn Monroe,
not Marilyn Monroe,

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.385
but actually why is it coding
Marilyn Monroe this way

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:07.240
and not that way.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.530
What are the associations?

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:11.940
If Marilyn Monroe
reminds you of JFK,

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.950
will the cell that
coded Marilyn Monroe

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.595
fire for Kennedy as well?

01:00:15.595 --> 01:00:16.970
If you fire for
Kennedy, will you

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:18.720
fire for Bobby Kennedy
and other Kennedys?

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.020
Or just for one?

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:20.655
How far is it?

01:00:20.655 --> 01:00:22.780
So those are interesting
questions philosophically.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.940
When in your life
did you acquire this?

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.870
Why did it pick this
cell and not that cell?

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:30.340
So the neuroscience is really
both interesting and in need

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.720
of people with technical skills.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.250
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:38.380
The second question was
how transferable is this

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.910
from one person to the other?

01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:42.710
Because I'm assuming that the
way one person has an idea--

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.434
their knowledge base
about Marilyn Monroe

01:00:44.434 --> 01:00:46.600
is entirely different from
how another person thinks

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.700
about the idea of
Marilyn Monroe.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.519
So do you see this
being applied from--

01:00:51.519 --> 01:00:54.060
you know, like say something's
standing between us on a lane,

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.760
or maybe 10 people--
maybe like 1,000 people

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.340
see a billboard in Times
Square, and then somebody

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.350
captures that data
to figure out just

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.810
what phased from yesterday
in terms of thoughts?

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:07.480
Or do you think this is not
transferable at all based

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.070
on the data that you've seen?

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:10.590
MORAN CERF: So high
level, it's very possible.

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:11.320
Low level, it's not.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.090
So high but meaning
in all of our brains

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.220
that part of our brain that
codes people is the same.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.502
So there's a part
that it comes to life

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:20.960
when you think Marilyn Monroe,
when I think Marilyn Monroe.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.010
But within this
spot, there are many,

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.300
many millions or billions
of neurons and there

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.620
are organizationally chaotic.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.953
Like your Marilyn Monroe cell
is here and mine is there.

01:01:27.953 --> 01:01:29.834
They're all in the
same stadium, but you

01:01:29.834 --> 01:01:31.750
might sit in section
one, and I'm section two.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.500
And we didn't find any way
to kind of map one brain

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.805
to another in that
high level notion.

01:01:38.805 --> 01:01:40.180
But there's a
Nobel Prize hanging

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:44.170
on the understanding of how
the brain actually decides

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.390
which cell to code this.

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:46.931
There's all kinds
of questions, like,

01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:48.760
how do I structure
the fragment memories

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.690
and moving them over night?

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:50.890
And there's a lot of
theories why that is,

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.530
but no one actually knows
when the brain chose to put it

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:55.400
here and not there and why.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.030
Now, the reason it's
really, really interesting

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.910
is I can map your brain and find
Marilyn Monroe, and the Eiffel

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:03.080
Tower, and your mom and
dad cells in your brain.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.780
And I can find it in his brain.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.400
And once we do that,
we can actually

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.610
override communication.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:11.410
So if think about historically,
we evolved in a lot of ways

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.714
in the last decades.

01:02:12.714 --> 01:02:14.380
But communication is
still the same way.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.050
If you find a
Neanderthal right now,

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:20.950
he and you would speak the
same way-- vocal cords, mouth.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:23.150
And we know it's a
pretty slow process.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:28.360
I can think thoughts in about
600 thoughts per second--

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.110
per minute, sorry.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:32.140
I'm going to check my
brain, but I can talk then

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.240
only at 150 words per minute.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.600
I can do 300, but
you can do 150.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.150
So we are very slow.

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.085
We think a lot faster
than our bandwidth

01:02:41.085 --> 01:02:42.737
is to communicate them.

01:02:42.737 --> 01:02:44.320
And we also receive
them a bit faster.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.627
Clearly there is a barrier
here that if we overcome,

01:02:47.627 --> 01:02:49.960
if I can just find the Marilyn
Monroe cell in your brain

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.450
and in my brain,
and when I think it,

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.366
I just zap your brain.

01:02:52.366 --> 01:02:56.260
And you immediately see it, we
can start using high frequency

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.100
communication.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.467
And that's pretty cool.

01:02:58.467 --> 01:02:59.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:02:59.860
MORAN CERF: Sure.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.370
Thank you, guys.

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:01.120
It was a pleasure.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.020
[APPLAUSE]
