00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.210
We’ve all heard various sayings that decry
revenge as being a worthless act that’s

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.859
beneath any civilized human being.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.820
“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world
blind” said Gandhi.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.700
“Before you embark on a journey of revenge,
dig two graves” said Confucius.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.750
“Two wrongs don’t make a right” said
your parents probably at some point during

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.970
your childhood.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.130
But, whilst we can see their point with regards
to overt acts of revenge, there’s something

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.519
to be said for the healing power of passive-aggressive
revenge.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.210
If you’re looking for ideas, look no further.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.160
British Royal Band Uses Star Wars to Insult
Saudi Monarch

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.890
In 2007, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was
due to visit the UK for a royal engagement

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.050
with Queen Elizabeth II.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.730
However, as the leader of a country where
torture is rife, human rights are routinely

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.320
ignored, and governmental corruption is endemic,
it’s fair to say that this was a controversial

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.320
outing.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.880
On arriving to meet the Queen, it’s a long-established
tradition that every monarch is greeted with

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.520
a performance by the British Welsh Guards.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.230
However, despite not wanting to perform for
such a character, they didn’t want to break

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.290
years of protocol.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.690
So instead, when the King arrived, they greeted
him the most apropos song they could think

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.440
of: the Imperial March, i.e. that song from
Star Wars that was commonly used to herald

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.540
the arrival of supremely evil tyrants such
as Darth Vader.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.202
It’s not known whether the King understood
what was being played to him, but it’s easy

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:28.890
to spot the people in that video we linked
who are trying their best to keep a straight

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.780
face whilst royal protocol trashes a guy’s
reputation in the eyes of the world.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780
9.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.570
Arnold Schwarzenegger Makes a Sweary Poem

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.630
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a man of many talents:
bodybuilder, actor, politician, and more recently

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
a poet.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.820
In a 2010 letter vetoing a bill authored by
Democratic assemblymen Tom Ammiano, readers

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.640
noticed a hidden message from Schwarzenegger
in the left-hand margin: the words “F**k

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
You.”

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.590
Coincidentally, several weeks beforehand,
Ammiano had heckled The Governator, openly

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.970
accusing him of lying about his policies during
his time in office, all whilst the latter

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.780
was giving a speech at a Democratic Party
fundraiser.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.480
When the message was revealed, Arnold suggested
that the whole thing was just a coincidence

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.250
and that “when you do so many vetoes, something
like this is bound to happen,” he said knowingly

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.010
with a wink (probably).

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.010
8.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.980
Ronald Emmerich Hits Back at Ebert and Siskel

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.540
Movie director Ronald Emmerich was really
suffering at the hands of the critics.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.870
Well, two critics: Gene Siskel and Robert
Ebert.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.270
They hadn’t been too kind in their reviews
of Universal Soldier, Stargate, and Independence

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.060
Day, so Emmerich decided to give them a part
in his next movie, Godzilla.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.620
Casting two actors who bear a remarkable similarity
to the pair, he created the characters of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.870
Mayor Ebert, an argumentative, meddling buffoon,
and Gene, the mayor’s sycophantic lacky.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.240
However, despite Emmerich’s blind hatred
of the pair, they made it out of the movie

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.750
alive, leaving Ebert openly puzzled puzzled
about why they hadn’t been eaten or squashed

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
underfoot.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.750
7.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.620
Lord Byron Buys a Bear

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.420
In 1805, Lord Byron was starting his first
year at the prestigious Cambridge Trinity

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.340
College and requested to the administration
that he be able to bring his dog to live with

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
him.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.599
On receiving the request, the college flat-out
denied it, citing a rule which prohibited

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.850
dogs on campus.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.820
As a result, Byron then went out and did what
many of us would do when faced with such a

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.319
petty, obstructive rule: buy a freakin’
bear.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.920
On returning to the college, he was asked
to kindly get the animal off the premises.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.760
Byron agreed to do so, as soon as the college
showed him the rule which prohibited bears

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760
from living on-campus.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.190
As they couldn’t, the bear stayed with Byron
all throughout his studies.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.190
6.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.629
George Lucas Sells His Land to Charity

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.680
George Lucas is one of those people who need
no introduction.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.680
After all, he’s responsible for a couple
of famous films, some of which you might even

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.319
have heard of, including Star Wars, Indiana
Jones, and E.T.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.209
For 25 years, Lucas had been attempting to
build a special effects workshop on his property

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.480
in Marin County, California, which would revitalize
the area and create hundreds of high-paying

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
jobs.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.300
But, he was thwarted by his rich neighbors
at every turn, all out of fear that such a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.970
development would bring ruinous traffic to
the area and cause so much light pollution

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.930
that “their dark starry nights would be
destroyed” (actual quote, by the way.)

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.489
So, in 2012, Lucas dropped those plans.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.270
And then immediately announced that he’d
sold the land to the Marin Community Foundation,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.470
all so they could finally build some much-needed
low-income housing.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.849
Predictably, Lucas’ neighbors went crazy
over that decision, but there was little they

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.740
could do to stop it.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.740
5.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.940
Michael Crichton Gets Personal

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.800
In 2004, author Michael Crichton published
“State of Fear,” a science-fiction work

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.159
about global warming and environmental terrorism.

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.279
However, whilst it proved to be a bestseller
amongst the general public, it was heavily

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:52.139
criticized by the scientific community for
distorting evidence for global warming.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.349
One such critic was Michael Crowley who, in
an analysis of Crichton’s work, accused

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.939
Crichton of being a negative influence on
the discussion of global warming and contributing

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.069
to an increasingly hostile attitude towards
scientists who supported the idea of the phenomenon.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.830
Crichton wasn’t entirely happy with this
critique and made his displeasure quite obvious

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.029
in his next work, confusingly titled “Next.”

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.869
In several chapters, it features a character
named Mick Crowley, who is on trial for successfully

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:21.759
raping a two year-old child despite having
a woefully small penis.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.650
We’d like to make it absolutely clear that’s
a part of the book; we aren’t joking or

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.650
making any of that up.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.779
You can even read the extract in question
here.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:29.779
4.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:30.909
House Gets Colorful Paint Job

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.960
The Westboro Baptist Church has rightfully
earned the reputation of being a horrible

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.150
organization populated by horrible people.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.970
Spearheaded by Fred Phelps, the church is
vehemently homophobic, being responsible for

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.199
the sadly-famous “God Hates Fags” signs
which are proudly displayed by the group at

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.919
funerals of military personnel, gay people,
and just about anybody else who isn’t them.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.849
In 2013, however, the group must have received
quite a shock when they turned up for their

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.590
weekly gay-bashing rituals only to find the
house across the street had been re-painted

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.610
… into the colors of the LGBT flag.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.490
This was the work of one man, Aaron Jackson.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.039
Whilst looking on Google Earth in March, he
spotted the property for sale and decided

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.629
to spend $83,000 establishing a HQ for his
anti-bullying organisation in possibly the

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.770
world’s most ironic location.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.839
That might sound like a lot of money for some
passive-aggressive payback, but since trolling

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:29.680
bigots in a manner they can do absolutely
nothing about is priceless, it’s money well-spent.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.009
3.

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.159
Bank of America Gets (Legally) Foreclosed

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.860
In 2011, Bank of America delivered a foreclosure
notice on a family’s home for the heinous

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.499
crime of defaulting on their mortgage.

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:46.159
Only one problem: the family in question owned
the house outright, as they’d bought it

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:47.159
in cash.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.190
They didn’t even have a mortgage, let alone
one with Bank of America.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.970
The matter was later taken to court, and ended
with the family winning their case and Bank

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.360
of America being ordered to pay them $2,534
restitution for their legal costs.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.689
Of course, BoA refused to pay the money, because
it was founded by Satan.

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:06.270
So the family got creative.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.849
After consulting with their lawyers, the family
appeared at the bank one day and – armed

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.039
with a removal truck and a couple of sheriff’s
deputies – foreclosed on it.

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.729
As in, they were legally allowed to strip
the bank bare (including of all the money

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.300
in the tellers’ drawers).

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.139
The bank manager was suddenly able to pay
the family after all, presenting them with

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:26.020
a check an hour later.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.020
2.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.939
South Korea Blasts K-Pop at the North

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:34.440
It’s fair to say that the relationship between
North Korea and South Korea is somewhat fragile.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.690
Over the years, they’ve engaged in numerous
gun battles and psychological campaigns, despite

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.629
being separated by one of the most-heavily
armed borders in the world.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.990
In 2010, however, the situation was direr
than ever.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.409
In March of that year, the North Koreans sank
the ROKS Cheonan, a Navy ship belonging to

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:51.409
the South.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:54.225
This was soon followed by an artillery attack
on the island of Yeonpyeong, an island situated

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:56.129
well within South Korea’s territory.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:58.749
You can imagine that the South launched a
blistering counter-attack.

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.379
And they did.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:04.819
In June, they set up their own FM radio station,
through which they blasted the North Koreans

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:09.789
with the sickly-sweet sounds of Korean pop
music, also referred to as K-Pop.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.899
Predictably, the North didn’t appreciate
this lesson in musical history, and threatened

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:16.629
all-out war unless the transmissions were
turned off.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.629
They weren’t.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:20.849
We like to think that the South’s response
to this was just to turn the dials all the

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:26.530
way up to 11, and rock North Korea’s face
so hard that they completely forget to follow

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.770
through on their threat.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.770
1.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.700
Gustav Klimt Bares Some Painted Flesh

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.550
Gustav Klimt is the master painter responsible
for renowned works such as “The Kiss”

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.440
and “Adele Bloch-Bauer I.”

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.660
He specialized in drawings of the female form,
AKA mass nudity.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.770
So it’s strange that, after being commissioned
by the University of Vienna to paint human

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.830
representations of Philosophy, Jurisprudence,
and Medicine, each design was refused on the

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.960
grounds that it was “pornographic.”

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.850
Like the school didn’t know what they were
getting themselves into.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.510
Unwilling to appeal to the conservative masses
any longer, he painted “Nuda Veritas”

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.750
in response, which depicts a young, naked
woman holding a mirror to the face of the

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.750
viewer.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.860
Also, above this figure is a quote by Friedrich
Schiller stating “If you cannot please everyone

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.670
with your deeds and your art, please only
a few.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.680
To please many is bad.”

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:26.370
As with all great art, words are never enough
to describe it, so here’s a link to it if

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.720
you’re not in work or school.
