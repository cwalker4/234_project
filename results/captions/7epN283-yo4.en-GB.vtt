00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.191
During WW2 the Germans built many planes.
Some we are very familiar with, like the BF-109,

00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:11.960
they only built about ….34,000 of them.
It’s one of most built planes of all time.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.010
The germans also built rarer planes like the
Blohm &amp; Voss BV-138 of which they built around

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.110
300. This video is going to be focused on
German prototypes which it if you pardon the

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.260
pun didn’t take off. These planes either
had a single prototype made or a limited production

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.050
run. Either due to other choices in design
direction or lack of resources to build more

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.200
planes. These are my “Top 5 Weird German
Prototypes that flew”

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.660
For this list there are only two rules. The
plane to had existe and that it had to have

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.010
completed a flight. So that means no paper
blueprint planes and no prefabricated models

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.579
or mockups. Without further ado let’s get
on with the list.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.240
The list:
#5 Blohm &amp; Voss Bv-40 (two 30 mm glier)

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.649
This little glider doesn’t look too aggressive.
It doesn’t look out of place as a recreation

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.189
glider, perhaps something that one would take
out the weekend on a nice warm summer's day.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.390
What separates the Bv-40 from a standard glider
is a set of twin 30mm auto cannons, each one

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.619
equipped with 35 rounds. Bringing the Bv-40
maximum ammunition up to 70 rounds. I can’t

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.719
emphasise how odd it is to have guns on glider.
The bv-40 is the only glider fighter ever

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.209
made in history. This is further emphasised
by the fact that the guns are twin 30mm cannons.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:36.009
Look at this comparison between a 30mm shell
and a browning 0.50 cal round. The reason

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.420
that the Bv-40 need this fire power was for
it’s role as Bomber interceptor. Germany

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.289
needed a plane which would be able to take
on bombers that were attacking deep within

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.520
the German heartland.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.590
The Bv-40 was intended to be an alternative
direction of design for defensive planes that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.969
were being designed at the time. During 1944
Germany was looking into all sorts of different

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.840
planes such as jet planes like the Me-262
and the Ho-229. It was alsolooking at rocket

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.470
powered planes such as Bachem Ba-349 and Me-163.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.640
Rocket and jet planes, even the simpler designs,
are expensive and complicated to make. They

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.560
involve precision engineering and rare metals
both of which Germany of which running low

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.840
on.
Manufacturing works shops were under threat

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.250
of attack as day and night bombing raids destroyed
German industrial centers. This resulted in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.359
very high competition for designers to secure
the the limited manufactures jet engines.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.849
The BV-40 was a cheaper alternative to jets
and rocket planes. It was cheap due to three

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.670
main factors:
Its lack of complexity, so unskilled labour

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.989
could be used to assemble most of it.
Its tiny form, very few resource had to be

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.540
used to produce one
It’s wood design.The airframe was mostly

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.269
wood which could be sourced from within Germany.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.700
The ideal combat mission was that the two
BV-40s could be towed by a Bf-109. The Bf-109

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.519
being a single engine German fighter. After
take off the BV-40 would jettison its takeoff

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.180
dolly. The 109 would tow the gliders to a
height above the attacking Allied bomber formation.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.700
At height the BV-40 would detach the tow line
and glide freely to the Formation. The glider

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.950
could reach speeds as high as 900 km/h. It
was thought that a pilot should be able to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.050
get two passes on the bomber formation before
running out of potential energy and ammunition

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.080
. The glider would then head back to a landstrip,
landing on it’s fixed skid.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.890
Another odd thing about this glider is that
the pilot had to lie on his or her belly in

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.319
a prone position to operate the glider. This
photo is of a German prone pilot for a another

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.090
plane. It can’t have been nice to fly the
plane like that. Flights wouldn’t have been

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.730
too long so it shouldn’t have been too much
of a problem. The reason for the prone pilot

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.590
was to reduce the size of the glider.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.749
As well as the advantages we talk about earlier
there are further advantages to make the glider

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:04.300
small.
1- Less drag due to the small surface area,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.849
thus allowing for two gliders to be towed
by one single engine fighter.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.459
2- The small form makes it a difficult plane
to hit. Defensive gunners would struggle to

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.319
hit such a tiny plane.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:22.920
The first test flight was done in May of 1944.
Blohm &amp; Voss received a order for 19 prototypes,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.610
with a further order of 200 for production.
The program was later dropped with only 7

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.780
prototypes that were built. All the prototypes
built are currently not accounted for. No

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.060
one is quite sure what happened to them at
the end of the war.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.000
#4 Heinkel He 111Z

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.860
This plane looks like some sort of bad photoshop.
The kind of plane you would see in a thumbnail

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.930
with some sort of click bait title. The He
111 Z is exactly what it looks like it’s

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.480
two He-111 bombers joined together. Well they
did add a fifth engine to the middle, to bring

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.780
the total engine count up to five. The (Z)
in the designation stands for Zwilling meaning

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.120
twin in German.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.530
Each side of the He-111z was crewed. The main
pilot flew on the left side, along a mechanic,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.530
a defensive guner and a radio/navigator. The
co pilot flew on the right side along with

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.690
another flight engineer and defensive guner.
12 Z variants were built.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.510
The He-111z wasn’t the only experimental
twin fuselage aircraft was made by Germany.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:33.940
There was a experimental twin Bf-109 called
the BF-109Z. Remember that Z is for Zwilling

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.940
which means Twin in german. The prototype
was destroyed by a allied attack and the project

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.660
abandoned. Other countries also had their
own experimental twin fuselage planes.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:51.830
Russian made Belyayev DB-LK. Only 1 built
Italian made Savoia-Marchetti SM.92 Only 1

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.090
built
And the American made the F-82 Twin Mustang

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:04.039
Only….270 built.
The F-82 was built to be a bomber escort.

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.900
There was a two man crew, one in each hull
would. The pilots would take turns during

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.199
long flights controlling the plane to reduce
fatigue that sets it after flying for long

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.190
periods of time.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:22.440
And finally after almost 60 years, in 2017
we have the newest Twin fuselage plane. The

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.270
Stratolaunch. A plane designed to launch rockets
into space from high altitudes . It’s Wingspan

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.479
broke the last world record and is a staggering
117m long. That's almost twice as big as a

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.330
747.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.210
The He-111z plane was not designed to be a
fighter or to be a bomber. It was designed

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.780
to be a tug plane. Side note the He-111z did
see some use as a light transport used to

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.509
evacuate wounded troops. But the true purpose
of the He-111z was to be a tow plane for Me-321

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:01.470
also known as Gigant due to its size. The
Me-321 was a cargo glider. The world's biggest

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.830
cargo glider. The internal volume of the Giant
was similar to a standard German railway car.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.379
Its lifting capacity was huge at 23 Tones.
The large internal space and lifting capacity

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:19.439
allowed for transport of heavy goods such
as oil, supplies, vehicles, light tanks and

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:24.610
Artillery pieces. It could even be be used
to carry 120 fully equipped troops.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.301
There were several ways to get the Me321 into
the air. A Ju-90 could be used to tow Me321

00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:39.280
into the air, the Ju-90 wasn’t up to the
task with . The second way was the He-111z.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.420
The third was to use a trio of BF-110 with
tow ropes to tow the Me321.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:52.770
Up to eight externally attached rocket boosters
could be used to assist with take off. The

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.069
rockets would be jettisoned after the fuel
in them was spent.

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:01.710
Around 200 Me-321 were built. None of the
methods for towing were really that good.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:09.280
The ju-90 could barely climb. The He-111z
wasn’t to much more powerful. The three

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.350
towing Bf-110 was a extremely dangerous setup.
One wrong move by any of the pilots of the

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.090
tow aircraft and the glider could lead to
disaster. Which it did. There was case of

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.379
Me-321 crashing shortly after take off. To
make maters worse the flight was configured

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:31.639
for carrying troops. Between the four aircraft
there were 129 deaths.

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:36.790
Later the Me-321 was redesigned with six engines
and landing gear. The redesign was called

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:44.660
the Me-323. The He-111z was no longer needed
now that the cargo glider now cargo plane

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.720
could fly under it’s own power. There was
no longer a need to bother with completed

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.840
tow aircraft or rocket boosters to assist
with take off.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:59.060
Only 4 of the 12 He-111z survived the war,
the other eight were destroyed. Seven from

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.110
strafing runs by allied aircraft and one was
shot down during a towing mission. Sadly the

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.570
surviving four have been scraped.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:16.070
#3( Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg
This is a manned V1. The same V1 that was

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.100
being launched at England from launch sites
in Northern France. For those of you that

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.990
don’t know what the V1 was the world's first
cruise missile. The missile was powered by

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:34.181
a pulse jet which would propel the V1 at a
speed of 550km/h to it’s target. It had

00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:38.770
a basic auto pilot which would move the control
surfaces in flight to stabilise the missile

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.790
in a straight line. Around 30,000 V-1s were
made during the war.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.790
Desperate times call for desperate weapons
which is where the Fi 103R. It was intended

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.020
to be used a suicide weapon. Unlike the primitive
guidance system a manned missile would be

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.100
able to hit a target with very accurately.
The guidance system may make the missile land

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.620
around 10 miles around the designed target.
A human would be able to steer the missile

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:08.000
straight into an Allied Ship even if it was
at sea and moving. The Fi 103R would be carried

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.110
under the wing of a heavy German bomber to
a point very near the target before being

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:18.490
dropped. The pilot would do their best to
steer the 103R on to target. It was suggested

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.750
that pilots would be able to bail out before
impact but in practice it was near impossible.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.200
The pilot's cockpit was very cramped, and
added to the difficulty is that even if the

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.840
pilot could wedge themselves out there is
a Pulse right behind them. So unless you could

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.430
somehow bail out without whacking yourself
on the jet engine you were right out of luck.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:44.060
Oh and you're also flying at 650km/h in a
dive whilst all this is happening . It was

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:50.030
estimated that the chance of surviving a bail
out was 1%. Even so people volunteered to

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.380
pilot this plane knowing that flying would
lead to certain death . A training program

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.810
and testing of the plane had begun with 70
students on the program to learn how to fly

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:05.770
the plane. There were modified glider variants
of the 103R and also two seater variants for

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.875
training purposes. This was so students could
learn the flight characteristics of the plane.

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:11.990
The program did not get off to a good start
as there were several accidents causing injury

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:17.420
and death during testing of flight characteristics.
The program was shortly abandoned as it was

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.710
decided suicide missions were not part of
German warrior tradition. Interesting the

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:28.480
project was abandoned in favour the Mistel
project. Long story short, you piggy back

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.580
a smaller plane onto a bigger plane. You fill
the big plane full of explosives. The small

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:40.690
plane flies the big plane and steers the big
plane into a target. The small plane flys

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.690
back home.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:49.510
Under 200 Reichenberg planes were built and
none were ever used against an enemy target.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.200
Several Reichenberger have been preserved
in several museums around the world.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.550
Before we move on to the next plane on the
list let's take a moment to have a look in

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:03.130
the Pacific theater of war. Over here we Japanese
Ohka Cherry Blossom another suicide plane,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.440
but this one was actually
in combat.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.130
The Ohka was appropriately nicknamed by Americans
as the Baka (meaning idiot in Japanese). The

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:17.210
Ohka would be carried by a heavy Japanese
bomber near to Allied Ships. When in range

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.670
the Ohka would detach from the bomber and
glide most of the way to the target ship.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.750
Close to impact the pilot would activate rocket
boosters which would propel the Ohka to approximately

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:32.180
800km/h) At that speed it would be almost
impossible to shot down with standard Anti

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:39.120
Aircraft weapons. The payload was a 1,200kg
explosive. The main disadvantage of the Oka

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.400
was its limited range. It had a smaller operation
range then the V1. The delivery system of

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.910
the Ohka was it’s big disadvantage. American
warships expanded their defensive air screens

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.490
to account for the range that Ohka could travel.
With the skys over the Allied ships controlled,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.600
the Japanese bombers couldn’t get close
enough to drop the Ohka in range of American

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.540
ships. 850 Ohka were built and many are on
display.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:11.810
#2 Sack AS-6
The Sack As-6 while not a fighter plane is

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.950
remarkable enough to earn a place on this
list. It was developed as a proof of concept

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:23.810
for circular-winged aircraft. It resembles
a bad photoshop of a German UFO that the old

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.470
history channel was so fond of before it came
the logging and pawnshop channel.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:34.700
The Sack AS-6 is named after it’s designer
Arthur Sack. His weird circular wing design

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.320
was first seen when he entered a contest of
competing remote control planes with combustion

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.340
engines. His first model with the circular
wing design was the AS-1 which was just over

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:51.680
1m long. Sadly the AS-1 was unable to take
off under it’s own power. It did however

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.370
achieve 100m of stable flight after been thrown
into the air by Arthur Sack. The current Air

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.600
minster for Germany who was attending the
competition was interested by the circular

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.160
shape wing and gave Sack funding to continue
research into his design. Sack went on to

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.730
make 4 more models each one larger than the
first. The Sack-6 was the first design by

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.490
Arthur intended to be piloted by a human rather
than radio controlled. The first test flight

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:24.480
began in early 1944. During which several
flaws were found in the design. One being

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:31.010
that the AS-6 was underpowered. A more powerful
engine would have given better flight performance.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:37.500
The Sack-6 was using a Bf-108 engine, which
was a design and made in the early 1930s.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.260
Due to wartime shortages more powerful engines
were not available for the prototype.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.210
After several more tests the plane was proven
to be a failur, with it’s the ability to

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:50.800
barely get off the runway. There were proposed
plans to take the plane to the next stage

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.780
with the the Me-600.
The proposed Me-600 would have enlarged the

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.960
circular wing considerably. It would also
latest engine design. Complete with fuel injection

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:08.660
and a four-bladed propeller, repositioned
gear, improved control surfaces, redesigned

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:18.540
tail unit, and 30mm cannon Me-600 would have
been a able to 800kph fighter. This plan was

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.910
never followed through.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.450
The AS-6 was destroyed so it wouldn’t not
fall into Allied hands. The wood was broken

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.670
up into pieces and the miscellaneous metal
parts were thrown into the aircraft salvage

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:36.550
area. When the Allies arrived at the airfield
the plane was already destroyed, and so was

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.620
not recorded on the inventory of seized items.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.830
This wasn’t the first circle wing aircraft
invited nor the last. One of the first circle

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.390
wing aircraft was the the Nemeth Umbrella
Plane. From it’s design it’s easy to see

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.140
why they called it a umbrella with it’s
large wing located above the main body of

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:58.120
the plane. Another circular winged aircraft
was being produced near the end of WW2 by

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:05.940
America. The Vought XF5U or by it’s nickname
the flying flapjack. Unlike the AS-6 the flight

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.760
characteristics of the flapjack were very
good. It was capable of high speed flight

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.100
and was able to be armed with quad 20mm cannons
and could also carry bombs. The most attractive

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.350
quality of the plane was it’s very low stall
speed which made it easy to take off and land

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.251
on an aircraft carrier's deck. The navy was
considering mass producing the aircraft, but

00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:31.590
chose not to as they saw the future of aviation
was in jet propulsion not old fashioned propellers.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:37.590
#1 The Dornier Do 335, also called the Arrow

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:44.130
The Do-335 was one of the fastest piston Aircraft
of ww2. It’s top speed in level flight is

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:51.051
said to be 850 km/h. Although that speed was
achieved under perfect conditions. The normal

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:57.810
cruise speed was around 750km/h. Still though
very impressive for a single seater heavy

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.220
fighter plane. The key for achieving this
kind of speed was by having two engines in

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.350
one fuselage. One engine was pulling and the
other pushing. I’ll go over the more technical

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.740
side a bit later.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.789
Do-335 was originally designed as a fast bomber
but was redesigned during the emergency fighter

00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:20.039
program into become a fighter. The first prototype
took to the skies in late 1943. With production

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:25.689
models being manufactured in earily 1944.
The armament of the first production variant

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:32.030
was two 15mm Machine guns with 200 rounds
per gun. There was also single 30mm gun with

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:42.009
70 rounds that fired propeller hub. If need
a small internal bomb bay could carry up to

00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:43.059
a 500kg bomb.

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:46.921
Surprisingly for such a large and heavy plane
it was said by the pilots that flew it, that

00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:52.250
it had good handling, manoeuvrability, a tight
turning circle and good acceleration

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:57.509
It unusual for heavy planes to have those
characteristics. When i say this was heavy

00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:06.201
plane, i do mean it was heavy. Each engine
alone weighed 1 ton producing 1,750hp. Total

00:18:06.201 --> 00:18:12.269
weight was 7 and a half tones and that isn’t
with the addition of bombs. Put it like this

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:18.470
it weighed more than a BF-110 or a Beaufighter
but didn’t surfare from mobility issues

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.159
that those planes had.

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:23.879
The Do-335 hads a couple more interesting
features that made it unique from other fighters

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:27.149
at the time:
One of which was that it was the first planes

00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:33.700
to have an ejector seat. It was more out of
necessary than a luxury due to the rear propeller.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.029
Bailing out normally is not fun and is very
risky. Baling out when there is massive spinning

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:42.330
propeller probably means you're not going
to escape injury. To help further increase

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.779
the pilots chance of surviving a bailout,
explosive bolts were fitted on the rear propeller

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:52.590
and upper tail fin. Before ejecting the pilot
could detonate the bolts. This would remove

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.789
the tail fin and jettison the proper.

00:18:55.789 --> 00:19:00.629
Another interesting feature is Tricycle landing
gear which was a new concept at the time.

00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:07.690
Tricycle landing gear is somewhat take for
granted in modern aviation. The reason was

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.990
so that the rear propeller wouldn't strike
the ground during landing or take off. Most

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:17.730
planes around the period of 1943 were taildraggers
meaning the tail was resting on the ground.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.250
Be kind of difficult to have a propeller at
the back of the plane if the tail is meant

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:26.299
to be resting on the ground. An added benefit
of the tri landing gear is that the pilot

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:31.350
can see forward when taxing. With a tail dragger
it’s lot more difficult to taxi as the engine

00:19:31.350 --> 00:20:02.299
is blocking your forward view.

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:06.020
Okay now let's visit the technical bit of
why the plane was one of the fastest propeller

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.730
planes of ww2. It’s secret was by having
two engines in the main body of the plane.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.570
By doing this it was possible to avoid problems
that face most classical twin engine planes

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:21.350
designs. Normal twin engine planes have increased
drag produced by the addition of engines in

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:26.929
the wings. The increase drag effects speed
and roll rate negatively. Another advantage

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:32.270
of two engines sharing the same thrust line
is that if one engine fails the plane wouldn't

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.480
be pulled to one side. The plane would be
flying relatively normal with the only change

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.740
being less speed.
Both the the propellers were set up to spin

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:45.159
opposite ways, standard practice on any twin
engine plane. This is done to counter engine

00:20:45.159 --> 00:20:49.650
torque. Fighter planes at the time had very
powerful engines for how much they weighed.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:55.019
If 100% power was applied at take off. An
inexperienced pilot may find the plane sharply

00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:01.059
turning to one side (rolling on it’s axis)
. The result being the plane upside in a ditch

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:05.009
and the pilot becoming the laughing stock
of the airbase. This is due to propeller torque

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:09.780
effect. A skilled pilot would increase power
slowly while balancing out the pull to one

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:15.519
side by using his control surface on the plane.
Under high stress situation during aerial

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:20.889
combat a pilot may panic and increase power
to maxuim and forget to counter the pull.

00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:24.509
Twin engines planes aren’t affected by engine
torque because both engine spin in opposite

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:26.999
direction making the pulling force neutral.

00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:32.529
It wasn’t al rainbows and sunshine the,
Do-335 plane didn’t come without faults.

00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:37.100
One teething problem was the landing gear
wasn’t to strong, meaning there was danger

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.749
of it collapsing during landing. Visibility
out of the cockpit was rather poor. The large

00:21:42.749 --> 00:21:46.929
nose also blocked out a lot of the view a
head.

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:52.159
The Do-335 was also an expansive plane to
operate with it’s Two very fuel hungry engines

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:57.379
and lots of maintenance. All the extra upkeep
cost for a plane that was only a bit better

00:21:57.379 --> 00:22:04.221
than the Focke-Wulf Ta-152. The Ta-152 was
a german late war fighter plane. It’s speed

00:22:04.221 --> 00:22:09.200
and performance where only a bit worse than
the Do-335. It was a lot more simple to produce

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.400
compared to the Do-335

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.139
The Do-335 did see some use in the skies of
Germany, although it’s disputed if i ever

00:22:15.139 --> 00:22:20.990
actually engaged enemy planes or ground targets.
One recollection from a French fighter ace

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.759
was of a Do-335 flying at low level. He and
his wingmen chose to engaged in their Hawker

00:22:25.759 --> 00:22:31.350
Tempests. The Do-335 out ran the Hawker Tempests.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.980
Production of the Do-335 was stop due to complications
in manufacturing late in the war. Only 38

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:42.029
produced. There was a mixture of different
variants of Do-335s. Some of which were two

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:47.549
seat trainer aircraft, the two seater had
the nickname Anteater. Another variant was

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:53.269
a night fighter, it had a second seat and
radar equipment. They only built one of those.

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:57.440
Remember those twin fuselage aircraft from
earlier, They wanted to give the Do-335 the

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.279
same treatment. There was a plan to build
a twin fuselage version “Dornier Do 635”.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:08.860
The purpose of which was long range resonance
that variant was never built.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.500
Only one Do.335 survives today: an A0 variant,
currently on display at the National Air and

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.059
Space Museum near Dulles Airport in the US.

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:23.080
Well there you have it, those my “Top 5
Weird German Prototypes that flew”. Feel

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.400
free to leave a comment on what you think
should have been on this list. There may be

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.500
a chance i have already talked about it in
another vid. So have a look at my other videos.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.000
I’m going to recommend two vids. One of
which is my “Top 5 Weird Nazi Wonder Weapon

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.250
Planes That Actually Flew” That video is
focused on late War German Jet and rocket

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.440
planes all of which actually flew. The other
video is “Top 5 Weird Soviet Planes That

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.899
Actually Flew”. That video focusing on Weird
Russian planes which you will have most likely

00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:48.820
never have heard about before. Anyway thank
you for watching. I hoped you enjoyed it.
