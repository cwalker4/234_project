- We just celebrated
our seventh wedding anniversary,

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.066
so we thought we would see
how well we know each other

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.766
and play the
"Not So Newlywed Game."

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:12.766
[upbeat music]

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.033
All right, but first let's meet
our competition.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.533
Please welcome the hilarious

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.766
Melissa McCarthy
and Ben Falcone.

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:33.766
[upbeat music]

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.766
[cheers and applause]

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.466
- This is happening.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:52.266
- So...

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.066
- What if we don't get
any correct?

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.200
- We might not.
- Yeah.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.366
- She's already nervous
about it.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.800
She said, "I don't know
how we're--"

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100
'cause we filled all this out
separately backstage.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.766
How long have you two
been together?

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.733
- It'll be ten years this year.
- Yeah.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.766
- Married or together?
both: Married ten.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.700
- Together, what? Like 17?
- Yeah.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.166
- Oh, so you all have
a little bit of time on us.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.500
So you should really
know each other?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.566
- Highly confident.
- All right. I can't wait.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.900
So, we'll see.
tWitch, come on out here.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.733
tWitch is gonna host
this thing for us.

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:25.733
[upbeat music]

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.733
[laughter]

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.166
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.500
- Look at the gold--
- Oh, my God.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.733
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.733
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.366
- I'm kind of all for it.
- Yeah.

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.766
- I'm all for it.
- It's a good look.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.400
- I don't know if you
should change back.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.933
That's a good look.
- It's a good look.

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.266
- That's good.
- It's good. Okay.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.466
Well, earlier we asked you
a series of questions

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.566
to see how well
you know each other.

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.633
- You're so serious.
- So now we're gonna see

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:57.933
how well you know
each other.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.666
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, so for every--

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.200
you get a point for every time
your answers match.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.400
Y'all ready to play?
- We are. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.633
- Excellent, excellent,
excellent.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:07.833
Okay.
- Okay.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:08.966
Melissa...
- Okay.

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:11.133
- If Ben could describe you
in one word,

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.833
what would it be?

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.233
- I said chatty.
- Okay.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.533
- I said lovely and amazing,
but it was cute.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.233
all: Aww.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.400

[imitates buzzer]

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.300
[laughter]
All right, all right.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.733
- Okay, okay.
- We'll get it back.

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:26.800
We'll get it back.
- No problem.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.500
- Ben, what word would Melissa
use to describe you?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.533
- What did I say?

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:37.700
Good enough.
[laughter]

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.333
- Kind.
- I said kind.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.866
[buzzer buzzing]
all: Aww.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.933

[imitates buzzer]

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.066

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.466
I love "kind" gets a...
[imitates buzzer]

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:47.566
No, get out.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.000
- They just pull you out.
Yeah, just...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
- I think I'll put a harness.
- They wheel him back.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.466
- Okay, okay,
you still in the game.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.133
You still in the game.
Okay, Portia...

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.466
- Yeah.
- Name a celebrity

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.600
other than you
that Ellen has a crush on.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.333
- Easy.

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.933
- Oh, I knew
you were gonna say that.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.133
Well, but I was just joking
about this the other day.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.066
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- Oh.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:06.900
Aww, man.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.766
- I was gonna say be careful.
- Things change.

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:12.100
- You know a lot of celebrities.
- They change.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.833
Ellen, what celebrity
does Portia have a crush on?

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.866
- Oh, this is very easy.
- It's so easy. You better--

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.000

- Okay.

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:38.766

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.033
does Melissa think
you have a crush on?

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.533
- Uh, it's creepy
and it's no longer true,

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.766
but I think she's gonna say
Jennifer Aniston.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:47.933
- Oh. I did and then
I switched it.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:52.100
Ah! So I'm what--who?
What--

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.700
Oh, I said creepy.
- Oh, that's what you--

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.533
I was, like, that--
- Creepy and it's no longer--

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:58.033
- Tom Hanks?
Okay.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:59.366
- Who doesn't love Tom Hanks?
That's true.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.233
- I do have a crush on him.
That's actually really true.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.800
- Oh, yeah.
- Creepy.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.266
- I think your true crush
is Tom Hanks.

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:08.633
- Yeah, actually I do have
a crush on Tom Hanks.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:10.433
- Okay, Ellen...
- Yes?

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.366
- What candy would Portia choose

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:15.633
Starburst,
Good 'N Plenty,

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:20.333
Hot Tamales, Mounds,
or Oh Henry?

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.200
[laughter]

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.933
- They would all apply,
but--

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:27.733
- Well, yeah.
- But I'm gonna say Hot Tamale.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.433
- Damn it.
- Uh-oh, what'd you say?

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:32.100
- Oh Henry, Oh Henry.
[buzzer buzzing]

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.400
- I don't even know
what that means.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.200
- I didn't either, but I just
thought it was the funniest one,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.100
and you always go for
the joke.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.933
- Not when I'm competitive,
I don't.

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:41.933
- I see.
- All right.

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:45.000
- Okay, Melissa,
fill in the blank.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.933
Before I was married,
I used to blank,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:52.700
but now, I blank.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.500
- I said,
"Only really hit on gay men,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.900
now I married
the right one."

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.133
[laughter]
It's true.

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.700
Really true.
What did you say?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.166
- I said, "She used to go
to dinner late at night,

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.833
now she goes to dinner
at 4:00 p.m."

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:08.700
[buzzer buzzing]
- Also true, also true.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.933
- Also true.
- That could apply to me.

00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.966
- Yeah.
- I like to eat early.

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.766
- Okay, Ellen...
- Yeah?

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:18.066
- Where did you share
your first kiss?

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:21.966
- Well, this is very easy.
- Mm.

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.600
In the back of a limo.
[bell dings]

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.000
- Aww.
- Very nice. Very nice.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.133
- That's nice.
- Have we gotten any right?

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:30.500
- I don't think
we've gotten any right.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.433
- Okay.
- That's okay.

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:34.666
- No, you've got zero.
- Well, you've got zero,

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.566
but y'all, you look lovely.
- 17 years, guys.

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:39.166
- Yes.
That is the end of the game.

00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:41.600
You look lovely, no points,
but you're a beautiful couple.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.933
Beautiful couple.
- Is that the end of the game?

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:44.300
Aww, that's sad. All right.
- Yes, that's it.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.333
- Yep.
- Well played, well played.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.000
- We did it. Wonderful.
- That's it.
