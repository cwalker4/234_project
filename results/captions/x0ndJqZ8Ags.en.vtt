SPEAKING OF REPUBLICAN

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:07.173
DYNASTIES, THERE'S ONE MEMBER OF
THE TRUMP FAMILY PEOPLE RESPECT:

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.108 align:start position:0%
IVANKA.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:12.879 align:start position:0%
SHE'S GOTTEN A TON OF PRAISE
FROM THE RIGHT FOR HER POISE AND

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.347 align:start position:0%
INTELLIGENCE.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.648 align:start position:0%
AT THE SAME TIME, IT TURNS OUT,
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WORDS

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.685 align:start position:0%
MEAN.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.154 size:88% position:44%
THIS WEEK, ON TWITTER, VICE
WRITER EVE PEYSER COMPILED A

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
LIST OF ALL THE WORDS IVANKA HAS
USED INCORRECTLY, AND IT'S A

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.429 align:start position:0%
REAL FORTNIGHT.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.765 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN TALKING ABOUT

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.435 align:start position:0%
HER AND JARED'S MORNING ROUTINE
SHE SAID, "MY HUSBAND HAS

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.570 align:start position:0%
INCREDIBLY LONG HOURS, SO I TRY
TO KEEP MINE ON A RELATIVE

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.940 align:start position:0%
BASIS."

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.242 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
YOU THINK SHE'D KNOW HOW TO USE

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:47.047 align:start position:0%
"RELATIVE," BECAUSE HER WHOLE
CAREER IS ON "A RELATIVE BASIS."

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.117 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH!

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:57.057 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TURNS OUT -- AND

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.527 align:start position:0%
WE'VE KNOWN THIS FOR A LITTLE
WHILE --

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.628 size:84% position:42%
SHE ALSO DOESN'T HAVE THE
STRONGEST GRASP OF THE WORD

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.796 align:start position:0%
"COMPLICIT."

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:07.067 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IF BEING COMPLICIT IS WANTING
TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD AND TO

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.637 align:start position:0%
MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT, THEN
I'M COMPLICIT.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:14.174 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.042 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, SHE

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.978
MIGHT'VE JUST BEEN TRYING TO
MAKE A POINT AND ACTUALLY KNOWS

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.614
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE COMPLICIT.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.617 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE COMPLICIT.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:28.354 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.991 align:start position:0%
HERE'S ONE FROM TWITTER: "I
CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THEODORE IS

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:32.859 align:start position:0%
EIGHT MONTHS OLD TODAY!

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.797 align:start position:0%
HAPPY BIRTHDAY."

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:42.135 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HAPPY BIRTHDAY?

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.637 align:start position:0%
HE'S EIGHT MONTHS OLD!

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:48.741 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
EITHER IVANKA DOESN'T GET HOW

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.411 align:start position:0%
BIRTHDAYS WORK, OR DO RICH
PEOPLE GET MORE BIRTHDAYS THAN

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.713 align:start position:0%
WE DO?

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.550 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.085 size:81% position:41%
AND THEN THERE'S THIS GEM.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.955 align:start position:0%
"CUDDLING MY LITTLE NEPHEW LUKE,
THE BEST PART OF AN OTHERWISE

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:07.327 align:start position:0%
INCREDIBLE DAY!"
( LAUGHTER )

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:12.165 align:start position:0%
THAT IS A DUMB STATEMENT IN AN
OTHERWISE STUPID TWEET.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.668 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:22.909 align:start position:0%
( PIANO RIFF )
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.244
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MADE
FUN OF IVANKA ONLINE FOR THIS,

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:28.815 align:start position:0%
BUT I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING
IN HER DEFENSE.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:29.382 align:start position:0%
JIM.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.017 align:start position:0%
I'M A LITTLE BIT COMPLICIT WITH
IVANKA HERE.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.587 size:84% position:42%
IF COMPLICIT IS HERETOFORE
DEFINED AS "I SUPPORT HER,"

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.458 size:88% position:44%
WHICH IT TIMELESSLY DOESN'T.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.259 align:start position:0%
LAUGH
I KNOW THIS ALL SEEMS HUMOROUS

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.593 align:start position:0%
BUT, ALBEIT, IT IS NOT.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:47.901 align:start position:0%
IVANKA RISES AT THE APEX OF
SUNSHINE AND DOES A LOT OF GOOD

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.601 align:start position:0%
ON A RELATIVE BASIS.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
IN FACT, THE ENTIRE TRUMP FAMILY
IS A BIG PART OF AN OTHERWISE

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.872 align:start position:0%
GREAT COUNTRY.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.848 align:start position:0%
( CHEERING )
THANK YOU.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.982 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.618 align:start position:0%
AND, IN CONCLUSION, I MIGHT ADD,
SUMMARIZING LASTLY, HAPPY

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:09.722 align:start position:0%
BIRTHDAY.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:10.890 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.891 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
