00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
The world is going to have a new monetary system 
in this decade that we're in.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.600
We're going to experience this
huge deflationary crash around the world.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.300
And people will just lose confidence in currency.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.800
And what do they always go back to throughout history time after time for the last 5000 years?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Actually they always go back to gold and silver.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.070
We are entering a period of financial crisis 
that is the greatest the world has ever known.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.300
The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.880
Wealth is never destroyed. 
It is merely transferred.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.600
And that means that on the opposite side of every crisis there is an opportunity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.200
The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great opportunity is to educate yourself.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
I believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Education on the history of money.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Education on finance. Education on how the global economy works.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.680
Education on how all of these guys, the central bankers, the stock market, how they can cheat you, how they can scam you.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.010
If you learn what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.000
Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.300
This program is all about creating your own crystal ball 
being able to gaze into the future,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.800
being able to change this crisis, the greatest crisis in the history of mankind, into your great opportunity.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.990
So it all started back in 1999 when my sister and I hired a financial planner

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.000
to help my mother with her assets. 
And we gave him control of the family's assets.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.250
And in the next year and a half, he lost 50% of what she had.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.740
You know, he would come to us every six months. We'd have a meeting and he'd have this smile on his face, just ear to ear smiling.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.300
We did really well. The S&amp;P lost 24% and you only lost 18.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.060
And so, I fired him.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.000
And I moved all of her assets to cash.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.750
And I dived into studying the financial markets which led me into setting the economy.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.320
And when you start reading about the global economy,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.580
the people that are concerned with trade deficits and budget deficits,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.330
it's the hard money advocates the gold community.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.420
And once I started reading them, they also write about monetary history.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.000
And then I really fell in love 'cause monetary history just repeats and repeats over and over again,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
echoing all the way back to the beginnings of civilization.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.340
Gold and silver have been the
predominant currencies for about five thousand years

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.850
but it wasn't until somewhere between 680 BC and 630 BC that they became money.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.820
that when they were melted in the coin of equal weights somewhere in Lydia

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.000
where each coin was a same size and have a same weight.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.510
This made them interchangeable. 
It's called fungible.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.870
At that point they became useful as a unit of account and a measurement.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.530
You could price a good or a service in those gold or silver coins in a certain number of them.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.390
And it was always the same for anybody whenever they were buying that good or service

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.580
but it wasn't until they made their way to the world's first free-market society.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.150
The prototype of democracy, the cradle of civilization: Athens, that they exploded in use.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.500
Suddenly money found its natural home: the free markets.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.710
Athens was the first society to have a
working tax system and free markets.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.000
This enabled them to rise to the pinnacle of civilization.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.880
Their prosperity allowed them to create great works of art and achieve a level of architecture and engineering that the world had not yet seen.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.140
Here we are 2,500 years later,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.000
and people are still in awe of their achievements.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.650
it was truly a fantastic period in human history and the Athens star shone brightly for many years.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.270
So this begs the question: What went wrong?
How did such a great and powerful civilization fall?

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.950
The answer lies in the same pattern that we see throughout history:

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.300
too much greed and too much war.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.350
It was when the Athenians got involved in the Peloponnesian wars but war with Sparta that their monetary problems began.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.500
First they lost access to their
gold and silver mines.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.600
They were also paying armies that were on foot and they
were miles and miles away from Athens.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.870
So as they paid  their armies to buy goods
and services from the local populations,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.520
a deflation occurs in Athens because
they're sending all of their coinage out of the city.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.110
Then they started debasing
their coinage to pay for the war.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:56.820
If you take in a thousand coins in taxes and then you melt those down those gold coins and you mix 50% copper into your gold

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.200
now you can mint 2000 coins.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.550
so if you take in only a thousand coins but you spend two thousand coins, what is that called?

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.550
That is deficit spending.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.570
Athens began to do that during this war with Sparta.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.560
They also had these great public works which were very expensive.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.500
And they finished the temple of Athena Nike during the truce in the middle.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.800
There was a six-year truce in the middle of this 27 year war.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.620
So they didn't stop there great public works and allow their market economy to heal from the expense of this war.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.830
As they debase their coinage, people would take the new debased coins at face value at first

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.970
until there were a whole bunch of those

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.550
and there's something called Gresham's law where people tend to save, to keep the thing that's rare

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.330
and they spend the thing that's common into circulation first.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.980
So all of the gold and silver coins started to disappear from circulation and become quite rare and it was just these copper coins.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.450
suddenly it took a whole bunch of copper coins to buy a gold or silver coin

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.210
one of those old gold or silver coins.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.270
This is the first time that gold or silver ever had a price.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.950
Before that everything was measured in a weight of gold and silver.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.500
So a large factor in Athens downfall was the expense of war, the expansion of Empire,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.830
the debasement of their currency, the eventual inflation that was caused.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.610
You know, they minted these coins until
they became nothing but flecks of copper.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.600
This was actually the world's first hyper inflation

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.700
and what it did was it financially debilitated Athens to the point where in 404 BC they surrendered to Sparta

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.650
and eventually they became nothing but a satellite of Rome.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.020
The thing that amazes me is how history just keeps on repeating and repeating and repeating

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.300
and we never learn from all of our stupid mistakes.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.530
We just repeat the same stupid mistakes over and over and over again.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.300
Today we are doing the same thing that the Athenians did that caused the loss of their great culture.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.950
We're doing the same currency debasement, we're doing the same deficit spending,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.200
and it's for the same reasons: it's for war and it's for great public works.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.420
The interesting thing about the Peloponnesian War was how it started.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.610
I would say one of the interesting parallels is that

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:31.000
it started really with Athens at its height and with a level of hubris that sent them down the road towards ruin.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.470
- Perhaps they felt that they were, you know,... 
- Superior. Couldn't make a mistake. They knew better.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.550
Exactly! And they ended up destroying their society. As a result.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.610
- It's a road that we're going down today, right? 
- I think absolutely.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.300
there was a play written shortly after the Peloponnesian wars

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.320
about the worthlessness of the copper flecks

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.470
that are where their coinage at the time.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.600
So we go from gold and silver very high value money

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.120
to a currency that has a face value.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.520
And it's the first example that I can find in history

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.000
where a war was...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.310
war and great public works were being funded through deficit spending.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.840
What you've just seen is the first recorded example of one of the most predictable hidden secrets of money:

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.260
The Seven Stages of Empire

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.520
It's a long term cycle that echoes throughout history right to this very day

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.560
and is basically a societal pendulum that swings from
quality money to quantity currency

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.480
and back again to quality money.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.200
It always plays out in seven stages.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.770
It always ends with gold delivering a knockout blow to
debased currencies

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.570
and it goes like this...

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.570
Stage One
 A country starts out with good money

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.650
which is either gold or silver or it's backed by gold or silver.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.100
Stage Two
As it develops economically and socially

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.900
it begins to take on more and more economic burdens

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.800
adding layer upon layer of public works.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.000
Stage Three
As its economic affluence grows so does its political influence

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.000
and it increases expenditures to fund a massive military.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:19.000
Stage Four
Eventually it puts its military to use and expenditures explode.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.000
Stage Five
To fund the war it steals the wealth of its people

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.300
by debasing their coinage with base metals

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.780
or replacing their money with currency that can be created in unlimited quantities.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.800
Stage Six
The loss in purchasing power of the expanded currency supply

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.890
is sensed by the population in the financial markets

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.700
triggering a loss of faith in the currency.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.320
Stage Seven
 A mass movement out of currency into precious metals

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.600
and other tangible assets takes place.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.900
The currency collapses and gold and silver rise in price

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.460
as they account for the huge quantity of currency that was created.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.710
This process transfers massive wealth

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.300
to those who had the foresight to position themselves

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.560
beforehand in real money: gold and silver.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.500
You know, our monetary system basically steals from
the poor and middle class

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.640
and transfers the wealth to the banks.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.640
We see this throughout history

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and it's just repeating over and over again.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.640
What's happening in Greece right now is basically the same thing that was happening back in 407 BC.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:30.370
The deficit spending to fund all of these public works
 and the debasement of their currency supply

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.820
caused them to become nothing but a satellite of Rome.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.000
Today, they're becoming nothing but a satellite of the banks.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:47.300
Well, the idea of Gresham's laws is simply that people are going to hold on to what's value and spend what is value.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.110
Way way back in my youth, I was 11 years old

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:57.010
when we went from a silver based monetary system to a purely fiat system.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.900
People saw that silver was money, they got used to it, they didn't really think about it

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:10.170
and in 1965 under President Johnson, he basically said little silver is too valuable to money,

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.610
we're gonna just start putting out these substitutes which were what we call cupronickel coins.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:23.880
They were nickel copper plated with nickel at the time.
And of course the metal value was far less.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.500
And I understood that as a kid.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And yet very few adults really seemed to get the idea of what was really going on or a few and all it takes a few.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And of course the Gresham's law took effect,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.760
so the currency came out of circulation rapidly.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.550
It's very interesting to be, you know, knowing monetary history fairly well

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.800
is there always, you know, put out in silver looking or gold looking form

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.100
and in most cases, you'll have in fact they look rather interesting

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.830
and some of them are like silver on the inside and gold on the outside WITH THE LOOK.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.340
They have no value at all, really other than melt value of pot metal.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.770
To me it's sort of subconscious level. 
Why are they making them gold colored?

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.440
Why are they making them silver colored?

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:16.540
I think there's an inherent knowledge in the human species that knows that gold and silver have value

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.110
so if they look in their pocket

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.470
and they see something gold colored or silver colored

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.170
it makes it give them kind of a warm fuzzy feeling

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.570
and it's like, oh yeah, you know, 
but there's no value in these coins really.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.230
The next question is how does this affect you?

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.120
My next stop was in London where I had been asked to give a presentation to a group of businessmen.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.500
They wanted to understand the reason that gold had surged recently

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.460
and I explained to them that to understand gold you have to understand monetary history.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.470
Once you see where we've come from,

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.700
you can get a much clearer understanding of how the 7 Stages of Empire are playing out right now.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.420
We weren't allowed to show their faces but we were allowed to film my presentation.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So here it is.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.500
The last hundred and forty years of monetary history condensed into just ten minutes.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.500
Keep the 7 Stages of Empire in mind.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.350
And as you watch this, see if you can recognize the signs.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.200
Everybody thinks the US dollars still as good as gold and it hasn't been since 1971.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.590
This is the world monetary systems.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.000
From 1873 when Germany went on the Classical Gold Standard

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.200
where each unit of currency is backed up by

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.600
an equivalent amount of gold in the Treasury

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.500
in the United States.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.400
$20 bill - $20 gold piece in the vaults.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.300
Go into any bank, slap down your currency

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.500
which was a receipt for money, a claim check on money

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.500
ask for your money (gold and silver) 
and they would give it to you.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.000
So this shows this is currency, this is money.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Otherwise there was no reason for any government

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.130
to store gold in their vaults and then print this currency that was backed by gold.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.000
This is what gives confidence in that.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.170
And it gives governments the ability to start this scam in the first place

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.000
where they print these receipts for gold

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and then they can print more of them than gold that exists.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.500
And that happened when we got to World War I.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.100
And all the combatants stopped redemption rights?

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.000
You could no longer go on the bank and

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.590
trade your pounds, lira, marks, francs no longer redeemable in gold.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.890
And they lit up the printing presses and started printing like crazy.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Then between the wars they went on something called

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.100
the Gold Exchange Standard

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.000
where currencies would be backed partially by gold.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.150
So in the United States under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.000
the Federal Reserve was allowed to put

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.270
$50 worth of claim checks on gold currency in circulation

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.500
backed up by only $20 worth of gold

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.000
So it was a 40% reserve ratio.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.570
For every $20 gold piece in the vault

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.800
They could put $50 in circulation.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.250
We're the dollars of the nation on parade

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.800
We're the biggest batch of dollars ever made

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.350
Oh we used to march by millions

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.450
but now we march by billions

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.350
and maybe we'll be trillions before you're dead!

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.100
Then we get to 1944.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.100
Now during both wars, Europe paid the US with gold.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.230
During World War I, the US didn't get into the war until the very end of it.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.000
We didn't really have troops
on the ground here in any quantity

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.520
until the last six months of the war.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.000
So for the first four years or so, you're selling you, all of, you know...

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
You take all of your young men off of the farms and turn them into soldiers.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.580
You take your factories that make toasters and they start making machine guns.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.200
Your factories that made cars are now building tanks.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.300
And so you turn your economy toward war.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.880
And all of your consumer goods and your grains had to be imported from the United States.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.880
And you paid us with gold.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.870
Then in World War II, Hitler starts saber-rattling in 1936,

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.620
annexes Austria in 1938, invades Poland in 1939.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.100
Pearl Harbor wasn't until the end of 1941.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.830
We didn't have troops on the ground until I believe August of 1942.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:24.000
So again, it's like 6 years where you're paying us with your gold and we're selling you stuff.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
This is where Americans have this myth that war is good for the economy.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.400
War is good for the economy if you are not in it

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.550
and you're selling them the tools of the trade.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Yes. The American national income gets bigger and bigger.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:45.310
In 1943, it was a hundred and forty two billion dollars. That was double the 1939 figure, triple a figure for 1933.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.800
But by the end of World War II,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.000
the US had two-thirds of all the world's monetary gold, the central bank gold,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.650
and the rest of the world had to share the other third 
and Europe had none.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.500
So the world monetary system was no longer going to work. It would collapse.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.300
But we had made all these loans of dollars to Europe so Europe was flooded with dollars.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.600
And so representatives from around the world met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.100
They come up with a new world monetary system called

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.700
the Bretton Woods system

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.200
where every currency on the planet with the exception of just a few,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.740
they would be backed by the US dollar,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.500
and the US dollar would then be backed by gold at $35 per ounce.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.800
This gave confidence to all currencies.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.000
so this gave the world stability and

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.330
it pegged all the world's currencies to each other through the dollar to gold.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:42.000
So there was no such thing as the forex. Currencies didn't float, the exchange rates were fixed year after year.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.520
And this helped to make world trade boom.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.000
Then the Dollar Standard starts because

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.200
we kept on printing dollars.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.600
Under the Bretton Woods system,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.800
there was no reserve ratio established

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.800
where the US actually had to have a certain amount of gold

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.400
for how many dollars we created.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.200
So we had done a bunch of deficit spending

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.250
for Korea, for Vietnam, for Johnson's Great Society

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:12.190
and expanded the currency supply, 
the amount of paper dollars in circulation,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.390
and exported them all over the world.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:19.900
And then in the 1960s, Charles DeGaulle, President of France, realizes that we don't have the gold to back up the dollars.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.100
The fact that many countries,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.900
accept as a principle,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.900
dollars being as good as gold

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.300
lead Americans,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.600
to get into debt, and to get into debt for free...

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.000
at the expense of other countries.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.200
Because what the US owes them is paid,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.650
with dollars they are the only allowed to emit.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.130
We consider it necessary,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.350
that international trade,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.900
be established, as it was the case,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.100
before the great misfortunes of the world,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.400
on an indisputable monetary base,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.300
and one that does not bear the mark of any particular country.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.600
Which base?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.850
In truth one can't see,

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.850
how one could really have...

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.700
any standard criterion

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.000
other than GOLD!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.880
And he starts asking, France acts asks for their gold and trades and the dollars.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.900
And at that point, other countries saw this and started
jumping on board.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.800
And the US lost 50% of its gold from 1959 to 1971

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.000
but we still had in 1971 about 12 times more dollars that we had created

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.300
than there was gold and this run on the bank basically.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.300
The US now being the bank. This is a giant worldwide bank run

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.730
because the US for the second time had committed a fraud

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.500
and created more receipts for gold than there was gold.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.500
It's...it's that simple.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.500
Then finally the markets sort of sense this.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.000
And Nixon was forced to take us off the gold standard

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
because if he had paid out gold until it got to zero,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.600
once we couldn't pay on some of those dollars,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.400
the entire worldwide monetary system would have collapsed.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.800
I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.300
the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.350
except in amounts and conditions determined to be

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.400
in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interest of the United States.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.520
In full cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and those who trade with us,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.300
we will press for the necessary reforms to set up

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.440
an urgently needed new international monetary system.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.790
And on August 15th 1971, all the world's currencies became fiat currency

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.500
I don't know why the rest of the world didn't rush out and hang him

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.800
but they didn't, they just all went along with this.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.500
To our friends abroad, I give this assurance:

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.100
The United States has always been and will continue

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.500
to be a forward-looking and trustworthy trading partner.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
There have been thousands upon thousands upon thousands of fiat currencies throughout history

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.760
and there isn't one that survived.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.300
It is a 100% failure rate.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:33.820
And we started this experiment where all the world's currencies would be fiat currencies simultaneously in 1971.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.000
But what we have here:

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.500
30 to 40 years different monetary system,

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.000
30 years, 28 years, 39 years plus.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.160
What's next?

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.000
The world is going to have a new monetary system in this decade that we're in.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.990
We're going to experience this huge deflationary crash around the world.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.500
the world will probably end up on some sort of new monetary system

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.800
probably after governments try and print their way out of this

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.800
and cause hyper inflations of all the currencies.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.500
And people will just lose confidence in currency.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.850
And what do they always go back to throughout history time after time for the last 5000 years?

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.300
Actually they always go back to gold and silver.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.500
In a world of floating currencies and that's what all national currencies are today,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.500
they bob up and down relative to each other but they're all syncing relative to gold,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.000
that includes the Dollar as well as the Euro and the British Pound and all the others.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.800
They're going to continue to lose value, continue to lose purchasing power.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Personally I don't think there's any way of avoiding what is coming.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.500
There's no way to fix it right now.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.340
There's only a way to either let it wipe you out or to benefit from it.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.000
And I want to make sure that it's not just all,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
it's not just a few of the big investors in the world

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.700
that are ending up with all the cookies.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.400
So I want to make sure that there's as many small investors as possible

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.000
that are benefiting from it because

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.000
that's what makes society run: middle class, small investor.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.700
One of the biggest challenges for human beings is that

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.300
physiologically we are designed to operate in recency.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.400
It's the fight or flight response.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.500
It's literally in my cells. Literally.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:26.000
And so that when I'm in the wild, it's about I need to look for something to eat or make sure I don't get eaten.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.500
And how that translates into the modern world is that we think only about what's happening immediately in front of us.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.200
And so we think a long time is last week.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.600
In the world of YouTube and Facebook and instant messaging, we think three seconds is a long time like:

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800
Did you get the post already? I already posted it.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.690
And the reality is that if you look at history, I don't mean a week, I don't mean a month,

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:53.800
I mean decades, I mean a hundred years, I mean a couple of hundred years, I mean more than a couple hundred years.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.600
You can start to see some patterns, you can see some things that are going on

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.000
because history repeats itself there are some trends and there are some movements that you can learn from.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And you literally have to go outside of your your human instincts to look at history

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.520
because we just want to focus on right now,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.300
because I said that's about either eating or being eaten.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.140
So we're gonna go beyond that 
and that means not just focusing on the hair now

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.600
but learning some real powerful stuff and what's happened

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.500
because they just might be some indicators there as what's gonna happen in the future.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Now, the 7 Stages of Empire just as a reminder

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
started with sound money

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
and then a country adds layers of public works and social programs

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.500
and then develops a massive military

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.500
and then puts that military to use

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.500
and to pay for the war it debases its currency supply

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.500
which causes a loss of faith in the currency

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.500
which then leads to a currency crisis

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.700
and gold does an accounting of the expansion of that fiat currency supply

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.700
that happened over all those years of the first five stages.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.900
We are in the sixth and beginning the seventh stage.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.900
Gold started the accounting in the year 2001, it was 250 dollars then

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.500
but we're still in the very early stages of this.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.300
Well, that's right. I think one of the problems with gold is people just don't understand it.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.300
I mean for one thing it's sort of been banished from the curriculum for 35 years.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.490
We have going on two generations of academics and scholars who have never studied gold

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.800
unless you're a specialist in economic history, you can go back and look at it now.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.300
When I was in university and even when I was in graduate school in economics,

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.000
we were still on the gold standard,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.100
in some form it was fairly attenuated.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.800
But when you studied the IMF and you looked at how they present the finances of a country

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.400
and they break down the reserves and you know, the capital accounts,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.400
gold was a line item in the capital account.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:04.500
He had to understand how it, what role had played and how it, you know, could equilibrate in terms of balance of trade.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.000
Well, that's gone. The IMF, Nixon went off the gold standard in 1971.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.900
And bright young economic students just don't understand gold.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.550
They think it's a joke or they think it's maybe a commodity trade, a momentum trade.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.200
They don't understand that it really is money parks loss.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:29.300
So now we've learned that money was born in roughly 630 BC when it became fungible.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.400
It was free markets and sound money that led to Athens great prosperity.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.100
But debasement of their money for deficit spending on war and public works played a large role in their demise.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:47.000
Over the past 140 years, we've based our own currencies to the point where two generations of scholars don't even understand gold.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
We learned about Gresham's law and that Bad Money Drives Out Good.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.800
In recent history there has been a new monetary system roughly every 40 years.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And we've learned that we are in the 6th stage of the 7 Stages of Empire.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.800
So that's it for this episode. Join us next time when we learn more about the chaotic state of the US Dollar Standard

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.000
and how it's going to affect you no matter where you live on the planet.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.900
When I wrote my book I said that

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.000
we're coming into an era that is going to be the greatest wealth transfer in the history of mankind

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.000
therefore it's the greatest opportunity in the history of mankind.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.500
I've made it my mission to help as many people as possible get through this crisis

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.730
and to come out on the best side of the wealth transfer.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.700
I've just finished filming an exclusive presentation titled "How The 7th Stage Will Unfold"

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.800
where I detail what I'm doing personally to prepare for a range of scenarios.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.000
It's available at hiddensecretsofmoney.com as part of your free information toolkit.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
So my challenge to you for this episode is to try and find a single example in all of monetary history

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
of a crisis that was brought on by too much deficit spending, too much debt and too much currency debasement

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
being solved by more deficit spending, more debt and more currency debasement.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.240
Until then, good luck and I'll see you at the bonus presentation at hiddensecretsofmoney.com.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.000
Thanks.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.200
You bet, there's no other, there is no other side.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.700
you're either silver and gold or you're doom.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.000
That's exactly the way the world is always working. 
That's the way it's working right now.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:30.800
Turn on television. Watch what the price of gold because the dollar going down, gold going up, silver going up.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.900
That's exactly the way it's always working. It's always working that way. And it's working that way now.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.800
Why is anyone surprised? Why is it surprised?

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:48.000
It's always working like that. 5000 years, it's always working exactly that way.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
It's happening that way now. They're "Woo! Wait a minute..."

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.000
Weird! Beyond weird!!!

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.500
