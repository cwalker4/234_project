[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:09.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:13.890
FRANK ABAGNALE: Good morning.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.760
It's a pleasure to
be here this morning.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.610
I'm gonna ask your
indulgence on two things.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.210
It's allergy season, so
I have a real hard time

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.730
during this time of
the year speaking.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.000
And two, most of the speaking I
do when I walk up to the podium

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.890
is very technical.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.080
It deals with cyber crime
and identity theft, forgery,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.299
embezzlements, and
things of that nature.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.950
I don't often talk
about my life.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.830
But Google has asked me today
to do something different

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.460
and talk a little
bit about my life.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.614
So I will do that.

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:41.780
And then at the end, of
course, I'll take questions.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.030
And those questions can be
about any subject matter

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.490
that you like to ask.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.260
As you know, I've had a lot
of people tell my story.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.640
I had a great movie director
write a film about my life.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.820
I had a great Broadway musical
team make a Tony Award-winning

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.530
Broadway musical about my life.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.390
Had a popular
television show on TV,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.110
"White Collar," for four
years created around my life.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.000
And most of those
very creative people

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.130
have actually never
met me personally.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.500
But they've enjoyed telling my
story from their point of view.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740
So I thought I would take
a few minutes this morning

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.790
and actually tell you the
story from my point of view.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.580
I was raised just north of
New York City in Westchester

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.450
County, New York.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.400
I was actually one
of four children

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.065
in the family, the so-called
middle child of the four.

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:28.010
I was educated there by the
Christian Brothers of Ireland

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.610
in a private Catholic
school called

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.120
Iona where I went to school from
kindergarten to high school.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.500
By the time I had reached the
age of 16, in the 10th grade,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.840
my parents after 22
years of marriage one day

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.114
decided to get a divorce.

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:43.280
Unlike most divorces where
the children were usually

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.870
the first to know,
my parents were

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.175
very good about
keeping that a secret.

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:49.550
I remember being in the 10th
grade when the father walked

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.508
in the classroom one
afternoon, asked a brother

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:52.760
to excuse me from class.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.581
When I came out in the hallway,
the father handed me my books

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.080
and told me that
one of the brothers

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.550
would drive me to
the county seat

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.430
in White Plains, New York
where I would meet my parents,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.809
and they would explain
what was going on.

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.350
I remember the brother dropped
me at the steps of a big stone

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.099
building and told me
to go on up the steps

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.360
where my parents would be
waiting for me in the lobby.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.860
I remember climbing the steps,
seeing a sign on the building

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.450
that said "Family Court."

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.809
But I really didn't
understand what that meant.

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.100
When I arrived in the lobby,
my parents were not there.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.440
But I was ushered into the
back of an immense courtroom

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.900
where my parents were
standing before a judge.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.420
I couldn't hear what the judge
was saying, nor my parents'

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.890
response.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.290
But eventually, the judge saw
me at the back of the room

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.570
and motioned me to
approach the bench.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.210
So I walked up the stand
in between my parents.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.090
I remember distinctly that
the judge never looked at me.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.310
He never acknowledged
I was standing there.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.100
He simply read from his papers
and said that my parents

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.670
were getting a divorce.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.090
And because I was
16 years of age,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.590
I would need to
tell the court which

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.080
parent I chose to live with.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.040
I started to cry.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.710
So I turned and ran
out of the courtroom.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.480
Judge called for a
10-minute recess.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.050
But by the time my parents
got outside, I was gone.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.930
My mother never saw me again
for about seven years until I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.060
was a young adult.
Contrary to the movie,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.110
my father never saw me or
ever spoke to me again.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.900
In the mid-1960s, running
away was a very popular thing

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.650
for young people.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.050
A lot of them got caught up
in Haight-Ashbury, the hippie

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.404
scene, the drug scene.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.320
Instead, I took a few
belongings from my home,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.050
packed them in a bag, boarded
what was then the New Haven

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.970
and Hartford railroad
for the short train ride

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.850
down to Grand Central
Terminal in New York.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.370
My father did own a
stationary store in Manhattan.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.160
It was located on the
corner of 40th and Madison.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.080
Like all of us, we had
to work in that store.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.810
So from the time I was
about 13, I made deliveries

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.180
my dad in the summer on a bike.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.500
I knew the city very well.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.020
So naturally, I started looking
for the same type of work.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.020
There were a lot of signs
on the windows-- stock

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.240
boy, delivery boy, part time.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.620
I'd walk in and apply.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.390
So tell me, young
man, how old are you?

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.590
Uh, 16.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.105
How far did you
go in high school?

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:54.380
Uh, 10th grade.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.300
I'll hire you.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.050
I went to work for a
small amount of money

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.820
a few hours a day.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.280
But I soon realized I
couldn't support myself

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.510
on that amount of money.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.670
I also realize as long as people
believed I was 16 years old,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.280
they weren't going to
pay me any more money.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.900
At 16, I was 6 foot tall.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.640
I've always had
little gray hair.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.500
My friends in school
used to say that once

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.930
a week, when we dressed
in a suit for mass,

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.740
I looked more like a teacher.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.410
So I decided to
lie about my age.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.200
In New York, we had a
driver's license at 16.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.320
Back then, it didn't have a
photo on it, just an IBM card.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.690
So I altered one digit
of my date of birth.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.110
I was actually born
in April of 1948.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.570
But I dropped the four,
converted it to a three.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.180
And that made me 26 years old.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.610
I walked around applying
for the same type of work.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.520
People gave me a little more
money, a few more hours.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.567
But even then, it was very
difficult to make ends meet.

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:48.650
One of the few things I
had taken when I left home

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.490
was a checkbook.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.460
I had money from
work in the summers.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.420
I had some money in
that checking account.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.400
So every so often, I
would write a check

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.840
to supplement my income--

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.085
$20, $25.

00:04:59.085 --> 00:04:59.960
The funds were there.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.340
The checks were good.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.580
But it was my friends, my peers,
who would constantly say to me,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.170
you know, you're
the only guy who

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.730
walks into a bank in
the middle of Manhattan.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.230
You have no account there.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.420
You don't know a soul.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.880
You talk to somebody behind the
desk, and they OK your check.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.130
Oh, well, my checks are good.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.900
But if I walked in there,
they wouldn't touch my check.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.750
You walk in there,
they don't bat an eye.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.940
Years later, reporters
would write and speculate

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.580
and say that that was my
upbringing-- mannerisms, dress,

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.390
appearance, speech.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.160
Whatever it was, it
was very easy to do.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.650
So consequently, when
the money ran out,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.374
I kept writing those checks.

00:05:34.374 --> 00:05:36.040
Of course, the checks
started to bounce.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.009
Police started looking
for me as a runaway.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.550
So I thought maybe
it was a good time

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.580
to start thinking about
leaving New York City.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.500
But I was quite
apprehensive about going

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.530
to Chicago or Miami, wondered
if they'd cash a New York

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.560
check on a New York
driver's license in Miami

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.930
as quickly as they
did in Manhattan.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.260
I was walking up 42nd Street
one afternoon about 5 o'clock

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.870
in the evening, 16
years old, pondering

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.580
all of these things,
when I started

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.050
to approach the front door of an
old hotel that used to be there

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.710
called the Commodore Hotel--

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.210
now the Grand Hyatt.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.090
Just as I was about to get to
the front door of the hotel,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.960
out stepped an Eastern Airline
flight crew onto the sidewalk.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.224
I couldn't help but notice
the captain, the copilot,

00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:18.640
the flight engineer, about
three or four flight attendants

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.980
dragging their bags to the
curb to load them in the van

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.870
to take them to the airport.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.110
As they loaded the van, I
thought to myself, that's it.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.910
I could pose as a pilot.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.250
I could travel all over
the world for free.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.650
I probably could get
just about anybody

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.621
anywhere to cash a check for me.

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.370
So I walked up the
street a little further

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.780
to 42nd and Park.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.890
I went to crossover.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.780
I heard a huge helicopter.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.790
So I looked up, and there
was New York Airways

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.280
landing on the roof of
the Pan Am building.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.470
Pan Am, the nation's
flag carrier, the airline

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.340
that flew around the world--

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.670
I thought, what a
perfect airline to use.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.410
So the next day, I
placed a phone call

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.320
to the executive corporate
offices of Pan Am.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.540
I remember distinctly when
the phone was ringing,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.930
I had absolutely no idea
what I was going to say.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.730
When they answered,
"Pan American Airlines.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.260
Good morning, can I help you?"

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.820
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.390
I'd like to--

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.890
I'd like to speak to somebody
in the purchasing department.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.760
"Purchasing?

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.580
One moment."

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.410
The clerk came on.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.900
I said, yes, sir.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.816
Maybe you can help me.

00:07:15.816 --> 00:07:17.650
My name is John Black.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.980
I'm a copilot with a company
based out of San Francisco.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.530
Been with the company about
seven years, but never

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.580
had anything like
this come up before.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.620
"What's the problem?"

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.630
Well, we flew a trip
in here yesterday.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.570
We're going out later today.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.950
Yesterday, I sent my uniform
out through the hotel

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.420
to have it dry cleaned.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.270
Now the hotel and the cleaners
say they can't find it.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.340
I'm with a flight in
about four hours--

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.120
new uniform.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.170
"Don't you have
a spare uniform?"

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.200
Certainly, back home
in San Francisco.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.930
But I'd never get it here
in time for my flight.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.720
Do you understand this will cost
you the price of a uniform, not

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.830
the company?"

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.860
I understand.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.360
"Hold on.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.560
I'll be right back."

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.330
He came back and
said, my supervisor

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.730
says you need to go down
to the Well-Built Uniform

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.990
Company on Fifth Avenue.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.985
They're our supplier.

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:02.110
I'll call them and let them
know you're on the way.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.901
Well, that's exactly
what I wanted to know.

00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.980
So I went down to the
Well-Built Uniform Company.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.800
Little fella, Mr.
Rosen fitted me out

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.351
in the uniform, black aberdeen
with three gold stripes

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:12.850
on the arm.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.004
I certainly looked old
enough to be the pilot.

00:08:15.004 --> 00:08:17.170
When he was all done, I
said, how much do I owe you?

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.870
"Well, the uniform's $286."

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.960
I said, no problem.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.320
I'll write you a check.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.620
"No, um, we can't
take any checks."

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.670
Oh, well, then I'll
just pay you cash.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.870
We can't accept cash.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.760
You need to fill out
this computer card.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.250
Then in these boxes, put
your employee number.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.830
Then we bill this back
under uniform allowance,

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.480
comes out of your
next Pan Em paycheck.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.620
Well, that's even better.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.110
Go ahead and do that.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.429
New York had two airports--

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.600
LaGuardia and Kennedy.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.450
LaGuardia was 20 minutes from
Manhattan, Kennedy was 50.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.760
Naturally, LaGuardia being
the closer of the two,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.960
that's where I went.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.300
I spent most of the morning
walking around LaGuardia

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.010
in the uniform, trying
to figure out now

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.900
that I had this
uniform, how the hell do

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.134
you get on these planes?

00:08:58.134 --> 00:08:59.050
I got a little hungry.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.162
So about lunchtime, I
walked in the luncheonette

00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:03.370
in the terminal, sat down
at the counter on the stool

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.840
and ordered a sandwich.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.596
Moments later, a
TWA crew walked in.

00:09:07.596 --> 00:09:09.220
The flight attendants
sat in the booth,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.800
but the pilots up at the
counter on either side of me,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.540
and captain right next to me.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.120
Now back before deregulation
of the airlines,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.770
airline people
thought of themselves

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.569
as just one big family.

00:09:19.569 --> 00:09:21.860
So they didn't hesitate a
moment to talk to each other.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.260
The captain kinda leaned over.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.760
"Hey, young man.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.110
How's Pan Am doing?"

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.444
Doing just fine, captain.

00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:29.610
"Tell me, what's Pan Am
doing out here at LaGuardia?

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.300
Pan Am doesn't fly
into LaGuardia.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.610
They only fly into Kennedy."

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.110
Well, I picked up
on that right away.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.109
Yeah, we came into
Kennedy at a layover.

00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:40.650
So I came over to
visit some friends.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.300
Matter of fact, I'm on my
way back to Kennedy now.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.840
"So tell me, young man, what
type of equipment are you on?"

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.180
Airline people have a
lot of jargon for things.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.160
One of them is they never call
a plane a plane or an aircraft,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.280
they call it equipment.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.440
And what type of
equipment you're on meant

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.690
what type of plane do you fly.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.051
Back then, a DC-8, a 707.

00:09:57.051 --> 00:09:58.300
Of course, I didn't know that.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.430
And I thought,
type of equipment?

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.809
The only equipment
I'm on is this stool.

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:05.350
They must mean what
type of equipment

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.880
is on the planes I fly.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.115
So I thought, well, they got
the wings, they got the engine.

00:10:10.115 --> 00:10:11.740
They always had a
sticker on the engine

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.136
who manufactured the engine.

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:14.760
So I said, yeah, it's
General Electric.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.645
All three pilots kind of just
stopped eating and leaned over.

00:10:17.645 --> 00:10:19.020
And the captain
said, oh, really?

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.430
What do you fly,
a washing machine?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.971
So I knew I had said
the wrong thing.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:23.790
Out the door I went.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.980
Everybody had an
airline ID card,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.175
a plastic laminated card much
like a driver's license today.

00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:32.460
Yet without the ID card,
the uniform was worthless.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.320
I went back to Manhattan
pretty discouraged

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.778
thinking where would I come up
with a Pan American Airlines

00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:38.597
corporate ID?

00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:39.930
I was sitting in the hotel room.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.020
I noticed a big thick
Manhattan Yellow Pages.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.250
So I pulled them down on
the bed, flipped them open,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.010
and looked under the
word identification.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.900
There were three or
four pages of companies

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.900
who made convention badges,
metal badges, plastic badges,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.550
police badges, fire badges.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.540
Started to call around.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.940
And finally, one
company said, listen,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.580
most of those airline
IDs manufactured

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.780
by Polaroid, 3M company.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.120
You need to call one of them.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.640
Finally got the 3M company
on the phone in Manhattan.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.330
"Yeah, we manufacture Pan
Am's identification system

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.610
along with a number
of other carriers.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.530
How come?"

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.720
So I tell them, I'm a purchasing
officer for a major US carrier.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.332
I'm in New York
just for the day.

00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:19.040
We're getting ready
to expand our routes,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.690
hire a lot of new employees,
go to a formal ID.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.695
We're very impressed
with this Pan Am format.

00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:26.070
Wondered if I came by your
office this afternoon briefly,

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.990
we could discuss
quantity and price.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.580
"By all means, come on by."

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.900
So I went by dressed in a suit.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.316
And the sales rep
opened the book.

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.220
Yeah, we do United,
Braniff, National, Pan Am.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.510
Pan Am!

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.592
We like this Pan Am format.

00:11:38.592 --> 00:11:40.550
Wonder if you have a
sample I could bring back.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.030
Sure, I'll be right back.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.920
And he brought me
back a 5" by 7"

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.280
glossy piece of paper with a
picture of an ID card blown up

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.340
in the middle of it, someone
else's picture in the picture,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.830
John Doe for a name, and in
bold red ink across the front,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.489
"This is a sample only."

00:11:55.489 --> 00:11:57.030
I said, no, I'm
afraid this won't do.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.290
I need to bring back an
actual physical card.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.327
And by the way, what is all
this equipment on the floor?

00:12:02.327 --> 00:12:03.660
"We don't just sell these cards.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.960
We sell the system--
camera, laminator."

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.410
We have to buy all this?

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.335
"Absolutely."

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:10.170
But tell you what, since we
have to buy it all, why don't we

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.030
just demonstrate how
it works and use me?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.390
"Fine, have a seat right here."

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.130
Took my picture,
and made the card.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.320
I was going down the
elevator studying the card.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.250
It had a blue border
across the top,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.420
about a half inch in
Pan Am's color blue,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.980
but not a single thing
on the card said Pan-Am--

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.310
no logo, no insignia,
no company name.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.319
This was a plastic card
like a credit card.

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:33.360
So you couldn't type on
it, couldn't write on it,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.800
couldn't print on it.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.110
Discouraged, I put it in
my pocket, headed back

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.500
to the hotel.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.460
As I was walking back, I noticed
that I'd passed a hobby shop.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.194
So I turned around
and walked back.

00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:45.360
Excuse me, sir, I see you
sell a lot of models here.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.850
Do you sell models of
commercial jetliners?

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.920
"Sure, over there."

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.274
And I bought a model of
a Pan Am 707 cargo jet.

00:12:52.274 --> 00:12:53.940
Took it back to my
room, opened the box,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.960
threw all the parts out.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.460
But they're at the
bottom of the box

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.470
was a sheet of decals
that went on the model.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.040
And when soaked in
a glass of water,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.560
the little Pan Am
blue globe that

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.900
went on the tail of
the plastic plane

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.466
went perfect up at the
top of the plastic card.

00:13:06.466 --> 00:13:08.340
And the word "Pan Am"
and the special styling

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.381
and graphics that would
have went on the fuselage

00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:12.370
went perfect across
the top of the card.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.790
And the clear decal on
the laminated plastic

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.180
made a beautiful
identification card.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.720
Pan Am says they estimate that
between the ages of 16 and 18,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.120
I flew more than a
million miles for free,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.990
boarded more than 260 commercial
aircraft in more than 26

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.480
countries around the world.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.500
Pan Am says, keep in mind the
fact that Frank Abagnale did

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.080
in fact pose as
one of our pilots

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.870
for a long period of time,
he never once stepped

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.090
on board one of our aircraft.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.230
That's true.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.750
I never flew on Pan
Am because I was

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.500
afraid someone might
say to me, "You know,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.850
I'm based in San Francisco.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.620
Been out there 16 years.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.345
I don't recall ever
meeting you before."

00:13:48.345 --> 00:13:50.220
Or someone might say,
you know, "Your ID card

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.160
is not exactly like my ID card."

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.800
So instead, I flew
on everyone else.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.350
If I wanted to go
somewhere, I literally just

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.360
walked out to the
airport, walked up

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.300
on the board, United
Flight 800 to Chicago.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.780
Then I went downstairs to the
door marked United operations

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.950
and walked in.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.076
The operations clerk, "Hey, Pan
Am, what can we do for you?"

00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:12.450
I was wondering
if the jumpseat's

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.310
open on 800 [INAUDIBLE] Chicago.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.310
I was open this evening.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.040
Like to get a pink slip pass.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.810
I'd give them my ID,
write me out a pass.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.726
I'd walk out, hand it
to the flight attendant.

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.590
She'd open the door
to the cockpit.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.277
And I'd step in.

00:14:23.277 --> 00:14:25.860
They had a captain, a copilot,
a flight engineer, and the seat

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.680
behind the captain called
the jumpseat pilots dead head

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.330
on company time.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.430
Because pilots
love to talk shop,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.020
once you picked
up that jargon, it

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.320
was the same conversation
over and over and over.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.430
So I just step on board.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.429
Even [? John ?] Bob Davis
be running to Chicago.

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:42.660
On the taxi out, always
the same questions.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.640
"So Bob, how long you
been with Pan Am?"

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.140
Been flying about seven years.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.490
"What position you fly?"

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.910
Right seat, which is airline
terminology for a copilot.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.530
"What type of
equipment are you on?"

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.276
Had that one down perfect.

00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:55.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.800
Matter of fact, whatever
they flew, I didn't fly.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800
So I had no problems with that.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.460
Then we'd arrive in Chicago,
I'd go by the Pan Am ticket

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.150
counter, but just enough to get
the attention of the passenger

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.910
service rep.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.490
Excuse me, I haven't laid
over here in over a year.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.370
We're still at the--

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.620
"Palmer House Hilton downtown.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.640
Catch a crew bus lower
level door three, out."

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.640
I go down to the Palmer
House Hilton, walk in,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.290
and on the corner
of the registration

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.292
desk was a little sign
that said "Airline crews."

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.500
That was a three-ring binder.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.230
You signed in, referenced your
flight number, showed your ID.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.140
They'd give me a key.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.010
I'd stay two or three
days, and Pan Am

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.990
would be direct billed
for my room and my meals.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.350
I also could cash a personal
check at the front desk

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.850
because I was an
employee of the airline.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.600
The airline had a
contract with the hotel.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.780
And as a courtesy,
they'd cash your check.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.610
But then I found out
that every airline

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.460
honors every other airline
employee's personal check.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.930
Actually, a reciprocal agreement
still practiced today in 2017.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.540
So at the San Francisco airport,
a Delta flight attendant

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.830
can walk up to an American
Airlines ticket counter,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.270
show her ID, and cash a
personal check up to $100

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.800
and vice versa.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.980
Of course, when I found that
out, I'd go out to JFK or LAX.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.150
Only, I'd go to everybody--

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.829
Northeast, National,
KLM, Air France.

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:04.370
It would take me a good eight
hours stopping at every counter

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.197
in every building.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.280
By the time I got all the
way around the other end

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.280
of the airport, at least
eight hours had gone by.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.655
What did you have
in eight hours?

00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:11.740
Shift change, new people.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.050
So I'd go all the way back
around the other way again.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.030
As you know, I went
on to impersonate

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.550
a doctor in a Georgia
hospital for a while.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.450
I took the bar exams in
Louisiana, passed the bar,

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.276
went to work for
Attorney General PF

00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:26.400
Gremillion in the civil
division of the state court

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.590
where I spent about a
year practicing law.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.950
In both the job as the
lawyer and the doctor,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.170
no one ever doubted
for a second I was not

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.510
eligible or qualified to do so.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.964
I on my own resigned
and moved on.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.880
Of course, like any
criminal, sooner or later,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.825
you get caught.

00:16:41.825 --> 00:16:43.640
And I was no exception
to that rule.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.040
I was actually arrested
just once in my life

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.590
when I was 21 years old
by the French police

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.187
in a small town in southern
France called Montpellier.

00:16:52.187 --> 00:16:54.020
The French police were
actually arresting me

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.930
on an Interpol warrant issued
by the Swedish police who

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.910
were looking for me
for forgery in Sweden,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.320
but believed that I
was living in France.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.320
When the French authorities
took me into custody

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.750
on that warrant, they
realized I had forged checks

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.660
all over France.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.470
So they refused to honor the
warrant and Sweden's request

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.030
for my extradition.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.770
They later convicted
me of forgery

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.900
and sent me to French prison.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.339
I served my time
at a place called

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.140
the maison d'arret,
the house of arrest,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.010
in a small town in southern
France called Perpignan.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.089
Steven Spielberg
told Barbara Walters,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.750
"It was extremely important
to me to go back to that cell,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.250
to the exact cell he was
in and reconstruct it

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.100
according to the logbooks
during his stay there."

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.600
He said, "To my
amazement, there was

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.240
a blanket on the floor, no
mattress, a hole in the floor

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.985
to go the bathroom, no
plumbing, no electricity."

00:17:40.985 --> 00:17:43.370
He said, "According
to the log books,

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.130
I entered the prison
at 198 pounds,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.950
left the prison at 109 pounds."

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.640
When my sentence
was over in France,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.910
I was extradited to
Sweden where I was later

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.670
convicted of forgery in
a Swedish court of law

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.480
and sent to a Swedish
penitentiary in Malmo, Sweden.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.280
When my prison term
was up in Sweden,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.290
US federal authorities
took custody of me

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.210
and returned me to
the United States.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.520
Eventually, United
States federal judge

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.180
in Atlanta, Georgia, which
sentenced me to 12 years

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.770
in federal prison.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.590
I served 4 of the 12
years at a federal prison

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.450
in Petersburg, Virginia.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.280
When I was 26 years
old, the government

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.770
offered to take me out of
prison on the condition

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.020
I go to work with an agency
of the federal government

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.230
for the remainder of my
sentence until my parole had

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.450
been satisfactorily completed.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.030
I agreed and was released.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.270
This year, I'm celebrating
41 years at the FBI.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.250
I've been at the Bureau
for more than four decades.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.410
I work out of Washington DC.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.440
I actually make my home in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.350
So every Monday, I
fly up to Washington,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.860
about an hour flight, and I
go home on Thursday evenings.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.980
I live in Charleston with my one
and only wife of 40 plus years

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.650
and my three sons.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.200
My youngest boy graduated
from the University of Beijing

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.707
in China.

00:18:57.707 --> 00:18:59.540
He went on to get his
master's degree there.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.210
He reads, writes, and
speaks Chinese fluently.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.010
He works for a San
Francisco gaming

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.450
company called Glu Mobile.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.990
He designs games for
the Chinese market.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.880
All of his games are
in Chinese, and they're

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.629
in their fourth generation
as mobile games and devices.

00:19:14.629 --> 00:19:16.670
My middle son graduated
from University of Nevada

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.420
in Las Vegas.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.650
His degree was in business.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.780
He and his wife
graduated together.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.360
And he and her own a
business in South Carolina,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.670
and they manage that
business together.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.710
My oldest son graduated from
University of Kansas at KU.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.140
We went on to
Loyola School of Law

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.576
in Chicago to get
his law degree.

00:19:31.576 --> 00:19:33.200
Passed the bar in
Illinois, and went on

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.700
to make his dad
very, very proud.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.350
He's an FBI agent.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.090
He's been in the
Bureau about 12 years.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.910
He supervises a team that
deals with American citizens

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.170
kidnapped overseas.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.420
So they're a response
team that operates out

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.790
of Quantico, Virginia.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.270
As many of you know, I had very
little to do with the film.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.850
I would have preferred not to
had a movie made about my life.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.950
I actually raised my three
boys in Tulsa, Oklahoma

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.370
in the same house for 25 years.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.584
My neighbors had
no idea who I was.

00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:03.500
And I would have preferred
it stayed that way.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.690
But Steven Spielberg
told Barbara Walters

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.930
he felt compelled to tell
the world the story not

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.940
because of what I did,
but because of what

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.820
I'd done my life after that.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.160
He loved the redemption
side of the story,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.480
wanted the world
to know the story.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.480
So in the end, my family
and I were very pleased

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.590
with the outcome of the film.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.150
But we thought in
a couple of years,

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.021
that would all be forgotten
and move on with our life.

00:20:26.021 --> 00:20:27.770
I never dreamed that
"Catch Me If You Can"

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.770
would go on to earn more than
$1 billion for Dreamworks

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.070
and be shown over and over
literally every week on HBO

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.390
and TV and then become a
Broadway musical and a TV show.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.200
So consequently, every Monday
morning when I come to work,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.380
I have e-mails that come
from all over the world.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.960
Someone who's seeing the
movie for the first time,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.630
watching the play at a community
theater or a high school

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.660
somewhere, and they
feel compelled to write.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.090
And of course, they come from
people literally as young

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.110
as eight years old sending those
e-mails to people as old as 80.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.450
Most people assume I'll
never read those e-mails

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.470
or see those e-mails.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.210
But they feel
compelled to write,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.920
and they want to
make a statement.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.000
Some say, you know,
you were brilliant.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.190
You were an absolute genius.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.480
I was neither.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.650
I was just a child.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.721
Had I been brilliant,
had I been a genius,

00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:19.220
I don't know that
I would have found

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.059
it necessary to break the law
in order to just simply survive.

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.850
And while I know that
people are fascinated

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.414
by what I did some 50
years ago as a teenage boy,

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:30.830
I've always looked
upon what I did

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.950
as something that was
immoral, illegal, unethical,

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.020
and a burden I
live with literally

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.496
every single day of my life,
and will until my death.

00:21:40.496 --> 00:21:41.870
There are many
who write and say,

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.120
well, you know, you
were certainly gifted.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.032
That I was.

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:46.910
I was one of those
few children that

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.450
got to grow up in the
world with a daddy.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.790
Now, the world is
full of fathers.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.660
But there are very few men
worthy of being called daddy

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.260
by their child.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.594
I had a daddy loved his children
more than he loved life itself.

00:22:05.594 --> 00:22:08.010
Steven Spielberg told Barbara
Walters the [INAUDIBLE] I've

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.530
researched Frank's youth.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.080
Now without having met
Frank, I couldn't help

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.180
but put his father in the
film through the likes

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.740
of Christopher Walken.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.290
My father was a man who had
four children-- three boys

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.770
and a daughter.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.530
Every night at bedtime,
he'd walk into your room.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.390
He was 6', 3".

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.880
He would drop down on one
knee, kiss you on the cheek,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.660
pull the cover up.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.000
And he'd put his lip
up on your earlobe.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.070
And he'd whisper deep into
your ear, "I love you.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.750
I love you very much."

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.760
He never ever missed a night.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.850
As I grew older, I sometimes
fell asleep before he got home.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.830
But I always woke
up the next morning,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.140
knew he had been at my bedside.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.540
Years later, my older
brother joined me in my room

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.350
temporarily.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.640
He was in the Marine Corps.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.570
He was 6', 4".

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.180
He played semi-pro
football for Buffalo.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.450
But my father would
walk around to his bed,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.940
hug him, kiss him, whisper
in his ear he loved him.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.360
When I was 16 years
old, I was just a child.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.660
All 16-year-olds
are just children.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.770
Much as we'd like them to be
adults, they're just children.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.860
And like all children,
they need their mother,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.570
and they need their father.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:20.200
All children need their
mother and their father.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.150
All children are entitled to
their mother and their father.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.490
And though it is not
popular to say so,

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.890
divorce is a very
devastating thing

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.840
for a child to
deal with and then

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.900
have to deal with the rest
of their natural life.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.880
For me, a complete
stranger, a judge,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.760
told me I had to choose
one parent over the other.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.910
That was a choice a
16-year-old boy could not make.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.410
So I ran.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.480
How could I tell you
my life was glamorous?

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.750
I cried myself to sleep
'til I was 19 years old.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.210
I spent every birthday,
Christmas, Mother's Day,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:53.950
Father's Day in a
hotel room somewhere

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.340
in the world where people
didn't speak my language.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.260
The only people that
associated with me

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.590
were people who believed
me to be their peer,

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.270
10 years older than
I actually was.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.180
I never got to go to a senior
prom, high school football

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.360
game, share a relationship
with someone my own age.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.180
I always knew I'd get caught.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.390
Only a fool would
think otherwise.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.740
The law sometimes sleeps,
but the law never dies.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.790
I was caught.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.130
I went to some very bad places.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.942
My boys have grown up
asking their mother,

00:24:25.942 --> 00:24:28.150
why is it that dad gets up
in the middle of the night

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.358
and goes down to the TV room?

00:24:29.358 --> 00:24:31.420
Because you know he
doesn't turn the TV on.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.110
He just sits there all night.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.470
That's because there are
things you can't forget,

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.360
things you're not
meant to forget.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.700
While I was sitting in that
pitch black cell in France,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.760
my father, 57, was climbing
the subway stairs in New York

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.630
as he did every day.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.000
He was in great physical shape.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.890
He just happened to trip.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.750
He reached his arm
to break his fall.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.096
He slipped, hit his
head on the railing,

00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:53.470
landed at the
bottom of the step.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.760
He was dead.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.104
I didn't know he was dead.

00:24:56.104 --> 00:24:57.520
I was thinking
about him, how much

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.061
I couldn't wait to see him, hold
him, hug him, kiss him, tell

00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:01.570
him how sorry I was.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.610
But I never got the
opportunity to do that.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.280
I was very fortunate
because I was

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.570
raised in a great country where
everyone gets a second chance.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.860
I owe my country 800 times
more than I can ever repay it

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.150
over these past four decades.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.360
That is why I am
at the FBI today

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.590
32 years after the federal
court order expired

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.500
requiring me to do so.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.680
I have turned down three pardons
from three sitting presidents

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.770
of the United States
because I do not believe,

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.100
nor will I ever believe,
that a piece of paper

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.970
will excuse my actions,
that only in the end,

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.110
my actions will.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.660
40 plus years ago, on
an undercover assignment

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.510
in Houston, Texas,
I met my wife.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.390
When the assignment was
over, I broke protocol

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.410
to tell her who I really was.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.500
I didn't have a dime to my name.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.690
But I eventually
asked her to marry me.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.790
Against the wishes of
her parents, she did.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.440
Now, I could sit up here and
tell you that I was born again,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.220
I saw the light, prison
rehabilitated me.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.550
But the truth is
God gave me a wife.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.650
She gave me three
beautiful children.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.190
She gave me a family.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.800
And she changed my
life, she and she alone.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.190
Everything I have, everything
I've achieved, who I am today

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.440
is because of the
love of a woman.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.810
And the respect three
boys have for their father

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.900
is something I would
never ever jeopardize.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.480
There comes a time in all of
our lifetime, we grow older.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.370
And eventually, if
we're fortunate enough,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.870
we have children.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.910
And as every parent knows,
whether your child's

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.240
three months old
or 38 years old,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.070
when you lay ahead
on a pillow at night,

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.020
you're just about
to close your eyes,

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.440
the last thing you think about,
the last thing you worry about

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.040
are your children.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.170
So if you still
have your mother,

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.250
you still have your father,
you give them a hug.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.700
You give them a kiss.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.502
You tell them you love
them while you can.

00:26:59.502 --> 00:27:01.710
And to those men in the
audience, both young and old,

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.470
I would remind you what it
truly is to actually be a man.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.500
It has absolutely nothing to
do with money, achievements,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.740
skills, accomplishments,
degrees, professions,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.410
positions.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.920
A real man loves his wife.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.550
A real man is
faithful to his wife.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.360
And real men, next to
God and his country,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.700
put his wife and his children
as the most important thing

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.110
in his life.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.120
Steven Spielberg made
a wonderful film.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.180
But I've done nothing greater,
nothing more rewarding, nothing

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.100
more worthwhile,
nothing that's actually

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.160
brought me more peace, more joy,
more happiness, more content

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.930
in my life than simply being
a good husband, a good father,

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.880
and what I strive to be
every day of my life--

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.870
a great daddy.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.953
God bless you, and thanks
for coming this morning.

00:27:50.953 --> 00:27:51.498
Thank you.

00:27:51.498 --> 00:27:54.421
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:54.921 --> 00:27:55.899
Thank you.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.590
We have a bunch of questions
both from the audience as well

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.790
as some people that sent in.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:08.135
So we'll take some questions
I'll be happy to answer.

00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:10.010
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice for Googlers

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:15.170
who are feeling imposter
syndrome, the insecure feeling

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.980
that they're not nearly
as good at their job

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.930
as their colleagues
believe they are?

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.510
And how did you stay
confident, or did you,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.006
when you knew where
you were an imposter?

00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:29.150
FRANK ABAGNALE: You know,
people always say to me,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.170
you know, you were brilliant.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:30.980
You were a genius.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.720
No, I was an adolescent.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.000
And that was why
I was successful.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.330
I was so young that I had
no fear of being caught.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.870
I was so young that I didn't
think about consequences.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.930
Everything I did was
not premeditated.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.570
Everything was done by
opportunity or by chance.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.120
So if, in fact, I
was standing out

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.910
in front of a bank in
Manhattan with a $500 check,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.330
there was never a plan.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.040
I didn't say to myself, I'm
going in, cash this check.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.080
If they say this, I'll do this.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.720
If they do this, I'll do that.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.620
I just went in and did it.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.170
And I felt that there was
nothing I couldn't do.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.170
I had tremendous
confidence in myself.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.820
But everything was for a reason.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.570
So I saw that airline crew.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.510
I never dreamed about
getting on planes

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.610
or staying in hotels
around the world for free.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.680
All I saw was a uniform
and said to myself,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.280
if I had that uniform on,
and I walked in a bank,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.400
it would be a lot easier to
cash a check than me walking in

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.850
as just some young kid.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.970
So the whole thing was to
get a uniform and do that.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.610
But then I quickly
realized the power

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.220
of that uniform, how it
turned from night to day.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.900
No one ever said
no when I walked

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.882
in to cash a check, even though
there was no bank account there

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:39.590
or anything else.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.120
All they saw was the uniform.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.800
They didn't see me.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.010
And I realized very early on
the power of that uniform.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.070
And then I realized I'd
gone to the TWA ticket

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.230
counter just like he
showed in the movie.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.510
I was going to purchase
an airline ticket.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.150
And the ticket agent said to
me, "Are you riding for free,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.770
or are you buying the ticket?"

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.290
And I said, riding for free?

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.890
"Yeah, you on the jumpseat?"

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.550
And I learned
about the jumpseat.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.340
So then I flew around
the world for free.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.190
Everything I did,
I did by chance.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.570
I moved into an apartment
complex in Atlanta.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.420
I said I was a doctor
because I didn't want

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.860
to write down airline pilot.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.530
They were looking for me
with that airline pilot.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.240
So I said I was a doctor.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.420
I said pediatrician because
it was a singles complex,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.670
and there were only single
people living there.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.337
And then I met a
doctor who lived there.

00:30:24.337 --> 00:30:25.961
And then he took me
up to the hospital.

00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:26.820
And I met people.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.610
So I ended up at the hospital.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.100
I dated a flight attendant
whose father was the attorney

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.660
general in Louisiana.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.607
I told her that I had
gone to law school,

00:30:34.607 --> 00:30:35.690
but I never practiced law.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.040
Instead, I wanted to be a pilot.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.140
And I got furloughed
from the airline.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.349
So she introduced me to her dad.

00:30:41.349 --> 00:30:42.140
And I went to work.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.630
Everything was all these
opportunities, but always

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.020
the confidence that
I could pull it off.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.010
And that became just from age.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.610
But if you believe that you're
good at what you do, and you

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.441
strive to be good
at what you do,

00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:56.690
you don't need to worry about
what other people think.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.220
You need to be
able to understand

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.720
that you have your
own confidence

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.780
that you can do whatever it
is you're required to do.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.330
And other people will see
that confidence in you.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.820
The minute you start
doubting yourself,

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.060
other people will see that
you are doubting yourself.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.454
And that becomes a weakness
in your personality.

00:31:13.454 --> 00:31:15.620
So you always want you to
be confident in everything

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.720
you do that you can do it.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.553
You can get it done.

00:31:17.553 --> 00:31:20.509
You'll find a way
to get it done.

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:22.800
AUDIENCE: Obviously, technology
has evolved quite a bit

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.290
since you were going
around, things like that.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.360
Would somebody be able
to accomplish something

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.529
similar today, even with all
of the technical advances?

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:32.820
FRANK ABAGNALE: Yeah, you
know, I get asked that a lot.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.810
Actually, it's, sorry to say,
but 4,000 times easier today

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.910
than when I did it.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.880
Technology breeds crime.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.110
It always has, and
it always will.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.230
And there will always be people
willing to use technology

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.870
in a self-serving way.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.670
So you know, I always
use the example

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.650
that when I used
to forge checks,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.480
I needed a Heidelberg
printing press.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.360
It took me about 12 months
to learn that press.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.110
That was $1 million
printing press.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.830
It was 90 feet
long, 18 feet high.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.500
It required three journeymen
operators to operate it.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.500
So I built scaffoldings on
either sides of the press

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.480
so I could eliminate
the other two positions.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.340
And because I was
a teenager, I was

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.440
able to run the
length of that press.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.085
But there were
color separations.

00:32:15.085 --> 00:32:15.960
There were negatives.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.710
There were chemicals
you had to work with.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.130
There were plates
you had to make.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.330
There was typesetting involved.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:25.050
Today, one just opens
a laptop and decides

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.840
to forge a counterfeited check.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.220
They first bring up
a diagram of a check

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.680
with a little security
background in it.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.462
And then they go and
look on whose check

00:32:33.462 --> 00:32:34.420
they're going to forge.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.200
So if I'm going to forge,
for example, Intuit's check,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.410
I go to their company's
website, capture their logo,

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.350
and put it up on the corner
of the left top of the check.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.280
I put in their
corporate address.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.910
I might put some stuff in the
background, step and repeat

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.130
patterns or whatever
it is I'm designing.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.550
And in 15 minutes, I have a
four color, beautiful check,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.330
prettier than the real check
they use, up on my website.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.770
Now in the old days,
you would've said to me,

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.610
you know, this check
you printed for Pan Am?

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.670
I have to admit,
it's pretty awesome.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.280
It's amazing, four
color, it looks terrific.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.640
But let me ask you this.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.280
How do you know
where Pan Am banks?

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.600
I have no idea where they bank.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.610
So I'm just making
up a bank's name.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.860
Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan
Chase Plaza, New York,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.670
New York.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.470
How do you know the
account number is?

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.650
No idea, I'm just making
up a bunch of numbers.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.649
How do you know who the
authorized signer is?

00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:25.190
I don't know.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.270
I'm just signing
somebody as Joe Black,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.010
whatever name on a check.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.870
But we live in a way-too-much
information world today.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.980
So once I forge Intuit's
check, every forger

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.124
calls their victim twice.

00:33:38.124 --> 00:33:39.540
Because every
forger will tell you

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.300
a victim will tell me
everything I need to know.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.240
So when he calls, he
would have simply said,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.440
"Like to speak to someone
in accounts receivables."

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:46.940
"Sure.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.560
One moment."

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.990
"Accounts receivables,
can I help you?"

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.365
"Yeah, I was getting ready to
pay an invoice you sent us.

00:33:51.365 --> 00:33:53.220
But we prefer to
wire you the funds.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.790
Just needed wiring
instructions."

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.320
"Yes, sir.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.640
We bank with Bank of America.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.760
Our account number is 176853."

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.149
They tell you
right on the phone.

00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:02.940
You can call any company
and just tell them

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.870
you're going to wire them money.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.010
They're going to tell
you where they bank,

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.646
on what street, their
account number--

00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:07.770
what you need on the check.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.060
So I captured the bank's
logo, I put it on the check.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.090
I put the MICR line
down on the bottom.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.448
And I hang up and call back.

00:34:13.448 --> 00:34:14.989
"Intuit Corporation,
can I help you?"

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.405
Yeah, I'd like to
speak to someone

00:34:16.405 --> 00:34:18.420
in your corporate
communications.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.368
"Sure, one moment."

00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:21.159
"Corporate communications,
can I help you?"

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.310
Yeah, I wondered if you'd
be so kind as to mail me

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.070
a copy of your annual report.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.670
"Sure, I'll send
you one out today.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.560
On page three is a
signature of the chairman

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.230
of the board, the CEO,
the CFO, the treasurer.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.850
White glossy paper, black ink.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:33.480
Camera ready.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.560
All right, scan it, digitize
it, put it on the check.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.710
The technology has made
it much, much easier.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.442
And when we talk about IDs,
making an airline ID today

00:34:42.442 --> 00:34:44.400
would be very simple with
the technology that's

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.540
available today.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.199
So all of those things
are a lot easier.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.540
As I used to say, it would
be a little more difficult

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.636
for me to get on an aircraft
today posing as a pilot.

00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:56.010
But if you ever
go to the airport

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.810
and watch the crews go
through the airport,

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.030
they just simply hold
up a card, and they

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.410
go through the airport.

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:05.160
Anyone could make that card with
today's software and technology

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.420
that's available to anybody.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.330
So yeah, technology has
certainly made it a lot easier.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.690
So that's why we are
constantly making technology

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.637
to counter the use of
technology by criminals

00:35:15.637 --> 00:35:17.220
and to make it more
difficult for them

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.940
to convert that technology
into a negative idea.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.380
AUDIENCE: In your
candid opinion,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.855
did Leonardo DiCaprio and
Tom Hanks do justice to your

00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:30.482
and Joseph Shea's respective
roles in the movie?

00:35:30.482 --> 00:35:32.940
FRANK ABAGNALE: Yeah, you know,
I'm not a big movie person.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.340
So I watch very
little television.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.830
This is most of
my life, not just

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.502
something I took
up even as a kid,

00:35:38.502 --> 00:35:39.960
I didn't watch a
lot of television.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.543
I don't watch a lot
of television now,

00:35:41.543 --> 00:35:44.430
and I certainly very
rarely go to movies.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.610
So when it was
announced that Leo

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.320
was the person picked
to play the part,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.330
I really knew nothing about him.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.730
My sons weren't too
happy that it was Leo.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.010
But I didn't know
anything about him.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.310
So I went to the movies and
saw "Street Gangs of New York."

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:01.740
And I said to myself
sitting there, how would

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.460
this person portray a
person 16 years old?

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.630
He had a beard.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.280
At the time he filmed that
movie, he was about 27,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.340
28 years old.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.710
I thought, no one's going
to believe this guy is 16.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.420
But because I never
saw the script,

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.880
I didn't know if maybe Spielberg
was making the character

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.160
a lot older and not a teenager.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.260
When the movie came out,
it was quite amazing

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.360
that Leo starts out in the
film at 14, then he's 16,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.660
then he's 18, then he's 21.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.700
He is an amazing
character actor.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.170
And he took the role,
and he did an amazing job

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.540
of playing the role.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.630
Tom Hanks' character was
actually named Joe Shea,

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.510
S-H-E-A. He was an
Irishman from Boston.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.610
Joe Shea was my
supervisor at the FBI

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.810
after I came out of prison.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.280
I answered directly to him.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.640
He and I were friends for
30 years until his death.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.440
I've written five
books on crime.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.300
The last book I wrote,
"Stealing Your Life,"

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.110
I dedicated that book to him
and our 30-year relationship.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.790
But he was an
Irishman from Boston,

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.710
which Tom Hanks-- he didn't
want his real name used.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.790
So Tom Hanks used the name
of an old football player

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.460
and took that name
Carl Hanratty.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.740
But if you were watching
the screen, for me,

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.060
it was like watching him.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.290
He looked like him.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.860
He sounded like him.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.290
He had his mannerisms.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.640
They did an amazing
job, both of them,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.550
in portraying the
parts of real people

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.695
that were still
living at that time.

00:37:21.695 --> 00:37:23.320
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, as a father,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.495
your statement was
just got me tearing.

00:37:25.495 --> 00:37:27.370
So I'm not gonna ask
you anything about that.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.830
I'm gonna ask totally
practical with the Equifax

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.050
hacks and the Anthem hacks
that everyone in this room

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.020
has been probably affected
by one or the other,

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.100
is there anything we can do as
citizens to protect ourselves?

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.660
Or is it a lost cause?

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.690
FRANK ABAGNALE: No, I'll
tell you what to do.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.120
But let me explain this to you.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.270
That is where-- when I went
to the FBI 41 years ago,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.060
I worked undercover for
a long period of time.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.800
Then I went into
the field and dealt

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.500
with counterfeits and forgeries,
embezzlement, financial crimes.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.720
In the last 20 years, I've dealt
with only cyber-related crimes.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.880
So I spend most of my
time with breeches.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.780
I have worked every breech
back to TJ Maxx 15 years ago.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.430
And this is what I've learned.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.300
First of all, every
single breach--

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.290
every breach occurs because
somebody in that company

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.100
did something they
weren't supposed to do,

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.930
or somebody in
that company failed

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.050
to do something they
were supposed to do.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.470
Hackers do not cause breaches.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.300
People do.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.440
And every breach
comes down to that.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.290
So in the case of
Equifax, they didn't

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.670
update their infrastructure.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.470
That didn't fix the patches
they should've put in place.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.170
There were very negligent
in what they were doing.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.500
So the hacker waited
for the door to open.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.960
So when you interview a hacker,
the hacker will say to you,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.589
look, I can't get
into Chase Bank.

00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:47.130
The truth is they spend about
a half a billion dollars a year

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.120
on technology.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.015
Every 12 months, they spend
a half a billion dollars

00:38:51.015 --> 00:38:53.940
of their profit on putting
technology and software

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.340
in their bank to keep me out.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.870
However, they employ
200,000 people worldwide.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.260
All I have to do is wait
for one of those people

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.120
to do something they
weren't supposed to do

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.820
or failed to do what
they were supposed to do.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.960
And that'll open the
door for me to get in.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.060
When you steal
credit card numbers

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.630
like Home Depot,
Target, TJ Maxx, that's

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.130
stealing credit cards and
debit card information,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.470
that has a very short,
short shelf life.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.180
So you have to get rid
of it very, very quickly.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.540
But if I steal your name,
your social security

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.330
number, and your date of birth,
you can't change your name.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.390
You can't change your
social security number.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.580
You can't change
your date of birth.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.480
So those people warehouse that
data for two to three years.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.710
So we won't even see that
surface for at least a couple

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.230
of years before some of
that will start to surface,

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.120
the data that was stolen.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.590
Whatever number
they start with--

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.250
I think it was 143 million,
then it became 146 million.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.530
It was a million
drivers licenses, now

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.100
it's 10.6 million
drivers licenses.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.600
Are all breaches start
with very low numbers

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.730
before they let you know
the actual true numbers.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.690
So it's probably about 240
million pieces of information

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.130
that were stolen.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.830
But I remind people all
the time that they're

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.420
going to warehouse that data.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.655
So buying one-year credit
monitoring services

00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:16.920
is absolutely worthless
because nothing's

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.480
going to happen in a year.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.360
And if you really
analyze Equifax,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.171
they were very unethical
in what they did.

00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:25.920
They thought to
themselves-- first of all,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.550
they sold a bunch
of stock knowing

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:28.800
that it was going to come out.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.859
That was worse.

00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:31.650
But then they sat there
and said, how do we

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.910
make a profit from this?

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.993
It was our mistake, but
how do we turn this around

00:40:34.993 --> 00:40:36.420
into a profit?

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.010
So they sat there
and said, what we'll

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.860
do is we'll offer millions
and millions of people

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.070
one-year credit monitoring
service for free.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.180
They'll sign up.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.860
And in a year from
now, we'll simply

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.350
say that data hasn't
really surfaced yet.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.000
You need to be
enrolled automatically

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.864
into our program,
which is $20 a month.

00:40:52.864 --> 00:40:54.780
So they're going to make
millions and millions

00:40:54.780 --> 00:41:00.090
of dollars with automatic
enrollment into their program.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.570
If you've been a
subject of that breach,

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.630
there's only two things you
can do, and two things only.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.240
One, you can freeze your credit.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.890
Each state varies about that.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.500
So some states, freezing
your credit is free.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.770
Other states, there's a fee
associated with it, typically

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.100
$10 to freeze it,
$18 to unfreeze,

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.780
$10 to freeze it again.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.680
So for the last two years,
I've testified before Congress.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.990
And you go to my
website at abagnale.com.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.300
You'll see me testifying
before Congress telling them

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.200
that they need to put a federal
law across the 50 states that

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.000
allow anyone to freeze
their credit at any time

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.880
and unfreeze it at any time.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.410
There should be no
reason that there

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.750
should be a fee associated
with it because then

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.840
that becomes a deterrent
to people actually

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.310
freezing their credit.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.560
So you can freeze your credit.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.726
That's one thing you can do.

00:41:50.726 --> 00:41:53.370
And then you unfreeze
it if you need it,

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.270
if it's not too
much of a hassle.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.510
Then the only other thing
is to monitor your credit.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.750
So I've used a credit
monitoring service since 1992.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.110
So for about 25 years,
I've been using a service.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.470
I think they charge
me like $12 a month.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.860
The reason I like it, I
can monitor my own credit.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.820
I don't need them.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.830
All they've given
me for that $12

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.890
is the ability to go on my
keyboard in a few strokes

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.100
and bring up my credit reports
instantly on my screen.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.100
And up on my screen
comes all three reports--

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.560
Equifax, Experian, TransUnion.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.350
At the top is my score for
the moment of that day,

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.230
what my credit score is
at those three agencies.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.744
Then I can scroll down
and look at my credit.

00:42:33.744 --> 00:42:35.160
And I can say to
myself, you know,

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.080
I paid this car off
like four months ago.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.500
They still show that I
owe money to this bank.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.130
I'll correct that.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.830
And I can go all the way
down and see every inquiry

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.000
made on my credit.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.610
That's what we call
hard and soft inquiries.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.440
And that's your
employer checking

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.507
your credit, the IRS
checking your credit,

00:42:51.507 --> 00:42:53.340
your insurance company
checking your credit,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.530
or a credit card
you applied for,

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.120
and they're checking
your credit.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.740
So I really don't need them.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.931
But for a fee, they're also
monitoring my credit as well.

00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:04.680
So they're checking
my credit, and they're

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.810
letting me know in real
time if someone attempts

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.420
to use my social security
number to get a job,

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.100
open a bank account, or
whatever the case may be.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.390
So to me, it's worth using that.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:19.360
Now, one other tip I'll give
you is I don't own a debit card.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.560
I've never owned one.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.160
I've never allowed my
three sons to possess one.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.880
Certainly and truly the
worst financial tool

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.100
ever given to the
American consumer.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.010
So a long time ago, I asked
myself a simple question.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:39.170
How would I remove 99.9% of my
personal liability like that?

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.080
Because I really don't want to
worry about all these things.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.870
So I use the safest
form of payment

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.790
that exists on the
face of the earth.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.520
And that is a credit card.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.760
Credit card-- Visa,
MasterCard, American Express,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.020
Discover card.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.740
Not debit-credit,
but credit card.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.200
Every day of my life,
I spend their money.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.164
I don't spend my money.

00:44:01.164 --> 00:44:02.830
My money sits in a
money market account.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:03.520
It earns interest.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.645
Actually, nobody knows
where it is because it's not

00:44:05.645 --> 00:44:07.270
exposed to anybody to find it.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.560
It's just sitting there.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.570
I go to the dry cleaner,
I give them my card.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.580
I pick up the groceries,
I give them my card.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.160
I put fuel in my boat on
the weekend, I use my card.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.980
I pay the marina to keep my
boat in the water all year long,

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.350
they put the rent
on my credit card.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.180
I travel all over the world.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.700
While I wait to get reimbursed,
I use my credit card.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.610
If I need euros, I go to the ATM
machine, I use my credit card.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:31.660
I'm not going to use my debit
card to get euros overseas

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.180
or a pounds in Great Britain.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.860
And every day, I use my card.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.740
And then if I pay the bill
in full or part of the bill,

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.300
my credit score goes up.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.720
So I'm building credit while
I'm using that credit card.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.610
And if tomorrow-- and
I'll do everything

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.910
to protect my information--
but if tomorrow someone gets

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:55.090
my card number and charges
$1 million on my credit card,

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.540
by federal law, my
liability is zero.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.170
I have no liability.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.230
So yes, I love to shop online.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:03.580
I don't use a special card.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.110
I just use my credit card.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.120
If they don't deliver
the merchandise,

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.130
if they deliver it
and it's broken,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.100
if the host site I went to
was fictitious to begin with,

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.874
I have zero liability.

00:45:14.874 --> 00:45:17.290
When you use your debit card,
every time you reach for it,

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.180
you're exposing the
money in your account.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.640
The only person who's
going to get robbed is you.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.050
When you use your
debit card, you

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.790
could use it for the next
50 years 20 times a day,

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.510
you will not raise your
credit score by that much.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.810
And of course, when you
use your debit card,

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:34.550
you are liable up
to a certain amount.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.660
And it takes a while in order
to get that debit card fixed.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.770
So when we do post
investigations at breaches,

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.284
and we say to someone on
your incident, what happened?

00:45:43.284 --> 00:45:44.200
Well, I was in Target.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.670
But I used a Visa card.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.530
So I don't know, nothing.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.940
They canceled my
card the next day.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.206
Two days later, FedEx
sent me a new card.

00:45:52.206 --> 00:45:53.830
And that was the last
I heard about it.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.950
What about you?

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.330
And I used a debit card there.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.080
They took $3,000 out
of my checking account.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.120
It took me two months
to get my money back

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.890
while they said they
were investigating.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.770
I had to pay my rent, had
kids' tuition, everything.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.380
I couldn't pay it because
they had my money.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.230
So I do it for that.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.105
So I had three sons that
went off to college.

00:46:11.105 --> 00:46:13.780
And I said to them, I'm not
giving you a debit card.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.420
I've actually applied for
a credit card in your name.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.256
So it's your card.

00:46:17.256 --> 00:46:18.130
Of course, you're 18.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.150
You have no credit.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.010
So I guarantee the card.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.130
So as a guarantee-er of the
card, three things take place.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.372
One, the bill comes to me, and
I'm responsible for the bill.

00:46:27.372 --> 00:46:29.080
So if you spend a lot
of time in the bar,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.370
I'm going to know that.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.950
Two, I set the
limit on the card.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.290
So whatever I want you to
spend each month while you're

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.390
at school, I'll set that limit.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:41.060
Third, every month that I pay
the bill goes on your credit.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.730
So by the time you
get out of college,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:45.340
you should be looking at a
credit score of about 800.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.796
You want to buy a car,
buy a house, buy a condo?

00:46:47.796 --> 00:46:49.420
You're not going to
need me to do that.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.870
All three of my sons came
out of college with scores

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.272
up around 800.

00:46:54.272 --> 00:46:56.230
One of the best things
you can do for your kids

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:00.100
is to teach them to learn
to use credit early on

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.110
and build credit in their name.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.694
Credit is a very
important thing.

00:47:03.694 --> 00:47:05.860
30 years ago, it only meant
whether you got the car,

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.550
you got the house.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.300
Today, everything is
based on your credit.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.774
If a company hires you, they're
going to check your credit.

00:47:10.774 --> 00:47:12.190
If you buy auto
insurance, they're

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.090
going to check your credit.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.060
If you buy life
insurance, they're

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.460
going to check your credit.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.110
Everything is based
on your credit.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.340
So you want to make sure that
you maintain good credit.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.450
It's one of the best things
you can do with your kids.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:24.414
Question?

00:47:24.414 --> 00:47:25.830
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask you more

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.889
about the FBI specifically,
and kind of hiring

00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:30.930
and how you got in there.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:32.402
It is such an interesting story.

00:47:32.402 --> 00:47:34.110
You know, when I was
younger I was really

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.210
interested in
working for the FBI,

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.060
worked in fraud and security.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.430
If my boss is watching, I'm
very happy where I am right now.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:47.130
But I couldn't believe how
difficult it was to try and get

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.060
into public service.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.620
I thought, you know, there's--

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.149
I was willing to take a pay cut.

00:47:51.149 --> 00:47:52.440
I was willing to move anywhere.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.220
I was willing to do anything.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.200
And it was difficult.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.116
I mean, I was in touch
with people at the FBI.

00:47:57.116 --> 00:47:59.130
And they were super
nice and very helpful.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.400
But I just couldn't believe
the background checks,

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.030
and there's no available jobs,
and you have to keep e-mailing,

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.979
and oh, you don't
have a law degree?

00:48:07.979 --> 00:48:09.270
Oh, that's not going to matter.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.530
And you know, again, I
ended up in a great spot.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.190
So I'm happy.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.240
But when people asked me about
public service and working

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.909
for these organizations, I
really don't have an answer.

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:19.950
FRANK ABAGNALE: Yeah, the
FBI is extremely tough.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:25.110
We have about 13,000 agents
and about 25,000 support people

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:29.410
who support the agents, analysts
and things of that nature.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.600
Currently, we take one in
every 10,000 applicants

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.800
to be an agent.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.440
So it is extremely
difficult to get in the FBI.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.990
So just to share
the story with you,

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.840
my oldest boy, when
he was about 14,

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.960
I used to take my kids
to the FBI Academy, which

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.630
is on a marine military
base in Quantico, Virginia

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.520
because they like to
shoot guns on the range,

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.811
and I would take them up there.

00:48:51.811 --> 00:48:53.460
When I was teaching
class, they would

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.850
be out there with the instructor
shooting on the range.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:59.790
And I remember
distinctly coming back

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.740
off the base, which takes
you about 20 minutes

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.077
to get from the Academy
off to the base.

00:49:04.077 --> 00:49:06.410
And when we were riding through
the base, he said to me,

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.550
you know, dad, this
is what I want to do.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.417
I want to become an FBI agent.

00:49:10.417 --> 00:49:11.750
I said, well, that's great, son.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.700
But keep that in mind.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.270
And so he graduated
from high school.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.965
He said to me, I really
want to become a FBI agent.

00:49:17.965 --> 00:49:18.840
I said, that's great.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.280
Now you gotta go to college.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.320
So he went to school at
University of Kansas,

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.400
got his undergraduate.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.790
I always thought
he'd change his mind.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.920
My wife always had
a Christmas party

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.350
for all the agents in Tulsa.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.090
We had about 200 FBI
agents in the state.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.400
And every Christmas,
they would be at our home

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.600
with their family.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.490
And he would go
talk to all of them.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:40.380
And the Special
Agent in charge who's

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.440
in charge of the entire state,
he would say to him, yeah,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.970
my son tried to get in.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.530
But they turned him down.

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.724
And he explained to
him that senator's sons

00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:50.640
have been turned down.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.130
Former presidents' sons
have been turned down.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.040
It has nothing to do with
anything other than you.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.412
And I kept emphasizing
that to him.

00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:00.120
But I kept thinking
he'd change his mind.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.078
So when he graduated from
undergraduate school,

00:50:02.078 --> 00:50:04.824
I said, son, I would recommend
you go to law school.

00:50:04.824 --> 00:50:06.240
"I have no desire
to be a lawyer."

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.114
I said, I understand.

00:50:07.114 --> 00:50:09.720
But if you really want
to pursue the FBI,

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.760
that would put you
up a little higher

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.330
and your chances of getting in.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.760
He went to Loyola School of Law.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.170
He graduated from law school.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.040
The Bureau requires
you pass the bar.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.374
So he took the bar in
Illinois, passed the bar.

00:50:20.374 --> 00:50:22.290
And then he went through
the year-long process

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.740
of the process it takes
to apply to the Bureau.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.560
And I got very worried
because I'd say to my wife

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.450
that, you know, I'm a little
concerned because first of all,

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.090
I don't know if
someone in management

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.510
would like the fact that
my son is an FBI agent.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.670
Or maybe someone in
management would look at it

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.890
and say, his dad has
done so much for them,

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.320
we need to look at his son.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.570
It had absolutely
nothing to do with that.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:47.790
It was all about him.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:51.300
And I always tell him every day
he's living his life's dream.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.280
So he got in.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.330
But it is very, very tough.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.800
So when the Bureau came to me--
and they just a few years ago

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.450
celebrated their
100th anniversary.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.010
They did a big
coffee table book,

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.160
and they talk about me in there
as being the only person they

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.814
ever did that with.

00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:09.480
The whole thing to
the Bureau back then,

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.170
the director was
Clarence Kelley,

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.590
who was the Director of
the Bureau at that time.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:17.820
He wanted the ability because
he could say to me, OK,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.310
you are a lieutenant
in the Army.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.860
You have been in the
Army this many years.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.380
Your expertise is this missile.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.750
I need you to learn all
of this in two weeks,

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.870
and I'm sending
you to this base.

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:31.620
And I want you to find
out what's going on

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.570
in this particular area.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.490
He knew that no matter
what assignment he

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.410
gave me under cover,
I could go do it,

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:40.110
whether it was a scientist
at a lab in New Mexico,

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:42.330
whether it was a
doctor in a hospital,

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:43.950
he knew that I could
get away with it,

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:47.880
make people believe that I was
that person without any doubt.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.180
And that's how they used me.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.520
I think that was
their initial thing.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.190
And then, of course, when
my time was up-- and again,

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:58.230
keep in mind that when
I got that offer, to me,

00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.640
it was just an opportunity.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.140
I looked at it, well,
opportunity to get out of jail.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.140
I am not going to
sit here and tell you

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.240
I was a changed person, that
I was a different person

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.556
than when I went into prison.

00:52:08.556 --> 00:52:09.930
I just saw that
as an opportunity

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:10.830
to get out of prison.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.480
So I was going to do it.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.780
But then you get involved with
the men and women of the FBI

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.750
who obviously are probably the
most ethical people you'll ever

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.870
meet in your life.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.870
They have tremendous
character, love of country,

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.160
love of family.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.090
That kind of wears off on you.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:28.900
And I started to realize
that I met my wife,

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.320
and I was becoming a husband.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.730
I take care of my wife, I take
care of children, fatherhood.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.010
All those things is what
really changed my life.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.350
Wasn't that I was
rehabilitated or--

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:39.620
those things changed my life.

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.080
So it started out more
as an opportunity.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.140
So when my time was
over, and the court said

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.540
his court order
ceases to be, he's

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.550
free to do whatever
he wants to do,

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.560
I made the choice
to stay there only

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.790
because I thought that I could
bring a lot to the Bureau.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.780
So the Bureau was very smart.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.480
They realized very
early on that I

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.949
wouldn't be accepted very well.

00:52:59.949 --> 00:53:01.990
And so there was a great
scene in the movie where

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:06.310
Steven Spielberg obviously
knew that I was very, very

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.924
difficult for the agents.

00:53:07.924 --> 00:53:09.340
Keep in mind now
this is back when

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.130
there were no women agents,
no blacks, no Hispanics.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.170
Everybody was a white
agent, and they either

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.990
graduated from Harvard, or
they graduated from Yale.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.690
And they all came from
very good families.

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.490
And it was a totally different
environment 40 years ago.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.430
So they all had
really tunnel vision--

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.230
once a criminal,
always a criminal.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.630
So they were not very,
very happy with the fact

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.070
that I came there.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.960
So he showed that
scene of me walking

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.770
in the office and the
way people looked at me.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:37.660
That took years for me
to turn that around.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.340
Took years for me to
build their credibility.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.310
And of course, in the
first part of my career,

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:43.420
I was out in the field.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.530
I was undercover.

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.540
So they really weren't
dealing with me.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.400
So when I finished
working under cover,

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.280
the director then simply
said, you know what?

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.650
He needs to go to the
Academy and teach class

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:56.950
so that every agent who
comes to the Academy,

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:00.220
he will be their instructor
in one of their courses.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.570
And they will all know him.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:04.930
So I've taught at the Academy
now for well over 35 years.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.390
I taught my son when I
went through the Academy.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.110
Three generations of agents.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:11.170
And that helped a great
deal because they learned

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.260
who I was early
on, knew who I was,

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.650
and that changed a lot of that.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.680
But it took a lot of work to
turn that around and build

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.687
that credibility.

00:54:19.687 --> 00:54:21.520
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
to know whether or not

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.750
you continued to fly even after
you were released from jail

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:29.120
and working at the Bureau
as the movie suggests,

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.120
or if that was a bit of
Hollywood embellishment.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.245
FRANK ABAGNALE: Now, you
know, when people ask me--

00:54:33.245 --> 00:54:35.470
and I saw the movie
in a movie theater.

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.120
I've only seen the movie twice.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.980
I've seen that
trailer 1,000 times,

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.020
but I've only seen
the movie twice.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.900
So when the media asked me
what I thought about the movie

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.779
and what was right
and what was wrong,

00:54:45.779 --> 00:54:47.320
I said, you know,
well, first of all,

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.910
I have two brothers
and a sister.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:51.880
He portrayed me
as an only child.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.634
In real life, my
mother never remarried.

00:54:53.634 --> 00:54:55.300
There's a scene in
the movie where she's

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.830
remarried as a little girl.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:58.990
That didn't really happen.

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:02.680
In the real life, I never saw
my father after I ran away.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.604
In the movie, they keep
having him come back

00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:06.145
to Christopher Walken
in the film who

00:55:06.145 --> 00:55:07.810
was nominated for
the Academy Award

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.780
for that role as my father.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.590
That didn't really happen.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.667
I escaped off the aircraft,
but I escaped off the aircraft

00:55:15.667 --> 00:55:18.250
through the kitchen galley where
they bring the food and stuff

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:19.000
onto the plane.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.691
And there they had me
escape through the toilet.

00:55:21.691 --> 00:55:23.440
And my wife kind of
looked at me and said,

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.700
you didn't go through
the toilet, did you?

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.491
I said, no, I didn't
go through the toilet.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.090
So I thought he stayed
very close to the story.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:34.690
But pretty much all of that--

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.820
he was very concerned about
being accurate, first of all,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.060
because it was the first
time he made a movie

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.130
about a real person living.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.310
Second, the Bureau had an
information officer on the set

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.160
for all the shooting
of the entire film

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.440
to make sure that what
he said about the FBI

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.210
and what comments they made
and all that was accurate.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:57.460
There was an agent from our
information office on the set.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.530
And then, of course,
as he later said,

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:01.210
"I really got most
of my information

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:03.340
from those three
retired agents."

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:08.310
Because he said their notes were
so particular and so accurate

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.130
he said that "when I filmed
the scene in the hotel room,

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.870
I had scripted it.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.350
And so we're sitting there, and
I said, read me your notes."

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:19.570
He said, "I entered the
room with my gun pulled.

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:21.520
I heard someone in the bathroom.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.800
I ordered them to come
out of the bathroom.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.240
And this is what happened."

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.190
He basically loved his notes
better than his script.

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.940
So he used his
notes for the film.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.780
So I thought he did a good
job of staying very, very

00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.120
accurate at the movie.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.060
I'll just make a
final comment to you

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.700
having to deal with cyber now.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.850
I like to write about
crimes in the future.

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.970
So I always used to
write to my class

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:49.400
about what will we investigate
five years from now.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.570
What will an agent be
doing five years from now?

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:56.230
And unfortunately, there's good
news, and there's bad news.

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.880
First of all, the
good news, we will

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.640
be doing away with passwords
in the next 24 months.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.690
Passwords will leave the world.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:04.750
There will be no more passwords.

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.270
There is a new technology
called Trusona.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:12.340
That's T-R-U-S-O-N-A.
Stands for true persona.

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.140
It is a company in
Scottsdale, Arizona

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.990
that created a
technology for the CIA

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.870
which we have used now
for the last few years.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.750
That technology--
and I was an adviser

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:24.940
on that technology for the CIA.

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.630
So I'm an advisor on bringing
it to the commercial world.

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.400
But it was the
ability for an agent

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.540
to send data back from the
field, such as Afghanistan,

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:39.970
on their iPhone, and that
Langley would know 100% that

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:42.880
is the agent on the
other end, to 100%

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.720
identify the person on the
other end of the device.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.730
That's the level four security.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.830
So they basically
said, what if we

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.560
brought this to
level two security,

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.002
and we did away with passwords?

00:57:56.002 --> 00:57:57.460
So immediately,
when they announced

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:01.210
that, Microsoft gave them
$10 million and said, I'm in.

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:01.816
Develop it.

00:58:01.816 --> 00:58:03.190
So Microsoft is
going to use that

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:04.750
on all their gaming,
all their access

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.430
to their computers, et cetera.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:09.490
We now have the
ability to identify

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.650
who the person is on the
other end of that device.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:15.010
And when you go to their
website at Trusona,

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:16.580
they actually show
you how it's done.

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.212
So they show you
demo videos there

00:58:18.212 --> 00:58:19.670
that are three or
four minutes long

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:21.220
that show you how it's done.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.050
And that's great.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.352
Passwords are stagnant.

00:58:24.352 --> 00:58:26.060
They should have been
gone long time ago.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.910
It's why we have most of the
problems that we have today.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.150
So it is very important that
we get rid of passwords.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.920
And just in case
you didn't know,

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.440
if we take a bank like
a Bank of America,

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.460
they spend about $6 million
a month in their call center

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.840
resetting passwords.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.950
Costs them $6 million a month.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.910
So that would save that
bank $100 million a year

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:48.070
to eliminate the
use of passwords.

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:49.764
So that's the good part of it.

00:58:49.764 --> 00:58:51.430
And I think that will
eventually do away

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:52.900
with social security numbers.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.060
You'll still have a
number assigned to you

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.480
for the government purpose.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.534
But when I go by a car,
I go to the doctor,

00:58:58.534 --> 00:58:59.950
I don't have to
give them a number

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.580
because they already know
who I am through my device.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.060
So I won't have to provide
a social security number.

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.800
So I think that's the good part.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.440
But I do believe that cyber,
up until this point in time,

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.200
has been used for financial
crimes or gathering

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.810
data and information
which is of value.

00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:20.530
What's going to happen is we're
going to see cyber very quickly

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.930
now turn very black.

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:26.500
So we have the ability,
as you know, to basically

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.590
shut someone's pacemaker off.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:30.520
But we have to be
within 35 feet of them.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:34.220
We test these device at
Quantico all the time.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.460
So as long as I walk up
within 35 feet of you,

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.550
I take control of any bodily
device you have on you.

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.380
So if I want to
assassinate you, I

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.500
want to speed it up, take
it down, I can do that.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.360
But I believe that
in five years,

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.350
you'll be able to do that
from 5,000 miles away.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:52.220
We have the ability
now that we test

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.310
that we can chase a car
down the interstate.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:56.740
We've got to get up within
35 feet of the vehicle.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.480
We take over the vehicle.

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.040
We shut the motor off.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.570
We lock the person in the car.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.190
We lock the power window
so they can't open them.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.220
We can turn on their airbag.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.110
Again, five years
from now, you'd

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:11.560
be able to do that
5,000 miles away.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.950
So yeah, so our electrical
grid uses as a terrorist tool.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:17.380
The ability to shut
down an entire system,

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.900
shut down an entire
banking system.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.240
Those are all the things
that, unfortunately, we'll

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.200
be dealing with in the next four
or five years as cyber starts

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.030
to make that turn to the
very black side of cyber,

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:33.320
not just about stealing
money, information, and data.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.190
And so that's why we're going
to have to work extra hard

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:39.770
to make sure that we go back
to protect our electrical grid.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.940
I always remind people
we have the technology

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.560
to prevent most
of these problems.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.130
But if you don't use
it, then it's worthless.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:51.200
And we tend to develop
a lot of things--

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.950
I just want to make
this emphasis to you--

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.530
we develop a lot of things
without following them through.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.229
So one thing I've
done in the government

01:00:58.229 --> 01:01:00.520
over the last several years,
if the government is going

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.270
to buy a technology, they send
me to the technology company

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:06.400
and say, try to defeat that.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.770
I just simply go there
and see their technology.

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:10.810
As one CEO says, he
plays chess with you.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.692
You tell him you did
this, this, and this.

01:01:12.692 --> 01:01:14.650
And then he tells you,
we have a weakness right

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:16.810
here because I would
come in and do this.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.860
So they build a wall up.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.200
And then he says, no, I
would still get in here

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.060
until he says he can't
do it any longer.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.270
Then we know we have
a good technology.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.120
But very rarely is--

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.020
and I did that with
Trusona when we did it

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.880
for the purpose of the CIA.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.660
But today-- and it
tells you on the website

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.220
that I advised on
their project and how

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.250
it came down to commercial use.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.264
But today, what we have
is we develop things.

01:01:42.264 --> 01:01:44.680
So we say to you, here's a
device you put in your kitchen,

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.846
and then you can talk to it.

01:01:45.846 --> 01:01:49.090
You ask what the weather
is, what's on TV tonight,

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:50.194
all of that.

01:01:50.194 --> 01:01:52.360
I could easily reverse that
and listen to everything

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.740
you say in your house.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.910
There are so many
weaknesses in your home.

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:59.530
Your security cameras are access
points, your remote control

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:02.320
on your TV, your
Samsung television,

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.190
your refrigerator that tells
you how much milk is in it.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:08.860
My thing is I really
don't need my refrigerator

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.350
to talk to my toaster.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.860
They've gotten along
for a long time

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.330
without ever having
a conversation.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.359
But what happens is
we develop something.

01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:17.650
We get really excited about it.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.450
"We gotta get this
to the marketplace."

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:22.690
And sure enough, we never
look at the negative side.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:26.320
All I try to say to technology
company, yeah, this is great.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.060
Now, can you take a
little time to just

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.420
say, how would someone
use this technology

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.930
in a negative, self-serving
way so that we build

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:37.240
the block to that
before we ever give it

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.180
to the public to use it?

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.960
We'd save a lot of problems.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.670
Been an absolute pleasure
spending the morning with you.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:43.840
Thank you very much for coming.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.715
It's been a pleasure.

01:02:44.715 --> 01:02:45.940
Thank you.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.840
Thank you.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.890
[APPLAUSE]
