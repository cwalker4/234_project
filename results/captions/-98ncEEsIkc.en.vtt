00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.529
&gt;&gt; VOICE OVER: in the past few years, road
tripping in camper vans has become a really

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.050
popular way to travel on a budget.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.849
Many people are also taking the trend one
step further by living in their vans full-time

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.180
to save money

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.740
and to enjoy the special freedom and flexibility
that a life on wheels can offer.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.420
While living and travelling in a van can be
a cheap lifestyle

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180
it’s certainly not free.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.620
We caught up with our friend Julien from Go-Van
to find out

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.860
how he’s turned his camper van into a mobile
home and office

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.400
so that he can earn money on 
the road.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.020

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.119
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: it was kind of a...combining the
really cool aspect of travelling

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.550
the best way of travelling, you know

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.440
and also to generate revenue at the same time.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
&gt;&gt; V.O.: Julien is an entrepreneur and video
producer from Montreal, Canada who lives and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.350
works in his van full-time.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.160
At 30, he sold his first business, an online
skateboarding magazine, and invested the money

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.780
he made in a condo

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.020
but he still preferred to travel in his 1989
GMC Vandura camper van

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.729
looking for adventure and good surf.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.550
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: I really, really, really loved
that van.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.460
It was kind of loungy, you know, it was not
a full conversion van.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.320
So the interior was like...the lighting was
amazing

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.979
The blue velvet seats and everything.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.490
So that was perfect for awhile.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.060
&gt;&gt; V.O.: the freedom he experienced on his
trips in the van,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.300
and the people he met on the road

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.380
inspired him to start his second business:
the Go-Van website,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.310
where he shares road tripping stories from
fellow travellers, and videos about his travels.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.799
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: everyone I was meeting was so interesting
and I wanted to share everyone's stories.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.680
Their road tripping stories and travelling
stories.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.399
&gt;&gt; V.O.: to finance the Go-Van project, Julien
needed a business model

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.569
so he started creating video content for brands
and tourism bureaus while he travelled.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.400
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: the van is also my office.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
We film pretty much all summer.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.120
I don't film myself.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.440
I produce and direct.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.480
So the way I work is to invite videographers
with me to basically live the van life for

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
usually a week

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.060
and we just travel for the week together and
it's pretty much adventure style

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.910
Basically one guy is sharing the bed here
and some other guy is in a tent.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.790
We keep the gear inside here.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.340
That's why we need a van that allows us to
charge batteries and that is safe and that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.849
doesn't break down.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.430
&gt;&gt; V.O.: when he’s working on the website,
applying for contracts and planning his upcoming

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.880
video projects,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.800
his mobile office is very simple.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.720
He uses a cell phone to create a wifi hotspot
for his laptop,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.000
and he has a bag full of hard drives for
his video footage.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.050
To power his laptop and cell phone, he uses
the van's house batteries that are charged

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.490
by the van’s alternator, or by the solar
panels on the roof.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.280
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: this is super useful when you need
to recharge batteries and all the gear we

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.150
have when we film on the road

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.180
so that's a big improvement from my old van
for sure.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.960
With the inverter and all the power it can
generate from the van,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.459
this makes the van a super cool office.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.320
A super functional office.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.680
Every crew that comes with me, I'm trying
to make them feel like they're at home also

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680
in the van

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.530
so it creates a really fun moment for a week.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.940
Even if it's kind of hard sometimes.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.690
&gt;&gt; V.O.: one of his first video contracts
was for a Quebec-based camper van conversion

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.319
company in 2015.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.440
This led to a long-term partnership with them
that allows him to use one of their super

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.090
functional camper vans year-round.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.940
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: really, I have everything I need.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.819
I have a hydraulic rooftop which is pretty
cool so

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.709
I just press a button and the roof comes up.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.450
So that's awesome.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.349
There's windows all over so that's great when
you work by the river, or by the ocean.

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.789
Two fridges which are really great so you
can put a lot of food and not have to stop

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.590
every day by the grocery store.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.590
&gt;&gt; V.O.: now that he has all the comforts
of home on the road with him,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.640
like running water, a shower, and a kitchen,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.851
he’s been able to rent out his condo and
transition to living and working in the van

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:41.851
full-time.

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:46.650
&gt;&gt; JULIEN: it's hard to keep up with friends
and family.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.960
But besides that, it gets easier and easier
so that's why I don't see a lot of challenges

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.630
but obviously there's a few things here and
there

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.410
like showers

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.789
but after a little while it just becomes details,
you know?

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.461
I can work whenever I want and if the waves
are good I go surf and I come back and then

00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:10.610
I can work.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.120
It's Saturday today and I've been working
pretty much all day

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.060
but yesterday I've been swimming in the ocean
so I think that's why people love the van

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.570
life so much.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.430
Now that most of the assignments that we had
for the summer are pretty much done

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.940
I was thinking that I had to go back home
and I just decided this morning that

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.210
I don't need to go back home, home is here!

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.900
So I'll just move and continue to work from
the road.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.130
So basically that's the freedom that I love
about working from the road.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.930
It's a flexible way of travelling.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.090
