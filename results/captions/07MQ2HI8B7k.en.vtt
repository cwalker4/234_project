00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.100
Charlene Bollinger: Have you ever thought
of fasting as a method to heal your body?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.750
Why is it that fasting is mentioned over 40
times in the Bible?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.860
Our colleague and friend Dr. Edward Group,
founder of the Global Healing Center, and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.770
his team have dug into past documents and
have found extensive information on fasting.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.990
Ty Bollinger: Watch the upcoming video and
find out what they discovered about water

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.430
only fasting, which Dr. Group also calls the
most cost effective method of healing in the

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.430
entire world.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.710
Enjoy and be sure to watch all the way to
the end.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.719
Dr. Group: So, I actually hired a research
scientist to work with me all year long and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.670
to find all of the information they could
possibly find on fasting, trying to dig up

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.829
all those documents from the past and put
everything together and see.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.420
Because what I want to talk about is hardcore
fasting.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.120
I mean there’s a lot of talk about ketogenic
and juice fasting, and that’s all fine,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.850
but I’m like looking for what is a hardcore
method that’s been used for a long period

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.170
of time?

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.560
And I didn’t really know a lot about it,
or at least didn’t dig into the history

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.420
of it, but this guy worked all day long every
single day for almost a year with me to try

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.979
to pull up and find a lot of the information
that was out there.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.840
So, what I found I want to share with you
today, which is incredible because looking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.520
at some of these old doctors that have spent
years and years in the past with doing water

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.350
fasting protocols.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.909
This is a bold statement, but think about
if you could really eliminate disease for

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.520
$1.99 a day.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.560
That would be pretty cool.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.049
That’s how much a gallon of water costs,
right?

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.040
I mean if you think back at the benefits of
water, I mean how many times do we talk about

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
water?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.540
It’s weird that I’ve been doing all this
fasting all year, and then all of a sudden,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.130
Hurricane Harvey, I’m from Houston, comes
in and just goes “Here’s a bunch of water,”

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.610
that just goes “whoosh” and rinses everything
out and my house floods, and it’s just like

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.979
I’m going through this cleansing process
and then my environment gets cleansed with

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.040
water, too, which has actually been a great
experience.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.610
You don’t hear too many people saying that,
but it’s great to just kind of have a good

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.890
cleansing of your life every now and then.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.480
It just puts things into perspective in reality.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.500
And the more I study fasting, I’ve been
telling people, “Well, how would you like

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.760
to get $120,000 stem cell treatment for free?”

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.570
I mean your body is so powerful.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.040
Your body has the power to heal itself.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.680
I’ve always been talking about the self-healing
mechanism and how effective it is.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.030
And looking back at religious texts doing
research, I mean I think the Bible mentions

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.370
fasting over 40 times.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.730
And people didn’t have a lot of medicinal
herbs and different methods of healing themselves

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.220
a long time ago.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.379
So, I used to be one of those doctors that
had 400 different vitamin supplements in my

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.379
cabinet.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.349
And it’s weird, after 25 years, I’m coming
back to simplicity again.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.769
Like everything is in simplicity.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.930
Your body wants to heal itself and it’s
not really that hard to heal from any disease.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.150
And the abstinence of food really is the definition
of fasting.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.150
You know?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.330
There’s juice fasting, there’s intermittent
fasting.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.770
I like all of those.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:41.490
But water-only fasting is to me probably the
most cost-effective method of healing in the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.490
world.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.390
Dr. Group: So, fasting was God’s original
medicine.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.599
I mean if you look at the flood, Noah, all
that stuff, water, not only did people in

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.000
the past, whether it’s Egyptian, Ayurvedic,
every society fasts.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.580
But it was also a staple used for spiritual
reasons and purification.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.920
Everything’s about purification, you know?

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.920
If you’re pure.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.980
That’s why detoxing and cleansing always
works.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.189
And doctors that have been around for ages
will tell you that if the body’s pure, the

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.380
body’s healthy.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.830
And if you look back at some of the methods
years and years ago, what did they have?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.080
I mean all of this stuff that’s been created
recently with the food and all this other

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.430
stuff is damaging to us.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.240
But really, all they had was sunlight, water,
air, and rest.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.660
And that alone, the reason I don’t have
food in there is because food wasn’t a big

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.720
staple a long time ago because animals, when
they’re sick or they’re ill, they fast.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.780
And anybody who was sick a long time ago didn’t
really utilize a lot of food.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.720
So, we’re taught to eat several meals a
day.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.120
And the more that I started getting into this
and looking at this covert agenda between

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.860
the USDA and the FDA and the American Dietetic
Association, all these associations, big pharma,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.050
big agriculture, I mean there’s literally
been a covert agenda that’s been happening

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:29.070
for a long time to create fear in us that
if we don’t eat we will die.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.500
Not only that, but all the chemicals and all
the poisoning of the food and everything else.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.479
So, I kept asking myself “Why are so many
people scared of fasting?

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.639
Why are so many people scared not to eat?

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.140
Why do they think that something’s going
to happen to their body if they don’t eat?”

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.930
I started talking to people and asking them,
“I’m just going to starve.”

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.830
But all of this conditioning that’s been
done for years and years and years is what

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.220
we need to kind of get out of our mind.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.560
And then I was saying “Why aren’t doctors
using fasting?”

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.160
Well, first of all, they’re taught that
it’s dangerous, that you’re going to starve,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.699
that you’re going to have a mineral deficiency,
that you’re going to waste away, that you

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.410
need a bunch of protein in your system.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.910
And it really is kind of a dark secret of
the medical community, because if you look

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.010
at the past and how everything’s been structured
with those relationships with the food industry

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.009
and the big pharma industry, it’s all designed
really to keep us sick.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.470
It really all revolves around money.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.699
And that’s why.

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.230
Why are they going to teach fasting in medical
school?

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.710
Why are they going to teach you how you can
get rid of any disease, not like Down syndrome

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.530
and stuff, but any degenerative disease?

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.139
Because there’s no money in it.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.521
As I was working with my research scientist
trying to find documentation on fasting, one

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:06.139
thing led to another and led to another and
led to another, and it was really hard to

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.139
find stuff.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.050
I mean we know, because of all the research
and all the books on natural medicine from

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:18.539
the 1800s, even back to the 1600s, when you
look at Paracelsus and you look at Pythagoras,

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.000
who had made his students fast for 30 days
before he even accepted him as a student.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.449
It’s been going on for a long time.

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:33.870
But all of those books, all of those books
were pretty much taken and burned by the pharmaceutical

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.890
companies because they don’t want to give
you the information that you need so your

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.410
body can be healthy.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.490
Now let me tell you, it’s been amazing that
we’ve been able to track down some of these

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.349
old documents and some of these successes.

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:56.580
Some doctors that did over 100,000 supervised
water fasts.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:04.130
I’ve read so many case studies on water
fasting of what it can do to the body and

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.050
how fast the body regenerates.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.500
And I put some in here to share with you how
powerful it actually is.
