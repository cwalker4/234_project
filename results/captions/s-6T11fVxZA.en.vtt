00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.400
back in 2011 a florida Highway Patrol
trooper by the Madonna Jane walks

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.929
%uh stop AP speeding driver who was
going 120 miles per hour

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.340
well she was really surprised to find
that that person in the vehicle was so

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.059
many move

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.460
boss told Lopez buffalo has actually a
police officer with

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.830
the Miami Police Department so she
arrested him and the video footage

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.830
was awesome take a look think draw line
and commands

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.079
firing thought at the HP trooper pulls
over a Miami police officer

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.290
them 1st SEM Cox a.m.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.290
and courts him to her cruiser tho and
during all of this

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.079
the Miami officers sounds just as
shocked as she

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.680
is mad home I growing I cannot believe
this I cannot believe me and/or

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800
it began unbelievably just minutes
before with his police cruiser seen here

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.239
passing by the trooper like she's
standing still

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.479
fire play she chases him lights flashing

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.979
engines creamy on as she describes him
we need

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.030
in and out of lanes speeding up and
slowing down at speeds topping up 120

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.110
miles an hour

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.380
until both finally come to attend stop 4
minutes 57 seconds later

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.409
them but I would not mess with her

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.490
okay he's not playing man yeah not so
foster

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.000
hope how to end on a bad looking guy

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.100
anywhere you look up okay so Louis

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.720
at first she doesn't know if it's a
copper not shadows acknowledging the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.030
whole the cop car right right so so she
pulled them over Shishir I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.049
you know takes is bad not take batch
that leapt to his

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.909
I him losing his job right so as you
guys know usually cops look out for one

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:55.369
another

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.270
but in this case that did not happen it
made national headlines he lost his job

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.439
and other members of law enforcement
there were really upset about it so

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.790
the harassment begins and people start
harassing

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.540
the the for the trooper random telephone
calls on your cell phone

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.370
some were threatened summer prank calls
including orders for pizza unfamiliar

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.500
bill unfamiliar vehicles and police cars
at idling

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.120
in her call the sock she was afraid to
open her mailbox a number of certain

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.550
things were happening to her so she was
really worried about it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.270
and make you realize hey you know what I
get the sense

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.599
that cops are checking in on my driver's
license information you know they can

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
pull up that information because they're
cops that's why they know where she

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.090
lives

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.430
for my local art house will feel that
way I gather you're paranoid rather

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.959
people are going to check in on you and
then nope it all works in mysterious

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.739
cars in my call the sack

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.810
in this case not so much yeah

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.290
so she I decided to take a look and she
realize that in a three-month period

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.230
88 law enforcement officers from 25
different agencies accessed

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.480
%uh her driver's license information
more than two hundred times

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.690
turns out she was totally right she was
right to be paranoid

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.220
it seems like half the cops in South
Florida we're checking out

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.349
where she lives and obviously some of
them were totally harassing

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.930
now in 1994 there was a law passed a
federal law passed it's known as the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.959
federal driver Privacy Protection Act

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.819
and it prevents up call for anyone
looking up your private information

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.510
when there's absolutely no need to do so
in this case there is no need to do so

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.360
other than to try to harass or right

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.250
are if you are caught breaking this log
you can be fined

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.500
twenty-five hundred dollars now she is
suing

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.200
using that law as a reason to sue and if
she wins she can receive up to five

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.720
hundred thousand dollars

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.110
totally you agree with her okay now this
people now of course the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.290
the defending his lawyers defending the
other side

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.150
the same the government and say hey wait
a minute this is like if you look up

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.459
a summary driver license for profit it's
a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.090
Naruto it but it doesn't say that on the
law doesn't say only for profit like for

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.599
example if you look at the driver's
license to harass them at their house

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.110
yeah that's exactly without law should
cover so she deserves a pilot to those

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.450
laws

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.780
look if you have a TA cops looking to
harass you ever threaten you

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.829
know if a man that would be a good
reason to sue the government even if

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.729
you're a cop

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.060
hell yeah now the Department of Justice
is actually chimed in on this and they

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.160
said no no no no that defense is
ridiculous

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.710
on this law would protect her so she is
going to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.400
go ahead and file suit and I'm I'm glad
she's doing it i mean it's absolutely

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.639
ridiculous that they

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.490
use those resources just to go after it
harasser and by the way

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.340
nor should be driving a 120 miles per
hour on the highway that so unbelievably

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.979
unsafe

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.830
and I love that she actually did her job
she didn't look out for him because he's

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.360
a cop

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.210
and she did what she needed to do a
better way to say that it was speeding

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.330
because he was running late for his
off-duty job

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.180
get the world worst excuse I would never
look back ha point today

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.580
if there were just a regular person
going 120 miles per hour and use that as

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.530
an excuse would not be acceptable

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.050
now look I'll organizations courageous
NB

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.270
I she doesn't love those bullshit ruled
the cops are allowed the break

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.060
every law there is you're not allowed to
break it she actually Bassem on its

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.530
great

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.910
and by the way so what's happened to her
I she's been

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.430
reassigned to road patrol in Broward
County is that a dade county

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.590
she's been relocated and is no longer
driving a cruiser

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.680
so she's the worst the Highway Patrol
and they say she's fine overall

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.160
but they did take a job she was
obviously doing well

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.229
the way for power yeah and so does she
deserve the money for all the harassment

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.370
absolutely so you go you're 90 the rest
like observer

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.020
Foster and furious over this but they're
wrong

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.720
issues right
