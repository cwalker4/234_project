00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.390
From the lost identity of a Victorian monster
to a missing lover’s tomb, here are 8 unsolved

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.120
mysteries from history!!

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.360
8.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.140
Ark of the Covenant

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.289
The location of the Ark of the Covenant is
perhaps one of the greatest religious mysteries.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.710
You probably know it best from the Indiana
Jones movie, but for some, the Ark of the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.910
Covenant is all too real.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.450
Biblical accounts say that it was a large
gilded case made of wood made to house the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.660
stone tablets where the Ten Commandments were
written.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.460
It was described as a large chest that must
be carried by at least 2 people and it had

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
two large golden angels, so it would have
been hard to miss.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.890
Not only would it have been a valuable object
on its own, but the Ark is also linked to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.690
several miracles.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.350
This handsome object was the work of the Israelites,
who crafted it approximately 3,000 years ago.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.470
The Ark was carried toward the Promised Land
and in the Old Testament it is said to have

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.890
cleared poisonous animals from their path
and even stopped the flow of the Jordan River

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.710
so the people could cross.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.100
The Ark was paraded around Jericho with trumpets
for 7 days, and later placed in the legendary

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560
Temple of Jerusalem.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.649
However, it disappeared after the Babylonians
overthrew the Israelites in 597 and 586 B.C.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.509
Since then, it hasn’t been seen again although
naturally people have ideas about where the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.509
precious container may have gone.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.820
One of the strongest claims is that before
Jerusalem was sacked, the Ark had been sent

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.749
to Ethiopia and hidden in the St. Mary of
Zion Cathedral.

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.210
The only person allowed to see it is the appropriately
named Guardian of the Ark.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.310
It is such a holy object that a mere human
cannot look at such a holy object without

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.409
suffering the consequences.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.320
Other churches and temples around the world
claim to possess the Ark but none have been

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.600
tested for authenticity because that would
be inappropriate.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.079
Ron Wyatt, an amateur archaeologist and Seventh
Day Adventist claimed he found the Ark buried

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.469
under the place where Jesus was rumored to
have been crucified.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.880
He lead an excavation in Jerusalem and found
a network of caves where he said he found

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.610
the ark but that divine interference prevented
his pictures from showing up.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
When he returned to the site, he saw angels
who told him that it was not yet time for

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.280
the world to see the ark.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.230
Of course, many professional archaeologists
dismiss Wyatt as he also claimed to have found

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.440
Noah’s arc, his anchor, his tomb, the tower
of Babel, and the blood of Jesus himself among

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.070
100 other Biblical discoveries.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.600
So far the Ark of the Covenant is still lost.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.820
7.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670
Copper Scroll Treasure

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.620
One of the most intriguing archaeological
finds of all time were the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.760
ancient manuscripts found in caves near the
Dead Sea.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.980
The scrolls are now small bits of parchment
with text but they are enormously significant

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.540
because they are some of the oldest biblical
manuscripts ever found.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.230
The odd thing is one scroll that stood out
in particular because it is made of copper!

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.730
The style, language and medium are so different
that scholars believe it must have been placed

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.370
there at a different time than the rest of
the scrolls.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.760
It couldn’t be unrolled so it was authorized
to have it cut into strips and then pieced

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.790
back together.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.010
Instead of being a religious text, it was
a list.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.290
It gives the details of 64 locations where
you’ll supposedly find a mega-valuable collection

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.370
of treasure!

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.030
The Copper Scroll has been referred to as
an ancient inventory and so far no-one has

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.000
been able to find the silver, gold and other
materials referred to on this unusual metallic

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.150
document.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.920
Several researchers have attempted to go to
the locations and requested permission from

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.720
the Israeli government to go with a metal
detector but so far, requests have been denied.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.980
No one knows where the treasure lies, but
that’s not to say it won’t be discovered

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.100
any day now!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
6.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.480
Dance of Death

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.390
You’ve heard of dance fever?

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.870
Well in Strasbourg 1518 you’d be hitting
the dance floor whether you wanted to or not.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.140
As strange as it may sound, for 3 months the
French town found itself in the grip of an

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.960
affliction whereby people started dancing
uncontrollably… in some cases till death!

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.900
The first recorded case was a lady named Frau
Troffea, who busted some moves for 6 days

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900
straight.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.549
Before long lots of people had joined her
- albeit involuntarily - in a groovy yet disturbing

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.549
way.

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.850
It’s easy to make jokes about this but can
you imagine what it would have been like?

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.039
And it was especially horrible for those with
heart conditions because they just couldn’t

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.860
stop until they literally dropped.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.960
In an effort to control the situation, the
town proposed a solution to build a stage

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.770
complete with musicians in the hope that people
would get the dancing disease out of their

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.770
system.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.940
But what caused this strange occurrence?

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.590
Local physicians blamed it on “hot blood”
and may have just been caused by mass hysteria,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.389
or a hysterical reaction against authority.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.509
People at the time were dealing with disease,
famine, all kinds of stress.

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.629
Or they could have been members of a religious
cult.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.150
But one of the most interesting hypothesis
is that the people may have accidentally eaten

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.330
ergot, a hallucinogenic mould that forms on
damp rye.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.680
Ergot may have also been responsible for the
hysteria and odd behaviour during the Salem

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.790
witch trials.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.889
Other dancing plagues popped up in other places
in Europe in the 16th century so it was not

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:13.919
an isolated incident.

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.900
But it remains a mystery for sure.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.900
5.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.360
Hanging Gardens of Babylon

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.039
Gardening is a surprisingly competitive activity,
with people vying to see who can create the

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.909
most beautiful flowers, the most spectacular
fountain, you know what I mean.

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.129
Of course if you were cultivating a garden
back around 575 BCE in the area where Baghdad

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.779
is now, you’d have the ultimate competition
in the form of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.870
These mighty gardens were planted by Nebuchadnezzar
II, who ruled over the legendary capital city

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.270
of Babylon.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.560
The gardens were described as a paradise,
with exotic plants and terraces creating a

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.840
place of greenery and tranquility in the middle
of a desert.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.819
Nebuchadnezzar’s power and influence spread
to the extent that he seized control of Jerusalem.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.990
Remember when I was telling you about events
surrounding the disappearance of the Ark of

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.990
the Covenant?

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.370
Yep that was him.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.370
The Hanging Gardens were one of his crowning
achievements.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.919
It was said he built them for his wife so
that she would feel more at home, but many

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.599
historians doubt if this magnificent wonder
of the world ever existed at all?

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.080
There are records of gardens existing in Nineveh
and Mesopotamia from before the time of Nebuchadnezzar

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.080
and and maybe ancient historians got their
places confused.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.740
Scholars do agree though that if these gardens
had existed they would have been probably

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.879
near one of the royal palaces and would definitely
have qualified as one of the 7 wonders of

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.129
the world.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.159
4.

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:37.650
Where is Jimmy Hoffa?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.639
One of the most well-known vanishings in American
history is that of union man Jimmy Hoffa in

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.639
1975.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.190
Before his abrupt departure he’d had a high
profile carer, rising to become President

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.129
of the Brotherhood of Teamsters.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.810
Hoffa then fell from grace, getting convicted
in 1967 on charges of fraud, bribery and tampering

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.949
with a jury.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.629
It wasn’t a surprise to some that he disappeared,
as Hoffa kept company with dark underworld

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.740
figures as well as distasteful people on the
street.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.150
He wasn’t allowed to get involved with a
union again until 1980 though the disgraced

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.580
figure was working on a comeback of sorts
in the Seventies after his release.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.879
Reports say when he disappeared while in Detroit
he was going to hook up with Anthony “Tony

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.430
Jack” Giacalone and Anthony “Tony Pro”
Provenzano, two Mafia bosses.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.339
In fact he telephoned his wife Josephine to
tell her they hadn’t arrived, leading many

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.319
to speculate that Hoffa was killed by organized
crime.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:36.389
A movie was made in 1992 - a decade after
Jimmy was officially declared dead - titled

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.699
simply Hoffa.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:41.460
It starred Jack Nicholson as Hoffa and was
directed by Danny DeVito.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.580
Martin Scorsese is also making a Netflix film
called The Irishman.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.259
This is based on the story of Frank Sheeran,
who claimed he was the one who murdered Hoffa

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:51.770
all those years ago.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.619
Could Scorsese and De Niro be the people to
shine a light on this most enduring mystery?

00:07:56.619 --> 00:07:59.599
Guess we’ll have to get streaming to find
out…

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:00.599
3.

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.309
Jack The Ripper

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:06.009
If there’s one historic mystery that’s
never likely to be solved, it’s that of

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:07.350
Jack the Ripper.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.479
This anonymous maniac tore through the area
of Whitechapel in London in 1888, attacking

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:16.289
prostitutes with a mixture of brute force
and surgical precision.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:20.949
The horrifying case is made even worse by
the fact that to this day no-one has exposed

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:21.949
the killer.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:25.849
There have been numerous attempts to link
people to the crimes but there is no conclusive

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:29.039
proof outside of gossip and leaps of the imagination.

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:33.760
Suspects identified at the time included George
Chapman, a Polish medical man with a history

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.969
of threatening and violent behaviour.

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.779
Eventually he was arrested on suspicion of
poisoning women to get his hands on their

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:42.050
wealth and hung in 1903.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.860
It’s reported that detective Fred Abberline
- who hunted the Ripper himself - believed

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.120
Chapman to be the infamous slayer.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.130
An enduring myth about the Ripper is that
he was a member of the Royal Family.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.970
The Duke of Clarence has been mentioned as
a suspect, though some sources claim this

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:02.089
to be wild speculation with nothing to suggest
he was near the scene when the slaughter occurred.

00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:06.250
Whoever this terrible human being was, he
held the world in a grip of fear and although

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.740
discovering his identity won’t change the
nature of his crimes, it would finally put

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.670
the mystery to rest.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.740
2.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.690
Location of Cleopatra’s Tomb

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.600
Cleopatra is one of the most recognized names
in history so you’d think the location of

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.610
her tomb would be somewhere recorded in the
history books.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.610
But no!

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.870
To this day people don’t really know where
this notorious queen, who famously bathed

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.920
in milk and swallowed fortunes, was finally
laid to rest.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.769
After all, she married Marc Anthony, a general
and Romans are famous for keeping records.

00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:40.180
But they both had become the public enemy
of Rome.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.839
When her kingdom was seized by Julius Caesar's
adopted son Octavian she knew the end was

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:45.880
inevitable.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.709
Marc Antony thinking that Cleopatra was already
dead and all was lost, stabbed himself with

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:51.930
his sword.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.750
Although Cleopatra tried to make peace with
Octavian, he resisted her charms and so she

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.950
took her own life, possibly by provoking an
asp to bite her.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.270
Better to bitten by an Egyptian symbol of
divine royalty than to be paraded in the streets

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.810
of Rome as a slave.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.560
They were reportedly buried together.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.329
A team from the Dominican archaeological mission
believe it’s most likely located under a

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:18.740
hill near Alexandria, beneath a limestone
structure called Taposiris Magna.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.980
Why this place in particular?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.420
Well, they think this due to the presence
of what looks to be a prominent statue which

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.769
could be Antony and Cleopatra.

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:31.319
The location is surrounded by mummies, which
suggests important people wanted to be buried

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:33.560
in proximity to these great figures.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.180
They’ve also uncovered some intriguing artefacts
and hopefully it is just a matter of time.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.180
1.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.959
The Shugborough Inscription

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:46.060
If you want a mystery that’ll really get
you scratching your head, then the Shepherd’s

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.440
Monument inscription found at Shugborough
Hall in Staffordshire England should top your

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440
list.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.120
Besides the fact that that was quite the tongue
twister!!

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.670
The estate’s most famous owners were perhaps
the Anson family.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.860
Thomas and George Anson came up with the idea
around the mid 18th century.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.740
A Flemish sculptor named Peter Scheemakers
was commissioned to create the elaborate piece.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.790
The monument takes the form of a relief depicting
‘The Shepherds of Arcadia’ by Poussin.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.660
Surrounding this is an arch and carved onto
the Monument is an inscription which reads

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.660
‘DOUOSVAVVM’.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.270
What does this even mean??

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.800
It’s this element that has tested some of
the greatest minds of the age.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.410
The author Charles Dickens took a stab as
to its meaning and even Charles Darwin was

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.579
intrigued.

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:36.079
Over the years it has been described as everything
from a message of love to a Biblical reference.

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:41.040
The Ansons’ reported association with secret
organizations has led to some experts claiming

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.050
the inscription relates to codes used by the
Knights Templar.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.100
Poussin the artist was involved with the Templars,
deepening the rumoured connection and possibly

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.600
revealing the whereabouts of another historic
legend, the Holy Grail!

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.050
If this turns out to be true then wow… a
double whammy!

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.350
Thanks for watching!

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.699
