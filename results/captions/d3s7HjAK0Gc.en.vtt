00:00:03.058 --> 00:00:05.314
- [Bryce] Is he talking to him right now?

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:07.724
(background drowns out speaker)

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:08.557
- Yeah.
- Like what

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:10.104
are the freaking chances?

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.104
- Yeah.
- Hi.

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.509
- Yeah, that happened.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.092
(upbeat music)

00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:37.150
Okay, okay, okay, before we begin,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.890
I know that we just left that teaser clip.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.027
(background drowns out speaker)

00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:41.860
- Yeah.
- Like what

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.210
are the freaking chances?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.010
- We're just gonna walk
you through this experience

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.413
as it happened for us.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.753
What?

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:49.586
- I don't trust them.

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:51.450
- Out of everything we
expected to go wrong

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.030
and to happen, when did you
think this would happen?

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.870
- Never.
- What did you think?

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.777
We did not even think
this was a possible thing,

00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:59.500
we weren't filming, when it happened,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.780
so we're gonna give you a little bit,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.560
a little bit of story of what happened

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.181
before you saw the clip, just barely.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.290
We were leaving, where were we?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.260
Silver Falls, Washington, as you guys saw,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.315
hid a treasure there,

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.898
(upbeat music)

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.156
which that treasure has now been found,

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:19.260
we're posting updates on our Instagram,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.280
another one coming out in Idaho soon.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.940
We'd just left, we drove, how many hours?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.773
Four or five hours to Spokane.

00:01:24.773 --> 00:01:26.010
- I don't even remember anymore,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.390
we had to wake up really early,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.520
so it was just like no
point in paying for parking,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.020
we just decided to go to Walmart.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010
- So Nellie and Kenzie do
the honors of looking up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.910
which Walmart parking
lots that you can park at,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.743
'cause not all of 'em you can.

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:38.865
- So you guys can actually go online

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.932
and look up which Walmarts
have overnight parking

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:44.280
and people leave comments and like reviews

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.020
and there were two, one of
them was like super sketch,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.060
a lot of sketchy people
outside and one of them

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.723
was like really nice, super
quiet, cool, we'll do that one.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.190
- Yeah, there's all these RVs
and a trailer on one side.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.494
- So I'm watching these people,

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.650
there's like cars coming and going,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.100
there's like, they're really loud.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.820
In my mind, I'm like we should move,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.165
even just like 20 feet down,

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.210
but I'm like I don't wanna
wake Bryce and Kenzie,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.667
they're just going to bed,
so I'm just like whatever,

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:12.690
I'm gonna lay down, but the
whole time I was laying down,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.811
I'm just thinking about these people

00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:17.010
and I watched the lady go into her RV.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.780
- You saw her get in it?
- Yeah.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.230
- So did it happen right then?

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.063
- No.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.753
- Did it?

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:24.810
Maybe she broke it loose?
- If you let me watch,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.570
I bet I would have watched it,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.928
- Okay, no to husbands.
- Your fault,

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.120
I knew I should have kept watching them.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.850
- She's crawling over to me
to look through the window

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.730
at this lady.
- I'd been watching them

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.668
for like 10 minutes.
- And I was like,

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:36.611
no, just go to bed.
- I could watch them forever.

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:39.773
- Husbands, if your wife has
an intuition, listen to it.

00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:41.021
- I would have saw it coming.

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:42.130
- She would have.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.930
- All of a sudden, we hear
this loud, screeching noise,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.240
it's getting louder and louder

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.110
and it sounds like--
- Ready?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.182
One, two, three.

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.599
(screeching)

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.730
- I don't know, anyway,
it sounds like that,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000
it's getting louder towards us

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.559
and Bryce shoots up super fast,

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.680
you know something is
wrong, when he's doing that,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.710
opens his blinds and what did we see?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.773
- This happened.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.222
Crashed into it.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:11.780
Wait, wait, wait, we gotta tell you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.300
more story details here.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.450
I'm coming into consciousness,
coming out of my sleep,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.370
I fall asleep pretty fast,
- It's ridiculous.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.647
- So I was almost out.

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:21.300
- He shot up, opened the blinds

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.580
and we see this trailer just coming

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.860
straight towards our window,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.420
like it's coming right at us.
- Yeah,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.810
so half my body's out the window,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.734
as I'm reaching out thinking,

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:30.380
oh, someone's backing up into us,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.508
I can pound on their trailer,

00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:32.341
they'll hear it and they'll stop.

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:33.880
- I knew.
- I'm whistling, yelling

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.287
and then it just launched me back.

00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:37.829
- It was like no stopping,
in fact, you guys,

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.072
the lady that had got in
her trailer had no idea.

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:42.922
- She didn't even know it was moving.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.920
So it's after midnight

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.334
and we woke up to this.

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.293
- [Woman] I don't know who
else to talk to about this,

00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:52.053
I don't know what to do and so--

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:54.087
- Whose RV is it or whose trailer is it?

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.140
She said she's gonna go talk to this guy.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.319
- So I'm gonna go talk to him

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.840
and brainstorm and see what I can do.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.365
- And I'm like, wait, no, at
the scene of some accident,

00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:05.343
you want everyone still there.

00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:07.809
I think it's best to wait a second,

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.003
while we figure out what to do here.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.552
- I called 911, which I've
never done that before.

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:17.287
- And I wish I'd filmed that,
'cause this is how it went.

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:18.120
"Hello, 911."

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.307
"Hi, we just got hit,
we're in a motor home

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:22.177
"and a trailer just hit us in the side."

00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:24.977
"Oh, okay, ma'am, okay,
is anyone injured?"

00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:27.830
"I don't know, but we have a baby."

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.060
- Listen, I didn't want them to leave,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.180
I needed the cops to get
there as fast as they could,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.878
great job, 911, they actually
got there pretty fast.

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:35.532
- Actually the cops got there super fast.

00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:36.893
- Whose trailer is this?

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.980
- [Bryce] This man was standing there.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.090
- [Man] Yeah, Walmart doesn't
even want it in this lot,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.400
they told me I had to get it out of here,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.060
I guess 'cause one of the
axles is broke off of it.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.060
- I was a little nervous,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.336
'cause I didn't know how many
people were in that trailer

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:50.830
and I felt weird when I got out there,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.930
so I was just like concerned about safety.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.270
If people are under the
influence of something,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.627
you know, drugs or alcohol or anything.

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:58.450
- Yeah, we were kind of sketched out.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.283
- You don't know what they're gonna do.

00:04:59.283 --> 00:05:02.237
- And the cops were like,
"Even if we do find the owners,

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.787
"chances are they don't have insurance,

00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:04.822
"they don't have money,"

00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:06.900
and we're like probably.
- Life's so short,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.733
it's on us.

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:08.610
The policeman's like, "You know what?"

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.230
He's like, "So what's this 50
state treasure thing like?"

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.640
Oh yeah, we're filming, we're
hiding treasures all over,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.871
hoping to motivate friends and families

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:17.317
to adventure more in each
state and he's like, "What?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.680
"you've gotta be documenting this,"

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.810
'cause at first, you'll notice,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.260
we're kind of renegade filming,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.760
I just kept the camera by my side.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.204
Should we ask if I can document this?

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:27.672
I'm gonna do that first, yeah.

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:30.577
I'm coming right now, I'm just
gonna put out their faces,

00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:32.400
but should we ask?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.350
- No.
- Okay.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.155
Then when we got permission,
we started filming more.

00:05:35.155 --> 00:05:36.849
- Are you guys renting it or do you--

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:37.682
- No, we just bought it.
- We own it,

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.940
we just bought it.
- Are you The Jurgys?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:41.606
- Okay.

00:05:41.606 --> 00:05:43.133
- We're doing a documentary.
- Like and subscribe.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.707
And then he said, "You know what?

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:45.929
"You need the security
footage for your story."

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.740
- I don't know if they're
telling the truth or not.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.910
- Yeah.
- I took pictures,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.251
so go ahead and just pull her forward.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.470
- Hey, we don't wanna
give more trouble to them,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.617
we just wanted to make
sure it's taken care of.

00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:57.780
- [Officer] Oh, it's not gonna stop.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.910
- So he goes in to get security footage,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.367
this guy was awesome, he's like,

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:05.070
"I'm gonna get it for our
purposes, but you can use it."

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.940
He comes back to our RV an hour later,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.890
knocks on the door, after we had moved.

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:11.232
- [Officer] Hey.

00:06:11.232 --> 00:06:12.482
- [Bryce] What?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.660
- It looks like a big whale
just coming to get you.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.210
(laughing)

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.438
It was pretty funny.

00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:21.750
What took so long is I
was trying to figure out

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.920
how to burn it to the CD.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.880
- Okay.
- There you go.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.747
Alright, guys.
- Have a good night.

00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:27.535
You think we're good here?

00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:28.470
- What?
- You think we're good

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.303
in this spot?

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.230
- Well,
- We're up from the hill.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.150
- Well, you got this
island protecting you,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.163
you got the return cart,
- Yeah.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:39.075
- I think you're good,

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:40.610
I hope.
- Yeah,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.443
hey, thanks Officer.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:42.276
- Yeah.
- Have a good night.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:43.447
- [Officer] You guys have a good one.

00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:47.330
- And we checked it and
all it was was an AVI file

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.920
and it only shows a
timeline with no video,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.195
so if you're tech savvy and you know

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.660
how to pull video out of that,
I used HandBrake, I used VLC,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.870
couldn't figure out how to convert it,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.820
so we're just trying to work
with the police department

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.720
to still get the footage again,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.317
if so, we'll post that on,
where should we post it?

00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:05.470
Instagram, we'll post it on Instagram.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.556
You need to think of every
possible wrong scenario

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:09.510
that could happen, when you park an RV.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.550
Luckily as you'll notice,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.527
the damage wasn't near as
bad as it rocked the RV.

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:14.194
- It could have been so much worse.

00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:16.920
- Thanks Walmart for
letting us park for free.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.560
- Yeah, even though we basically
have to pay for it now.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.393
- Yeah.

00:07:20.393 --> 00:07:21.226
- Times like that are all the same.

00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:22.400
- We're gonna be hitting up all 50 states,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.195
if you don't know that yet,
please tell your friends

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:25.516
and people that are in different states,

00:07:25.516 --> 00:07:27.533
we wanna know the coolest
things to do in each state

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:29.143
and where we should hide our treasures.

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:30.470
- Also, you should find our treasures,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.370
because remember,
- Yeah.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.500
- once you do, you're entered

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.480
into our international trip giveaway,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.978
which is huge.
- All you need is a passport,

00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:39.010
that's all you need.
- All you need,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.401
for you and a friend or loved one.

00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:41.234
- Woo!

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:42.693
Thanks for praying for us,
that the only damage was that.

00:07:42.693 --> 00:07:44.077
We love you guys, see you later, bye.

00:07:44.077 --> 00:07:45.448
- See you guys.
- Say bye.

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:48.031
(upbeat music)

00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:50.503
- You okay?
- Stressed out,

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.677
(drowned out by background music)

00:07:52.677 --> 00:07:54.390
it's like past midnight, I'm tired.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.750
Seriously, like what are the chances

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.590
of like you open a window

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.930
and you see like a rolling
trailer coming at you?

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.260
Like what the heck?

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.920
- I'd say one in three,
'cause it's our third state.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.140
- Next time on The Jurgys.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.787
You guys, I flew a plane,
he let me fly the plane.
