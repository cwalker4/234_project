facts about the 10 commandments.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.500
A misunderstanding of just 1 of these 10 facts
could cost you eternal life. Stay tuned!

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:28.249
 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.640

Bible Prophecy, and be prepared for these

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.020
end times.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.020
The law of God, also known as the 10 commandments,
is under attack.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.910
Many well-meaning Christians have lost sight
of the role and purpose of God’s law – an

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.149
understanding that is essential to every Christian.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.199

we have in store for you.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.160
Before we dive into our 10 facts, let us consider
the 10 commandments themselves.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.770
Exodus 31:18 tells us “And he gave unto
Moses, when he had made an end of communing

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.000
with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony,
tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.990
Notice that the 10 commandments were written
in stone by the very finger of God and given

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.770
to Moses on Mt. Sinai.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.800
The following is a summary of the ten commandments,
found in Exodus chapter 20.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.450
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.500
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.500
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Honor thy father and thy mother

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Thou Shalt Not Kill

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Thou shalt not commit adultery

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Thou shalt not steal

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.999
Thou shalt not bear false witness against
thy neighbor

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500
Thou shalt not covet

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There you have it friends – The 10 commandments,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.930
the Law of God, spoken with His own mouth,
and written with His own finger.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.200
Now, Let’s jump right in with our first
fact about God’s Law

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.900
1.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.040
The Law of God Points out Sin and Our Need
of a Savior

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.090
The 10 commandments serve a very important
role.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.340
They reveal to us what sin is.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.220
This is very important because we want to
avoid sin at all costs.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.450
After all, the Bible says
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.080
of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
our Lord.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.560
Notice how the law serves the purpose of identifying,
or revealing, what sin is:

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.239
“Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth
also the law: for sin is the transgression

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.480
of the law.”

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.140
Romans 3:20 says it very plainly:
…for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.819
In fact, Paul says in Romans 7:7
..I had not known sin, but by the law…

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.710
So, we can see that the law serves the critical
role of pointing out our sin to us, which

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.010
shows us our need of a Savior.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.999
But we should also note that the law cannot
save us.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:13.389
Notice this powerful verse:
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:20.540
that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.520
The best way that I can think to illustrate
this is with a mirror.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.800
When we sin, it’s like getting mud on our
face, that needs to be cleaned.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.490
We are not aware of our sin, or dirt, until
we look into a mirror.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.730
The mirror is like the law – it reveals
our sin to us.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.920
But can the mirror clean the dirt of our face?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.540
No, it simply reveals the dirt, so that we
can wash it off with water.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.150
In the same way, the law can not cleanse our
sin, but it reveals it to us so that we can

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.170
go to Jesus, who cleanses us.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.760
So, is the solution to get rid of the mirror
by smashing it?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760
No!

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.950
If we remove the law from this equation, we
can no longer see our sin, and we no longer

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.340
have a need for a Savior!

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.140
I hope you can see how dangerous it is to
believe that the law of God no longer matters!

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.870
The law identifies sin, and shows us our need
of Jesus.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.910
If we continue to break the law (sin), then
we will be lost:

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.390
“sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth
death.”

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.410
But there is good news!

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.680
When we confess our sins, God will forgive
us, and help us to obey His law!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.300
At the end of this video, I will reveal how
this is possible!

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.300
2.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.440
God’s Law Reveals His character
Did you know that the Bible calls the Law

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.790
of God pure, holy, good, just, and perfect?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.680
These are just some of the characteristics
that describe both the law and God Himself.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.250
Notice how this verse uses the same description
when talking about God and His law!

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.860
But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in
judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.780
in righteousness.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.500
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.320
Both God and His law are holy!

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.720
Consider this example:
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.650
which is in heaven is perfect.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.140
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting
the soul…

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.660
Both God and His law are perfect!

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.310
I will provide just one more verse comparison
that shows how God’s law reveals His character.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.520
And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba,
and called there on the name of the LORD,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.340
the everlasting God.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.530
The works of his hands are verity and judgment;
all his commandments are sure.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:04.330
They stand fast for ever and ever, and are
done in truth and uprightness.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.440
Notice how both God and His law are eternal
– they last forever!

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.570
The very character of God – who is pure,
good, true, and perfect, and unchanging, can

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.670
be seen in His law!

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.670
3.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:26.060
Obeying God’s Law Leads to Peace and Happiness
As a former social studies teacher in the

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.700
public schools, the required curriculum for
my students taught that the 10 commandments

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.210
are the basis, or foundation, for many governments
throughout world history.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.640
Even to this day, countries across the world,
including the United States of America, have

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.960
laws (such as prohibiting theft and murder)
that are anchored in the 10 commandments.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.240
God’s law has been a safeguard to countries
across the world, and obeying His commandments

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.540
leads to true peace and happiness.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.960
The Bible reveals that
…he that keepeth the law, happy is he.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.500
And
My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.390
keep my commandments: For length of days,
and long life, and peace, shall they add to

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.390
thee.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.390
God’s Law is Eternal and Can Never Be Changed.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.210
Obeying God’s law leads to peace and happiness.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.260
4.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:25.460
God’s Law is Eternal and Can Never Be Changed
Think about this for a second friends.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.660
Every successful nation in this world has
laws.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.419
These laws serve to protect that nation and
keep it safe.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.740
Would the government of God be any different?

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.310
Is it reasonable to think that God does not
have laws that protect and guide His people?

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.550
Listen to what the Bible says about the permanence
of God’s Law:

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.800
My covenant will I not break, nor alter the
thing that is gone out of my lips.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.680
If you remember, God spoke the 10 commandments
with His own mouth.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.300
Notice that God tells us that He will never
change the things that He speaks.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.430
Just in case there was any doubt if God’s
law is permanent, Jesus makes it clear in

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.490
this verse:
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.130
than one tittle of the law to fail.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.690
God’s law is eternal, and can never be changed.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.079
5.

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:23.069
The Law of Moses was Nailed to the Cross,
NOT the Law of God

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:28.180
Many people have a misunderstanding of which
laws in the Bible are done away with.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.040
There are many laws in Old Testament that
were designed to bring people’s attention

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.240
to the coming Messiah, which is Jesus.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.339
These laws, such as killing lambs and goats,
and many others, were called ceremonial laws,

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:47.040
and Christians no longer need to follow them
– they had their fulfillment in Christ.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.510
All of the laws of the Old Testament, including
the ceremonial laws and the laws given specifically

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.970
to the nation of Israel are known as the Law
of Moses.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.420
These laws should not be confused with the
law of God, also known as the moral law, or

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:09.870
the 10 commandments, which we have clearly
seen are eternal and permanent.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:16.350
Notice the clear difference the Bible makes
between the law of God and the law of Moses.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.949
The Bible says
The Law of Moses was written in a book by

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:21.050
Moses.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.810
The Law of God is written on stone by God.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.899
The Law of Moses was stored in side of the
ark of the covenant.

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:34.620
The law of God was stored inside of the ark
of the covenant, showing a clear distinction

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.740
between the 2 laws.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.550
The Law of Moses is contrary to us, or against
us.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.220
The Law of God is not burdensome.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.370
The Law of Moses is carnal, or fleshly.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.240
The Law of God is spiritual.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.100
The Law of Moses was abolished, or completed
at the cross.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.720
The Law of God will last forever.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.389
As you can see, the Bible makes a clear difference
between the law of Moses and that law of God.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:07.699
It was the law of Moses that was nailed to
the cross, not the law of God.

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:08.720
6.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.899
Jesus’ Death on the Cross Proves that God’s
Law Can Never be Changed

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:20.160
Perhaps the greatest proof or strongest evidence
that God’s law can never be changed is the

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.839
fact that Jesus came to this earth to pay
the penalty for our sins – the broken law

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.240
of God.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.779
If God’s law could ever be changed, altered,
or done away with, then Jesus would not have

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.999
had to die to save us!

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:41.060
Referring to Jesus, the Bible says:
Who his own self bare our sins in his own

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:48.980
body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.670
ye were healed.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.230
Notice that He died to pay for our sins.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.199
Remember, sin is the breaking of the law!

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:04.129
In fact, during His life here on earth, Jesus
taught that we should obey God’s commandments,

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:06.619
and he perfectly followed them Himself!

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:10.480
He says
…but if thou wilt enter into life, keep

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.699
the commandments.”

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.730
And
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:22.449
in my love; even as I have kept my Father's
commandments, and abide in his love.

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:29.220
Jesus death proves 2 things about God – Number
1, He is Love – His sent His only Son to

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.339
die for our sins, so that we may have eternal
life!

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:40.040
Number 2, God is righteous – His law cannot
be changed – even his own Son had to pay

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:47.610
the penalty of death because of our breaking
of the law – he took these sins upon Himself.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.550
What a loving and righteous God we serve!

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.670
7.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.420
God Hates the Teaching that We Don’t Need
to Obey His Law

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.759
Many modern pastors and church members, perhaps
innocently misguided, have a accepted a deadly

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:08.029
false teaching when it comes to God’s law
– they believe that it is no longer binding

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:11.829
since we are under grace, and not under the
law.

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:14.180
What does the Bible say about this?

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.190
Do we then make void the law through faith?

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.449
God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:26.160
You see, to be “under the law” means to
be living under the condemnation of the law.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.119
This happens when we disobey or breaks God’s
law – we are then condemned by it.

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:37.009
While it is true that, as Christians, we are
living under grace and not under the law,

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:42.130
this does not give us permission to break
God’s law and sin!

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.839
Think about this illustration friends.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:49.009
You are speeding down the highway with the
pedal to the medal when you seen those dreaded

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:51.279
blinking lights in your rearview mirror.

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:57.130
A police officers approaches your car and
confirms the obvious – you were speeding.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:02.899
However, the officer than does something that
he doesn’t need to do – he gives you grace!

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:08.019
Instead of writing a ticket and making you
pay for your action, he pardons you and tells

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:10.820
you to slow down and be careful.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.819
Now friend, how should you respond to this
grace?

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:20.740
Should you floor the gas pedal and burn your
tires out as soon as the officer walks away?

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.179
Of course not!

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:25.889
If youdid this, the officer would most likely
write you a ticket!

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:29.259
Instead of grace, you would now be under the
law!

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:36.029
Yes, when we confess our sins and are forgiven,
we are given grace, but we must respond to

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:41.779
this grace by obeying God’s law, and not
returning to sin.

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:46.869
If we return to sin, we will once again be
under the law.

00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:51.990
As new covenant Christians, it is essential
that we obey God’s law out of our love for

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.100
Him.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.550
Notice this passage that describes the new
covenant:

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.810
This is the covenant that I will make with
them after those days, saith the Lord, I will

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.589
put my laws into their hearts, and in their
minds will I write them.

00:15:05.589 --> 00:15:10.069
Notice that God promises to write His 10 commandment
law on our hearts!

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:16.850
That is, if we choose to follow God, He will
teach us to love and obey His laws!

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.879
Let’s think about this for a second friends.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:25.119
Does the teaching that we no longer have to
obey God’s law even make sense?

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.129
Think about the 10 commandments.

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:29.819
Which of these should we now be allowed to
break?

00:15:29.819 --> 00:15:34.499
Should we now steal, lie, murder, take each
other’s wives?

00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:36.399
Take the Lord’s name is vain?

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:40.029
Does God now say it’s acceptable for us
to do these things?

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:41.410
Of course not!

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:48.209
God’s law points out sin, is the foundation
of His government, and can never be changed.

00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:54.199
So, what does God say about preachers and
ministers who teach that we no longer need

00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:56.910
to obey God’s law?

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.040
Please pay careful attention to this strong
wording:

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.720
For the priest's lips should keep knowledge,
and they should seek the law at his mouth:

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.209
for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

00:16:08.209 --> 00:16:13.309
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have
caused many to stumble at the law; ye have

00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:17.429
corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the
LORD of hosts.

00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:22.610
Therefore have I also made you contemptible
and base before all the people, according

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:28.489
as ye have not kept my ways, but have been
partial in the law.

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:35.329
The Bible condemns those who teach that we
can break even one of God’s 10 commandments.

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:40.290
Listen to this clear Bible passage:
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:46.509
least commandments, and shall teach men so,
he shall be called the least in the kingdom

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:48.139
of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:49.139
kingdom of heaven.

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:53.430
Friends, God Hates the Teaching that We Don’t
Need to Obey His Law, and he will hold ministers

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.089
accountable who teach this false doctrine.

00:16:57.089 --> 00:16:58.089
8.

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:03.620
All Men will be Judged by the Law of God
The Bible is clear, as we have already seen,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.189
that we are saved by grace.

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:10.230
However, the Bible also speaks of a judgment.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:15.209
Every human being will be judged to see if
their faith was genuine, to see if their lives

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:18.319
match up with their claim to believe in Christ.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.329
2 Corinthians 5:10 says that
…we must all appear before the judgment

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.929
seat of Christ.

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:26.829
And how will we be judged?

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:33.030
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall
be judged by the law of liberty.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:38.529
We will all be judged by God’s law, here
referred to as the law of liberty.

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:44.250
The previous verse, 11, makes it clear that
this law of liberty is referring to the 10

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.250
commandments.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:55.290
It is true that Jesus will be our Advocate in the judgment, and His precious blood will forgive us of all our sins that we have confessed.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:00.590
However, any sins that we hold on to will
not be forgiven.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:05.230
God does not want us to be confused about
what are standard for holy living is.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.840
He wants our duty to be clear to us.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.510
The Bible says
Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.299
is the whole duty of man.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:20.301
Let us learn to love and obey God’s law
– for all men will be judged by the law

00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:21.800
of God.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.100
9.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.620
Those Who obey God’s Law will Have Eternal
Life

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:33.130
The Bible promises that those who surrender
their lives to God, and keep His commandments

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.250
will be granted access to Heaven.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.080
Consider the thrilling promise given in this
verse

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:45.309
Blessed are they that do his commandments,
that they may have right to the tree of life,

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:49.260
and may enter in through the gates into the
city.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.490
On the other hand, there will be those who
profess to be Christians, but are not obedient

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.049
to God’s law.

00:18:56.049 --> 00:19:02.030
The Bible describes their fate as well:
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.870
have we not prophesied in thy name? and in
thy name have cast out devils? and in thy

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.610
name done many wonderful works?

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:17.539
And then will I profess unto them, I never
knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:25.059
Iniquity is another name for sin, and we have
seen that sin is the breaking of God’s law.

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:29.350
Those who continue to break God’s commandments,
even if they have done many good things in

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.390
their life, will be destroyed.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.970
Friends, I hope you choose to give yourself
fully to Jesus.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:43.559
I hope you choose to cherish His law and strive
to obey each of His 10 commandments.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:47.820
I would love to meet you by the tree of life
in Heaven.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.980
10.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:55.299
If We Love Jesus, We Will Obey His Commandments
Sometimes Christians who seek to obey God’s

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:58.260
law are accused of being legalists.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.480
Think about this for a second.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:05.289
If a parent tells their child to clean their
room before going outside, and the child obeys

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:09.299
their parent, should the child be accused
of being a legalist?

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:10.940
Of course not!

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:16.539
As Christians, we should want to obey God’s
laws because of our love for Him and our desire

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:18.140
to please Him.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.630
We should not view our obedience as earning
our own salvation (this would be legalism),

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:29.340
but we should obey God out of love, and to
show that our faith is real.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.490
After all, the Bible says that faith without
works is dead.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:39.470
In fact Jesus tells us plainly
If ye love me, keep my commandments.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.850
The Bible says
And hereby we do know that we know him, if

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.679
we keep his commandments.

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:50.540
On the other hand
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.390
his commandments, is a liar, and the truth
is not in him.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:01.380
Behold Jesus, the Lamb of God that takes away
the sin of the world.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.080
He died for your sins and mine.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:11.681
Dear friend, show your love for Jesus today
by making a commitment to keep all 10 of his

00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.200
commandments.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.470
If this is your desire, please write in the
comment section below “Dear Lord, write

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.200
your law on my heart.”

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.399
You may be thinking, “Lord I can clearly
see from the Bible, that I must obey your

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:27.399
commandments.

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:32.070
I want to show my love for Jesus, and follow
His example, by obeying your law.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.180
But I don’t know if I can.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.850
I have failed so many times before”.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.750
But friends, obedience to God’s law is possible.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:48.750
He would never ask us to do something that
He will not give us the power to do.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.490
Consider these precious Bible promises:
For it is God which worketh in you both to

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.340
will and to do of his good pleasure.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.669
God will help you not only to obey Him, but
even to desire to obey Him!

00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:06.380
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
me.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.960
Friends, total obedience is possible!

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:16.269
When we chose to obey Him, and put our trust
in Jesus, He will give us all the power we

00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:17.480
need!

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.539
Once again, I hope it’s clear to you that
God’s law, the very reflection of His character,

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:26.130
is eternal, and will never change.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:32.460
I hope it’s clear that those who obey the
10 commandments will receive eternal life,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.549
and those who continue to break God’s law
will be lost.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:42.289
If you love Jesus, and would like to commit
to obey His commandments, please write in

00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:47.179
