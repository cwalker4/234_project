00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:19.147
In 2013, I decided to meet my enemies.

00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:24.579
I was a 27-year-old, award-winning
documentary filmmaker

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.487
and a proud feminist.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:30.806
And I was determined
to expose the dark underbelly

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:33.014
of the men's rights movement.

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:37.089
At that point, all I knew
of the men's rights movement

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:38.665
was from what I'd read online,

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:44.281
that it's a misogynistic hate group
actively working against women's equality.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.245
Well, the vast majority
of my previous work

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:48.895
was about women's issues.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:51.515
I directed documentaries
about reproductive rights,

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:52.965
single motherhood,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.759
and the need for more girls
to get into STEM education.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.446
So when I learned that no one had ever
documented the men's rights movement

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:01.927
in a film before,

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:07.051
I saw it as an opportunity
to continue fighting for women's equality

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.816
by exposing those preventing it.

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:13.524
So for one year, I traveled North America

00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:17.229
meeting the leaders and followers
of the men's rights movement.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.373
I spent anywhere
from two hours up to eight hours,

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:23.518
interviewing each individual
men's rights activist,

00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:25.507
also known as MRA,

00:01:26.037 --> 00:01:27.793
and I filmed 44 people total.

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:32.440
And there is an important rule
in documentary filmmaking.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.609
As an interviewer, you do not interrupt.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.479
So I'm asking questions,
and I'm getting their full life story.

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:44.684
And in the moment, I didn't realize it,

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.529
but now looking back I can see,

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:52.069
that while I was conducting my interviews,
I wasn't actually listening.

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:55.701
I was hearing them speak,

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:58.492
and I knew the cameras were recording,

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:02.728
but in those moments
of sitting across from my enemy,

00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:04.839
I wasn't listening.

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:06.730
What was I doing?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.517
I was anticipating.

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:13.176
I was waiting to hear a sentence,

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.725
or even just a couple
of words in succession

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:18.073
that proved what I wanted to believe:

00:02:18.073 --> 00:02:20.868
that I had found the misogynist.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:23.720
The ground zero of the war on women.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.515
A couple of times, I thought I had it.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:29.256
There was one men's rights activist

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:30.467
that said to me,

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:33.417
"Just walk outside and look around,

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:36.656
everything you see was built by a man."

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.237
Oh!

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:41.078
That statement felt anti-women.

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.528
I felt my jaw clench,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.779
but I sat quietly,
as a documentarian should,

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.418
while removing all the space
between my upper and lower molars.

00:02:50.418 --> 00:02:52.694
(Laughter)

00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:55.242
After my year of filming,

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:58.728
I was reviewing the 100 hours
of footage I had gathered,

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:02.059
replaying and transcribing it,

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.635
which believe me when I say

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:08.967
no one will ever listen to you more
than someone who transcribes your words.

00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:11.500
You should write that down.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.166
(Laughter)

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.196
So,

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.716
I was typing out every word meticulously,

00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:22.054
and through that process,
I began to realize

00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:26.409
that my initial knee-jerk reactions
to certain statements

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.488
weren't really warranted,

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:32.550
and my feeling offended
did not hold up to intense scrutiny.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.369
Was that statement about men

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.160
having built the skyscrapers
and the bridges anti-women?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.481
I thought, well, what would
be the gender-reverse scenario?

00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:44.381
Maybe a feminist saying:

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:45.778
Just look around,

00:03:45.778 --> 00:03:50.040
everyone you see was birthed by a woman.

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.396
Wow!

00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:54.263
That's a powerful statement.

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:55.612
And it's true.

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:58.038
Is it anti-male?

00:03:58.038 --> 00:03:59.174
I don't think so.

00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:03.475
I think it's acknowledging our unique
and valued contributions to our society.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:06.078
Well, luckily,

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.163
while I was making The Red Pill movie,

00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:16.066
I kept a video diary which ended up
tracking my evolving views,

00:04:16.716 --> 00:04:20.387
and in looking back on the 37 diaries
I recorded that year,

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:23.037
there was a common theme.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:26.396
I would often hear
an innocent, valid point

00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:28.451
that a men's rights activist would make,

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.612
but in my head,

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:33.492
I would add on to their statements,
a sexist or anti-woman spin,

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:37.301
assuming that's what they
wanted to say but didn't.

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:39.610
So here are two examples
of how that would go.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.190
A men's rights activist,
an MRA, would say to me,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.384
"There are over 2,000
domestic violence shelters

00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:49.365
for women in the United States.

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:52.271
But only one for men.

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:58.283
Yet, multiple reputable studies show
that men are just as likely to be abused."

00:04:59.338 --> 00:05:01.136
I would hear them say,

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.887
"We don't need 2,000 shelters for women.

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.662
They're all lying about being abused.

00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:07.791
It's all a scam."

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.843
But in looking back
on all the footages I've gathered

00:05:11.843 --> 00:05:14.090
of men's rights activists
talking about shelters

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.667
and all the blogs they've written

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.266
and the video live-streams
they have posted on YouTube,

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:21.839
they are not trying
to defund women's shelters.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.931
Not at all.

00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:26.024
All they're saying
is that men can be abused too,

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:28.910
and they deserve care and compassion.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.681
Second example.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.231
A men's rights activist would say to me,

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:41.513
"Where is justice for the man
who was falsely accused of raping a woman,

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:44.515
and because of this accusation,

00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:46.446
he loses his college scholarship

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:50.170
and is branded with the inescapable
title of a rapist."

00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:53.734
I would hear them say,

00:05:54.974 --> 00:05:57.804
"A woman being raped isn't a big deal."

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:03.936
It's as if I didn't hear the word
"falsely" accused of rape.

00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:06.930
All I heard was, "He was accused of rape."

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.343
Of course, rape is a big deal,

00:06:09.343 --> 00:06:12.813
and all the men's rights activists I met
agreed it is a horrible thing

00:06:12.813 --> 00:06:14.706
to have happened to anyone.

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.581
I eventually realized what they are saying

00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:20.510
is they are trying to add
to the gender equality discussion,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.893
who is standing up

00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:27.113
for the good-hearted, honorable man
that loses his scholarship, his job,

00:06:27.113 --> 00:06:29.355
or worse yet, his children,

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.754
because he is accused of something
he absolutely did not do?

00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:35.554
(Sighs)

00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:40.236
Well, I couldn't keep denying
the points they were making.

00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:41.633
There are real issues.

00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:47.237
But in my effort to avoid agreeing
with my enemy completely,

00:06:47.717 --> 00:06:51.078
I changed from putting words
in their mouth

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:56.966
to acknowledging the issue
but insisting they are women's issues.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.679
So here are two examples
of how that would go.

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:01.616
A men's rights activist would say to me,

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:07.748
"Men are far more likely
to lose their child in a custody battle."

00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:10.356
And I would counter:

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:15.449
"Well, because women are unfairly
expected to be the caretaker.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.893
It's discrimination against women
that women get custody more often."

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.791
Yes.

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:23.956
(Laughter)

00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:25.240
I am not proud of that.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.358
(Laughter)

00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:29.563
Second example.

00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:32.237
An MRA would say to me,

00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:38.489
"Men are roughly 78% of all suicides
throughout the world."

00:07:40.036 --> 00:07:41.745
And I would counter with:

00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:45.800
"But women attempt suicide more often.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.110
So ha!

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.619
(Laughter)

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:49.652
Ha?

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:52.646
It's not a contest.

00:07:52.646 --> 00:07:54.777
But I kept making it into one.

00:07:55.347 --> 00:07:59.430
Why couldn't I simply learn
about men's issues

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.962
and have compassion for male victims

00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:07.461
without jumping at the opportunity
to insist that women are the real victims.

00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:15.071
Well, after years of researching
and fact-checking,

00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.483
what the men's rights activists
were telling me,

00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:22.932
there is no denying that there are
many human rights issues

00:08:22.932 --> 00:08:26.978
that disproportionately
or uniquely affect men.

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:31.460
Paternity fraud uniquely affects men.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.536
The United States Selective Service
in the case of a draft

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:37.456
still uniquely affects men.

00:08:38.296 --> 00:08:41.592
Workplace deaths: disproportionately men.

00:08:41.592 --> 00:08:44.154
War deaths: overwhelmingly men.

00:08:44.154 --> 00:08:46.050
Suicide: overwhelmingly men.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.980
Sentencing disparity, life expectancy,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.098
child custody, child support,

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:54.731
false rape allegations,
criminal court bias,

00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:56.504
misandry, failure launched,

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:58.529
boys falling behind in education,

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:00.430
homelessness, veterans issues,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.184
infant male genital mutilation,

00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:05.665
lack of parental choice
once a child is conceived,

00:09:05.665 --> 00:09:09.145
lack of resources for male victims
of domestic violence,

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:13.613
so many issues that are heartbreaking,

00:09:13.613 --> 00:09:15.291
if you are the victim

00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:20.323
or you love someone who is the victim
unto any one of these issues.

00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:21.811
These are men's issues.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.491
And most people can't name one

00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.115
because they think,

00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:30.588
"Well, men have all their rights;
they have all the power and privilege."

00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:33.773
But these issues
deserve to be acknowledged.

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.297
They deserve care, attention,

00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:38.734
and motivation for solutions.

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:46.515
Before making The Red Pill movie,
I was a feminist of about ten years,

00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:50.058
and I thought I was well-versed
on gender equality issues.

00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:54.579
But it wasn't until I met
men's rights activists

00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:57.556
that I finally started
to consider the other side

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.523
of the gender equality equation.

00:10:00.578 --> 00:10:03.018
It doesn't mean I agree
with all that they've said.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:08.476
But I saw the immense value
in listening to them

00:10:08.476 --> 00:10:11.477
and trying to see the world
through their eyes.

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.594
I thought if I could get my audience
to also listen to them,

00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:19.760
it could serve as a rung on the ladder,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.851
bringing us all up
to a higher consciousness

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:23.139
about gender equality.

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:27.406
So in October 2016,

00:10:28.286 --> 00:10:29.948
the film was released in theaters,

00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:33.537
and articles and critic reviews
started to roll in.

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:39.737
And that's when I experienced
how engaged the media is

00:10:40.437 --> 00:10:43.971
in group think around gender politics.

00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.952
And I learned a difficult lesson.

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:53.730
When you start to humanize your enemy,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.126
you, in turn, may be dehumanized
by your community.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.975
And that's what happened to me.

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:10.516
Rather than debating the merit
of the issues addressed in the film,

00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:13.726
I became the target of a smear campaign,

00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:19.593
and people who had never seen the movie
protested outside the theater doors,

00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:21.486
chanting that it was harmful to women.

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:24.398
It certainly is not.

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:28.015
But I understand their mindset.

00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:31.194
If I never made this movie,

00:11:31.194 --> 00:11:33.526
and I heard that there was
a documentary screening

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.720
about men's rights activists
that didn't show them as monsters,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.732
I too would have protested the screenings

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:41.935
or at least sign the petitions
to ban the film

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.851
because I was told
that they were my enemy.

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:49.673
I was told that men's rights activists
were against women's equality.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:55.079
But all the men's rights activists I met
support women's rights

00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:58.089
and are simply asking the question:

00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:00.790
"Why doesn't our society
care about men's rights?"

00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:08.702
Well, the greatest challenge I faced
through this whole process,

00:12:09.392 --> 00:12:12.074
it wasn't the protests against my film,

00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:15.300
and it wasn't how I was treated
by the mainstream media -

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.762
even though it got
pretty disgusting at times.

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:21.725
The greatest challenge I faced

00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:26.862
was peeling back the layers
of my own bias.

00:12:28.913 --> 00:12:32.160
It turns out I did meet
my enemy while filming.

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:37.080
It was my ego saying that I was right,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.780
and they were subhuman.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:49.088
It's no secret now that I no longer
call myself a feminist,

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:54.547
but I must clarify I am not anti-feminist,

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:57.540
and I am not a men's rights activist.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.184
I still support women's rights,

00:13:00.824 --> 00:13:03.021
and I now care about men's rights as well.

00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:05.240
However,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.650
I believe if we want
to honestly discuss gender equality,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.239
we need to invite all voices to the table.

00:13:14.442 --> 00:13:16.758
Yet, this is not what is happening.

00:13:16.758 --> 00:13:19.015
Men's groups are continually vilified,

00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:21.204
falsely referred to as hate groups,

00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:24.244
and their voices
are systematically silenced.

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:27.992
Do I think either movement
has all the answers?

00:13:27.992 --> 00:13:29.059
No.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:32.426
Men's rights activists
are not without flaws,

00:13:32.426 --> 00:13:34.166
neither are feminists.

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:38.071
But if one group is being silenced,

00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.498
that's a problem for all of us.

00:13:42.408 --> 00:13:46.336
If I could give advice to anyone
in our society at large,

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:50.998
we have to stop expecting to be offended,

00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:57.165
and we have to start truly,
openly, and sincerely listening.

00:13:58.145 --> 00:14:00.379
That would lead
to a greater understanding

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:01.921
of ourselves and others,

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:04.659
having compassion for one another,

00:14:05.469 --> 00:14:07.690
working together towards solutions

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.813
because we all are in this together.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:15.693
And once we do that,
we can finally heal from the inside out.

00:14:17.038 --> 00:14:19.692
But it has to start with listening.

00:14:20.702 --> 00:14:22.426
Thank you for listening.

00:14:22.426 --> 00:14:25.352
(Applause)

00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:30.903
