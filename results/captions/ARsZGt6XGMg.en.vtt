00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
Before Donald Trump took the White House by
storm, he earned a college degree.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.940
Most of his kids followed suit and were well
known at their schools, but not always in

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.940
a good way.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.080
As for the first lady?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.200
Well, her academic history is murkier than
Donald's tax returns.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.380
Let's study the Trumps' education.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.539
Not only does he describe himself as being,
quote, "like, really smart," Donald Trump

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.400
also boasted about having "one of the highest
IQs" in a May 2013 tweet.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.370
Perhaps it was his mental prowess that earned
him admission into an Ivy League college after

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.990
he graduated from high schoolâ€¦ or maybe
not.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.160
Donald attended Fordham University for two
years, before transferring to the University

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.830
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.140
The Washington Post reported that Trump squeezed
his way into the school, writing,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.900
Though he's now known for his boisterous and
cocky demeanor, the president reportedly made

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.440
a less memorable impression at his prestigious
college.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.600
According to the Boston Globe,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.320
Commencement details from his 1968 graduation
show that he didn't graduate anywhere near

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.479
the top of the class, according to the the
New York Times.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.340
He did, however, obtain a Bachelor of Science
degree in economics, according to Metro, and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.480
his alumni status certainly opened up a lot
of doors for his entire family.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.799
Donald Trump Jr. followed in his dad's footsteps
by enrolling in to the Wharton School at the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.200
University of Pennsylvania, but while his
dad supposedly shied away from the party scene,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.009
Don Jr. reportedly immersed himself in campus
life, earning a reputation of a wild child.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.460
Don Jr.'s former classmate, Scott Melker,
shared on Facebook,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.679
While speaking with New York magazine in 2004,
he looked back on his college years and all

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.240
but confirmed the rampant rumors, saying,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.580
Nonetheless, Don Jr. managed to hit the books
hard enough to earn a degree in finance and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.400
real estate, admitting to Oprah Winfrey that
bearing the Trump name certainly helped in

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400
this endeavor:

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.939
"We've been spoiled in terms of education,
been able to see the world, many things, but

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.740
I think there's definitely a stigmata [sic]
associated with it at times."

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.100
Ivanka Trump attended Georgetown University
for two years, before transferring to her

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.939
dad's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.439
The Daily Pennsylvanian reached out to some
of Ivanka's old classmates, and many of them

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.810
had nothing but kind words to say about the
first daughter.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.120
One former classmate said,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.760
However, not everyone was impressed by Ivanka's
college years.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.900
Another student claimed Ivanka "didn't seem
all that super intelligent" but added, "she

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.190
seemed nice enough."

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.200
Regardless, Ivanka's intelligence earned her
a degree in economics in 2004.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.580
While Donald Trump's eldest children chose
to attend his alma mater, Eric Trump bucked

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.680
the family tradition, bypassing the University
of Pennsylvania following his 2002 high school

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.459
graduation to become a co-ed at Georgetown
University, according to Business Insider.

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.629
Believe it or not, Eric didn't have to try
too hard to fly under the radar while on campus.

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.100
He told CBS News during his sophomore year,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.320
Eric graduated in 2006, according to Georgetown
Voice, with a degree in finance and management.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.620
The glam and flamboyant mama bear of the group,
Ivana Trump; mother of Eric, Ivanka, and Don

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.780
Jr.; grew up in Czechoslovakia and was known
by her childhood friends for being "enviably

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.420
beautiful and hardworking," according to People
magazine.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.350
She reportedly went to work as a model and
also attended Charles University in Prague,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.069
and earned a masters in physical education.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.370
Becoming Mrs. Trump signaled Ivana's entrance
into New York's elite circles, and her eventual

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.960
divorce from Donald left her with a cool $14
million in her bank account, according to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.220
the New York Times.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.800
So, perhaps she doesn't really need a college
degree after all.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.900
Tiffany Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump
and his second ex-wife, actress Marla Maples,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.690
may not be as well known as some of her half-siblings.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.449
However, she's making some major moves behind
the scenes, pushing her education to levels

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.650
that no other Trump has gone before.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.990
Tiffany enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania
and graduated with a double major in sociology

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.880
and urban studies in May 2016.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.700
Her father told People magazine prior to her
graduation,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.360
Unlike her sister Ivanka, Tiffany didn't hang
up her cap and gown and make a beeline for

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.020
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.020
Instead, she threw herself right back into
the books by enrolling at Georgetown Law.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.060
When her husband was President-Elect Donald
Trump, first lady-elect Melania Trump had

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.390
a rather robust biography on the incoming
administration's official website.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.569
The site initially claimed she obtained a
degree in architecture and design from a university

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.010
in her native Slovenia.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.819
However, that contradicted an April 2016 GQ
piece, which stated she had "decamped to Milan

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.759
after her first year of college, effectively
dropping out."

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.430
So what's the truth?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.500
NBC News contacted a professor who said he
briefly instructed Melania in Slovenia.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.600
He had this to say:

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.560
Eventually, Melania was forced to address
the speculation.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.590
Her bio was revised, briefly, to state that
she had "paused her studies to advance her

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.020
modeling career in Milan and Paris."

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.130
As of the making of this video, however, Melania's
official White House bio no longer mentions

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.720
her educational achievements at all.
