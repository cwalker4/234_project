00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.700
All right, I want to see a show of hands:

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.154
how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:21.696
because they said something offensive
about politics or religion,

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.825
childcare, food?

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:26.106
(Laughter)

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:29.042
And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.852
because you just don't want
to talk to them?

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:34.372
(Laughter)

00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:37.620
You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.902
we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:42.777
Stick to the weather and your health.

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:46.223
But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:47.724
(Laughter)

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:48.984
are not safe either.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:51.405
So this world that we live in,

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:54.359
this world in which every conversation

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.662
has the potential
to devolve into an argument,

00:00:56.662 --> 00:00:59.050
where our politicians
can't speak to one another

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.405
and where even the most trivial of issues

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:06.380
have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.394
Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults,

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:12.199
and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized,

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:13.699
we are more divided,

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.220
than we ever have been in history.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.867
We're less likely to compromise,

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.365
which means we're
not listening to each other.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.560
And we make decisions about where to live,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.241
who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be,

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.605
based on what we already believe.

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.167
Again, that means
we're not listening to each other.

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:33.723
A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening,

00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:36.600
and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.515
Now, part of that is due to technology.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.160
The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.869
or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.209
According to Pew Research,

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.536
about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.136
And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.240
than they are to talk
to them face to face.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.956
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:02.812
It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell.

00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:04.948
And he gave his kids
a communication project.

00:02:04.948 --> 00:02:08.684
He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes.

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.589
And he said this: "I came to realize..."

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.876
(Laughter)

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:17.052
"I came to realize
that conversational competence

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:21.148
might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach.

00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:25.444
Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens,

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.300
but rarely do they have an opportunity

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.876
to hone their interpersonal
communications skills.

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:33.052
It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves:

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.988
Is there any 21st-century skill

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:40.564
more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?"

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.156
Now, I make my living talking to people:

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:45.412
Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,

00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:47.828
billionaires, kindergarten teachers,

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.524
heads of state, plumbers.

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:53.572
I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don't like.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.356
I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.132
But I still have
a great conversation with them.

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:04.028
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:05.388
and how to listen.

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.188
Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.164
things like look the person in the eye,

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:14.980
think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.756
look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention,

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:22.652
repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it.

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:24.388
So I want you to forget all of that.

00:03:24.388 --> 00:03:25.604
It is crap.

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:28.620
(Laughter)

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.016
There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:36.672
if you are in fact paying attention.

00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:38.528
(Laughter)

00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:41.424
(Applause)

00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:46.834
Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:48.970
that I do in regular life.

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:52.906
So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people,

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:57.016
and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:58.541
Learn to have a conversation

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.056
without wasting your time,
without getting bored,

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.556
and, please God,
without offending anybody.

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:06.286
We've all had really great conversations.

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.666
We've had them before.
We know what it's like.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:12.246
The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired,

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:14.776
or where you feel
like you've made a real connection

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:16.946
or you've been perfectly understood.

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:18.336
There is no reason

00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:21.123
why most of your interactions
can't be like that.

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:24.486
So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them,

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:28.146
but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it,

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:30.736
you'll already enjoy better conversations.

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:33.076
Number one: Don't multitask.

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:35.386
And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:38.216
or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:40.076
I mean, be present.

00:04:40.076 --> 00:04:42.056
Be in that moment.

00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:45.576
Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss.

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:48.216
Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner.

00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:50.416
If you want to get out
of the conversation,

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.146
get out of the conversation,

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:54.171
but don't be half in it
and half out of it.

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:56.166
Number two: Don't pontificate.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.345
If you want to state your opinion

00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:03.996
without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth,

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.560
write a blog.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.876
(Laughter)

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.596
Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show:

00:05:12.596 --> 00:05:14.479
Because they're really boring.

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.348
If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.

00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:20.430
If they're liberal, they're going to hate

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.766
big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:24.022
Totally predictable.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:25.718
And you don't want to be like that.

00:05:25.718 --> 00:05:29.514
You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn.

00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:33.196
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said

00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:37.376
that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself.

00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:40.680
And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion.

00:05:41.497 --> 00:05:44.636
He said that sensing this acceptance,

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:47.576
the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:50.226
and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.810
of his or her mind to the listener.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.710
Again, assume that you have
something to learn.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.312
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't."

00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:02.000
I put it this way:

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.160
Everybody is an expert in something.

00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:09.496
Number three: Use open-ended questions.

00:06:09.496 --> 00:06:11.816
In this case, take a cue from journalists.

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:15.306
Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how.

00:06:15.346 --> 00:06:19.176
If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out.

00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:21.470
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.826
you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence,

00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:28.276
which is "terrified," and the answer is
"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:30.480
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.976
Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know.

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:35.856
Try asking them things like,
"What was that like?"

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:37.556
"How did that feel?"

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:41.726
Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it,

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:44.890
and you're going to get
a much more interesting response.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.341
Number four: Go with the flow.

00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:50.678
That means thoughts
will come into your mind

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.596
and you need to let them
go out of your mind.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:55.899
We've heard interviews often

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.120
in which a guest is talking
for several minutes

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.766
and then the host comes back in
and asks a question

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:04.195
which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered.

00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:07.306
That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago

00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:10.446
because he thought
of this really clever question,

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:13.356
and he was just bound
and determined to say that.

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:15.756
And we do the exact same thing.

00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:18.366
We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone,

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:21.952
and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:23.598
(Laughter)

00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:25.125
And we stop listening.

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:28.269
We're just waiting for a moment
to interject our story

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.488
about Hugh Jackman and coffee.

00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:32.517
Stories and ideas
are going to come to you.

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:35.861
You need to let them come and let them go.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:40.242
Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know.

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:43.679
Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR,

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:46.318
are much more aware
that they're going on the record,

00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:49.730
and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.168
and what they claim to know for sure.

00:07:52.168 --> 00:07:54.450
Do that. Err on the side of caution.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.891
Talk should not be cheap.

00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:00.744
Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs.

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:04.274
If they're talking
about having lost a family member,

00:08:04.274 --> 00:08:07.513
don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member.

00:08:07.513 --> 00:08:10.462
If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work,

00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:12.942
don't tell them about
how much you hate your job.

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:15.020
It's not the same. It is never the same.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.056
All experiences are individual.

00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:19.844
And, more importantly,
it is not about you.

00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:23.432
You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are

00:08:23.432 --> 00:08:25.801
or how much you've suffered.

00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:28.925
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said,

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.795
"I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers."

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:34.133
(Laughter)

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:37.224
Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity.

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:39.062
[Conversation in the 21st century]

00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:42.072
[How are you today?
Read my blog!]

00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:43.753
Number seven:

00:08:43.753 --> 00:08:45.517
Try not to repeat yourself.

00:08:45.517 --> 00:08:47.615
It's condescending,
and it's really boring,

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.179
and we tend to do it a lot.

00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:52.739
Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids,

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.173
we have a point to make,

00:08:54.173 --> 00:08:57.040
so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over.

00:08:57.354 --> 00:08:58.812
Don't do that.

00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:00.906
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.786
Frankly, people don't care

00:09:03.786 --> 00:09:06.381
about the years, the names,

00:09:06.381 --> 00:09:08.672
the dates, all those details

00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:11.360
that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.658
They don't care.
What they care about is you.

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:15.771
They care about what you're like,

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:17.814
what you have in common.

00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:20.514
So forget the details. Leave them out.

00:09:20.854 --> 00:09:22.201
Number nine:

00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:25.320
This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.727
Listen.

00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:30.306
I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:34.412
that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill

00:09:34.412 --> 00:09:35.639
that you could develop.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.318
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:09:37.318 --> 00:09:39.744
"If your mouth is open,
you're not learning."

00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:44.155
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man
ever listened his way out of a job."

00:09:44.893 --> 00:09:46.818
(Laughter)

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.792
Why do we not listen to each other?

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.270
Number one, we'd rather talk.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.098
When I'm talking, I'm in control.

00:09:53.098 --> 00:09:55.797
I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in.

00:09:55.797 --> 00:09:57.320
I'm the center of attention.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.956
I can bolster my own identity.

00:09:59.956 --> 00:10:01.485
But there's another reason:

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.002
We get distracted.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:06.076
The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute,

00:10:06.076 --> 00:10:10.317
but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute.

00:10:10.588 --> 00:10:14.495
So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:17.818
And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:20.140
to actually pay attention to someone,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.662
but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation.

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:25.540
You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.972
in the same place.

00:10:26.972 --> 00:10:28.745
(Laughter)

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:31.650
You have to listen to one another.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.886
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:37.323
He said, "Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand.

00:10:37.323 --> 00:10:40.144
We listen with the intent to reply."

00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:45.701
One more rule, number 10,
and it's this one: Be brief.

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:50.306
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt;
short enough to retain interest,

00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:52.978
but long enough to cover
the subject. -- My Sister]

00:10:52.978 --> 00:10:54.584
(Laughter)

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:56.350
(Applause)

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:04.611
All of this boils down to the same
basic concept, and it is this one:

00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.330
Be interested in other people.

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:10.657
You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather,

00:11:10.657 --> 00:11:12.927
and there was kind of a ritual in my home.

00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:15.433
People would come over
to talk to my grandparents,

00:11:15.433 --> 00:11:18.308
and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us,

00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:20.515
and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:22.453
She was the runner-up to Miss America.

00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:23.959
He was the mayor of Sacramento.

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:26.956
She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer."

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:29.811
And I kind of grew up assuming

00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:33.398
everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:37.149
And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.412
I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can,

00:11:40.412 --> 00:11:42.018
I keep my mind open,

00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:44.006
and I'm always prepared to be amazed,

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:46.622
and I'm never disappointed.

00:11:47.087 --> 00:11:48.604
You do the same thing.

00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:51.221
Go out, talk to people,

00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:52.566
listen to people,

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:55.871
and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed.

00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:57.776
Thanks.

00:11:57.776 --> 00:11:59.764
(Applause)
