00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.902
Ms. Sanders:
Good afternoon.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.374
As you know, the President
welcomed the Emir of Qatar

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.808
to the White House today.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:12.145
The two leaders discussed
the strategic relationship

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.115
and our cooperation on a
wide range of security

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.683
and economic issues.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.586
This includes efforts to
bolster their military

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.021
capabilities and to
advance new commercial

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.224
deals that would create
tens of thousands

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.992
of American jobs.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.094
The Emir reiterated his
commitment to counter

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.164
terrorist financing
and violent extremism.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.566
As you may recall, just
a few weeks ago, Qatar

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.369
publicly designated 20
terrorist financiers

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.904
and 6 entities.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.540
This is the latest in a
series of important steps,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.176
but the President and Emir
agreed that there is more

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.545
progress to be made.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.047
We are committed to
partnering in that effort.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.383
Finally, the two leaders
discussed the urgent need

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.285
to resolve the
Gulf dispute.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.421
The United States must be
able to work jointly with

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.923
a united Gulf Cooperation
Council to promote

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.526
regional security and
stability, and to stand

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.495
against Iran's
dangerous activities.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.664
Also, as you may have
seen, the President spoke

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:08.768
this morning with British
Prime Minister Theresa May.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.304
Both leaders condemned
Syrian President Assad's

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:14.307
vicious disregard for
human life and agreed not

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.477
to allow the use of
chemical weapons to continue.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.779
To that end, the President
will not attend the Summit

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.948
of the Americas or travel
to Colombia,

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.683
as originally scheduled.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.685
The Vice President will
travel to the summit in

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.787
his place and will meet
with the Colombian

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:30.623
President while
he's there in Peru.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.625
President Trump will
remain in the United

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.361
States to oversee the
American response to Syria

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.298
and to monitor
developments around the world.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.633
Looking ahead to this
afternoon, the President

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.902
is pleased to welcome the
University of Alabama

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.005
Crimson Tide football team
to the White House, in

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.309
celebration of their 17th
National Championship.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.511
Pretty sure that was written 
by somebody from Alabama.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.345
(Laughter)

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.414
Coach Saban, UA
President Bell, and the

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.416
team captains will meet
with President Trump in

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.585
the Oval Office, and the
group will then join the

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.087
rest of the team and
hundreds of Tide fans out

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.088
on the South Lawn.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.824
And that event will, of
course, be open to the press.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.093
And with that, I will
take your questions.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.761
And because it is her
birthday --

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.096
Nadia, I'm going to go with you.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.030
And happy birthday.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.031
The Press: Thank you.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.233
Thank you, Sarah.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.768
The President authorized
the use of military force

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.439
last year after President
Assad used chemical weapons.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.542
But this didn't
seem to deter him.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.944
The President talked
yesterday of a very strong

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.547
and serious response now.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.116
How is he going to hold 
President Assad accountable?

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.084
Ms. Sanders: I'm sorry,
could you repeat the last

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:31.918
part of the question?

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:32.685
The Press: How he's going
to hold

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.521
President Assad 
accountable now?

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.922
Ms. Sanders: The
President has been clear.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.924
We're working with our
partners and allies and

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.294
our national security team
to look at all options.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.663
And as we've said, all
options are on the table,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.899
but I'm not going to get
ahead of anything the

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.168
President or may not do in
response to what's taken

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.103
place in Syria.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.004
Jon.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.673
The Press: Sarah, talking
about the raid on Michael

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.775
Cohen's office, the
President said,

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.944
"It's an attack on 
our country...

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.945
It's an attack

00:02:58.945 --> 00:02:59.946
on what we all stand for."

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.750
In what way is an FBI raid
on Michael Cohen's office

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.184
an attack on our country?

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.920
Ms. Sanders: I think that
the President has been

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.156
clear that he thinks that
this has gone too far.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.158
And beyond that, I don't
have anything to add, but

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.160
I'd refer you back to the
President's comments.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.995
The Press: But that accounts 
to an attack on our country?

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.997
Ms. Sanders: Again, I
think the President has

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.365
been clear what
his position is.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.700
I don't have anything else
to add at this point.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.534
The Press: Does the
President believe he has

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.037
the power to fire Special
Counsel Robert Mueller?

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.371
Does he believe that's
within his power?

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.506
Ms. Sanders: Certainly,
believes he has the

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.440
power to do so.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.541
John.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.576
The Press: If I could, you
have said several times

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.744
from the podium that the
President has neither the

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.714
intention nor is thinking
about firing Robert Mueller.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.449
Does that remain
the case today?

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.084
Ms. Sanders: The President
was asked this question

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.054
directly last night, and I'd 
refer you back to his comments.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.122
The Press: Can I also ask:
What about Rod Rosenstein?

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.091
What's the President's
thinking about Rosenstein,

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.694
in terms of his tenure at
the Department of Justice?

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:51.197
He did not appear to be
very happy with him last night.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:54.667
And can you confirm
that Rosenstein was the

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.503
high-level DOJ official
that signed off on the FBI

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.072
raid of Cohen's office?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.006
Ms. Sanders: I'd refer
you to the Department of

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.209
Justice in terms
of their process.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.844
Certainly, the President
has voiced his

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.579
frustrations, but beyond
that, I don't

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.447
have anything else.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.481
Shannon.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:09.949
The Press: Is the
President still open to

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.751
talking to Mueller?

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.119
Is he still open
to an interview?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.988
Ms. Sanders: That's
something that I would

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.756
direct you to the
President's personal

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.458
attorneys to answer
that question.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.792
The Press: And we asked
about Rosenstein.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.361
What about FBI
Director Wray?

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.030
He was the one who signed
off, supposedly,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.365
on this FBI raid.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.367
Does the President still
have confidence in him?

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.701
Ms. Sanders: Again, I
would refer you to the

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.771
Department of Justice on
the process, and who did

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:32.472
or did not sign off.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.107
That's not something that
we were a part of here.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.041
The Press: But
specifically, on the

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.275
President's feelings about
the FBI Director, does he

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.443
have concerns about
the FBI Director?

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.945
Ms. Sanders: The President
has voiced his frustration

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.846
with the situation.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.948
I haven't spoken with him
directly about Direct Wray.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:42.682
Jill.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:43.416
The Press: Two things.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:44.584
Just to follow up on that,
has the President spoken

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.753
with either Jeff Sessions
or Rosenstein since the

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:47.720
raid yesterday?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.755
Ms. Sanders: Not
that I'm aware of.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:49.455
The Press: Okay.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.690
And then I wanted to ask
you about the decision to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.791
cancel the trip.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.226
Can you walk us through
a little bit more of the

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.662
decision-making and why
the President felt like he

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.664
couldn't make a decision
-- he couldn't execute on

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.966
whatever he decides to
do while he's traveling,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.436
considering that the
missile strike last year

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.905
was actually launched while 
the President was in Mar-a-Lago?

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.608
Ms. Sanders: Mar-a-Lago happens 
to be within the United States,

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:11.310
something I'm sure you're 
very well aware of.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.945
The President would like
to stay in the country

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.182
while there are a lot of
developments going on

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.050
around the world.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.284
The Press: What does being
in the country -- how does

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.419
that benefit him?

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.386
Ms. Sanders: Again, I'm
not going to get into

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.289
specifics on intel matters
and things that we may or

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.190
may not do.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.092
But the President and his
national security team

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:29.328
felt it was best that he
stay in the United States

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.497
while all of these
developments are taking place.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.799
Jackie.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.901
The Press: Does Michael Cohen 
still represent the President?

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.669
Ms. Sanders: I'm not sure.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.171
I would refer you to
Michael Cohen on that.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.605
The Press: And when did
the President first learn

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.041
of the payment from
Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.676
and their
nondisclosure agreement?

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.111
Ms. Sanders: I'm not sure
on the exact timing.

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:45.912
Kristen.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:46.679
The Press: And did
the President --

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.547
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, I'm going
to keep moving

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.381
because we're tight on time.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.248
Kristen.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:49.916
The Press: Just one
more question, Sarah.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:50.917
If the President denies having 
an affair with Stormy Daniels --

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:51.951
Ms. Sanders: Sorry,

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:52.719
Jackie, I'm going
to keep moving.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.619
Go ahead, Kristen.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.420
The Press: -- then
why did he instruct --

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.088
Ms. Sanders: Jackie,
I'm going to move on to Kristen.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.789
Sorry, we're tight on time
with the visit

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.291
of the Alabama team
coming up soon.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.358
Go ahead.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.461
The Press: Well, just, can you 
follow up on that question?

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.562
Ms. Sanders: I didn't
hear the question.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:03.663
The Press: Does he
continue to deny having an

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:04.731
affair with Stormy -

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.865
The Press: Then why doesn't 
he just instruct Mr. Cohen to --

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:06.833
Ms. Sanders: The President 
has been clear.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:07.734
He has addressed
this several times.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.601
I don't have
anything else to add.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.302
Brian.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.369
The Press: I'd like to
follow up --

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.771
The Press: Sarah, let me just
ask my other question.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.406
Can you just say
definitively, has the

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.808
President had any
conversations about firing

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.277
Jeff Sessions, Rod
Rosenstein, or Robert Mueller

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:19.378
in the
last 24 hours?

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:20.546
Ms. Sanders: I haven't had
any conversations

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.447
with him on that.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:21.948
I can't speak beyond that.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:22.915
The Press: And can you
clarify -- can you just

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:23.683
clarify his tweet?

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:24.450
Ms. Sanders:
Sorry, Kristen.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.384
We got to keep
going, guys.

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:26.152
The Press: He called it
a "witch hunt,"

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.954
but Rod Rosenstein, who he
appointed, signed off

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:28.855
on the probe.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:29.989
Ms. Sanders: Go ahead.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.693
The Press: Well, answer
her if -- go ahead, Kristen.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:35.161
The Press: Can you just
answer the question:

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.997
If the President appointed
Rod Rosenstein, and so how

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.400
can he call the raid
yesterday, a "witch hunt"

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.036
when it was approved
by the Deputy Attorney

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.171
General he appointed?

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.939
Ms. Sanders: Once again,
I'm not aware of what the

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.909
process is and who signs
off on those specific

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.644
types of things.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.180
The President certainly
has been very clear about

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.683
what his position is when
it comes to matters of

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.219
collusion, and that's
what his reference is.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.355
He thinks this entire
thing is a witch hunt.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:06.459
I think we've spoken about 
this at length, ad nauseam.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.395
And frankly, I think it's
a big distraction that the

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.430
media has spent every
single day, for the last

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.633
year, focused on this
instead of some of the

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:16.235
biggest issues of our day
and some of the biggest

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.938
issues that the President
is dealing with, like

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.975
Syria, like North Korea,
like deregulation, tax cuts,

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.076
defeating ISIS.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.745
Those are the -- that's
the focus of this

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.547
administration, and
frankly, that's what you

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:28.981
guys should spend a
little bit more time on.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.082
The Press: My follow-up -- So, 
Sarah, my follow-up question --

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.017
Ms. Sanders:
Hey, guys -- time out.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.952
We're going to take -- you 
yielded your time to Kristen.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:33.920
I'm going to go to John.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.121
The Press: No,
no, wait a minute.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.055
I had a follow-up
question.

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:36.789
Please, if I may,
just a follow-up.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.623
Ms. Sanders: Sorry.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.357
All right, I'll come back
to you, Brian, for one.

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:39.292
The Press: Thanks.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:39.992
You had said that it is a
little --

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:40.693
Ms. Sanders: I'm feeling 
generous today.

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:41.360
The Press: Thank you.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.128
Thank you.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:42.695
Ms. Sanders: For
Nadia's birthday.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:43.362
(Laughter)

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:44.163
The Press:
Jus two quick ones.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.032
So, you said that it's
a witch hunt and you've

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.334
continued to characterize
it as that, but not so

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:50.670
much as this
administration also has

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.272
leveled sanctions against
the 13 Russians that were

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:56.509
indicted by the
Mueller investigation.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:59.245
In some point, are you a
party to this witch hunt,

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.949
or is some of it, at
least, a legitimate effort?

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.717
Ms. Sanders: Just because
there many have been

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.619
involvement by Russia
doesn't mean there was

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.687
involvement by the
Trump campaign.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.621
The Press: No, no, no --

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.656
Ms. Sanders: And to try to 
conflate the two is insane.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.757
The Press: No -- no,
that's not the question.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.092
The question is: In some
ways, aren't you at least

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:14.260
supporting what
they've done?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.595
Because they've indicted
some of the people that

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.897
you have leveled
sanctions against.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.032
So, you're in agreement
with Mueller in at least

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.801
some regards, right?

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.170
Ms. Sanders: We've been
outspoken on a number of

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.340
occasions that we think
that Russia was involved

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.342
in election meddling
and we've taken actions

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.977
because of that.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.512
But that has nothing to do
with whether or not the

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:36.015
President and his campaign
had anything to do with that.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.550
The Press: That wasn't my
-- and then my quick --

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.985
Ms. Sanders: Sorry, I'm
going to keep moving.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:39.652
The Press: And my quick
follow-up --

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:40.553
Ms. Sanders: John.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:41.554
Guys, one at a time.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:42.755
Go ahead, John.

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.056
The Press: Thanks
a lot, Sarah.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.291
Ms. Sanders:
Sorry, right here.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.626
The Press: Thanks
a lot, Sarah.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:47.393
What is the --

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:48.060
Ms. Sanders: Kind of 
crazy today.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.095
(Laughter)

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.296
The Press:
Wha is the nature of the

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.798
President's relationship
right now with

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:53.866
Attorney General 
Jeff Sessions?

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.535
He really voiced his
displeasure with him last

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:57.603
evening in his remarks.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:59.472
Is it a good relationship?

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.474
Does he risk being
fired right now?

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.942
Ms. Sanders: I think the
President was pretty clear

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:06.045
about his frustrations
when he spoke about that

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:06.879
last night.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.747
The Press: Another one.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:08.881
Real quick, Sarah,
if you don't mind.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.718
It's about the EPA
Administrator, Mr. Pruitt.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.621
If it turns out that he
lied in the interview that

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:18.624
he gave with Fox News --
my colleague Ed Henry --

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:21.260
would that be problematic
for him in terms of

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.561
holding onto his job?

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.363
Ms. Sanders: I'm not going
to get into hypothetical

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.600
situations, but certainly
the President would expect

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.804
all members of his Cabinet
to be honest and certainly

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:32.872
open with the public.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.706
Michael.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.242
The Press: So, the
President last night

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:40.179
seemed to combine his
reaction to the Russia

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:43.215
investigation -- which
we've heard him say before --

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:46.385
and this new
investigation that has

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:49.288
grown out of the raids in
New York of his attorney.

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:53.292
Does he view that as one
in the same investigation?

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.528
In other words, does he
think that's all, kind of,

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.363
under the umbrella of
the Special Counsel?

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.666
Or does he view the Russia
investigation as separate

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:04.537
from the probe into the
payments by these women

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:07.673
that is apparently being
conducted by the U.S.

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:08.975
Attorney's office
in New York?

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:11.510
Ms. Sanders: I think
certainly that they are

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.648
separate investigation,
but I think that publicly

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.316
they have been
conflated quite a bit.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.317
Steve.

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:19.819
The Press: Thank
you, Sarah.

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:24.056
Does the United States
expect that, in a response

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.693
to the Syria chemical
weapons attack, that other

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:28.928
nations will join in?

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.330
Specifically, we're seeing
indications from France

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.235
and the Saudis that they
may also take military action.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:38.537
Ms. Sanders: We've had a
number of conversations,

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:42.808
both the President with
President Macron and Prime

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.845
Minister May, and at
various other levels --

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.813
not just with those
countries, but others, at

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:48.814
an administration level.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.816
And we're going to
continue to work with a

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.052
number of our partners and
allies as we determine

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.353
what the next
best steps are.

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:55.221
April.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:57.023
The Press: Sarah,
two questions.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.724
The President said
yesterday he was

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:01.394
compliant; that he turned
over a million documents.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:04.997
If he was compliant with
these investigation, why

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.866
was there a search
warrant needed?

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.402
Ms. Sanders: This doesn't
have anything to do with

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.669
the President, and I would
refer you

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:12.271
to Michael Cohen 
and his attorney.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.374
When it comes to matters
of the Special Counsel and

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:16.575
dealings with the
President, we've been

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:17.610
fully cooperative.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.711
The Press: Okay, and
the next question.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.213
With all of this turmoil,
particularly this last

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:24.683
week, has the President
at any time thought about

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.419
stepping down
before or now?

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.720
Ms. Sanders: No.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.588
And I think that's an
absolutely ridiculous question.

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:30.456
The Press: No, it's
not ridiculous.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.390
It's not ridiculous.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.258
Ms. Sanders: I gave you
two questions, April.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:33.125
We're moving on.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:33.893
Jordan, go ahead.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:34.393
The Press: It is a
legitimate question.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.494
It's not ridiculous.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:36.896
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:39.465
Did the National Security
Advisor, John Bolton,

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.300
force Tom Bossert
out of his job?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.803
Ms. Sanders: I'm not going
to get into specific

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.439
details about the
ongoings of personnel.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.507
But I can tell you
that he resigned.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:51.310
The President feels he's
done a great job and

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.512
wishes him the best
as he moves forward.

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:56.649
The Press: Sarah, the
President tweeted

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.651
favorably today about
some of the promises that

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.654
President Xi has made
toward instituting some

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:05.057
market reforms in China,
but he said this before.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.560
Is it going to be enough
to avert some of the tariffs

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.129
that the President has been 
talking about instituting?

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.364
Ms. Sanders: Certainly,
we are encouraged by

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:15.234
President Xi's words
and his kind words.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.603
But at the same time,
we want to see concrete

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.573
actions from China, and
we're going to continue

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.341
moving forward in the
process and in the

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.909
negotiations until
those happen.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:24.810
Pamela.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.112
The Press: Has the
President spoken with

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:27.413
Michael Cohen
since the raids?

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:28.747
Ms. Sanders: Not
that I'm aware of.

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.382
The Press: And can I just
ask you -- you said that

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:33.018
he believes, he views this
as sort of crossing the line.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.454
Can you explain a little
bit more why these raids

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.356
on his personal attorney
is viewed by the President

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:38.357
as crossing the line?

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:39.725
Ms. Sanders: I don't have
anything else to add on

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:40.726
that front right now.

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.328
Right here, in the front.

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:43.095
The Press: I just want 
to clarify something

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:43.929
you said earlier.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.231
You said the President
believes he has the power

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.832
to fire Robert Mueller,
because usually, most

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.567
legal experts believe that
he would have to order

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:51.003
Deputy Attorney General
Rod Rosenstein to fire

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:53.272
Mueller, and Rosenstein
could, of course, refuse.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.307
Ms. Sanders: I know a
number of individuals in

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.611
the legal community,
and including at the

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.247
Department of Justice, that 
he has the power to do so.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.948
But I don't have any
further announcements on --

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.383
The Press: They've
consistently said that it is.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:05.684
They've told
me; I've asked.

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.586
They've said it's Rod
Rosenstein oversees the

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.422
Special Counsel, and only
he has the power to fire

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:11.724
the Special Counsel.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.059
Ms. Sanders: Again, we've
been advised that the

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.695
President certainly has
the power to make that decision.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.797
I can't go anything
beyond that.

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:19.665
Dave.

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:20.733
The Press: Sarah, thanks.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.301
The British government
said they're still looking

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.404
for confirmation that
Assad used chemical

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:26.872
weapons last weekend.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.475
Is the President still looking 
for confirmation of that?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.678
Ms. Sanders: I can't get into 
specific classified information.

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.147
But I can tell you we feel
confident in the comments

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.448
that we've made up
until this point.

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.416
John.

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.551
The Press: Thank
you, Sarah.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.720
Two questions, with
brevity, on Ambassador Bolton.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.589
(Laughter)

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:44.657
With the
resignations --

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.658
Ms. Sanders: We'll believe
when we see it, right?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.592
(Laughter)

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.760
The Press: With the 
resignations of Michael Anton

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.462
and now Tom Bossert, can 
we expect any other

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:54.366
changes of
personnel in his family?

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.935
Ms. Sanders: I don't
have any other personnel

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.336
announcements to make at
this time -

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.437
The Press: The other question-

00:13:58.437 --> 00:13:59.438
Ms. Sanders: -- but we'll 
certainly keep you guys posted.

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:00.406
The Press: Right.

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:03.375
A year ago, Ambassador
Bolton was highly critical

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:06.145
in the op-ed
pages about U.S.

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.514
involvement with the World
Bank and the International

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.915
Monetary Fund.

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:13.752
With the World Bank-IMF
meeting coming up within a

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:19.425
matter of two weeks, is his 
position going to affect U.S.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.994
support for either
institution?

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:24.697
Ms. Sanders: I don't have
any policy changes on that

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.399
front at this time, and
don't expect any on that front.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.367
Francesca.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.802
The Press: Thank
you, Sarah.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:32.404
Yesterday, President
Trump said something very

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:33.706
interesting about Syria.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.008
He said that, "Because of
the power of the United

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.677
States and because of the
power of our country,

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.179
we're able to stop it."

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:43.115
Now, with bringing in 
Ambassador John Bolton as well --

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:46.018
which is sort of a
signal of a more hawkish

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.786
stance, potentially --
I want to know if the

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:50.256
President has changed his
calculus in any way on

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:53.092
Syria and on whether or
not he wants to pull out

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.527
those troops very soon,
as he previously said.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:58.230
Ms. Sanders: I addressed
the troops yesterday.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.266
I don't have anything
new on that front.

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.468
In terms of things that
the President may or may

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.969
not do, we're not
going to broadcast.

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:05.904
And I don't have any
announcements on that front.

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.072
Fred.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.575
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.111
Yeah, this week, Senator
McConnell said they're

00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:15.281
taking up six nominations
and that they're going to

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.049
continue taking up six
nominating per week.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.286
Do you consider that a
major breakthrough for the

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.021
administration considering 
there's been so many blocking --

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.155
Ms. Sanders:
We'd like to see them take

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:25.891
on a lot more than six,
but we're certainly glad

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.359
to see those six
move forward.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:30.262
But we'd like to see them
move forward in a much

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:33.565
bigger fashion than just
the single digits right now.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.534
The Press: And one
other question.

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.970
On U.S. Attorney Berman, he's 
in an interim position

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.071
now in New York.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.440
Reports have been that the
President was going to

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.875
nominate him
for full-time.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:44.143
Is that still the case?

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.312
Will the President
nominate him?

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.579
Ms. Sanders: I don't
have any personnel

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.714
announcements
on that front.

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.515
Saagar.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:50.749
The Press: Thanks, Sarah.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:54.053
So, all of the evidence so
far in the Syrian chemical

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:56.422
attack points to the
use of chlorine gas.

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.590
The Assad regime has
been suspected of using

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.859
chlorine multiple times
on the battlefield.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.462
What makes this particular
attack different and

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.198
warrant the international
response and the potential

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.500
use of lethal force that we're 
seeing from this President?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.536
Ms. Sanders: I can't
address specific

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.604
intelligence matters, but
I think everyone around

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.140
the world can see why
these recent attacks

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.275
are so horrific.

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.510
Beyond that, I can't get
into any other details.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.511
Eamon.

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:20.479
The Press: Yeah,
thanks, Sarah.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.548
To clarify your comment
here on Xi Jinping's

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:24.783
speech last night, it was
seen as rhetoric

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:26.218
around trade openness.

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:28.320
Are you saying that the
President didn't see

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.989
anything in that speech
that would encourage him

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:32.891
to back off on his threat
to impose tariffs

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:33.859
on the Chinese?

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:34.893
Ms. Sanders: We certainly
think it's a step in the

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.563
right direction and we're
encouraged by the words,

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.498
but we want to see
concrete steps and

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:41.667
concrete action
by the Chinese.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:45.437
In the meantime, we're going 
to continue moving forward.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:46.872
The Press: What specific
actions do you want

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:47.773
to see from the Chinese?

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.808
What could they do here to
stave off those tariffs

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:50.676
at this point?

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.477
Ms. Sanders: This is going
to be something that's

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:52.611
part of private
negotiations that we have

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:53.445
with the Chinese.

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.080
But certainly, we want to
see more than just the

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.483
rhetoric, but we think
that's a very good sign in

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:58.450
moving in the
right direction.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.918
We got time for
one last question.

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:00.519
Blake.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.121
The Press: (Inaudible)

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.722
(Laughter)

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:05.524
The Press: And to pick up 
on it I guess --

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.525
I missed that, I don't know.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.526
Ms. Sanders: I didn't hear
it, so -- I think they

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.460
were saying they
thought you were great.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.628
I'm pretty sure
that was it.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.163
The Press: To pick up and
end off where Eamon just --

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.165
what he was just
talking about.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.101
You said you want to see
concrete actions from the

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.770
Chinese as it
relates to trade.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.639
Do you feel that there
will actually be, at some

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.974
point, concrete actions?

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:24.543
Or is all of this right
now hope and talk and --

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.845
Ms. Sanders: Again,
we certainly hope so.

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.715
We think this is an
encouraging step in the

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:30.582
right direction.

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:33.485
But at the same time,
we're going to continue

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:36.355
moving forward in the
actions that the President

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:40.125
has announced, and hopeful
that we see something come

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.293
out of the Chinese
government.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:43.028
The Press: I ask because
it feels almost today like

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.496
it's been somewhat of
a lukewarm reception.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.564
Is that accurate?

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.598
Ms. Sanders: No.

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.901
As the President himself
said, he appreciates

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.403
President Xi's kind words,
but we want to see

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:52.471
more than just words.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.107
We want to see action, and
that's what we're focused

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:58.243
on pushing forward, is
making sure that we stop

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.812
the unfair trade
practices.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.280
That's been what the
President is committed to --

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.515
not just rhetoric,
but actual action.

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:04.950
Thanks so much.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.553
And we'll see you guys out
on the South Lawn as we

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.087
welcome the Crimson Tide.
