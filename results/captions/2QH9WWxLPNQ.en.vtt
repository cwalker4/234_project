00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.010
In the early 1700s, Peter the Great's reforms
put Russia on the path to becoming a great

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.800
European power.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.980
But it was his grandson's German wife, Catherine,
who deposed her husband to become Empress

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.739
of Russia, who oversaw the completion of that
transformation.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:46.149
Like Peter, she too would be remembered as
'the Great'.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.629
Catherine was a student and admirer of the
French Enlightenment, and even corresponded

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.120
with the French philosopher Voltaire.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.760
She reigned as an 'enlightened autocrat' – her
power was unchecked, but she pursued ideals

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.100
of reason, tolerance and progress:

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.020
Catherine became a great patron of the arts,
and learning.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.820
Schools and colleges were built, the Bolshoi
theatre was founded, as well as the Imperial

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.740
Academy of Fine Arts, while her own magnificent
collection of artwork now forms the basis

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
of the world-famous Hermitage museum.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.479
Catherine encouraged Europeans to move to
Russia to share their expertise, and helped

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.150
German migrants to settle in the Volga region,
where they became known as 'Volga Germans'.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.310
Their communities survived nearly 200 years,
until on Stalin's orders, they were deported

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.729
east at the start of World War 2.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.939
Catherine's reign also saw enormous territorial
expansion.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.700
In the south, Russia defeated the Ottoman
Empire, winning new lands, and the fortresses

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.200
of Azov and Kerch.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.459
But then Catherine faced a major peasant revolt
led by the renegade cossack Yemelyan Pugachev.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.091
The rebels took many fortresses and towns,
and stormed the city of Kazan, before they

00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:24.620
were finally defeated by the Russian army.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.900
Catherine then forcibly incorporated the Zaporozhian
Cossacks into the Russian Empire, and annexed

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.069
the Crimean Khanate – a thorn in Russia's
side for 300 years.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.540
Russia's new lands in the south were named
Novorossiya - 'New Russia'.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.519
Sparsely populated, they were settled by Russian
colonists under the supervision of Prince

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.159
Potemkin, Catherine's advisor and lover.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.629
The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, exhausted
by war and at the mercy of its neighbours,

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.330
was carved up in a series of partitions, with
Russia taking the lion's share.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.080
Poland did not re-emerge as an independent
nation until 1918.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.830
Russia inherited a large Jewish population
from Poland, who, Catherine decreed, could

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.720
live only in the so-called 'Pale of Settlement',
and were excluded from most cities.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.790
In France, the French Revolution led to the
execution of King Louis XVI.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.879
Catherine was horrified, and in the last years
of her reign, completely turned her back on

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.939
the liberal idealism of her youth.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:54.590
Three years later, Catherine died, ending
one of the most glorious reigns in Russian

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.150
history.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.400
She was succeeded by her son, Paul, a man
obsessed by military discipline and detail,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.370
and opposed to all his mother's works.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.700
Russia joined the coalition of European powers
fighting Revolutionary France.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.130
Marshal Suvorov, one of Russia's greatest
military commanders, won a series of victories

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.440
against the French in Northern Italy, but
the wider war was a failure.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.909
Meanwhile, Paul's reforms had alienated Russia's
army and nobility, and he was murdered in

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.710
a palace coup.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.110
He was succeeded by his 23 year old son Alexander,
who shared his grandmother Catherine's vision

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.450
for a more modern Russian state.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:57.270
His advisor, the brilliant Count Mikhail Speranksy,
reformed administration and finance, yet the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.669
Emperor refused to back his plans for a liberal
constitution.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:16.349
Ultimately, it was war with France that would
dominate Alexander's reign...

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:23.050
France had a new emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte,
who inflicted a series of defeats on Russia

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:31.160
and her allies at Austerlitz, Eylau and Friedland.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:39.150
But at Tilsit in 1807, the two young emperors
met, and made an alliance.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.670
Russia attacked Sweden, annexing Finland,
which became an autonomous Grand Duchy within

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.260
the Russian Empire.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.860
But then, in 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.770
At Borodino, French and Russian armies clashed
in a gigantic battle, one of the bloodiest

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.390
of the age.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.320
Napoleon emerged victorious, but the Russian
army escaped intact.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.700
Napoleon occupied Moscow, which was destroyed
by fire.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.810
And when Alexander refused to negotiate, the
French army was forced to make a long retreat

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:27.650
through the Russian winter, and was annihilated.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.750
Napoleon had been dealt a mortal blow.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.990
And Russia, alongside Prussia, Austria and
Britain, then led the fight back, which ended

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.399
in the capture of Paris and Napoleon's abdication.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:52.780
At the Congress of Vienna, as part of the
spoils of war, Alexander became 'King of Poland'.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.910
Then, with Austria, and Prussia, he formed
'The Holy Alliance', with the aim of preventing

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.279
further revolutions in Europe.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:09.880
Meanwhile, in the Balkans and Caucasus, Russia
had been waging intermittent wars against

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.140
the Ottoman Empire, Persia and local tribes.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:23.160
The frontier had been pushed south to incorporate
Bessarabia, Circassia, Chechnya, and much

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:30.490
of modern Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and
Armenia.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.209
But the peoples of the Caucasus bitterly resisted
Russian rule.

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:42.500
Russia's attempt to impose its authority on
the region led to the Caucasian War, a brutal

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.990
conflict, fought amongst the mountains and
forests, that would drag on for nearly 50

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.680
years.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.570
Alexander was succeeded by his brother Nicholas,
a conservative and reactionary.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:02.179
But parts of Russian society had now developed
an appetite for European-style liberalism

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:08.219
– including certain army officers, who'd
seen other ways of doing things during the

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:09.610
Napoleonic Wars.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:15.990
They saw Nicholas as an obstacle, and the
new Emperor's first challenge... would be

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.690
military revolt.
