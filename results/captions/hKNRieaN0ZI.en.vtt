00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.638
Please welcome the
one and only Shaq!

00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:03.630
[CHEERING]

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.618
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.530
Hi.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.030
Hi.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.016
[CHEERING]

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.976
Hi.

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:43.968
Hi.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:44.964
It's good to see you.

00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:46.458
Nice to see you.

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:48.948
So you--

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.936
[CHEERING]

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.040
They didn't know you were here.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.430
This is a surprise to them.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.020
Oh, they didn't know?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.978
Yeah, they had no idea.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.430
[CHEERING]

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.600
This is like--
what is this here?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.760
This is my Hall of Fame ring
that I had made for myself.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.950
Yeah.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.830
Are they normally that
big, or you had it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.510
made that big for you?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.344
You like big things.

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:17.801
Yes, I had it made
this big for me.

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:18.900
Yeah, it's like a coaster.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.649
I could actually--

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:20.190
Try it on.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.690
OK.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.420
Put a couple of
fingers through there.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.580
Wow, that's a big ring.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.490
That's beautiful.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.600
You're a big guy.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.809
And you have a big ring.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:33.850
And you have a big house.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.980
Yes.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.980
And your house is, like,
really big, though.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.990
I would think you
need high ceilings.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.350
But do you need it to be as
large as-- can we show the--

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.090
this is from Google
Earth, probably.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.810
All right, how many
square feet is that?

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.790
My house is 76,000 square fee.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.276
76,000 square feet.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:52.775
Yes.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.600
In Orlando, Florida.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.370
Yep, there it is.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.630
All right, so how long have
you lived in that house?

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.130
Since 1996.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.870
Oh, a long time.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.720
Yeah, a long time.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.960
So did you build it?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.460
No.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.470
I bought it when it
was 25,000 square feet.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550
And I had a 10-bedroom
guest house built.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.860
And I had a four-court
basketball court built.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.195
OK, so you just kept adding on.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:19.320
Yes, I just kept adding on.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.610
OK, so 76,000 square feet--

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.020
how much of that do you use?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.040
Only two rooms.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.540
Two rooms.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.494 --> 00:02:31.032
Two rooms-- the kitchen,
because I like to eat,

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:32.740
and the bedroom,
because I like to sleep.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.612
Right.

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:36.070
What about a living room, or
a den, or something like that?

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.260
No, never go to the theater,
never go to the gym.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.760
Really?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.259
Yeah.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.350
But I mean-- and how many
bathrooms do you have?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.450
I think 15.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.467
OK.

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:46.300
You know you're supposed
to flush the toilet

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.789
and run the water once a
week so it doesn't smell

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.080
with the drains and everything.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.630
Do you know--

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.380
I never knew that.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.040
Yep, yeah.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.520
Seriously?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.120
So that-- yes, that
part of the house

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.590
is not going to smell good
when you ever go there.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.105
Yeah, you need to run
water and flush toilets.

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:01.030
I never knew that.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.155
I always think of that with
people with big houses.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:06.267
It's like, you've got to use
it all, or else it just is--

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:07.350
yeah, you got to move out.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.272
Yeah, you got to move
out into just a place

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:12.480
with a kitchen and a bedroom.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.200
You're right.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.930
Yeah, just go to a
hotel or something.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.850
No, seriously, I got to
flush all the toilets?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.774
Yeah.

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:18.690
Oh, I never knew that.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.880
Your housekeeper
should know that.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.270
Yeah, once a week,
you're supposed--

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.395
I don't have a housekeeper.

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:23.820
I clean my own house.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.582
Do you really?

00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:25.456
No, I'm just kidding.

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:27.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:30.120
I'm just playing.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.410
Your housekeeper should
know that, though.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.730
OK, yeah.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.370
You better ask that
they were doing that.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.994
I will, I will.

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:34.640
Go check it.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.010
All right, so you
have how many kids?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.610
Six.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.180
Six kids.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.680
Yes.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.190
And you have rules for them.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.790
Yes.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.690
What are they?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.650
Well, my most famous
rule is, in order

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.805
to touch any of my cheese, you
have to present me two degrees.

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:51.984
You know what that means?

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:53.800
No.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.320
I don't know what
any of that means.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.170
OK, cheese means money.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.020
Money.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.010
So their father is
very successful.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.000
So as a father, I'm not
going to give them handouts.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.549
Right.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.340
They have to get a
bachelor's and master's.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.048
And then I will--

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:07.810
[CHEERING]

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.292
Oh, wow.

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:10.280
Two degrees.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.750
Yeah, two degrees to
get any of my cheese.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.900
So they're not in the will
unless they get two degrees.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.589
Exactly.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.220
Good for you.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.866
That's really smart.

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:19.740
That's the only rule?

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.440
Well, my sons can
date when they're 18.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.200
And my daughters can
date when they're 24.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.012
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.719
That's not fair.

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:29.510
Well, you're right.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.020
It's not fair.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.030
But my daughters are much
smarter than my boys.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.894
And I want them to
always be focused.

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.810
And I want them to realize
that, hey, you have

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.230
to be happy within yourself.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.290
You don't really need
anybody to make you happy.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.530
You have to be
happy for yourself.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.890
And you can do your own thing.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.273
[CHEERING]

00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:44.117
True.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.050
What would happen--
let's just say,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.220
hypothetically, one of your
daughters, at 18 or 19,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.580
meets a really great guy.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.590
I'm waiting for that.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.187
I know.

00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:55.270
So that's what I'm saying.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.980
So what happens?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.686
I'm going to torture them.

00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.170
In what way?

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.630
Well, you know, first thing
I have to let the guy know

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.900
is, all the little things
that you think you're doing,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.710
I invented--

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.854
you know, all the
little sly moves,

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:09.520
like you're going to
the movies, and you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.480
start to do stuff like that--

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.440
I did all that stuff.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.790
Uh-huh.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.164
So I need to let him know that
I know what he's thinking.

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:15.670
Right.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.170
I'd just really,
really torture him.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.980
OK, well--

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.070
Torture him bad.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.792
OK, you've made
it clear no one's

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.000
going to date your daughters.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.010
Yes.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.340
All right, so I understand--
and I love stories like this,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.460
because you had an opportunity
to get in on Starbucks earlier,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.960
right?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.940
Yes.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.320
It was my worst investment ever.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.420
So you guys know who
Harold Schultz is?

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.950
So Harold Schultz is
the owner of Starbucks.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.370
So I'm meeting with
him, I want to say.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.860
And he says, Shaq,
I want to open up

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.410
Starbucks in
African-American communities.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.870
So me growing up, I'd never
seen black people drink coffee.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.302
So I look to the owner
of Starbucks and say,

00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:52.260
it's not going to work.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.760
Black people don't drink coffee.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.400
So now, every time
I go to Starbucks,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.730
I see black people
drinking coffee, I'm like--

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:02.530
So yeah, that was my worst--

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.955
When did this start?

00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:04.905
Yeah, that was--

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:08.897
Wait, but you didn't
do so bad on Google.

00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:09.980
What happened with Google?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.530
So one time, this was like
when I first got to LA--

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.240
like '93, '94.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.260
So I'm in the Four
Seasons Hotel.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.036
And I'm playing with
somebody's kids.

00:06:20.036 --> 00:06:21.160
And they're in the meeting.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.585
So I'm playing with the
kids at the next table.

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:24.516
And the guy--

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.140
I'm actually babysitting
the guy's kids

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.150
while he's in the meeting.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.024
So after the meeting,
he says, you know what?

00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:30.040
You're good with kids.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.750
I like you.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.060
I'm going to bring you
in on this investment.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.555
And it was called Google.

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.040
And he said, in
the future, you're

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.664
going to be able to
type on your phone,

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.730
search engine, this, do
this, boom, boom, boom.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.510
You should invest.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.300
I invested.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.020
And then, a couple years later,
I got a really big return.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.680
Yes, you did.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.790
Yeah, a really big return.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.290
Are you out of it now,
or are you still in it?

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.950
No, I'm still in it.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.580
Good for you.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.830
Yeah, I'm still in it.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.880
That's amazing.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.530
Wow.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.230
See, you just play with kids
sometimes, and it pays off.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.960
I know, right?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.711
You never know whose
kid-- whose parents--

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.293
All right, so tell
us about the movie.

00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:58.110
It looks hilarious.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.110
And is that New Orleans?

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.235
It looked like New Orleans.

00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:02.590
No, we actually shot
that in Atlanta.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.180
But before I talk
about the movie,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.721
I just want to let
you know that I've

00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.056
come a long way since Kazaam.

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:08.028
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:10.944
I've come a long way, so--

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:11.902
I'm much better.

00:07:11.902 --> 00:07:12.402
OK.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.650
The movie is a fun movie.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.970
It has a lot of heart.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.470
For those who don't
know Uncle Drew,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.290
Uncle Drew is Kyrie Irving.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.270
That's his alter ego.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.610
He's and older gentleman,
never made it to the NBA,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.860
but was always a great player.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.630
So Uncle Drew has four
or five older teammates--

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.824
myself, Reggie Miller,
Nate Robinson, Lisa Leslie.

00:07:33.824 --> 00:07:34.740
And we just go around.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.300
And we play against
all these young guys.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.758
Reggie Miller is
also in the class.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.420
But it's a very fun movie.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.850
It opens June 29.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.610
And I think it's
going to be hilarious.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:42.910
All right.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.993
Well, I trust you on that.

00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:45.360
[CHEERING]
