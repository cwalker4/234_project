00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.110
So something just arrived in the mail. I'm very excited about it.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.820
It's this huge humongous thing here some of you may be familiar with it -

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.580
It's a Klein bottle.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.840
It's a humongous Klein bottle cost me a couple of thousand dollars

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.700
Definitely worth it as you can see I'm pretty nuts about these things I've got like a pretty huge collection of Klein bottles

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.500
I'll just put a couple here on the table. You know as many as could fit in this frame!

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.540
Basically here, and so I want to talk a little bit about Klein bottles. Why I'm nuts about them?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.350
but also

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.229
We want to do something. You know do something related to what we've been doing before so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660
I've put Rubik's cubes in bottles

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.540
and today the final thing I'm going to do is I'm going to put some Rubik's cubes in Klein bottles.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.020
It's going to be something all right, so I think before we start talking about these these various bottles,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.200
I better give you an explanation of what it's all about mathematically.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.420
Let me tell you a little bit about what makes these Klein bottle interesting,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.320
Mathematicians are really nuts about them,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.540
so what we do to build one,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.580
We just take a sheet of paper well not paper, some flexible material and do this, okay?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.820
So we'll bring the red edges together make them into a tube

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
And then we connect up the yellow circles in a special way, okay?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.000
If you just bring them together like this we get a like a donut shape

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.719
But we can do this in a second way

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.040
and that gives the Klein bottle. Let's have a look, so we extend out like this and then extend and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
together comes the Klein bottle okay?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.140
Alright, so that's one way of building it the other way actually focuses on the yellow edges first

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850
Okay, so let's just go straight to that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.968
So what I'll do here is I'll take a rectangle

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.629
that's a bit thinner to start with okay, and then the way the yellow edges are brought together is

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640
Well as there's just two different ways

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.660
and so you could just do like this and you get a nice ring

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.860
Or you could give it a twist and bring it together like this

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.220
And that's of course something that pretty much everybody who watches this I guess knows

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.179
This is a Mobius strip all right, and what's special about a Mobius strip?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.220
I mean you start out with two sides,

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.769
and when you connect like this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.160
When you connect like this, white gets connected to white and yellow is connected to yellow and you get two sides again

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.480
But when you kind of switch over like that you actually connect the two sides

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.509
So you connect the white side to the yellow side the yellow side to the white side and actually now what you get here is

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.870
a one-sided surface okay, so if you take two different points like one point here and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.519
Like on the opposite side you can actually travel from here to there by walking along the surface, okay?

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.090
So just walking along the surface

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.190
So that's that's something very special a one-sided surface one sided surface

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.049
Okay, now the Klein bottle is actually just a mobius strip,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910
extended in such a way that eventually the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.690
the two edges come together and merge together

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.559
Okay, let's just have a look at how that works so first we connect this up into a Mobius strip in a special way

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.430
So what we have to do is

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.720
We have to connect

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.799
The yellow point to the green point and the green point to the yellow point, and we do this in a special way here

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.629
So with the twist is kind of hidden a little bit okay, so goes like that just extend it out

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.530
Bring it around and now you can see if I just extend this out

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.049
those two points are going to get

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.820
Merged those two points going to get merge and you get a Mobius strip okay,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.419
and now let's just go into our real starting position

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.749
Which is basically this so there's your Mobius strip, okay?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.349
And now we kind of extend things out,

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:07.309
So we extend things out we extend further we extend further we extend further and if you just extend a little bit further

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.910
It's all going to come together and you're going to get your Klein bottle

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.638
What's nice about the Klein bottle is that doesn't have any edges whatsoever? It's like a sphere basically

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.530
It's like a sphere doesn't have any edges

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.619
It's a closed surface as opposed to one with an edge the mobius strip. So that makes it somewhat special, okay?

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.690
Okay, now

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.040
Klein bottles they actually don't live in our world.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.619
They really live in four dimensions, and they're really I mean these sorts of guys they really feel uncomfortable here

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.250
They're really kind of crammed into three dimensions, and you can see it here kind of they're kind of clash into it themselves

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.790
They don't want to do this, they want to be like like donut shapes. Donut shapes, they don't clash into themselves

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.160
They want to be like that and in four dimensions. They can be like this. I just want to show you

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.790
How you actually get the fourth dimension in here? So if you've got a figure eight living in a plane, all right?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.190
Now there's got a clash here

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.499
If you want to get rid of this clash what you do is you kind of just take a little bit of this

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.749
This figure eight here and kind of raise

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.380
It slowly up into the third dimension and bring it back in like

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.349
we've kind of built a bridge and all of a sudden the whole thing doesn't clash into itself you can do the same [sort] of

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.089
Thing here with the Klein bottle so what you do is at this stage here

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.090
You kind of push things off slowly into the fourth dimension

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.679
And you kind of just go across like in the fourth dimension kind of building a bridge in the fourth dimension

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.800
and then

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.910
well from our perspective it just seems to vanish here right

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.420
From the perspective of somebody who lives in here the curves just seems to vanish and then to reappear, but it's still there

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.559
It's still there in three-dimensional space same sort of thing is possible here for a Klein bottle

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.720
So here it just kind of starts vanishing

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.489
But it's actually still there in the fourth dimension goes across and you don't get this running into itself

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.630
So this is really a four dimensional creature, and it's a one sided surface

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.670
And there's a couple of other things that are really amazing about it. So one of them

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.480
Which not just mathematicians find amazing, but just about anybody finds amazing is that they provide

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.460
You know a hint

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.260
that the universe we live in might actually have a very strange property and I just want to show you this

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.100
By looking at a mobius strip real quick. So here's a really really big mobius strip okay, and

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.200
Let's say there is a creature living in here

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.100
So there's like our two-dimensional man lives in here, and that mobius strip that it doesn't have any

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.760
third dimension it's just that it's there.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.400
But it doesn't have any third dimension. So what we can do is this man

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.840
Here is we can let him travel around the Mobius strip, okay?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.338
so let's just let him travel around the Mobius strip

00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:57.760
and now he kind of just turns on the spot and

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.440
Now something amazing has happened

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:06.598
but just walking around a mobius strip this man has actually turned into his mirror image, so

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:16.049
Something similar is theoretically possible in our universe that we kind of go off for a trip through the universe

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.289
We come back and we come back mirror reversed

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.700
It could theoretically

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:29.620
Happen, and it could happen in a kind of a three-dimensional counterpart of of the Klein bottle so that's what makes Klein bottles interesting

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.240
For new Mathematicians and also you know I hope

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.809
Everybody watches here. It gives you basically a space a

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:41.008
Flat analog of of the three-dimensional universe we live in

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:45.808
That has this special property that if you kind of just walk around in the right way

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:49.528
You kind of turn into your mirror image, and you know you won't feel it

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:55.648
You won't feel it that you know you'll feel perfectly fine all the way throughout the trip, but you know I come back it's strange

00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:00.838
So let's get serious about putting some

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.319
Rubik's Cube in Klein bottles and

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.120
talking just in general a little bit about about my collection here, so

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.320
What have I got here, I've got

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.840
Different sizes, so this is kind of just straightforward shape basically four different sizes here

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:23.429
Well really five if I've got all of these really small ones here, so there's another one

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:31.139
So five different sizes you can use them for in earrings or pendants or whatever now. They're all made from glass by real glass blowers

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.478
Pretty much all of these come from a place in California

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.109
I'm going to put a link somewhere here

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.310
So they're all coming from California. I've got one here this one came from the UK so,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.719
They actually attached something here, so they can use the Klein bottle as a

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.760
Drinking vessel and then I've got something very strange here

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.809
three Klein bottles kind of merge together like this very strange

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:07.498
Then I've got a Klein bottle opener so you can actually open beer bottles like this

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.860
Which is actually 3D printed.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:18.419
And it's in metal and there's another 3D printed version just from plastic, and this is something that I use on a daily basis

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.819
So this is my Klein bottle mug

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.489
So if you actually have a really really close look

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.069
This is actually a real mug, and you can see that water's kind of sitting in here in a strange way

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.969
And that's basically you know the talos space.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.550
Get some water in every once in a while, okay

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720
now how do we get a

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.790
Rubik's Cube in a Klein bottle

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.990
Okay, so we want to get maybe this one here into this Klein bottle

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:52.199
I mean from the movie you maybe remember well this thing actually only has one side, right?

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.959
So it actually doesn't have an inside and an outside

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.399
Mathematically speaking, so pretty much you could just say well,

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:05.849
It but nobody will be impressed also. It's not really true. It's not really true because

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.639
while we're talking about a Klein bottle kind of squeezed into our 3D space

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:16.829
It would be true if we had what kind of you know doing this video in four dimensions

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.149
Then I mean there would really be no point to do anything with this thing

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:24.029
You know just be inside whichever way you look at it, right?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:31.679
But because it's kind of squeezed into three dimensions. You can actually see well. There is really an inside here somehow, right?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:39.180
There's really an inside so how do we get it into this space inside it looks hard and actually it would be completely impossible

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.920
Were it not for a strange flaw

00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:50.339
Okay, let's let's be kind and call it feature of all these glass Klein bottles, okay?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.860
So when you look at them

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:59.370
And when you remember so there's basically a tube going through to the inside here

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:05.309
And then there's a surface kind of cutting across here, so I mean here we've got this kind of circular

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.879
intersection so a circular intersection and really

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.230
What should be there it should two surfaces in two intersecting right, so this surface

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:18.149
And that surface here there should be intersecting and actually that hole should be closed

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:25.260
But it isn't you can actually get in through the tunnel here and move things to the inside

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:32.609
It's a floor. I guess. It's just very hard for for glassblower to get any sheet of of glass in here

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.550
So that's actually the case for all of these

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.110
all of these

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.560
Handmade glass bottles and strangely enough it's also the case for this plastic one. I mean for this plastic one

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.460
There's actually no excuse for not putting anything

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.160
But I guess whoever made this he just looked at the glass Klein bottle copied it and didn't realize that

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.420
He was actually making a mistake there now the person who made this one here

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.400
very famous 3d printing artist, Bathsheba Grossman

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.410
She got it right, so if you actually look in the hole here

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:10.259
So there's the surface cutting across so among all those things that I have here. It's really this is really the only one

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.700
That's you know perfect right in that sense, but I mean we're not really worried about this

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.069
We're actually pretty happy about this because at least there's a way in you know, so otherwise yeah, there's no hope

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.090
Okay, so how do we get something in?

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.220
Well was this large one

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.600
it's actually pretty easy, so I got to just kind of take it like this and I get a

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:37.530
small cube, maybe my favorite cube the 1x1x1, and I just kind of pop it in

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.740
alright, and it's in

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.819
Nobody will be impressed, well I think you'd still be impressed, by me holding this thing

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.900
So anyway, so you can get a cube in like this, but of course you want to want a real 3x3x3

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.320
okay, well that's that there's still a really really tricky way of doing it because I've got this really really small 3x3x3

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.960
So that's actually you know that's actually the smallest mass-produced

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.420
3x3x3 cube. That's just as big as

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.760
One of the little cubes that make up an ordinary one and you can really you know

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.520
twist the sides of this thing and can you scramble it up

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.309
And you can solve it and do all sorts of things. It's called a Nano Cube

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.239
So this one let's put it in probably a world first

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.500
There, a 3x3x3 in a Klein bottle just like that

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.510
Okay, but again

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.000
I mean you've never seen this before and I'm sure it's going to be very memorable you'll never forget this

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:41.179
Image of me throwing this thing in but still you know it's too easy. I mean, I could have done it

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.680
I mean this this one here

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.960
You only really impressed because I got this thing in that doesn't really fit through the hole alright

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:54.650
So we have to somehow get this a cube like this into one of those Klein bottles

00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:01.939
Now I'm not going to use this one here because I mean if you've actually watched the video where I put this one in you

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.060
know

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:09.619
It's dangerous, sometimes I destroy these things in the process right, so I'm not going to use the several thousand dollar

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.120
Sample here of which only like two exists in the whole wide world

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.369
So I'm going to use one of the other ones right, so I've got quite a few of the other ones and so

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.460
What I thought I'd try is, I'm going to try and put

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.250
Something into this one here

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.849
Okay, so this one here and well

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:38.540
I mean this this 3x3x3, definitely doesn't fit in all right. So can't can't fit that one inside

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:47.000
and even larger one would be this 2x2x2 right so that that would I think just just just fit inside and

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:57.289
Well, I guess we could do another world first since I'm here we could put a Klein bottle inside a Klein bottle since we've got

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.170
It here. We might as well do it I've got this little Klein bottle here

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:07.579
Okay, so we're going to put a Klein bottle inside a Klein bottle, there it is, never seen before, world-first

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:13.849
All right, okay. Let's leave this in there. I think I might just leave this in there permanently and

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.930
Now I'm going to go away and then

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.679
And then I'm going to see what I can get this thing inside, okay?

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.699
alright. I'm back. I'm wearing my Klein bottle hat

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:33.379
Which you can get also for the place where we get these glass Klein bottles from so it's a very neat hat

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:36.589
So if you go inside, you pull

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.779
You can actually see the two kind of sliding inside so very nice anyway, so I succeeded

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.570
as you can see

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.379
The Rubik's Cube is in alright. The Rubik's Cube is in the Klein bottle and

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.110
let me just show you a little bit, so

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.489
Here it is right. I just kind of move it around a little bit here

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.190
Wow, okay, anyway

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.410
That's as far as we'll go. It's actually pretty tight fit. This way, so you know great stuff?
