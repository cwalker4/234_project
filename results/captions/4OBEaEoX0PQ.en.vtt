00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.466
- Last week, while driving
with her one-year-old son,

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.600
our first guest experienced

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
the most frightening event
of her life.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.866
Thankfully, a hero appeared

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
on the busy highway
to save the day.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.366
From Springfield, Minnesota,
please welcome Sara Sorby.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.333
So you were driving Ben,
your one-year-old son,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.400
to a doctor's appointment.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.333
- Yes.
- Was he sick?

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.533
- He has some medical issues
we're trying to figure out,

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.833
so he has doctor appointments
just about every other week.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.433
- Wow, okay.
So that's stressful enough.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.266
So you're driving him,
and what happens?

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.466
- I was driving, and
my accelerator pedal in my car

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.766
kind of started skipping.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.466
So I called my dad, and I said,
"What should I do?

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.466
My car's not working."

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.933
And he said,
"You need to pull over."

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.166
So I was in the left lane.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.866
I needed to get all the way
to the right lane,

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.166
and my accelerator pedal
just stopped working,

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.066
and I'm watching the speedometer
just drop on my car.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.666
So I basically kind of just
coasted over to the right lane,

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.000
And I went to brake,
and my brake wouldn't work,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.666
so I just kind of shifted it
into park,

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.466
and then my car started
filling with smoke.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.466
- Oh, my gosh.

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.466
- So you get out of the car.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.566
You grabbed Ben, obviously.

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.666
It's freezing, probably.
Minnesota.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.133
- It was cold, but I think
my adrenaline was so crazy

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.333
that I remember being warm.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.500
- Well, there was a fire
next to you, so, yeah.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.566
[laughter]

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.133
You could've kept warm that way.
- Yeah.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.200
- All right, so you're standing
on the side of the road

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.266
with your child,
and your car's on fire,

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.733
and no one's stopping.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.200
How many cars passed by,
do you think?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
- I have no idea.
The time was at a standstill.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.433
I was in shock.
I just stood there.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:18.466
I just held him in my arms.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.933
I have no idea
how many cars passed by.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.966
- Wow.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.400
But obviously enough
that the car--

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.100
and so finally,
this wonderful guy--

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.600
his name is Joseph?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.266
- Joseph, mm-hmm.
- Joseph stops.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.466
And what a--
do you remember that moment

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.066
when he came up to you?

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.100
- I was watching the cars go by,
and I hear,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.500
"Ma'am, are you okay?"

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.766
And I turned to look at him,
and he looked panicked.

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.166
And I was still kind of calm.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.266
I didn't know what to do.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.533
And so he said,

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.933
"You need to get away
from your car immediately.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.233
Your car is on fire."

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.433
And then I realized,
"Okay,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.333
this is more than just
a smoking vehicle."

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.400
So I started to walk over
to him,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
and I burst into tears.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400
I was hysterical.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.066
And he said,
"Do you have any belongings,"

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.366
you know,
"That you need to get?"

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.066
And I said, "Well, my purse
and my medical--

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.333
my son's medical records
are by my car."

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.700
He said,
"We need to go get them."

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.600
And as I turned to go get them,
he kind of...

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.366
held his hand out firmly
and said, "No.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.533
You have to stay here."
- And then he went for them.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.000
- He put on a respirator mask...
- Wow.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.133
- And went to go get them.
- His name is Joseph Stampley.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.266
You have not seen him
since this happened.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.500
Joseph?
[cheers and applause]

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.566
- [singing]
This is how we do it

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:20.300
This is how we do it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.566
La-la-la-la-la, la-la

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.466
- You did what anybody
should have done,

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.600
but they didn't, and you did,
so good for you,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.266
and thank goodness
you were driving by...

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.733
- Thank you. Thank you.
- At that moment.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.433
[applause]

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.300
I can't believe
no one else stopped,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.533
but it really is a good thing

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.966
that you happened to be
driving by at that moment.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.900
So you're driving by,
and you saw the car--

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.000
was it on fire when you saw it
or just smoking?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
- No, it was just smoking.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.900
It had a lot of black smoke
coming out of it.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.666
- So then you just pull over,
which is the right thing to do,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.866
and go up to her.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.933
And how quickly
did it catch on fire?

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:51.933
- Within seconds.

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.633
We were in the middle--
she was in the middle

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:55.766
of telling me that she needs
to get to her destination.

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:56.766
- Right.

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.100
- And I keep telling her,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.633
"You need to get away
from this car."

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:00.700
You know, it can explode.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.766
It's not just in movies.

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.033
- Yeah, right.
- [chuckles]

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.400
- There's gas in there.
- There's gas in there.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
- All kinds of things.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.500
So you knew it could explode,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.266
and yet her purse is in there
and her son's medical records,

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.800
and you put your respirator on
and went in after that.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.333
- Yep.
- Really brave of you.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.633
Really amazing.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:18.233
I mean...
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:20.366
[applause]

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.566
- And this--

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:23.966
I don't even think
you know this.

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:27.700
So after you left them at--
I think the gas station, right?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.733
- Yes, yes.

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:30.333
- So you were waiting
for your dad

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.533
to come pick you up.

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:33.033
Tell her what you did.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.900
- Well, I didn't want to just,
you know,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.566
stand there looking creepy...

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:39.166
[laughter]

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:40.466
After you told me no,

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:42.133
I got in my truck
and just drove around

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.400
to the other side
of the gas station and waited

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.100
to make sure
your dad did come.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
- Thank you.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.466
[applause]

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:53.400
- Isn't that amazing?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.066
I mean,
the fact that he didn't leave.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.533
He just waited to make sure
you were--

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:57.533
'cause you were in shock.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:58.933
You must have been freaking out.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.466
And you're holding your son.

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:02.966
And so there is insurance money,

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:05.900
but you owed money on the car
as well, right?

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.500
- Yeah, we were gonna pay it off
this week.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.233
- Uh-huh. Okay, well...

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:10.466
- Not anymore.
- Yeah, no.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.633
All right, well, we have been
partners with Shutterfly

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.833
for three years,
and they have helped us

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:17.666
with hundreds of peoples' lives
they want to make better.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:18.900
And they want to give you
a check

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.333
for $10,000 to help you...

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.333
[cheers and applause]

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:33.733
That'll help.

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.300
And Joseph,
I know you work long hours,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.566
and you're struggling
paycheck to paycheck.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.533
So Shutterfly wants to give you
$15,000.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.933
[cheers and applause]

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:47.233
- Oh, my God.

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.833
- That's what you get
for being a good guy.

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:50.800
- Thank you.
- You're a good guy.
