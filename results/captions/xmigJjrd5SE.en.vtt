00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.460
GUEST: So, this is a painting that I was given
when my grandmother passed away.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.520
It always hung right above her bed.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.830
Her dad, I'm guessing, would've given it to
her after she spent the summer at a dude ranch

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.180
when she was 19, in, like, the '40s.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.000
Not sure if it's a print or a painting, but
when I got it, there was a mosquito underneath

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.050
the glass, so I took it out to the front yard
and I opened it up to get the mosquito out,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.630
so I could take it with me to college, and
then it kind of scared me a little.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.789
I closed it back up immediately because it
looked like it might be real.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.460
APPRAISER: Okay, and have you had it appraised
before, do you know if she had it appraised?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.319
GUEST: It was appraised in, like, a general
house appraisal twice.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:46.899
In 1998, it was appraised as a print at $200,
and in 2004, it was appraised at $250.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.120
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.020
Do you know anything about the artist?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.320
Have you done any looking into that, or...?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.299
GUEST: I know he was born in France, and then
he moved to northern Pennsylvania, so he could

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.949
have been in the area at the time when he
was painting it, when it was given to my grandmother.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.979
And then he moved out to Ohio, but he had
associations with, like, the Sioux tribe,

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.110
so they actually adopted him in.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.600
And they gave him a cipher, "Long Boots,"
and that's what that little circle underneath

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.509
his signature is.

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.950
APPRAISER: So, that's the artist, it's Henry
Francois Farny.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.869
He was born in France.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.840
He came to Pennsylvania when he was about
six years old.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.020
And when he was living in Pennsylvania, he
began a relationship with the Seneca Indians,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.539
and that's really where his fascination with
the different tribes began.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:46.250
This piece is really interesting because it's
a dense group of figures, which is very desirable

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.570
in his work.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.969
He did, eventually, spend a lot of time with
the Sioux Indians, and they did adopt and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.929
gave him the name "Long Boots."

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.729
This is really his most prolific time.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.969
1890 is about when we start to see some of
his very best paintings.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:09.800
He represented the Native Americans in a very
kind of peaceful, tranquil way, and you can

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.892
see that in this painting.

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:14.830
He didn't ever really bring conflict into
his work as some of the other artists from

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.890
that time did-- Charles Russell and Remington
kind of would show the conflict with the Indians,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.610
where he really wanted to just show the Native
Americans in their natural environment without

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.680
too many other things happening besides the
landscape around them.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.600
So if we were going to put this in an auction
today, I would suggest an estimate of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.580
$200,000 to $300,000.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.420
GUEST: Oh... (sniffles) So I can't hang it
up.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.600
Oh, my God.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.840
Oh...

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.500
That's so much.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.540
(laughs)

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.660
I don't even know what to say.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.580
(exhales) Should I have left the mosquito
in the back?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.580
APPRAISER: It's actually not a bad idea that
you took the bug out.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.450
Ultimately we would like for a conservator
to do that.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.450
GUEST: Right.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.720
APPRAISER: But the bug could've continued
to decay and caused a stain or something that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.670
you could've probably had a conservator work
on.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.440
But, no, it's good that the bug wasn't there
any more.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.500
Guest: Oh, jeez.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.560
Oh, my goodness.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.960
So I'll keep it away from my dog.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.380
APPRAISER: (laughs)
