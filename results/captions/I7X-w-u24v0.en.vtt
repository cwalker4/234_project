00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.192
IN 

00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:04.322
AN ERA WHERE IT SEEMS AS
THOUGH BLACK PEOPLE HAVE

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:06.772
INCIDENTS WHERE PEOPLE CALL THE
COPS ON THEM FOR ALL SORTS OF

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:11.212
RIDICULOUS REASONS, MORE STORIES
ARE POPPING UP SHOWING BLACK

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:16.432
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THEIR
JOBS AND UNIFORMS FACING

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:20.652
CRITICISM AND THREATS OF POLICE
BEING CALLED ON THEM.

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:25.002
A RECENT EXAMPLE FEATURES A
BLACK FIREFIGHTER FROM THE

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.272
OAKLAND AREA, HIS NAME IS KEVIN
MOORE.

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:30.312
HE WAS DOING ROUTINE INSPECTIONS
INTO PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS.

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:33.552
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DOES THIS IN
ORDER TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:34.841
FIRE CODE.

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.272
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
CHIMNEYS DON'T HAVE ANY

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.721
TYPE OF DRIVE VEGETATION NEAR
THEM.

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.422
THEY DID THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:46.221
BACKYARD THAT COULD LEAD TO A
FIRE.

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:50.732
AND APPARENTLY, WHILE KEVIN
MOORE WAS JUST DOING HIS

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:54.562
JOB, A RESIDENT DECIDED TO CALL
THE COPS ON HIM BECAUSE HE

00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:55.562
LOOKED SUSPICIOUS.

00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:00.441
MIND YOU, HE WAS WEARING HIS
FIREFIGHTER UNIFORM.

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:01.471
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:23.632
THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE SAN
FRANCISCO CHRONICLE:

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:28.871
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS
RESPONDED TO THIS SAYING:

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:41.782
THAT IS 
FROM THE CAPTAIN DAMON

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:52.601
COVINGTON.

00:01:52.601 --> 00:02:00.322
THE 
TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS AND

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:01.452
I'VE EXPERIENCES WITH THE

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:06.732
DWP, THEY WILL KNOCK ON THE
DOOR AND LET THE INDIVIDUAL

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:09.282
KNOW, THE PROPERTY OWNER
KNOW, WE HAVE TO DO THIS

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:10.672
INSPECTION, WE ARE GOING TO GO
IN THE BACKYARD.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:14.961
IF THE OFFICIALS KNOCK ON THE
DOOR, FIREFIGHTERS KNOCK ON

00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.122
THE DOOR AND NO ONE ANSWERS,
THEY ARE STILL SUPPOSED TO

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:21.412
GO TO THE BACKYARD AND DO
THEIR JOBS BECAUSE IT IS AN

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:22.792
IMPORTANT JOB TO DO.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.772
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
HERE BUT UNFORTUNATELY, HE

00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:29.282
WAS MET WITH A CALL WITH THE
AUTHORITIES.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:33.601
THE WAY THAT HE DESCRIBES
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THIS PERSON

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:39.482
CONFRONTED HIM, HE IS LIKE, THIS
PERSON, YOU CANNOT INSPECT

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:41.842
HERE, HE KIND OF STARTLED ME.

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.532
HE SAYS WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.301
AND THEN MOORE RESPONDS, WE ARE
HERE DOING OUR ANNUAL

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.822
VEGETATION INSPECTION.

00:02:49.822 --> 00:02:53.892
THEN THE GUY WHO WAS SUSPICIOUS
OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

00:02:53.892 --> 00:02:57.152
PERSON SAID, HE ASKED FRIDAY.

00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:58.372
MOORE SHOWS HIM THE ID.

00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:02.612
A DUDE TAKES A PICTURE, LOOKS AT
IT AND SAYS THAT MOORE NEEDS

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:06.332
TO GET A DIFFERENT ID AND MOORE
RESPOND'S I HAVE HAD THAT

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:10.172
ID FOR YEARS, IT'S KIND OF DARK
AND I AM DARK SKIN BUT YOU

00:03:10.172 --> 00:03:12.971
CAN STILL SEE ME.

00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:16.851
AT THAT POINT YOU ARE WONDERING,
WHAT DOES THIS GUY HAVE TO DO?

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:21.301
WHAT DOES THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,
THE FIREFIGHTER HAVE TO DO

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:25.582
IN ORDER TO CONVINCE YOU THAT HE
IS AN ACTUAL FIREFIGHTER.

00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:31.032
HE THEN GOES ON AND SAYS IF THE
RESIDENT WAS SO CONCERNED HE

00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:34.672
COULD JUST LOOK OUT ON THE
STREET AND SEE A VERY RED

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:39.262
LARGE FIRE ENGINE IS RIGHT
THERE.

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:45.292
IF NOT FIREFIGHTER, THIS IS THE
MOST COMMITTED AND AT THAT

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:52.192
POINT, HE IS INSPECTING MY
BUSHES.

00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:54.462
THIEVES THESE DAYS ARE GETTING
INVENTIVE.

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:58.082
THEY STILL FIRE TRUCKS, FIRE
UNIFORMS, THEY PUT THEM ON, THEY

00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:03.683
PARKED IT IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE
AS LOUD AS THEY ARE, THEY GO TO

00:04:03.683 --> 00:04:06.742
THE BACK, THEY HAVE
IDENTIFICATION THAT COINCIDE

00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:10.982
WITH THEIR PERSON AND THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT ALL JUST A CASE

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:11.982
YOUR HOUSE.

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.662
THAT IS A MILLION-DOLLAR
FIRETRUCK.

00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:18.032
IT'S SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:20.802
THEY ARE JUST TO RICH THESE
DAYS.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:25.612
THE MAN WHO QUESTION THE
FIREFIGHTER SAID THAT THE

00:04:25.612 --> 00:04:28.462
FIREFIGHTER LOOKED SUSPICIOUS
BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING WHITE

00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:29.462
TENNIS SHOES.

00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:32.502
THAT IS ALL IT TAKES.

00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:33.932
BLACK SKIN, WHITE TENNIS SHOES.

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:36.712
HE DOES NOT MATTER IF THERE'S A
TRUCK IN THE FRONT YARD

00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:37.932
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE YARD.

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:41.132
IT DOES NOT MATTER IF HE IS
WEARING A UNIFORM OR GIVES

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:42.742
YOU THE ID THAT YOU ASKED FOR.

00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:48.332
HE GAVE THE ID, THINK ABOUT HOW
ANNOYING THAT IS AND HOW

00:04:48.332 --> 00:04:52.302
PATIENT YOU HAVE TO BE TO COMPLY
WITH THAT BUT HE DID, HE

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:53.302
COMPLIED WITH IT.

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:56.212
AND BY THE WAY, ANOTHER THING,
DID NOT LOSE HIS TEMPER,

00:04:56.212 --> 00:05:01.522
WAS INCREDIBLY PATIENT WITH THIS
RESIDENT, DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:07.602
IF ANYONE APPROACHED ME AS I WAS
DOING MY JOB, SITTING AT MY

00:05:07.602 --> 00:05:09.202
DESK, READING AND RESEARCHING
AND TRYING STARTED ASKING

00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:13.822
ME QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONING MY
RIGHT TO BE THERE, AS I DO

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:17.012
MY JOB, I WOULD LOSE MY MIND.

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:20.582
WITHIN TWO SECONDS, IT WOULDN'T
EVEN, I WOULDN'T BE PATIENT

00:05:20.582 --> 00:05:23.452
AT ALL, NOT EVEN FOR A 2ND.

00:05:23.452 --> 00:05:25.912
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:05:25.912 --> 00:05:27.632
THIS IS IN CALIFORNIA, BY THE
WAY.

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:31.662
LIBERAL CALIFORNIA, THIS HIPPIE
BASTION.

00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:35.192
THE BAY AREA, THIS GUY IS DOING
HIS JOB.

00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:37.972
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:41.252
HOW ABOUT THAT OFFICER KEVIN
MOORE WAS AMONG A GROUP OF

00:05:41.252 --> 00:05:45.142
FIREFIGHTERS PARTNERED WITH THE
CITY COUNCIL AVERY AND HEROISM

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.972
AWARD IN 2008.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:52.382
HE JUMPED INTO A RAVINE TO SAVE
PASSENGERS TRAPPED IN AN

00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:53.482
OVERTURNED VEHICLE.

00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:54.482
BUT DID HE?

00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:55.482
AS IDENTIFICATION?

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.542
AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE BOTTOM
AND AS HE WAS RAISING THE PEOPLE

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.882
THEY WERE LIKE CAN I
SEE YOUR ID?

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:10.132
I KNOW YOU ARE WEARING A
FIREFIGHTER HAD YOU ARE IN 

00:06:10.132 --> 00:06:11.132
THIS

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:18.472
RAVINE, BUT -- IT'S A LITTLE
DARK.
