00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.280
With a murderer  every one and half hours

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.680
El Salvador is amount the world's most violent societies

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
A wash with weapons and torn apart by rival gangs.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800
But as the states struggles to respond, are others now taking matters into their own hands?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.860
16 homicides per day. El Salvador

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.980
is the most violent peace time nations on earth.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.220
Government forces struggle to contain armed and ruthless gangs.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.220
The most notorious of which are the mara salvatrucha.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280
Also known as MS 13

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.100
No place is free from the blood shed

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.420
Local journalists Brian Avelar has spent the last

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.320
two years trying to understand what is ripping his country apart.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280
He believes that local business men have been taking the law into their own hands

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.760
and hiring hit-men to clean up the street.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.700
We joined Brian in San Miguel, the countries 2ed biggest city

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.420
to investigate a death squad, known locally as los extermino

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
Sunday morning  a tactical crime scene for journalist Brian Avelar.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
An exchange of gun fire with common  forces is said to have caused the death

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.810
of a possible gang member.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.450
This man is a relative to the murdered victim.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.680
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.420
 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.440
They are not gang members YET.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.500
 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.920
 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320
The unspoken rule in El Salvador is to stay quiet what ever you see or hear.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.860
 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.720
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.860
 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.290
 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.200
Hours can go past waiting behind the yellow police tape. Until

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300
forensics appear.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.330
 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.310
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.640
 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.100
 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.320
 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.740
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.490
 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.380
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.900
It is unlikely this family will ever receive answers.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.100
Only one out of 10 homicide cases in El Salvador is ever solved.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.620
This is the state of affairs were murderer is normalized. An impunity rains,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.800
Other the last view years a number of vigilante deaths squads have emerged

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.100
One known as los extermino, style themselves as savoir.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.860
They say they have fought back against the gang's choke hold.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.440
And have been accredited with at least 40 murders in the San Miguel area.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.200
Very often with public support.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.860
The first came to light last summer. When seven bodies were found on a country road.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.080
All excluded with a bullet to the head.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.720
This man, in the yellow t-shirt, came across the body when they were being taken away.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.120
He has asked for his identity to not to be shown

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.190
 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.960
 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.870
 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.360
 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.270
 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.180
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.590
 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.640
 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.100
 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.980
 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.160
The people

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.760
realize the situation of their location where they live

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.540
But there is a great fear to talk about it

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.020
 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.940
 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.860
 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.850
 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.670
 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260
 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.080
A source has leakedc Brian this classified document.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.040
An account of a former investigation into the groups activities

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.030
It describes a group of heavenly armed men operating from several 4x4 vesicles

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.260
hunting down suspected gang members. Allegedly in coordination

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.180
with police.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.180
It says  a number of local

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.740
business men are also under investigation for supplying weapons and vehicles

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.920
 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.240
 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.580
 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.980
The exterminators in verity has grown. Making waves on social media.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.980
Local journalist Juan Carlos Dias has been looking for patterns from past murders

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.860
contributed to the group

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.740
 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.850
 

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.950
 

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.970
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.320
 

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.400
That same night, we met a man who was thankful to be alive.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.180
After a terrifying run in with los exterminos

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.620
 

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200
 

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.770
 

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.880
 

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.500
 

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.090
 

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.140
 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.910
 

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.960
 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.540
In that book the witness believed were the names of those set to be exterminated.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.220
 

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.110
 

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.450
 

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.790
 

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.660
 

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.730
 

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.180
 

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.120
There's an estimated 60,000 gang members in El Salvador

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.660
With over half a million affiliates ranging from look outs to family members.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.180
A modern day tribe or a shadow society that protects it's own and claims

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.280
to represent the disenfranchise.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.160
The maras rule by terror and violence.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.040
At the San Miguel police department men accused of being MS13

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.720
gang members are arrested and paraded in front of the media

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.560
Some bear the distinctive symbolic tattoos they are famous for

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.120
As usual the event takes place without the police showing their faces

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.440
for fear of gang reprisals

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.520
In here suspects are being dealt with according to the law.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.020
 

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.820
Outside, that's not always the case.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.320
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.000
 

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.660
 

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.710
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.650
 

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.820
 

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.660
Ver, oie y cayar.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.360
See, hear and stay quiet.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.180
The gangs motto is entrained on society.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:04.040
MS-13 operates in all the suburbs , santi-towns  and city santa

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.820
 

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.050
 

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.510
 

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.550
 

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.770
 

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.370
 

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.630
 

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.230
 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.350
 

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.580
 

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.920
 

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.390
 

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.870
 

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.710
 

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.800
 

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.670
 

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.160
 

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.980
 

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.040
 

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.290
 

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.830
 

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.740
 

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.740
One gang crime the police struggle to control. Is extortion of local businesses.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.040
Payments can range from $5 thur $1500 a month

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.260
This business man says he is forced   to pay a monthly fee to the maras

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.640
 

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.910
 

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.110
 

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.240
 

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.440
 

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.240
 

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.300
 

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.340
 

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:15.290
 

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.080
 

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.510
 

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.810
 

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.250
 

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.900
 

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.600
In order to understand this reality better

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.840
We've come to meet Will Sangado

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.260
A former Mayor of San Miguel. Who now owns a furniture business.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.460
Sangado spent two years in prison.  Convicted of being a founder of the death squad.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.940
Known as la sombra negra.   Or black shadow

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.080
that operated in the 90's

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.200
It is an accusation he still denies.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.420
 

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.430
 

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.040
 

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.580
 

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:35.110
 

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.920
 

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.950
 

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.870
 

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.940
 

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.850
 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.740
 

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.820
Brian spent weeks attempting to meet the mara's from San Miguel.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.240
Finally we received confirmation.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.220
The local chief sent one of this foot solders to talk to us.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.740
They enforced strict rules about what we could reveal on camera.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.560
This was the only angle they allowed us to film.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.840
 

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.930
 

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:48.030
 

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.510
 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.660
 

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.470
 

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.810
 

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.750
 

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.460
 

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.520
Local journalist Juan Carlos Dias joins us to compare  notes.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.460
 

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.590
 

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.540
 

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.300
 

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.080
 

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.800
We are getting closer to los exterminos

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.800
Do they represent the desperation of ordinary people

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.560
or are they simply a band of hit men? Killing for cash.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.040
After weeks of negotiations, Los Exterminos agree to send a spokes men

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.520
Again, the interview had to be done under strict terms of anonymity.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.320
They refused point blank to answer any awkward questions.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.760
Everything about their image was considered from their balaclava and weaponry

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.640
to their head gear

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.780
 

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.810
 

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.870
 

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.750
 

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.560
 

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:06.590
 

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.590
 

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.440
 

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.200
 

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.040
 

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.540
 

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.560
There is now an investigation by state prosecutors into police involvement

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.200
with Los Exterminos.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.080
20 police men have been placed under investigation.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.300
15 of these are from the same anti-extortion department

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.120
and have all taken indefinite leave

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.260
We arranged to meet the highest ranking officer under investigation.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.760
He had been moved to a different police district closer to the capital San Salvador.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.500
Unaware of the nature of our investigation

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.680
He invited us to take a look at disturbing material he recently sieved from MS-13 hide outs.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.920
The images on this cell phone are too shocking to show on screen.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.820
 

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.870
 

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.650
 

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.440
 

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.570
 

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.730
 

00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:00.240
 

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.940
 

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.870
 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.970
 

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.750
 

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.420
 

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:31.470
 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.320
 

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.790
 

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.460
 

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.110
 

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.090
 

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.100
 

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.600
 

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.740
 

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.750
 

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.760
 

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.000
 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.580
We spoke to the head of police in San Miguel

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.480
he said that police are involved in Los Extreminos and they are not acting officially. .

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.200
But police insist they will investigate their own.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.440
Anyone found to be involved would face charges

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.020
Local people told us, that the murder rate had gone down since Los

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.700
Exterminos began dealing with the gangsters.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.380
But there are no official   figures

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.000
 

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:03.070
 

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.340
 

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.760
 

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.850
 

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.490
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.420
 

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.390
 

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.910
