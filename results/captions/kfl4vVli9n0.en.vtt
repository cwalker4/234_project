00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.200
I've repeatedly tried to work with your
office first and delaying the hearing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.639
until February and then in providing you
our questions in advance I did this

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.750
because executive branch's own rules
governing assertion of privilege which

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
were issued by President Reagan and have
been followed ever since say that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.039
ultimately it is up to the president to
decide whether or not he wants to assert

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
executive privilege you cannot repeat
forever that the president might want to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
assert privilege I've given you a fair
opportunity to prepare for the hearing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.570
and to and to speak with the White House
in advance so that we could avoid this

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.420
fight in the first place but you don't
appear to have done any of that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.070
the department's failure to do its due
diligence here to me is deeply troubling

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
I do not believe that issuing a subpoena
here would correct the problem but I'm

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
going to give you the opportunity to
rectify the situation after today's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.530
hearing we will attempt to reach an
accommodation with the Department to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.820
obtain answers to these questions as
part of that process I ask for your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.940
commitment to return for a deposition
before this committee and the following

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.320
in the coming weeks under oath with an
understanding that the transcript will

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.760
be released to the public as soon as
practicable thereafter any questions

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.330
that are unanswered today require
consultation with the White House will

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.820
be asked again at that proceeding and I
expect either a clean answer or a proper

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.290
assertion of privilege claimed by the
president I would ask members on both

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.530
sides of the aisle to make those
questions clear for the record so we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.250
know what must be addressed at the
future proceeding now in your capacity

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.390
as acting Attorney General have you ever
been asked to approve any request or

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.090
action to be taken by the special
counsel mr. Chairman I see that your

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.380
five minutes is up and so

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.330
we-we-we I am me I'm here voluntarily we
have agreed to five minute rounds and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.760
committee I think that's a fine place to
end the five-minute rule

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.180
the committee will end will come to
order

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.220
I will point out that we didn't enforce
the five-minute rule on an attorney

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.710
acting Attorney General Whittaker we
will

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.890
I understand mr. Rao was just saying
there might be a good breaking born at

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.240
that or you know the the Attorney
General was in the middle of saying

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.160
something a question answer the question
please

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.360
regular order should I ask the
questioning okay in your capacity yes

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.020
question let me let me just repeat the
question so because so people remember

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.260
what we're talking about in your
capacity as acting Attorney General have

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.739
you ever been asked to approve any
request or action to be taken by the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:45.420
special counsel mr. Chairman I as the
acting Attorney General I am under the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.160
special councils rules I am the person
that is ultimately in charge of the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.650
investigation and I have exercised that
authority under these special counsels

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.200
regulations of the Department of
Justice's so I assume the answer is yes

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
your order mr. Hewitt I assume the
answer is yes you haven't asked an

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.440
approval request to action and you've
said yes or no Kevin

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.010
in other words mr. Chairman I want to be
very clear about what you're asking me

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.670
are you asking me if I have asked a
special counsel to do something regular

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.799
order mr. chairman well I'm I'm asking
if I think my words were clear enough

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.980
have you ever been asked to approve any
request to actually be taken by the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.230
special counsel last week you commented
on the status of the investigation

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.870
saying the stating it was close to being
completed on quote this was said despite

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.140
the fact you recognized just moments
before that it was ongoing stating quote

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.950
I really am NOT going to talk about an
open and ongoing investigation otherwise

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.269
close quote so all I'm asking you is
have you been asked to approve or

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.989
disapprove a request or action to be
taken by the special counsel point of

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.680
order mr. chairman I've asked the
question of order

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.890
when the water is not in order until the
question is and we're not operating

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.090
under the five-minute rule anymore that
point of what the witness will answer

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.920
the question I want to be very specific
about this mr. chairman because I think

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.510
it's gonna rely a lot of fears that have
existed among this committee among the

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.620
legislative branch largely and maybe
amongst some American people we have

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.710
followed the special counsels
regulations to a tee

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.680
there has been no event no decision that
has required me to take any action and I

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.210
have not interfered in any way with the
special counsels investigation very good

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.870
thank you my time is expired and they
recognized the ranking member the

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.229
gentleman gentleman from Georgia mr.
Collins Thank You mr. chairman

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.410
again it is playing out exactly as we
thought this is my colleagues across the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.850
aisle when we had questions about the
FBI's operation in investigations it was

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.270
those stay away we don't wanna get close
to mauler in fact the Chairman even said

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.440
you know we is it no longer okay to wait
for Robert Miller well it's no longer

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.650
right they got you in front of them
right now so get ready this is all this

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.370
is gonna be DOJ oversight and it is
someone's gonna say for a second there

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.430
is some things interesting here that you
did torn out in your opening statement

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.280
that they do need addressing I think
there's a lot of things whether it be

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.940
voting rights issues whether be civil
rights issues and other things and I get

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.539
that but I'm also going to deal with
something that is directly under your

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.750
oversight provision mister acting
Attorney General and we're gonna talk

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.139
about but something I've written a
letter about and believe I believe that

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.229
lying before this body or anybody is
wrong especially under oath and that's

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.360
not the issue but the issue is tactics
and I question is were you aware of

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.310
Roger stones indictment before it became
public

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.830
congressman Oetzi as you know a
important question it is also mr. stone

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.710
is part of an ongoing investigation but
I have again been briefed on the special

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.950
counsels investigation that would have
been a you know that would been

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.190
considered a development that I would
have been briefed on and I was briefed

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.700
on that
