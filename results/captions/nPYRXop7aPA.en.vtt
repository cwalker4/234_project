00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.389
this is a question from the Stow campus
and it'll say it says how do you respond

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.560
to non-believers who accuse Christians
of being hateful to people who support

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.160
lifestyles that are according to the
precepts of our faith.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.280
I think this is a  very important question and they all are
really I'd be a dishonest person if I

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.670
said to you that that question doesn't
worry me that I don't even think about

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.060
it
in fact we as a team our entire team

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.050
people like Nabeel Qureshi Michel
Ramsden oz Guinness a Maori Ewing aren't

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.280
ice because too often sat around a table
and said you know how do we deal with

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.829
this very trying social issue of our
time and even though the word is not

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.300
used here the idea is you know the
homosexual lifestyle and all that has

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.859
come about in our time how do we as
Christians deal with it? So Joe if you

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.269
don't mind I'd like to take an extended
answer in this you know let me give you

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.930
about three panels of an answer the
first panel is the logical problem the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.759
second panel is what I call the
theological problem and the third panel

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.439
is what I would call the relational
problem how you communicate it so let me

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.770
take first of all the sociological issue
here what is the problem now we talked

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.880
about tolerance so when I was at one of
the prestigious universities somebody

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.409
went to the microphone and asked this
question and I said to the person I said

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.170
I will be glad to answer your question
if you will first answer mine what kind

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.049
of a culture are we living in you have
to define it for me I said as far as I

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.159
know there are three cultures in
relation to absolute the first quest the

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.930
first culture is called a thick anima
sculpture where the law of God is

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.350
supposedly so embedded into our hearts
that we all emotive ly or otherwise

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.990
think in the same categories once upon a
time we would talk about the natural law

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.730
in those categories natural law we
believe these truths to be self-evident

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.870
the early framers believed in the
natural law we don't believe in natural

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.110
law
anymore but we used to talk about and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.720
that's a thick anima sculpture theros
god no mas law sometimes the Indian

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.370
culture will get close to that it's not
always the case but they sort of Darth

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
Academy is what they will say there are
people of the soil and the idea of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.060
respect for parents and all of that they
consider to be self-evident ingrained in

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.800
the heart of man and so on but we don't
believe in the Theon immerse culture in

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.030
the West so what's the second kind of
culture the second kind of culture is a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.010
heteronomous culture heteros meaning
another No Mas meaning law so we have

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.770
another law what does that mean the
mainstream of the culture is dictated to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.410
by the leadership at the top if you look
at Marxism in secular terms it is a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.060
heteronomous culture the handful and the
top will control the masses if you look

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.040
at Islam it's a heteronomous culture if
you go to Saudi Arabia or you go to Iran

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.570
which are supposed to be truly Islamic
countries the mullahs or the sheiks or

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.920
who are the ayatollahs at the top will
tell the masses when they must fast when

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.940
they can eat what they must wear what
they must not wear who they can be seen

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.740
with who they cannot be seen with all of
the dictates even to the discipline of

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.640
how you wash your hands and feet before
you worship and so on it's a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.080
heteronomous culture the few at the top
dictated for the masses below so I

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.860
looked at the question and I said a
really enormous culture I said no I said

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.950
are we a heteronomous culture I said no
we don't want the few to dictate it for

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.850
the money I said so that leaves us with
the third which is an autonomous culture

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.220
our toss meaning self namaz meaning law
which means each person dictates their

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.300
own moral prerogatives in the set I said
are we on autonomous culture he said yes

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.980
I saw right now tell me this if we are
on autonomous culture and I answer your

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.270
question are you going to give me the
privilege of my autonomy too or as soon

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.650
as you disagree with my answer you will
switch to a heteronomous mode and

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.910
dictate for me what I must believe as
well that is the sociological dilemma

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.919
that is the sociological dilemma because
if a disagrees would be it's not just

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.159
that is being enforcing his or her
principles upon being

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.619
but B wants to enforce his or her
principles upon a so there's a mutual

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:39.279
autocracy being sought here but it is
never going to be consistent in a

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.080
culture that is neither phenom us nor
heteronomous autonomous cultures run

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.879
into a conflict where everybody has
their own autonomy that's the law that's

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.189
a sociological issue you move beyond
that then to the theological issue the

00:04:54.189 --> 00:05:00.069
theological issue is this way years ago
I was doing some open forums at Indiana

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.029
University and the press reporter was I
was there with Dallas Willard we were

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.809
both to debate doing the defense of the
Christian faith and press reporter came

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:13.959
and said she was filming some religious
actions on campus for their network and

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:18.759
so on do you mind if we take what you're
going to talk about tonight I said no

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.629
that's all right you're welcome but she
then she startled me by saying we'll

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.379
only be there for about five minutes and
then we'll be packing up and leaving I

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.459
hope we won't disturb you and I thought
this is what the news does with the talk

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:34.119
takes five minutes of it and then tells
people that this is what was said you

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:37.749
know I thought okay but I wasn't gonna
argue with I said ma'am you're welcome

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.589
to leave just tell your crew to be very
quiet because once I get into the thick

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.619
of it I really don't like the
distraction and they'll be quiet

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:50.079
slipping out I'll be okay she stayed the
whole time stayed for the whole talk

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:55.059
stayed for the Q&amp;A and then she said can
I walk you back to where you're staying

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.809
I was staying on the campus I said right
and she was walking to me it's quite

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:05.679
dark at this time and she says I have a
question for you I said is this on the

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:08.769
record or is this an off-the-record
question

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.669
she said no this is for me I said so you
promise me this is just between you and

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.909
me in order to print these answers and
okay that's all right I just want to

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.619
know and so she said you know I have a
problem with Christianity and here's my

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.509
problem
Christians are generally against racism

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.099
but when it comes to the homosexual they
discriminate against the homosexual how

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.449
do you explain that I said I find your
comments so interesting in the first

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.439
part of the question it's an ism you're
talking about the second part of the

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.810
question you particular eyes it with
individual some just fascinated by that

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:50.660
that's okay I said here's what I want to
say to you the reason we believe that

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.330
discrimination ethnically is wrong is
because the race and ethnicity of a

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:04.470
person is sacred you do not violate a
person's ethnicity and race it is a

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.740
sacred gift and the reason we believe in
an absolute nester sexuality is because

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.140
we believe sexuality is sacred as well
and that's why we make a choice that

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.270
same way I said you will help me if you
will tell me why you treat race as

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:29.610
sacred and desacralized sexuality she
was very quiet she said I've never

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:35.880
thought of it in those terms here's what
I want to say view marriage as God has

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.900
given it to us and if you take the whole
corpus of the world view is the most

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:46.950
sacred relationship into which you will
enter because love is given one word in

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:54.510
English but there are four words in the
Greek agape eros storge and agape filler

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.810
Oh storge and eros agape is God's love
filler who is friendship love or

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.060
brotherly love story is protective love
of parental love eros is romantic love I

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.510
said do you realize marriage is the only
one that pulls these four together

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.750
agape Follette Oh storge and eros I said
and if you take agape out of that eros

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:26.010
is gone for whatever you want to do
romantic love becomes redefined and to

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.500
us the Bible gives the sacredness of
marriage as Christ is to the church the

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.330
bridegroom and the bride and in that
sacredness the beauty of a consummate

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.410
relationship between a man and a woman
as it is shown in the singular

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.300
commitment of the marital vow I do
I will when you say I do to the one you

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.560
say I don't do all of the others and you
say I will to one you're saying I won't

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.350
to all of the others so any departure
from that beauty and sacredness of the

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:02.580
four confluences of love is a biblical
notion of what it really means to be

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.680
married and to just take one behavior
and make it look like it's aberrant is

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.970
not right all departures from that are
not acceptable in the sight of God the

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.100
theological position is a consummate
relationship between a man and a woman

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.750
in the procreative Act and in the
sacredness and paying each other the

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.360
ultimate compliment of taking each other
at their word

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.190
so theologically this is the way we see
it sociologically we've been put into a

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.300
conundrum so we come then in
relationally how do we deal with it and

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:43.080
here's the hard part but you know what
and my wife will tell you this others

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:49.850
will tell you this who know me I accept
people with a love and a genuineness

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.899
regardless of what their view is on
anything if it's different to mine I

00:09:54.899 --> 00:10:00.420
have learned to love humanity I can put
my arm around a person who has a

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.110
different view on marriage or a
different view on politics of water and

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.320
just say you know God gives you the most
sacred Drifter gift of the prerogative

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.660
of choice but God does not give you the
privilege of determining a different

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:23.700
outcome to what the choice will entail
the consequences are bound to the choice

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.800
and you go right back to the book of
Genesis and it tells you you do what is

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.270
right will not you will you not be
accepted but if you don't sin stalks a

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.770
veil at the door desires to have you and
so when I look at the sacredness of

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.260
marriage any change from it from the
biblical point of view is a departure

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.610
from the biblical mandate but at the
same time the Bible commands us to love

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:54.430
even those with whom we disagree and our
responsibility as the church is never to

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:59.800
eight the individual our privilege is to
love and only God can change the heart

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.660
of a person and God is the ultimate
judge and anaplerotic society

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.540
let us as Christians be both light salt
and learn to love one another and let

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.630
God be the judge over all of us he is
the one who is pure in his judgments we

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.839
can make errors those are the three
panels I want to leave with you
