00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.460
Hello and welcome to the next in our series of inside the tanks

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.100
and it is with great pleasure and due to popular demand

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.150
that today we are going to look at the fantastic Tiger I.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.880
Not only any old Tiger 1, of course, this Tiger 131

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.180
the only fully functioning Tiger 1 actually currently in existence in the world as we speak.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.220
Relatively few of course Tiger 1's were ever produced only 1354 between 1942 and 1944.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.770
We are now joined by David Willey who is the curator of the tank museum here in Bovington.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.220
Thank you very much for joining us David.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.640
A bit of history about the marvelous Tiger 131.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.020
Well this particular Tiger was captured in North Africa in early 1943.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.500
It was sent out at the end of those see saw battles that had been going across the North African desert,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160
out to Tunisia when finally Hitler realises the Germans are going to lose.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.240
He then reinforces the German army there with his latest secret weapon, that's the Tiger.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
So a number of them are sent across the Mediterranean.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.330
This one is serving with the 504 Schwere Panzer Battalion

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.200
The 504th Heavy Tank Battalion.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.800
It's on a hill side at a place called Medgelbab.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.970
British tanks are attacking it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.280
There are Churchill tanks firing at it.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.900
We know it knocks out at least a couple of those Churchill tanks,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.820
but then we can see damage on this tank that we can now surmise why the German crew abandoned the tank.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.070
They didn't blow it up, they should have done.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.660
That was the orders at the time.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.410
It was a secret weapon, you should destroy your tank if you are going to abandon it,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.820
But we think that one of the key rounds that was fired by a Churchill tank it goes under the barrel,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.100
we can look at that damage in a moment, and it wedges the turret to the hull.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.460
In other words it goes underneath the point meeting between the turret and the hull,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.100
jams in there so that the crew can't actually traverse the turret.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.180
And whether they were wounded, we just don't know

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.040
we've never been able to find out or actually track down the actual crew, they abandoned the tank.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.840
The German war diary actually uses the word "panic", when they leave that tank.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.450
It's the first Tiger we have captured intact on the battlefield in the west.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.230
So let's have a look at the damage.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.550
You can see here on the mantlet and the beginning of the barrel

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.880
the damage as a round has been coming in its clipped underneath,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.200
clipped the mantlet there and actually then, wedged between the turret and the hull.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.930
At the time the gun was facing forward

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.530
and it actually depressed the roof above the driver and the co driver,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.080
and we've got photographs of the time, it shows a fair bit of damage went on there.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.040
Again whether that wounded the crew we just don't know.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.420
You can also see where another, we think 6 pounder round

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.560
from one the Churchill guns that's firing,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.880
has clipped off the side of the lifting eye here and it has exposed the bare metal.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890
So another round has gone there.
has clipped off the side of the lifting eye here and it has exposed the bare metal.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.890
So another round has gone there.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.600
And around on the vehicle as well you can also see other bits of damage

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.140
which we assume this is probably from shrapnel

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.610
so exploding high explosive rounds and there is more damage on the rear.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.320
So obviously shell fire is going off around the vehicle at the time as well,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.300
so we can see that sort of damage.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.280
We know that the loaders hatch, not the commanders hatch,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.240
the loaders hatch, the square hatch was actually damaged as well.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.720
We've got photographs when it was first hit that was broken.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.040
Subsequently that was replaced.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.750
So again whether the crew were damaged in that action again we just don't know.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.360
But whatever happened the crew abandoned the tank.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.840
Again the German war diary it says, they use the word in the war diary, "panic".

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.130
The crew of Tiger 131 panicked and abandoned the tank.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.320
And the following day the 48th Royal Tank Regiment,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
who have these Churchill tanks, they've been attacking up the hill.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.610
They've had losses, they are back on the battlefield and they find this tank sitting there, abandoned.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.820
And they go across it, they have a look at it.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.090
They knock out the wedged in shell.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.320
We realise we have got the first captured Tiger tank

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.410
And its photographed and filmed in situ before it is then recovered back.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.250
It goes to Tunis, where Churchill comes out.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.110
He sees it in Tunis.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.380
The king sees it.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.670
It's put on show.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.520
It's then taken back to Britain, where it is taken to a place called Chertsey where they do all the experimental analysis.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.730
They have a really good look at it there.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.830
They take it apart. They measure it. They record it.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.300
They make a massive report on it.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.280
Put it back together again. They fire the gun.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.060
They do all sorts of things and it is only until 1951, well after the war,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.610
that it is then handed over to the tank museum

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.600
And it has been here, obviously, a very popular exhibit for many many years.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.860
And at the end of the 1990's we started a programme to get it back into running order.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.050
And now every now and again, we take it out, special events, special occasion,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.730
we let people know we are going to run it and we drive it around our track.
