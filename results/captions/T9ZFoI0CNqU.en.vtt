bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: Now, two stories about
the changing portrait of America, first, a

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.840
different kind of life in the suburbs.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.510
Between 2000 and 2010, the number of people
living below the poverty line in U.S. suburbs

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.960
increased by more than 50 percent, a trend
that accelerated during the recession.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.279
It's happening in places that have long been
middle-class, as well as in richer neighborhoods.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.130
Elizabeth Brackett of WTTW Chicago has our
story.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.850
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: DuPage County, Ill., is
one of the wealthiest counties in the country.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.830
Comfortable homes sit on tree-lined streets
in the suburb of Wheaton eight miles west

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.580
of Chicago.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.910
Upscale restaurants and shops line the historic
downtown.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.200
But there is another side to DuPage County,
one that would have been unthinkable a few

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.060
years ago.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.260
It includes packed food pantries and crowds
at the county welfare office.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.739
Candace King coordinates human services in
DuPage County, and she has watched poverty

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.739
grow.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.939
CANDACE KING, Federation of Human Services
Reform: It's exploded.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:13.030
In the 16 years that I have been in my job,
it has gone from something that was rarely

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.280
encountered in this community, and certainly
no one thought it was here, to an issue that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.530
we encounter every day.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.929
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Over the last 20 years,
poverty in DuPage County has grown by 185

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:27.999
percent.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:33.499
Nearly 60,000 people here live in poverty,
defined by the federal government as earning

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.499
$22,350 a year for a family of four.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:43.159
And now a Brookings Institute analysis of
census data finds that, for the first time

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.920
in the Chicago area, there are more people
in poverty in the suburbs than in the city.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.390
In this Wheaton housing complex, 11 of the
townhomes are in foreclosure.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.070
After almost two years of trying, 43-year-old
Catherine Aravosis was finally able to renegotiate

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.079
her mortgage and save her home.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.500
But she and her two children live far below
the poverty line.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.390
Aravosis had a middle-class upbringing.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.750
Her father was a college professor, and, in
2008, she got her second master's degree,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.920
this one in elementary education.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.470
But, because of cuts in state education funding,
she hasn't been able to find a full-time teaching

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.850
job.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.830
Last year, she made $11,000 as a substitute
teacher, far less than what she needs to support

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.830
her two children.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.490
CATHERINE ARAVOSIS, homeowner: It has been
hard for me because I want to provide for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.280
them in a way my parents provided for me.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.570
I never knew what my parents made.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.740
I never had to worry about a thing.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.430
We just lived a really stable, typical middle-class
existence.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.290
And for my children, they don't have that
sense of security that I had.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.770
They know when I'm stressed.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.770
And that hurts.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.330
WOMAN: You will get one item out of the bucket
behind him.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.710
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Aravosis is part of the
newly poor demographic that account for much

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.460
of the rise in poverty in the suburbs.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.960
Ten years ago, she and her husband, an architect,
were earning a six-figure income and living

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.940
in a five-bedroom home in Wheaton.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.480
They divorced in 2004.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.930
Her former husband's architectural commissions
dried up in 2008, and he has had trouble making

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.190
child support payments.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.430
Aravosis tried to get Medicaid for her children.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.870
But the state threatened to take her former
husband's architect license because of lack

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.650
of child support, and she backed off.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.300
CATHERINE ARAVOSIS: It's those days when you
get up and you really don't know what you're

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.540
going to give your kids for dinner.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.140
And it can be a full-time job finding out,
how am I going to get glasses?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.050
The prescription is a year-old.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.990
And where am I going to -- you know, how do
I go and get her the shots she needs?

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.910
She's going to sixth grade -- not having the
health insurance, not having the basic things

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.470
that people take for granted, being able to
get their kid to the doctor, you know, when

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.140
they come home and say, we need $5 for school.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.850
There's always something.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.940
And, sometimes, you have to say, I don't have
it.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.320
I just don't have it.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
I'm sorry.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.840
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Today, dinner comes from
the local food pantry.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.590
She cooks in her Crock-Pot or microwave, since
she can't afford to repair her broken stove.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.080
Like many of the suburban poor, Aravosis never
thought she would need help buying food.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.030
CATHERINE ARAVOSIS: I didn't expect to be
using the food pantry, especially not on a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.300
regular basis.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.680
But, you know, I'm working, and I'm not making
enough money to make ends meet.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.780
So, it's very humbling, but I swallowed my
pride and I went to the People's Resource

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.510
Center, and I asked for help.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.510
Okay.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.510
I have to have pumpkin, right?

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.760
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Aravosis can fill up a
shopping cart once a week at the People's

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.770
Resource Center.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.210
The number of people using this food pantry
in Wheaton has gone up by 200 percent in the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.060
last five years.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.110
There was a 30 percent jump in 2008 alone.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.410
MELISSA TRAVIS, program director, People's
Resource Center: Make sure all the cart handles

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.410
are clean.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.270
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: The resource sister's
program director, Melissa Travis, says many

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.960
of their clients are new to poverty.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.750
MELISSA TRAVIS: Oftentimes, the first time
they come, they break into tears because they

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.110
can't imagine that they would ever need help
in a way like this.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.669
They ve been people that have paid taxes.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.700
They re people that have volunteered and helped
in places like this in the past.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.410
And now, suddenly, they have to go and seek
out that assistance.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.190
So we give a lot of hugs.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.350
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Mary Kay Hopf could have
used a hug the day she came to the food pantry.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.419
A registered nurse, Hopf has been out of work
for several years.

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.800
She grew up in Wheaton and enjoyed a far different
lifestyle.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.510
MARY KAY HOPF, registered nurse: My dad had
a good job.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.110
We had the big house and the cars and all
those other things, new wardrobe for school

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.800
when that time of the year came around.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.370
I think that I'm one of the people who didn't
have to go without much.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.570
And, yeah, it's a whole flip side of that.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.150
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Three months of unemployment
brought Mariano Menendez and his family to

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.220
the food pantry for the first time.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.330
Did you think you would ever wind up coming
to a food pantry...

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.449
MARIANO MENENDEZ, unemployed: No, no, of course
not, never, never.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.070
I ve had good jobs.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.690
I have ve made good income.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.250
I have -- I -- never in my wildest dreams.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.940
So, yes, I'm definitely very grateful for
this.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.210
It's an amazing, amazing service that they
offer here.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.350
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: The dramatic increase
in poverty in suburban DuPage County mirrors

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.290
the increase in poverty in suburban areas
across the country.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.610
That leaves human service agencies struggling
to meet the needs in their communities.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:18.520
Yet federal, state and local funding still
goes disproportionately to urban areas.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.680
That lack of federal and state resources to
fight suburban poverty leaves existing agencies

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
overwhelmed.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.220
CANDACE KING: All of the growth in poverty
in the state of Illinois has been in the suburban

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.490
area.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:39.660
My organization did an analysis of federal
funding and some state funding and private

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.280
philanthropic funding, and found that the
city of Chicago is getting up to four and

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.710
five times more per poor person than DuPage
County is.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.810
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: That is not news to Melissa
Travis at the People's Resource Center.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.440
MELISSA TRAVIS: We are stretched.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.759
About six weeks ago, the food pantry was as
empty as I have ever seen it in six-and-a-half

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.759
years.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:05.100
We were trying to get through to our next
delivery, and just hoping that we had enough

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.320
food to give everybody what they needed.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.650
It's been a devastating year in that regard.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.139
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Unlike many of the newly
poor who have a hard time finding the resources

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.990
that are available, Catherine Aravosis has
taken advantage of all the programs at the

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.100
People's Resource Center.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.560
She has gotten clothes for herself and her
kids and used the job counselors in her effort

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.300
to find a full-time teaching job.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.340
But having to accept help has changed the
way she thinks of herself.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.750
CATHERINE ARAVOSIS: I always thought of myself
as middle-class.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.760
I had a middle-class upbringing.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.480
I had middle-class expectations.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.330
But the reality is that I'm not living a middle-class
lifestyle anymore.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.690
So, no, I don't think so.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.980
I think I have fallen out of the middle class.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.180
ELIZABETH BRACKETT: Like many in her situation,
she doesn't see much hope of things improving.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.700
And while she wants to stay in Wheaton, life
in suburbia is far different than she ever

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.001
imagined it would be.
