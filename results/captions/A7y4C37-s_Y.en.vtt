00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.750
With the ongoing story of the Federation of
Planets and at least a couple of ships named

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.970
Enterprise, the Star Trek franchise has inspired
generations of die-hard fans.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.900
There are still a few persistent myths that
the crew just can’t seem to shake, though,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.400
so here are some of the false “facts”
that you’ve been believing about Star Trek.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.520
During the first season of Star Trek: Discovery,
a minor scandal broke out when actor Jason

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.760
Isaacs admitted he was told not to ad-lib
a particular swear word - not because of the

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.890
profanity, but because it included the word
"god."

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.129
Star Trek has long promoted a humanist and
non-religious view of the future, with spirituality

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.929
usually left to the aliens, and religious
figures like God and the Devil often used

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.720
as tricks by the bad guys.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.760
“Excuse me, I’d just like to ask a question?

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.440
What does God need with a starship?”

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.499
Trek producer Brannon Braga once said that
creator Gene Roddenberry handed down an edict

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.079
to the show’s writing staff, saying that,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
“Religion and superstition and mystical
thinking were not to be part of his universe.”

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.090
The show is clearly meant to take place in
a future based on atheism and secular humanism,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.049
but in practice, that’s not exactly the
case.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.280
While Picard wasn't walking around with a
giant crucifix around his neck, human religion

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.360
has been a bit more present in Star Trek than
is popularly thought.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.230
We see the Enterprise’s chapel on the Original
Series episode "Balance of Terror," and Star

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.130
Trek: Generations includes a celebration of
Christmas, so some version of Christianity

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.409
certainly seems to have survived to the 23rd
century.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.420
Uhura even directly references Christianity
as being impossible to ridicule in “Bread

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.909
and Circuses,” when the crew encounters
a technologically advanced Roman Empire who

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.289
have “Sun Worshippers” broadcasting on
pirate radio.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.450
“Well, don’t you understand?

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.039
It’s not the sun up in the sky.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.499
It’s the Son of God.”

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.120
That’s a lot of love for the Lord on the
supposedly atheist show.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.040
A lot of Star Trek fans think The Next Generation
started from scratch, picking up almost 20

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.820
years after the end of the original show with
a collection of brand new characters completely

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.970
removed from the classic series.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.790
For the most part, that’s true, especially
with regards to the idea of adding a prune-juice

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.790
loving Klingon -

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.650
“A warrior’s drink.”

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.770
- to a crew commanded by a brooding, Shakespeare-quoting
Captain Picard.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:31.549
"My love is a fever, longing still for that
which longer nurseth the disease."

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.090
But before The Next Generation hit the airwaves
in 1987, there was another attempt at reviving

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.380
Star Trek, and it included the blueprints
for a few key characters.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.710
In 1977, a TV project called Star Trek: Phase
II almost made it to production.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.939
Sets were built, actors cast, and over a dozen
scripts written.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.200
When producers decided it would work better
as a feature film, however the project was

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.360
scrapped, and pieces of it were repurposed.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.060
Alan Dean Foster’s pilot script was retooled
into Star Trek: The Motion Picture.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.930
Two of Phase II’s characters, the debonair
Commander Decker, and his former love, the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.140
exotic alien Ilia, made their way into the
film.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.900
But a third new character, the emotionless
Vulcan Xon, didn't make the same jump to the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900
big screen.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.090
When all three of those characters were jettisoned
from future movies, the Trek team decided

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.709
to tweak them again for the small screen.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.730
Xon was transformed from a Vulcan learning
to be more human into Data, an android with

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.330
the same dream, and Decker and Ilia were reimagined
as Commander Riker and Counselor Troi, with

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.299
the same basic backstory and personalities.

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.580
Even a few of those Phase II scripts were
pulled out of the mothballs during the 1988

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.140
writers’ strike for some second-season episodes
of Next Generation, including the one where

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.260
Troi was impregnated by a ball of light.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.080
Maybe it’s a good thing that we never got
to see more of Phase II.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.879
Star Trek has always tried its hardest to
promote equality, and considering that Martin

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.090
Luther King Jr. was a fan, they were clearly
doing something right.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.510
When it came to equality, the show always
had good intentions, but implementing them

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.659
was another matter, and the show's lofty ideals
ran into the reality of real-world bigotry

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.950
right from the beginning.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.750
The show’s original pilot, which saw a woman
serving as the Enterprise's first officer,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000
also saw the captain complaining about his
female crewmates.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.960
“It’s just that I can’t get used to
having a woman on the bridge.”

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.200
Then there's the infamous Next Generation
episode "Code of Honor,” which is often

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.840
regarded as one of the worst Star Trek episodes
of all time.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.960
It managed to be both racist and sexist at
the same time, telling the story of an aliens

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.810
who, as Screenprism put it,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.780
"...speak in thick African accents, dress
in stereotypical tribal garb, and are ruled

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.910
by appetites like ancient barbarians.”

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.860
And they also kidnap the blonde, caucasian
Lieutenant Tasha Yar.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.200
In fact, the director of the episode was fired
halfway through filming for his uncomfortably

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.960
racist choices.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.290
And that’s not the only episode of TNG explicitly
based on racial stereotypes, either.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.120
And then there's the long, drawn-out debate
about including LGBTQ characters in the Trek

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120
universe.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.700
Trek writer Ronald D. Moore has been candid
about the franchise's handling of the topic,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.550
saying, quote, "we've just failed at it."

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.890
Thankfully, Discovery has finally included
a gay couple as key members of the ship's

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.000
crew, helping to fix an oversight that's long
vexed the franchise.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.280
Gene Roddenberry, the visionary behind all
things Star Trek, had a very specific edict

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.110
for the characters on his shows.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.020
He was creating a utopian future in which
humans have achieved peace and conflict will

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.640
be a thing of the past.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.560
An admirable goal for humanity, sure, but
for a room of TV writers it was a living nightmare.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.790
How do you write drama without conflict?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.460
Well, it turns out you can't.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.840
While the conflict-free decree did allow for
the more allegorical storytelling style that

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.440
the franchise has always been famous for,
the writers still managed to sneak in a fight

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.600
here and there.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.660
Why else do you think the crew got possessed
by alien gods and mating hormones so often?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.501
As long as the personal beefs were the result
of some outside force causing trouble with

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.080
the crew, Roddenberry would look the other
way.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.240
When he passed away in 1991, the writers behind
the many Star Trek series began to loosen

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.310
the reins.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.490
Deep Space Nine was filled with internal conflict
and an all-out war, and incorporating a group

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.650
of former terrorists gave the main ensemble
of Voyager the flexibility to create conflict

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.380
on a weekly basis.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.780
By the time Discovery rolled around, the crew
members were at each other's throats.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.811
From a deceitful captain to a key character
leading a mutiny, the famous no-conflict rule

00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:45.320
became a relic of the past, if it was ever
truly followed to begin with.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.440
Everyone knows that on The Original Series,
if you wore a red shirt, you were going to

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.460
die.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.270
The crew was always beaming down to some god-forsaken
planet where an unforeseen danger would make

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.660
itself known by killing off a hapless, no-name
crimson-cloaked officer.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.650
They were the cannon fodder of the Star Trek
universe, just anonymous enough to make us

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.700
feel bad without their deaths at the hands
of alien blobs really mattering.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.860
But would it surprise you to learn that these
cardinal-hued crewmen weren't actually the

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.570
most likely to die?

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.530
While it's true that redshirts did represent
a whopping 73% of the total deaths over the

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.880
series' 79 episodes, something surprising
pops out once you start running the numbers.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.770
There were 430 crewmen aboard the Enterprise,
239 of them dressed in red.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.160
According to research done by Significance
Magazine, even though redshirts die pretty

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.880
often in the show, when you look at the total
population, the fact that they make up over

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.430
half the crew means they’re statistically
much less likely to die than their crewmates

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.430
in gold.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.430
Their finding?

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.490
"Only 10% of the entire Redshirt population
was lost during the three-year run of Star

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.490
Trek.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.100
This is less than the 13.4% of Goldshirts."

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.660
So, if you're looking to make it through that
five-year mission unscathed, suiting up in

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.690
a red isn’t exactly a bad bet by the numbers
- especially if you make yourself busy when

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.360
they’re handing out assignments for the
Away Teams.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.360
You might want to make it blue just to be
sure though.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.120
Speaking of the uniform colors, any fan of
The Original Series knows that Spock wore

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.230
blue, Scotty wore red, and Kirk wore gold.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.890
Those colors are as indelibly linked to their
characters as Spock's Vulcan salute and Shatner's

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.240
over-the-top acting.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.970
“KHAN!”

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.849
So sit down because this may come as a bit
of a shock.

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:36.669
Kirk's uniform was, in fact, actually more
of a lime green.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.959
It only turned into command gold thanks to
the quirks of film stock development.

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:45.310
If you don't believe us, take a look at the
rest of Kirk's wardrobe, like his wrap-around

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.370
tunic from the "Trouble With Tribbles" episode,
or his dress uniform in the Season 1 episode

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.379
"Court Martial.”

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:52.589
All green!

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:56.790
Apparently, many of the colors chosen for
the show were intended to promote RCA's new

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.430
color television units, including the green
uniforms.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.870
That explains the bright, striking style of
the series, even if some of the colors failed

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.480
to turn out exactly as expected.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.839
For decades, fans and even some of the people
behind Trek itself have steadfastly believed

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:18.009
that Pavel Chekov, the spunky ensign with
the indecipherable accent, was created as

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:20.280
an olive branch to the Soviet Union.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.180
“Excuse me sir, can you direct me to the
naval base in Alameda?

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.720
It’s where they keep the nuclear wessels.”

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:36.080
As the legend goes, in the fall of 1966 Gene
Roddenberry got the idea to introduce a new,

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:41.190
hunky heartthrob to the cast with hair like
a British Invasion rock star, and Walter Koenig

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.120
apparently fit the bill.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.780
But at some point, word got to Roddenberry
that Pravda, the official newspaper of Soviet

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:53.329
Russia, had criticized the show for not including
a Russian character in its vision of the future,

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:55.350
and Gene jumped at the idea.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.850
Chekov was born, and Roddenberry even wrote
a letter to the minister of cultural affairs

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.300
in Moscow, apologizing for not including him
sooner.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.589
Alas, they never heard back, presumably because
there's no record of Pravda ever writing such

00:10:08.589 --> 00:10:09.589
an article.

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:13.860
In fact, Star Trek wasn't even available in
Russia at the time, so whoever received this

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.499
letter from an American television producer
proudly hailing the addition of a hunky young

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:23.560
Russian heartthrob to his space show must
have been confused beyond belief.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.000
If there is one cultural catchphrase Star
Trek is best known for, it's Captain Kirk

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:34.750
asking everyone’s favorite engineer to transport
him away from whatever salty vampire or lizard

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.180
monster the crew was tangling with that week
with a quick “Beam me up, Scotty!”

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.300
But despite the decades-long prominence of
this phrase in pop-culture and on t-shirts

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.029
and buttons, Kirk never actually said it…
and neither did anyone else.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:52.670
Captain Kirk did, of course, say very similar
things a number of times throughout the series,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.630
and in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, he gets
pretty close with this:

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.000
"Scotty, beam me up."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.230
However, the exact phrase "Beam me up, Scotty"
has never appeared in any Star Trek series

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.529
or movie, though it does appear in some of
the unofficial Star Trek novels and other

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:09.529
media.

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:13.580
As a result, it belongs in the same category
as Casablanca’s “play it again, Sam,”

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:19.400
and “Elementary, my dear Watson" from Data’s
favorite detective Sherlock Holmes as quotes

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.660
that have been mistakenly attributed to their
source material so often that most people
