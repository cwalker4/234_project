00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:12.391
In 1942, Albert Einstein
was teaching at Oxford University,

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.711
and one day, he just gave
an exam of physics

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.981
to his senior class of physics students.

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.050
He was walking on the campus
with his assistant,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.372
and all of a sudden, the assistant
looked at Albert Einstein and said,

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:28.531
"Dr. Einstein, this exam
which you just gave

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.971
to the senior class of physics students,

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:35.531
isn't that exactly the same exam
you gave to exactly the same class

00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:37.073
one year ago?"

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:41.673
"Yeah, yeah," said Albert Einstein,
"it's exactly the same."

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:46.312
"But Dr. Einstein, how could you
possibly do that?", the assistant said.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.702
"Well," said Einstein,
"the answers have changed."

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.782
(Laughter)

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.283
The answers have changed.

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:02.033
In other words, what is true for 1942
is even more true for today.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.722
We live in a world where
the questions might be the same,

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:06.753
but the answers have changed.

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:11.012
In other words, what has got you here,
will no longer get you there.

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.873
And if you want to have results
that you've never had before,

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:17.363
well, you need to start doing things
you've never done before.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:22.482
The key question for today is of course:
Is there a method to the madness?

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:27.583
Is there a way that each of us
can do impossible things

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.274
to truly create dramatic results?

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:33.794
The good news is that the answer
to that question is 'yes.'

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.154
Because what I'm going to explain today

00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:41.464
is when it comes to high performance,
why the majority is always wrong,

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.874
and how you can use that

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.484
to get everything you can
out of everything you've got.

00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:52.374
But let me first introduce you
to something interesting,

00:01:52.874 --> 00:01:54.215
an interesting observation.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.815
When people, teams, and organizations,
whenever they hit a wall,

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.374
they tend to do one of two things:

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:05.384
they either do more of the same things,
or they do less of the same things.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:07.554
But what you very seldom see

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:10.895
is that they start to do
different things instead.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.314
It's interesting, if you look at the data,

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:17.814
approximately three per cent of people 
are inclined to even do different things.

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:22.716
The remaining 97%
continues to smash into the wall,

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.486
like some kind of crazy
energy bunny on steroids.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:29.826
Why is that?

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:33.974
To understand what's going on here,
we need to ask another question.

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:37.696
The question we need to ask ourselves is:
What is the purpose of thinking?

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:39.986
What is the purpose of thinking?

00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:43.536
If you ask that question
to a brain scientist,

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:44.986
the brain scientist will say,

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:47.926
"Well, the purpose of thinking
is to stop thinking."

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.736
The purpose of thinking 
is to stop thinking.

00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:53.026
What does she mean by that?

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:54.018
Here's the thing:

00:02:54.018 --> 00:02:57.797
Thinking is a high energy activity;
it takes a lot of energy to think.

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:01.720
So whenever we think,
we try to think as short as possible,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.938
and then we return to automatic pilot.

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:10.518
Over 95% of our life,
we run on automatic pilot.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.918
For example, if you've ever driven a car,

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:16.788
and then realize, whoa!
What did I do in the past half hour?

00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:18.799
That's your brain on automatic pilot.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.159
Another example.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.189
Many of you right now
are listening to me on automatic pilot.

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.099
And I know who you are.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.320
(Laughter)

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.930
Here's the thing, if your brain
is on automatic pilot,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.801
this leads to what scientists
call mental myopia,

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:42.680
also known as tunnel vision.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.501
If you have tunnel vision,
that's a bit of a problem

00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.913
because it confuses people
about their own performance.

00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:54.302
This is the reason
that many people go through life

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:56.751
acting like a mediocre race car driver

00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:59.780
who sits in his car,
looks in his rear-view mirror,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.151
sees his competition,

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.590
and is so far behind
that they think they are first.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.602
(Laughter)

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:14.472
In other words, ladies and gentlemen,
we tend to think inside the box,

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:16.641
and the box is a very good metaphor, here.

00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:18.512
So let me draw a box.

00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:22.632
If you take a close look at the box,

00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:26.492
you see that the boundaries
of this box are very well defined.

00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:30.902
We think inside defined boundaries.
I'll give an example.

00:04:30.902 --> 00:04:36.702
One boundary is a legal boundary,
and we think within the legal framework.

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:38.482
I'll give you an example.

00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:44.291
Very few of you would think of stealing
the wallet of the person next to you

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.293
in order to fund your next cool startup.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:51.352
At least that's what I hope.

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:55.392
We think in legal boundaries,
but there are other boundaries as well.

00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:58.313
We think in technological boundaries,
in physical boundaries,

00:04:58.313 --> 00:05:01.073
but we also think in moral boundaries.

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:03.653
This is why we think inside the box.

00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:06.621
At least, that's what we think.

00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:12.063
Because the reality is that the box
in which we think looks more like this.

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.342
For those of you in the back
who cannot see it,

00:05:20.342 --> 00:05:22.443
the reason is this is a very small box.

00:05:22.443 --> 00:05:24.853
(Laughter)

00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:28.823
Let me illustrate
how small this box can be.

00:05:28.823 --> 00:05:32.303
For example, if I would say tonight,
"Let's have something to eat,

00:05:32.303 --> 00:05:34.873
have dinner tonight,
what would be options to do that?"

00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:37.933
Probably you come up with,
"Let's buy some pizza,"

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.865
"Go to a restaurant," "Cook at home,"
all kinds of cool ideas.

00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:46.234
But I believe that very few of you
would raise their hand and say,

00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:48.914
"Hey let's go to the highway close by,

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:51.905
see if we can pick up some dead animals
on the side of the road

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:54.755
and prepare ourselves a crispy dinner."

00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:58.114
(Laughter)

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.904
That's a disturbing thought.

00:06:02.744 --> 00:06:04.034
But here's the funny thing,

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:07.115
for many in the world 
this would be a perfectly normal response,

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:08.754
nothing wrong with that.

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:10.945
What it shows is
that the box in which we think

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.065
is actually very, very small.

00:06:14.295 --> 00:06:18.756
If you take a closer look 
at your industry or professional field,

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:21.675
you also think inside a very small box.

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:27.055
The boundaries of this box,
they are called industry standards,

00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:28.575
or industry norms.

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.986
For example, if you are
in the restaurant business,

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:36.586
then the industry standard is
that people come to your establishment,

00:06:36.586 --> 00:06:38.726
they eat, and then they pay.

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:41.676
That's the standard;
that's how everyone is doing it.

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:45.337
Another example, if you are
in the banking business,

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:48.577
this norm is that people give you money,
you say thank you very much,

00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:50.447
and you give the money to someone else.

00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:51.458
(Laughter)

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.056
I mean, that's banking!

00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:59.017
Those are standards, those are norms
in the industry or professional field.

00:06:59.017 --> 00:07:00.637
But this is what you need to know:

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:04.427
The word 'norm' is
an abbreviation for 'normal.'

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:08.108
In other words, if you do
what everyone else is doing,

00:07:08.108 --> 00:07:10.298
you get results
that everyone else is getting,

00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:12.558
and those are 'normal' results.

00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:18.418
And the thing is, what we are after today,
are extraordinary results.

00:07:19.698 --> 00:07:23.809
So the key question is of course:
How can you kick yourself out of the box?

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.819
Out this very small box
of your industry and professional field,

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.877
and move to the happy place,

00:07:30.757 --> 00:07:32.698
where cool innovation happens.

00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:33.968
How can you do that?

00:07:34.858 --> 00:07:36.159
Let me introduce you

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.809
to the curious case
of the London taxi drivers.

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.769
If you want to become
a taxi driver in London,

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:47.158
you need to know the entire city by heart,
and this is called 'the Knowledge.'

00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:50.419
You can imagine it takes years
to get 'the Knowledge' in your head.

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:55.270
And that's a bit of a problem if you want
to rapidly expand your taxi business.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.680
So they asked themselves a question:

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.050
How can we rapidly
expand our taxi business,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.530
while at the same time
employing taxi drivers

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.660
who do not know anything
about the city of London?

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.821
Then they came up
with a very ingenious solution.

00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:13.540
They said, well actually,
then we make two kinds of taxis.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.461
One is a normal taxi, and the other taxi
has a big sign on it which says,

00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:22.630
"The driver of this vehicle
does not know anything...

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.080
(Laughter)

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.901
about the city of London,
but loves to get directions from you."

00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:34.311
That's a brilliant solution
because this attracted those people

00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.100
who lived in London,
who knew the city very well,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.001
and finally, finally, finally,
could play boss in a taxi.

00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:44.501
(Laughter)

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:46.501
Brilliant!

00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:50.681
Ladies and gentleman,
this sounds like a very cute story,

00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.231
but there's much more than meets the eye.

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:55.132
Because what we have found

00:08:55.132 --> 00:08:59.251
is that breakthrough innovation,
extraordinary results happen

00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:03.291
when people decide to finally
break the standards or the norms

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:06.026
in their industry or professional field.

00:09:07.516 --> 00:09:09.157
You see this over and over again.

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:12.351
For example, if you would have
a furniture business,

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.811
and one day you would decide

00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:17.361
to no longer assemble
furniture for your customers,

00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.532
probably you would end up
with a company called IKEA.

00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:25.902
Another example,
if you owned a computer business,

00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:28.551
and one day you decide
to no longer sell your computer

00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:30.695
using a physical store,

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:35.622
probably you would end up
with a company called Dell computers.

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:42.322
Ladies and gentlemen, what it tells us,
there is a method to the madness.

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:45.991
And by understanding
that the majority is always wrong,

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:47.652
when it comes to high performance,

00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:52.902
finally you have the opportunity
to quit fixing things,

00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:56.511
and move to massive innovation, instead.

00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:00.522
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:00.522 --> 00:10:03.862
the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius

00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:06.612
once said that the object of life

00:10:06.612 --> 00:10:09.382
is not to side with the majority,

00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:11.722
but the object of life

00:10:11.722 --> 00:10:16.313
is to escape finding oneself
joining the ranks of clinically insane.

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:21.282
If you do what everyone else is doing,

00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:24.672
you're not distinguishing yourself,
and you're probably stuck.

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:27.993
This is why, when it comes
to high performance,

00:10:27.993 --> 00:10:30.263
the majority is always wrong.

00:10:31.803 --> 00:10:33.353
This is what we know.

00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:38.104
We know that three per cent of people
are able to achieve extraordinary results.

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:42.813
Each of you can become part
of those three per cent

00:10:42.813 --> 00:10:44.593
by deciding, as of today,

00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:48.323
to break your industry standards
and to break your industry norms.

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:50.983
The alternative of course,

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:54.223
is that you become part of the 97%

00:10:54.223 --> 00:10:57.973
who, in the end,

Thank you very much.

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.954
