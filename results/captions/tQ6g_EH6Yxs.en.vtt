00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.470
MOST RECENT DIDN'T DO THAT
DIDN'T GET DONE, WHICH WAS

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.674
PASSING THE SKINNY REPEAL, WHICH
WAS THE LAST-DITCH EFFORT OF THE

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:26.646
SENATE REPUBLICANS TO JUST
CREATE ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.749
GO INTO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE
WITH THE HOUSE TO HAMMER OUT A

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:30.216
REPEAL FOR OBAMACARE.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.551 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.155 align:end position:100%
THEY HAD THEY, YOU KNOW, HAD
SEVEN-PLUS YEARS TO COME UP WITH

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:41.027
A REPEAL-AND-REPLACE, AND
EVERYTHING THEY CAME UP WITH WAS

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:41.294 align:start size:88% position:13%
TERRIBLE.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:41.628 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.563
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DID THEY ACTUALLY
COME UP WITH ANYTHING OR WAS IT

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.832
REALLY LIKE CRAMMING AT THE LAST
MINUTE.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:50.303 size:84% position:42%
LIKE, "OH, (BLEEP).

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.639
WE TOLD THEM WE HAD SOMETHING.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.973
EVERYBODY START TYPING."

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.776
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU SAID?

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.612
ANYWAY, I'M A SENATOR AND I
CAN'T HEAR WORD LIKE THAT, LIKE

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.647 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT YOU SAID.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: STAY AWAY FROM
SCARAMUCCI.

SO, SO FLEETING.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.091
SO FLEETING THAT HE COMES, WHAT
A GIFT.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.862
HE'S LEAK A FLOWER THAT OPENS
AND THE FIRST RAY OF SUNSHINE

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.230
JUST SHRIVELS ON THE VINE.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.333
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT WAS-- IT WAS SAD.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.735 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO I'M SORRY.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.603 size:75% position:38%
SO THERE WE ARE.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.507
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, EVERYTHING THEY
CAME UP WITH, EVERY PIECE OF

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:28.942
LEGISLATION WAS TERRIBLE.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:33.313
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE-- TENS OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.647 size:75% position:38%
THEIR INSURANCE.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND INSURANCE WOULD BE MORE
EXPENSIVE.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:41.020
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE-- THIS,
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY SENATOR

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.424
McCAIN, SENATOR COLLINS,
SENATOR MURKOWSKI WERE.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:48.995 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEROES IN-- BUT THE CREDIT

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:54.400 size:88% position:56%
REALLY GOES TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP AT TOWN

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.836
HALLS AND WHO MADE THEIR VOICES
HEARD.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:02.041
I-- I'M COCHAIR OF THE RURAL--
( APPLAUSE )

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.544
I'M COCHAIR OF THE RURAL HEALTH
CAUCUS.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:10.650
AND I GO TO RURAL HOSPITALS AND
CLINICS AND NURSING HOMES, AND

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.325
PEOPLE IN RURAL MINNESOTA HATEDT
I HAD A WOMAN CRY AT A HOSPITAL

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.227 size:84% position:42%
IN PERN, MINNESOTA.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:25.164
THIS IS A ROUND TABLE, AND SHE
SAID THAT HER MOM GETS HER HOME

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.434
HEALTH CARE THAT ALLOWS HER TO
STAY IN HER HOME FROM MEDICAID.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.437
SHE WOULD LOSE THAT, AND SHE AND
HER HUSBAND BOTH WORK, AND SHE

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.307 align:start size:88% position:13%
WAS CRYING.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:35.975
AND ABOUT WHAT THE REPUBLICANS
WERE PROPOSING.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:39.712
SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STOOD UP
AND SO THEY DESERVE THIS

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:39.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
VICTORY.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:45.351
AND WHAT I HOPE WE DO IS WORK IN
A BIPARTISAN WAY TO SHORE UP THE

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.055
EXCHANGES AND THE WEAKNESSES AND
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT --

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.691 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WILL.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BIPARTISAN--
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST BIPARTISAN

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.028
THING THAT'S HAPPENED?

00:04:55.028 --> 00:05:00.033
&gt;&gt; WELL, ME IN MY TIME IN THE
SENATE HAVE DONE MANY BIPARTISAN

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:00.266 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:00.667 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.035 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; ON EDUCATION AND OTHER
THINGS.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.737 size:88% position:56%
AND I LIKE WORKING WITH MY
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, AND I

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:10.143 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOPE THAT WE GET TO THE HEP
COMMITTEE IT'S HEALTH,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.247
EDUCATION, AND PENSION
COMMITTEE-- AND THEY WORK WITH

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.750
US TOGETHER, AND THEIR
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.257 align:end position:100%
I THINK WILL JUMP AT WORKING IN
THE SHORT TERM GETTING THESE

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:24.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
EXCHANGES.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:28.394 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE'VE ALSO GOT TO GET
PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS DOWN.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:31.998
I HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE BILL
THAT CONTAINS THE IDEAS OF A LOT

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.735
OF SENATORS TO BRING DOWN THE
COSTS OF PHARMACEUTICALS, AND WE

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:39.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEED TO DO THAT
( APPLAUSE )

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.075
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO
US-- WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.711
PICTURES AND SOME OF THE
FOOTAGE, SO IT'S HARD TO HEAR

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.548
WHAT'S GOING-- WERE YOU THERE
WHEN McCAIN GAVE THE THUMBS

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:48.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOWN?

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:49.115 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT
MOMENT LIKE?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.919
DID EVERYONE KNOW THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.887
YOU HEARD AUDIBLE GASPS IN THE
ROOM.

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:59.492
&gt;&gt; I SUSPECTED IT WOULD BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.261 align:start size:88% position:13%
PENCE HAD LEFT THE ROOM--
( APPLAUSE ).

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.664
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE DIDN'T WANT TO
BE AT THE SCENE OF THE MURDER.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.368
&gt;&gt; THE LAST VOTE HE WAS THERE
FOR THE ENTIRE VOTE.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.602
AND HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:15.942
SO THAT TOLD ME THAT-- THAT HE
WAS GOING TO VOTE NO.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:19.912
SO WHAT WAS INTERESTING THERE
WAS THERE WAS APPLAUSE, AND

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.080
PARTLY FROM THE GALLERY.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
I WAS LOOKING AT SENATOR
McCAIN.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.819
AND I THINK PARTLY FROM STAFF.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.122
AND CHUCK SCHUMER JUST WENT...

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.190

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
DIDN'T-- WE DIDN'T WANT TO
GLOAT.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.894
AND WE SHOULDN'T GLOAT.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:35.995
