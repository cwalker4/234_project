00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:18.457
Good morning.

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:20.783
Are we alone?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.219
Do we live in a Universe

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.659
that is populated
with many, many intelligent species,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.819
or are we, as human beings,
just the only intelligent life

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
anywhere in the Universe?

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:37.465
The last couple of centuries
have been a triumph of modern astronomy.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.255
We can now trace back
the history of the Universe

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:42.535
to just seconds after the Big Bang,

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:44.275
when our Universe began.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.035
We can watch
the Cosmic Microwave Background

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:50.515
and map out the structure
of the very early Universe.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.475
We can track the very first stars

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.335
that formed in the first few hundreds
of millions of years

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:57.305
after the Universe was born.

00:00:57.306 --> 00:00:59.765
We can track the formation of galaxies.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.945
We understand nearly everything
that there is to know

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.235
about the way that the Universe was born

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:07.785
and the way that the Universe
continues to evolve,

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:12.470
except for one
very glaring exception: life.

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:16.555
We know that in the very first
few hundreds of millions of years

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.105
after the Earth formed,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:20.115
life arose on our planet.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.965
We know that from fossils
like these, stromatolites,

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.516
that were formed
by the very first organisms

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:28.745
that existed on our planet, cyanobacteria.

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:34.075
So very quickly, as soon as the Earth
cooled off, after its formation,

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:36.755
we know that life began here.

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:38.735
And even more amazing than the fact

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:43.375
that a self-replicating organism
somehow came forth,

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:47.375
amidst the laws of thermodynamics
that govern our Universe,

00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:50.655
that life evolved fantastic complexity,

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:54.146
and, in fact,
eventually evolved intelligence.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.839
Amazingly enough, we now know

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.639
that nearly every single star
in our galaxy hosts a planet.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.909
And something like one in five
of those stars

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.749
hosts a planet something like the Earth,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.070
at just the right distance from the star
to have liquid water exist on the surface.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.258
But on any of those planets
did life arise?

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.585
Did something similar
to what happened on our own planet

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:24.245
happened on those other planets?

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:27.595
We know that the galaxy is awash in water,

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:31.805
it's awash in organic molecules,
and complex chemistry.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:33.255
All of the things that we know

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:36.035
were necessary for life
to begin on this planet

00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:38.775
exist in abundance throughout the galaxy.

00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:42.266
But did life ever arise
on any of those planets?

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.098
And even more pressing of a question:

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.058
did that life - if it did arise -

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.628
did it ever go on to develop intelligence?

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.988
Is intelligence a common outcome of life?

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.698
Is intelligence a driven process?

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.048
Does life proceed towards intelligence

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.848
for some reason
that we don't yet understand,

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.008
or is intelligence simply
some evolutionary fluke

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.139
that only happened on one single planet
that maybe did develop life?

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.319
And again, even more interesting,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.739
if intelligence does arise commonly,
how far can technology progress?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.849
How advanced could
very advance life become?

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.239
The Universe is nearly
14 billion years old,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.759
and our Galaxy is something like
12 billion years old.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.491
So there could be life out there
if it evolved intelligence

00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:35.011
that could be dramatically more advanced

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.582
than the life that we have
here on this planet.

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:41.940
Now, we don't have any way
of directly detecting intelligent life,

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:47.530
so we use technology or can use technology
as a proxy for intelligence.

00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.970
Here, on this planet,
we have been producing technology

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:52.940
that has been emitting signals

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.080
that would be detectable
at very, very large distances,

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.330
well out into the Galaxy
for hundreds of years.

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.710
These are things like high-power TV
and radio transmitters

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.160
that we use for communication systems
here on Earth,

00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.730
radars that we use to map
other planets in our Solar System,

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.510
or asteroids that we have
in our own Solar System,

00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.520
and also laser technology.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.570
We don't do this yet here on our planet,

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.850
but it's an amazing fact

00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.310
that if you take our most powerful lasers
and our largest mirrors,

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:24.880
and you pair them together,

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:26.280
for the fraction of a second

00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.870
that our most powerful lasers
can produce light,

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:30.850
they can outshine the Sun

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.981
by factors of a thousand
and more than a thousand light years away.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.318
We have just announced a brand new program

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.388
that we think is going to be
humanity's best chance ever

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.778
to answer this question.

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.728
It's called "Breakthrough listen".

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.928
It's humanity's boldest attempt ever

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.929
to determine whether or not
we are alone as intelligent beings.

00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:58.273
It's a 100-million-dollar ten-year project
that will use three telescopes

00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:02.273
to conduct the most comprehensive,
sensitive, and intensive search

00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:05.123
for extraterrestrial intelligence
in history.

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:07.033
We're going to use optical telescopes,

00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:08.923
one called The Automated Planet Finder,

00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:13.273
that is just about an hour away from here,
near San Jose at Lick Observatory,

00:05:13.274 --> 00:05:16.380
and two of the world's
largest radio telescopes,

00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:19.334
the Parkes Telescope
in Australia, near Sidney,

00:05:19.354 --> 00:05:21.243
and the Green Bank Telescope

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.483
in West Virginia,
here in the United States.

00:05:23.484 --> 00:05:24.663
The Green Bank Telescope

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:27.893
is one of the world's largest
movable structures,

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:31.123
and it is, in fact,
the largest fully steerable antenna

00:05:31.124 --> 00:05:33.283
that we have here, on this planet.

00:05:33.284 --> 00:05:35.653
With the telescope
like the Green Bank Telescope,

00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:41.154
we could detect a human-like technology
nearly to the center of the Galaxy.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:46.012
We're going to search
a variety of different types of objects.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:49.742
We're going to conduct
a survey of a million stars,

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:53.862
about a thousand light years
or so off the Earth.

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:56.502
We're going to conduct
a comprehensive survey

00:05:56.503 --> 00:05:59.802
of the entire plane
of our Milky Way Galaxy,

00:05:59.803 --> 00:06:02.952
and we're going to search
a hundred nearby galaxies

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:05.512
to see if that very, very advanced life

00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:08.362
might have developed
the necessary technology

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:13.243
to transmit at truly extraordinary
distances between galaxies.

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:15.934
Let's take a look
at how that's going to work.

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:18.214
Here's an animation
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:21.054
Imagine that somewhere
in the Milky Way Galaxy

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:25.504
intelligent life arises
and begins to transmit.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:27.514
If they did so,

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:31.994
their transmissions would proceed
at the speed of light out from their star,

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:35.294
for as long
as that intelligent life existed.

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.744
And that would form
a bubble of electromagnetic radiation

00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:41.074
that we might be able
to detect here on Earth.

00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:44.034
But how long do these civilizations live?

00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:46.584
They might develop life, intelligent life,

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.994
and then some technology,
and a radio signal.

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:51.944
But that radio signal
will only continue to emit

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:55.145
for as long as the civilization lives.

00:06:55.588 --> 00:06:58.067
But these bubbles
of electromagnetic radiation

00:06:58.068 --> 00:07:01.527
continue out into the Galaxy
at the speed of light.

00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:04.367
And here, on Earth,
we can potentially detect those

00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:07.187
with our very large radio telescopes.

00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:12.117
Here's the Earth itself transmitting
electromagnetic radiation, radio signals,

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:16.297
and here are these bubbles of radiation
from signals from other intelligences

00:07:16.298 --> 00:07:18.177
that are sweeping across the Earth.

00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:19.587
And we can detect those again

00:07:19.588 --> 00:07:22.172
with the telescopes
like the Green Bank Telescope here.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.437
This is an animation of the signal

00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:27.227
that we might expect to see
from that civilization.

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:30.898
And also with the Parkes Telescope
in Australia.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.939
It's not just us that's going to be
doing the data analysis.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.179
With Breakthrough Listen,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.619
there is a very key component
of the program

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.199
that will make all of the data
that we collect

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.349
available to the public immediately.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.909
It will, in fact, when complete,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.089
be the largest amount of scientific data

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.659
that's ever been made available
to public for any experiment whatsoever.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.723
This is one of the ways
that you can get involved in that program

00:07:58.843 --> 00:08:02.029
with an application developed
here at Berkeley called SETI@home.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.229
This is a program that you can download
on your computer,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.144
and when you're not using your computer,

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:09.299
when you're getting up
to get a cup of coffee,

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:11.889
if you take long enough,
your computer will wake up,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.759
it'll download a little bit of the data

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.569
that we collected
at these giant radio telescopes,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.269
and use your computer

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.099
to do the very computationally
intensive processing

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.989
that's required to detect
these very weak signals

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.150
that we're looking for.

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:26.991
And your computer will join

00:08:26.992 --> 00:08:29.311
with hundreds of thousands
of other computers,

00:08:29.312 --> 00:08:32.311
and will in fact form
the largest supercomputer

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.020
on the entire planet Earth,

00:08:34.022 --> 00:08:38.672
dedicated solely to hunting for evidence
of extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:45.521
And here's a video showing
how this process works.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:50.248
Here we see Berkeley, California,
where we all are here.

00:08:50.249 --> 00:08:52.738
All of the data that we collect
from these telescopes

00:08:52.858 --> 00:08:56.768
being sent out
to hundreds of thousands of volunteers,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:01.758
and then results of those computations
being sent back to us at Berkeley.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:05.258
And if one of those little blue dots
comes from your computer

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:09.568
and happens to contain evidence
of extraterrestrial intelligence,

00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:13.228
you too will share in the Nobel Prize
that we will surely win.

00:09:13.228 --> 00:09:14.858
(Laughter)

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:15.939
But I warn you,

00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:19.358
you have to share it with the hundreds
of thousands of other volunteers

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.038
that participated in the project,

00:09:21.038 --> 00:09:24.538
so you might only get a couple nickels.

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:29.488
But surely it would be one
of the most remarkable discoveries

00:09:29.489 --> 00:09:32.459
in the history of humanity.

00:09:34.097 --> 00:09:37.546
So I wanted to take a minute
to look back briefly

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:41.126
at one of the still images
from the video that I showed you

00:09:41.127 --> 00:09:44.276
to point out something very remarkable

00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:47.276
about the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence

00:09:47.277 --> 00:09:50.516
and something that we do in this science.

00:09:50.517 --> 00:09:54.796
So here we see the bubbles
of electromagnetic radiation

00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:56.946
coming out from the civilizations

00:09:56.947 --> 00:10:00.316
that may exist somewhere
in our Milky Way Galaxy.

00:10:00.317 --> 00:10:03.766
And these bubbles
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:05.876
they have fixed widths;

00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:09.246
they're not constant.

00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:13.516
And that reflects
the lifetime of the civilizations

00:10:13.517 --> 00:10:15.887
that might be arising.

00:10:16.573 --> 00:10:18.512
And this is something that's captured

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:23.782
in a very famous equation in this field,
called the Drake Equation,

00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:28.972
named after Frank Drake,
one of the pioneers of this field.

00:10:28.973 --> 00:10:32.392
I promise that this is
the most complicated bit of mathematics

00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:33.942
that I'll show you today,

00:10:33.943 --> 00:10:37.812
but I think it's worthwhile
to take a minute to walk through this.

00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:39.063
So this equation here,

00:10:39.083 --> 00:10:43.532
N is the number of civilizations
that we might be able to detect.

00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:46.902
And it's expressed as a product
of all of the factors

00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:50.652
that might go in
to the emergence of intelligent life.

00:10:50.653 --> 00:10:55.041
R*, the rate of star formation
in our Galaxy.

00:10:55.042 --> 00:10:59.042
Fp, the fraction of those stars
that have planets.

00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:02.892
Ne, the fraction of those
that are something like the Earth.

00:11:02.893 --> 00:11:07.313
Fl, the fraction of those
that actually develop life.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:12.999
Fi, the fraction of those that actually
go on to develop intelligence.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.702
Fc, the factor
of those intelligent species

00:11:18.265 --> 00:11:21.764
that go on to develop
some kind of communication technology

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.984
that we might be able to detect.

00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:29.654
But perhaps the most interesting factor
in this equation is L,

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:32.444
the lifetime of the civilization.

00:11:32.445 --> 00:11:38.474
How long can an intelligent,
communicative civilization actually exist?

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:44.544
Now, if we look at our own technology
and our own human society,

00:11:44.545 --> 00:11:46.904
we might ask the question,

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:52.884
well, maybe not very long,
maybe only a few hundred years.

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:59.174
Can a truly advanced technology exist
for thousands and thousands of years

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:01.424
without destroying themselves?

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:06.974
This is something that we're able
to probe directly in our experiments

00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:09.095
to search for intelligent life.

00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:15.248
We're now just beginning to explore
the area around our own planet.

00:12:15.249 --> 00:12:16.568
In a hundred years,

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.288
surely the area around our planet
is going to be populated

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:24.138
with innumerable satellites,
communication, technology,

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.988
perhaps we'll visit the Moon again,

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:28.676
perhaps we'll have a colony on Mars.

00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:32.820
Maybe in a thousand years

00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:37.060
we might actually have
permanent colonies in space.

00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:42.511
We can sort of imagine getting that far
with our own current technology.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.519
But where might we be in the far future?

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.789
Can we as humans being exist long enough

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.369
to actually travel between the stars?

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.399
Could our technology progress far enough

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.979
that we could actually become
an interstellar civilization,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.980
sailing between the stars
on giant spacecraft?

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.759
This is the ultimate question

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.379
of the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.321
We're searching for life beyond the Earth,

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:18.751
but truly what we're searching for
is our own future.

00:13:18.752 --> 00:13:20.731
We're asking the question:

00:13:20.732 --> 00:13:23.551
what is the future
of an intelligent civilization?

00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:25.841
How long can they last?

00:13:25.842 --> 00:13:29.881
This is something that a pioneer
in this field, Phillip Morrison

00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:32.571
called "the archeology of the future".

00:13:32.572 --> 00:13:37.501
Because of the finite speed of light,
we're studying civilizations

00:13:37.502 --> 00:13:41.741
as they were a thousand,
or maybe ten thousand years ago.

00:13:41.742 --> 00:13:45.741
Our galaxy is a hundred thousand
light years across.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.961
So if we detect a signal
from a civilization

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.081
that is on the other side of the Galaxy,

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:56.101
we're seeing that civilization as it was
a hundred thousand years ago.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:14:00.851
But because our Galaxy is so old,
many billions of years,

00:14:00.864 --> 00:14:03.271
it's likely
that that civilization we detect

00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:05.801
is much, much more advanced than we are,

00:14:05.802 --> 00:14:08.381
and has been around much, much longer.

00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:11.891
So although we're looking
at that civilization's past,

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:15.891
we may be looking
at our own civilization's future.

00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:17.011
Thank you.

00:14:17.012 --> 00:14:18.427
(Applause)
