00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.520
- As an athlete I had plenty of advice

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.550
on my choice of footwear
and my running gait,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.180
but I never actually had barefoot
running recommended to me,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.320
and as a result, I didn't try it.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.390
So I want to explore the
development of this type of running

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.540
with my own investigation
and the added help

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.350
of some top level podiatrists.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.730
Ultimately, should you
try barefoot running?

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.213
Or are you better off
sticking with your trainers?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.500
Now before we begin,
I think it may be wise

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.603
to give a quick history on
what this craze is all about.

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:33.300
In 1960 Abebe Bikila won
Olympic gold in the marathon,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450
running the whole race barefoot.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.190
And this was a milestone in athletics

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.430
as it was the first time in modern history

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.350
that an athlete had won
a major race barefoot.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.550
1962, New Balance joined the competition

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.670
with the first scientifically
researched shoe.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.539
Another company arose in this decade

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.430
from a coach, Bill Bowerman,
and one of his athletes

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.540
who came up with a lightweight
shoe providing a heel wedge,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.040
and they went on to name the brand Nike.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.280
Much to the shoe
manufacturers' disapproval,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.350
the famous South African middle
distance runner Zola Budd

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.760
won all of her races barefoot,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.290
even breaking the 5K world record in 1985.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.760
If we then leap forward to the 1990s

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.640
the emphasis was on bigger
shoes with more cushioning.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.360
Brands such as Reebok,
with the Reebok pumps,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.550
and then Nike, with the
hugely popular Nike Air.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.150
Then there was a change in 2004

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.264
as Nike released the Nike Free,

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:30.360
which they claimed helped
to strengthen the foot.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.010
This was a sign of a move away

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.820
from the ever supporting,
cushioning shoe designs.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.450
A year later, in 2005, the
Vibram 5 Fingers were released.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.962
Four years later again,
the sales and popularity

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:45.240
of this minimalist shoe
escalated after the release

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.180
of the book Born to
Run by Chris McDougall.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.170
There was a notable swing back
against the minimalist shoe

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.610
when Hoka released their
first shoe in 2010,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.960
which boasted 2 1/2 times more cushioning

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.630
than a normal training shoe.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.000
Then there was another new
development just last year

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.050
with Nike releasing their Vapour 4%,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.533
that was worn in world
record-breaking runs.

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:10.650
Well as much as this
investigation is about

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.140
me and my opinion, I
thought it was probably time

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.560
I got an expert opinion as well,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.917
so Claire has very
kindly agreed to join me.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:19.290
Claire is an HCPC registered podiatrist,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.070
and an ex-professional
runner, so I'm delighted.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.240
Claire, thanks so much for coming.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.140
- Oh, thank you for inviting me.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.080
- So Claire I know you're
not a massive advocate

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920
of barefoot running, but what things

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.080
can we learn from barefoot running

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.740
that could maybe help, you know,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.220
everyday runners who use trainers?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.600
What can we take from it?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.110
- So, I do think there's a place

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.610
for barefoot running
within training programmes.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.185
We are a shod community;
we do all of our training

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:47.280
with trainers on, we walk with shoes on,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.513
so to go from being shod to barefoot

00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:53.910
needs real sort of progression and study.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.570
So, maybe I can talk about it
from a personal point of view,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.280
where I use barefoot running would be

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.270
at the end of a session;
I take my trainers off

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.690
and I might do my warm-down
loops around a track barefoot,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.560
or I might do a few strides
on the beach barefoot,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.370
but that's about all me, as an athlete--

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.060
- And why would you do that?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.124
What was that giving your running?

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:19.550
- So you're going from a shoe
where the foot is supported

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.070
to a non-shoe environment where

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.390
the foot actually has to work,

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.880
so it's really making all those

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.405
little intrinsic muscles of the foot

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.750
power up and start working,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.230
and it actually works in conjunction

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.130
with the extrinsic muscles
of the foot as well.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.747
So it is a way of getting
the foot to be more powerful,

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.410
in a safe environment really.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.977
- And when you're doing most
of your running with trainers,

00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:41.566
and the clients that you have,

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.490
what are the main problems
that trainers can give runners?

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.180
Because obviously yes
there's lots of benefits,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.430
and that's why you're an advocate for it.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.060
But what are the downsides
of wearing trainers

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.990
and what problems do you see?

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.120
- So, badly fitting trainers
can cause lots of problems;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.730
they can cause inshoe friction,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.140
which can cause corns/calluses,
ingrown toenails.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.580
It can then on the mechanical
side of things you can look at

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.350
things like plantar
fasciosis, plantar fasciitis;

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.540
you can get achilles strains.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.430
You can get bony joint deformities.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.270
- Because of trainers?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.350
- Well yeah, you can,
if they're badly fitting

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.350
you can get lots of conditions.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.620
That's why it's really important
to find what suits you.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.420
- And what's the main thing
that a trainer offers?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.450
Like, what are you looking
for in a shoe, in a trainer?

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.880
Or what are you advising
people to look for?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.220
- Yeah, so you're looking
for support, really.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.540
Support, protection,
and comfort, I would say

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.220
are the three main areas
that you're looking for.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.300
You're looking for a trainer
that will perform its function.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.570
Are you going to be going walking?

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.628
Are you going to be running?

00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:43.280
What are you going to be
doing with these trainers?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.577
Are you long distance;
are you short distance?

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.720
My trainer that I use for
racing will be different

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.300
to the the trainer that
I use for training.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.850
So it really comes down to what
you need this trainer to do.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.190
- So if you're going
to do barefoot running,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.290
or if you've ever seen
any barefoot runners,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.270
what problems might arise from it?

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.730
Or, what could you see as a
barefoot runner, as a problem?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.630
- So I've seen quite
a few barefoot runners

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.570
that have presented in the
clinic with stress fractures.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.970
- Of which part, the foot or the leg, or--

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.250
- Mainly in the shin.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.790
The shin and also oscillating
a little bit higher up

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.470
into the hip.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.093
Also with barefoot runners, they tend to

00:05:20.093 --> 00:05:23.280
acquire a fallen arch quite quickly.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.533
And they often get sort of
plantar fascial problems.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.730
So I had one barefoot
runner come into the clinic;

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.498
he got rid of his knee
pain, but he got foot pain.

00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:36.331
- Right.

00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:39.200
- So, he's now trying
to find a balance there

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.410
with whether he puts his
shoes on or takes them off.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.100
And then, what he's done
is he's found a balance;

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.970
he does a little bit of barefoot
and then some shod running.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.683
So I think it's all about
finding your own formula.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.640
- Well it's time to investigate.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.979
And we learned from watching

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.130
I couldn't actually find any grass,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.690
so we're going to improvise
and use this beach

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.523
and then the promenade.

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:02.370
And I expect you're like me

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.020
and you've done some running on the beach,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.920
but probably never thought about it.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.680
Now I have run on the
beach in trainers before,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.330
and barefoot, but I've
never really thought about

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.810
how it feels different and
what it does to my stride.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.190
So this time I'm going to be
really thinking about that,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.460
but also I'm going to watch
the footage back and see

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.190
if it changes the way I run
and the way my foot moves,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.600
and then I'm going to do exactly
the same on the promenade,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.750
and run it with trainers
and then with barefoot.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.610
I haven't done much running
barefoot on the hard,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.483
so I expect that to feel
even more different.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.550
To be honest, going barefoot
feels so refreshing.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.490
Childhood memories of running on the beach

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.339
come flooding back.

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.810
It actually feels natural as
my feet are constantly adapting

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.800
to the change in the sand
as I land and push off.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.060
And this makes for an
all round enjoyable run,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.560
whilst feeling like a full
workout for my lower leg,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.960
and my core, to that matter.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.800
Now onto the promenade, and
a surface I'm familiar with.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.510
As expected, the use of
trainers on this type of surface

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.070
proves nothing new; the
support from my trainers

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.970
allows me to power through the movement

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.370
whilst keeping my foot in
a more stable position.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.460
Thus, I'm able to run hard and fast

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.569
while staying comfortable.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.652
(relaxed club music)

00:07:16.414 --> 00:07:18.640
Shoes off, and despite the slow-mo walkup,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.270
I'm slightly apprehensive due
to the hard, gravely surface.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.330
What did surprise me though

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.950
was the change in my foot strike;

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.710
it became quite flat and
less energy-transferring

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.520
from one stride to the next.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.313
Oh and ouch, that's the gravel.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.090
To be honest, I've never
really thought about

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.610
the weight of my shoe and its effects,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.420
and it wasn't until I directly compared

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.240
running with trainers
to then running barefoot

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.980
that I noticed how much
lighter I felt barefoot.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.240
Now, I run with a fairly
neutral, cushioned trainer,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.110
and then I also insert
these very rigid orthotics.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.760
Now, I was given these
because I was diagnosed

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.550
as an overpronator years ago

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.920
when I suffered from longterm shin splits,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.410
and I wasn't massively won over by them

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.870
but I did eventually become
injury free whilst using these

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.300
and to be honest, I've never
actually risked taking them out

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.140
and going back to neutral running.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.090
I found running barefoot was really nice

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.570
on the plantar fascia, so
the underside of my foot,

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.240
as it naturally let it stretch out

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.630
and let my foot move as it wanted to.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.610
On the counter side, I did find though,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.340
that my calves got quite tight.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.430
So, if you do think about wanting

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.560
to incorporate barefoot
running into your training,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.940
then something worth
considering is definitely doing

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.480
some calf strengthening exercises
and plenty of stretches.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.570
If I did decide to take
barefoot running any further,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.750
I'd definitely start by
just reducing the support,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.350
so just going for a more minimalist shoe,

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.190
but still going for a
shoe to protect my foot

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.290
from the surface.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.970
But at the moment, after
this investigation,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.710
I'm not prepared to make
any dramatic changes.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.870
Because I did have so many
injuries as a younger athlete,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.770
and to be honest, I've just
enjoyed being able to run now

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.880
and I'm not patient enough
to take it back to basics

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.950
so I can't do the miles and
race like I can at the moment.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.430
In summary, my opinion
is, if it's not broken

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.880
then don't fix it.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.380
Having said that that, this investigation

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.570
has made me realise that my
foot has got a little bit lazy,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.360
so I'm going to try and
reintegrate some exercises,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.390
maybe a bit of barefoot running
at the end of hard sessions

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.430
when I've got a grass field to run on,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.530
or maybe some exercises in a sand pit,

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.010
just to help get my foot strong

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.690
and really protect me from injury.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.840
If you've had any experience
with barefoot running,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.020
I'd love to hear from you so do

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.040
let us know in the comment section below.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.140
And if you haven't done so yet,

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.140
And if you want to know
how to run a fast half mile

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.170
and you want some training tips,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.350
there's a great video that we did

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.620
with GCN's Dan Lloyd just here.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.110
We've also been talking about stretches;

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.460
you want a video on that,
I made one just here.
