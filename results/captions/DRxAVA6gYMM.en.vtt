00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.710
ALEX CLARK: And what's
interesting about this problem

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.430
is that it was actually solved
by what might be called an

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.200
amateur mathematician, someone
that wasn't officially a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.450
mathematician.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.460
So I first encountered 163 when
studying a little bit of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.650
basic number theory.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.810
And it came up in the most
mysterious way that fascinated

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.790
me because it's the
last number in a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.510
short list of numbers.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.730
Even though it seems very
innocuous, it has some very

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.210
mysterious properties.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.310
So you may have heard about
factoring numbers.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.650
You may not remember exactly
what that means.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.630
So let's just review that.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.400
If you start out with a whole
number, say 12, you can write

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
it as a product of numbers
in many different ways.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.130
So you could think of 12 as
being 6 times 2, or you could

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.160
think of it as being
4 times 3.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.260
But if you want to write it as
a product of prime numbers,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.110
there's only one way to do it,
up to the ordering in which

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.170
you write the numbers.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.710
So 2 and 3 are both
prime numbers.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.180
So every whole number can be
written in exactly one way as

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.900
a product of prime numbers, up
to the order in which the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.610
numbers are written.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.220
BRADY HARAN: Any number?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.430
ALEX CLARK: Any number.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.566
BRADY HARAN: All right.

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.341
I'm going to give
one, you ready?

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:24.820
ALEX CLARK: No.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.410
OK.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.980
BRADY HARAN: 20.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.930
ALEX CLARK: That is going
to be 2 times 2 times 5.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.650
And each one of those
is a prime number.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.420
A mathematician named Gauss was
trying to identify all of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.420
the perfect Pythagorean
triples.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.440
So what are these?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.520
These are the whole numbers
a, b, and c that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.980
satisfy this equation.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.330
And what this means
geometrically, the reason

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.060
these would be called
Pythagorean triples, is that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.140
these numbers are the side
lengths for a right triangle.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.630
The most common example of a
perfect Pythagorean triple

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.610
would be 3, 4, and 5.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.670
And so the natural question
is, well, we can

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030
find specific examples.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.700
How do we find an exhaustive
list of all the examples of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.730
Pythagorean triples?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.350
And what Gauss noticed is that
well, if we take the idea of

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.470
factorization of ordinary whole
numbers to a new number

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.570
system, that we can make
some progress.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.970
And so the way that he created
this new number system was to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.420
take all of the whole numbers
and add i, sometimes

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.000
denoted this way.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.490
So he takes all of the whole
numbers, that's what this zed

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.150
corresponds to, and he adds i.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.510
So this consists of all of the
numbers that can be written

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.720
this way, where the a and
the b are whole numbers.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.960
And i is the square
root of minus 1.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.940
Well, what he noticed is that
he could factorize this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.400
expression, if he just had i in
a way that can't be done in

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.370
the ordinary number system.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.550
So if we take a squared plus b
squared, you might remember

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.240
from school that this can't be
factorized in any nice way

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.040
using ordinary numbers.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.120
If it were, instead, a
difference of squares, there

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.840
would be a nice way to do it.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.000
But if we allow ourselves
to use i, we can

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.250
actually write this.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.910
And what's more, the special
property that each number can

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.460
be factorized into primes in
exactly one way carries over

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.110
to this new number system.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.610
Now you have to expand your
notion of what a prime is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.400
because you've got
now new numbers.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400
So they may or may
not be primes.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.870
And it could be that what used
to be primes are no longer

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.790
primes in the new system.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.930
But what he also discovered was
that if we adjoin other

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.740
numbers instead, we might
not get the same result.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.850
So for example, in this number
system, this is just all the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.200
normal numbers, except that we
now allow ourselves this one

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.740
new number.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.330
So this one still is a number
system, but it has the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.700
unfortunate property that
it doesn't have unique

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.220
factorization.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.030
So just to give you
an example.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.610
In this number system, we have
the number six, which could be

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.485
written as a product
2 times 3.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:04.480
But, at the same time, it can
be written as this product.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.570
This is a problem because here
we have one way to decompose

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.490
it into a product of primes, and
here we have another way

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.090
that's completely
different, using

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.370
completely different primes.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.860
It's not just a matter of
rearranging the ordering.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.620
BRADY HARAN: So it worked for
the square root of minus 1.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.240
It didn't work for the square
root of minus 5.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.610
Where are we going here?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.950
ALEX CLARK: So what he observed
was that it doesn't

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.410
work for all numbers, but he did
identify quite a few for

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.970
which it did work.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.950
And specifically, he identified
a list of numbers.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.270
We still do have the unique
factorization, provided we

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.920
choose one of the following
numbers, d.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.170
Well, one--

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.900
these are the numbers for
which we get unique

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.150
factorization.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.110
And then there's a big
jump to this number.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.190
BRADY HARAN: So that
one works.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.680
ALEX CLARK: And this
one works.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.290
As you can tell, it's quite
a bit removed from

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.320
the previous one.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.470
And what Gauss conjectured was
that this was the last one.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.000
That for some reason, with this
number, the list stops.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.700
And no matter what other number
after this you add, you

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.620
no longer have unique
factorization.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.900
He conjectured that this was
really the way it was, that it

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.650
was true, but he could never
actually prove it.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.580
BRADY HARAN: I can see why that
number intrigued you now.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.190
ALEX CLARK: The problem is to
try to actually show that this

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.670
is the last number for which
this happens, that this list

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.440
is exhaustive.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.410
That there are no other numbers
of this sort that one

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.360
can add in order to get unique
factorization in the new

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.410
number system.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.360
BRADY HARAN: Tough nut to
crack then, was it?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.400
ALEX CLARK: It was a very
tough nut to crack.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.950
And what's interesting about
this problem is that it was

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.670
actually solved by what might
be called an amateur

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.960
mathematician, someone that
wasn't officially a

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.600
mathematician.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.670
So a German by the name of
Heegner actually found a proof

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.820
in the '50s.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.170
And he did actually publish
his result, but it wasn't

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.600
accepted by the mathematical
community for several years.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.060
And then in the '60s, some
well-established

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.290
mathematicians, a British
mathematician by the name of

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.550
Baker and an American by the
name of Stark, found other

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.450
proofs which were generally
accepted.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.280
And then, after a couple
of years, one of those

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.450
mathematicians, Stark, went back
to what Heegner had done,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.490
analyzed it in more detail,
and realized, hold on a

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.260
second, he did actually
have a proof.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.230
It was actually OK with just
some minor issues.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.720
BRADY HARAN: So, and what
did Heegner find?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.860
Was Gauss right?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.060
ALEX CLARK: He was right.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.740
This is the end of the list.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.490
And mysteriously, these
are the only ones.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.830
And there are some other
interesting and mysterious

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.690
consequences of this that you
wouldn't guess just from the

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.500
way these are presented.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.490
So one of these is the fact that
there are certain numbers

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.320
that Ramanujan had identified
as being very

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.160
close to whole numbers.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:40.080
So among these are this
number, this number.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.130
And who knows how he managed
to determine this.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.400
But Ramanujan did observe that
these were close to whole

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.950
numbers, surprisingly close.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.620
And as a sort of joke in the
'70s, the recreational

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.380
mathematician, Martin Gardner,
wrote in one of his columns

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.750
that Ramanujan's conjecture
had finally been proven,

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.840
namely that this was
a whole number.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.290
So here we've got
the number e.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.380
Here we've got the number pi.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.100
And this is taking
e to this power.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.030
So e is anything but
a whole number.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.090
It is as far from a whole number
as you could expect to

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.580
be, likewise for pi.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.560
The square root of 163 is
also not a whole number.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.630
So it would be extremely
surprising if you took this

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.730
combination and somehow wound
up with a whole number.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.180
And you don't.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.370
But he was able to fool people
because it's so close to a

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.720
whole number that, with the
techniques that most people

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.260
would have had available in
those days, they wouldn't have

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.900
been able to tell
the difference.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.890
It's extremely close to a
massive whole number.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.840
Makes it very difficult to
check exactly what it is.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.450
But it turns out to be different
from it by just ever

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.380
so slightly much.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:05.060
BRADY HARAN: Is the fact that e
to the power of root 163 pi

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.710
is very close to a whole number
in any way related to

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.910
all this stuff we've already
been talking?

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.320
ALEX CLARK: Yes.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.740
In fact, the fact that you get
all of these from those is

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.850
directly related to that fact,
not in an obvious way.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.720
It's quite involved to see
exactly how that works, but it

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.210
is, in fact, related to that.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.180
And I'm not even sure how it is
that Ramanujan was able to

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.140
identify these.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.750
I'm not sure that he knew about
these properties, but he

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.020
did identify those as being very
close to whole numbers.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.250
Very strange.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.890
It's not something that I think
ordinary people would

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.040
ever have expected.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.680
And who knows why it was that
Gauss conjectured that this

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.210
would be true?

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.680
Because one might also expect
that, since you have this big

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.780
gap between 67 and 163, that
the next one might just be

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.670
very far along.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.550
And before people had
computers, how

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.510
would they have known?

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.890
How could they possibly check?

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.760
So I wouldn't have
guessed that.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.850
I don't know who would, other
than someone like Gauss.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.230
But it's a very mysterious fact,
but one that has now

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.710
been established.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.410
BRADY HARAN: That's why
you think 163 is

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.050
a pretty cool number?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.520
ALEX CLARK: It is a
very cool number.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.030
BRADY HARAN: Is it like your PIN
number or the combination

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.230
on your briefcase?

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.030
ALEX CLARK: No, no, but
it is certainly one

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.280
of my favorite numbers.
