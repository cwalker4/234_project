00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:05.169
Welcome to our van tour. I'm Trent. I'm Ally and together. We are TNT MTV

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.930
Together so we really learned from the first fan and what we liked and what we wanted to change made a bunch of modifications

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.589
You can check out our first van tour of the other vans layout which was totally different. We'll have a link somewhere

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.489
After living in that van, we realized we're gonna do this full-time

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.339
We wanted something a little bit bigger something that we could put the bikes inside the vehicle for a little bit extra security

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.340
so now we've got

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.769
Pamela van der suits the biggest Promaster they make

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890
3500

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
Extended one hundred and fifty nine inch wheelbase

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.559
This fan is meant to accommodate

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.039
full-time living in four seasons doing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.159
multiple different types of recreational activities

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.890
and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.190
Also being able to accommodate working professionally full-time as well won't y'all come inside and take a look around

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.459
This is the cab of the Promaster if you've been in any of the pro masters, or see any of the videos

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.038
If you check out our old tour of the video

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.599
They're all the same

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.059
They might have one feature here and there this one's got like cruise control, which is pretty important

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.709
they all have defrosting mirrors these mirrors don't power fold, but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.269
it's a

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.869
Pretty nice cab. A lot of cup holders a lot of little cubbies. It's got like two glove boxes

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.130
Pro Master's actually front wheel drive comes with a Chrysler v6

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.329
I think it's like the same v6 they put in some of the minivans so it's cheap to fix

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.679
Pretty much any mechanic can work on it. That's some of the reasons to be one with the Promaster. Also, it's lower center gravity

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.059
That's turning radius. Yeah, it's a gasoline engine so you don't have to worry about getting good or bad diesel

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.219
so one thing that it did change about this van is I put a modular center console that goes in

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
in between the front seats

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.790
makes it so that you have somewhat of a little table to like eat on or have a drink or something like that while you're

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.760
driving all these cupholders in here like pretty down and far out of the way and there's nowhere to really put like a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.519
Sandwich or like a snack or like chips and salsa or something like that. So let me show you how this unfolds

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.390
This is the table here

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.599
Just regular RV table post

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900
that goes down there and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
There you go you can put

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.889
Bone sandwich drink whatever you want long as you're not going down some windy turn erodes

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.599
Stuffs probably not gonna slide off of there if it does. Oh,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.429
Well, that's pretty much it for the cab. We have a swivel seat here for the passenger and the driver doesn't swivel because

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.619
Showers in the way, let's get back to the meat and potatoes of this operation

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.190
All right. So this is the swivel seat that I was talking about

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.919
When the center console is up, you can actually rotate this and do work on the center console or eat here kind of a double

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.470
Use space just like in all the pro masters you have this over the cab shelf

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.859
We have a lot of stuff that's stored up here we have the Sun shades for the front windows

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.969
This black drape actually hangs down to section off the cab

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.829
Really helps you be able to control and regulate the temperature of the cab by putting that curtain down

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.930
When you're driving or at night?

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.459
We put it down to block out light or if anybody else from seeing in when we're in the back

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.848
We have like some tools a lot of different jackets

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.689
Spare parts toes strap extra gas can everything all fits up here. So really convenient space

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.449
So when you first open up the door in the van

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.419
Obviously you see this big white curtain

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.680
This is our shower

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.400
We have the Holtz Brook axe mounted above the shower in case we need to chop down trees

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.889
Or make firewood or whatever

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.939
So opening up the shower

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.299
The shower was one of those things where we wanted to have a place to shower after mountain biking or hiking

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.789
Things like that when you're living in a van you get dirty and stinky and that's fine

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.189
But it's really nice to be able to clean yourself off

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.639
and in the last van we used a solar shower where

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.929
You shower outside but you usually like standing in the dirt

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.259
And so when you're cleaning yourself your feet are still

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:39.549
Getting dirty and it's cold and you're in public it just it created a lot of problems or presented a lot of problems for us

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.839
So we decided to section off a big chunk of this van and turn it into a shower bathroom slash storage area

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
so one of the first things

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.210
Is this cabinet right here?

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.759
Or this shelf

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.949
hangs in there holds extra towels

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.278
extra clothes a lot of Frank's stuff

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.919
I think there's what six shelves in here three of them have drawers and then there's these pockets on the side

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.619
That's a huge amount of storage that we have there

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.370
So we also have our garbage can which is pretty big or a rubbish bin, whatever you call it wherever you're from

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.669
and then

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.119
This is the Porta Potty it's a Dometic porta potti five-gallon

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.000
And

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.170
also

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.680
Drinks water dish lives in here and Frank's toys

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.890
Now when you get in here fully

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.670
It's nice and big and you can do whatever you want. You can fit two people in here if you want you could both shower

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.589
It's got a removable showerhead so you can clean all around your body

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.549
Also a couple towel racks soap dispenser that's on the wall

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.450
We put one of these foam noodles that's cut down the middle

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.869
Over the handles so that you don't accidentally bump one of the handles and then it turns the water on because that's super annoying

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.479
Yeah, that's pretty much the shower

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.210
Has its own light

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.559
This is our kitchen it's nice and compact but it does literally everything we could have ever asked for it's

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.059
Completely different than the last kitchen in the last van that we had we decided

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:35.399
To put it in front of the slider door instead of where most vans traditionally how their kitchen is behind the the driver seat

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.489
we just thought this was a much more efficient use of our space and allows us to have a

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.609
Toilet and a shower and just like a lot more

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.540
Stuff over there

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.769
The kitchen here has a countertop made out of it was a big butcher block of untreated maple that we got from Home Depot

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.610
We made

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.960
Trent made

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.700
All the cuts himself and we epoxy

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.579
The top so it's a nice gloss finish. It's very durable and tough

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:15.600
Which is exactly what we needed for all the torture. We put our kitchen through. We love to cook we needed something

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.049
Very resilient over here

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:25.290
We have a nice wide deep stainless steel sink and then a couple nice stainless steel appliances

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.419
So this is our water

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.280
Just lovely

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.489
This van actually has hot water which was a huge upgrade for me. I'm really happy about that

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.580
There's a nice retractable hose in this faucet

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.159
And then over here one of our major

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:48.838
Improvements or additions from the last van is we wanted to have filtered drinking water so we can fill up

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.810
From anywhere we want

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.599
you know a dirty river in Mexico or

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.179
someone's backyard hose and there's a three canister filtration system to

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.469
Purify water for us that can be safe for drinking. So I

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.030
Forget what it what it filters out. It's like bacteria protozoa

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.730
parasites viruses

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:19.260
It was like the the most heavy-duty water filtration system we could afford basically and that's

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.990
nice

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.880
powerful stream

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.380
and

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:32.510
Has been extremely useful so far. We also decided to install a little handheld soap dispenser, right?

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:37.338
There so we use. Dr. Bronner's biodegradable eco-friendly soap

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.440
But it's nice to just have that

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.749
All right in the same spot and not have to always be reaching under the sink or looking for the soap somewhere else

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.380
So those are our nice clean

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.460
useful

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:56.089
Kitchen area appliances. Okay, so moving down across the the kitchen countertop

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.820
This is a nice useful cutting board space meal prep food prep area

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.859
but um our last bin we had an induction cooktop that we had to pull out and

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.189
Plug in every time we wanted to cook and we decided we really need

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.420
some type of

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.339
permanently mounted

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:16.290
stovetop or oven

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.290
combination so I

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:26.420
Put in a wish list and Trent comes out with all of my requests perfectly assembled. We have a latch over here and

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.010
then this actually lifts right up and

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.990
There's a latch up here in the corner to keep it from coming back down

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.200
There's a light in this corner

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.339
Which is nice and dimmable

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.089
for if someone is

00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:51.949
Sleeping and you don't want to wake them. You can have nice quiet lighting over here. And then you have a three burner propane stove

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.650
This is amazing. I'm

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:01.639
Super excited about this. So this three burner propane stove also is attached to an oven

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.049
So right here, we have a nice wide oven space

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.379
for cookies bruschetta

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.410
casseroles um

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.450
We do a lot of baking and cooking. So kind of whatever our heart desires behind the

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:20.689
Counter top over here. We have a really nice spice rack

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.650
That was built right into the wall of the side of the van that has been

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.220
Really nice actually just to be able to see the spices all the time and know exactly what you need

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.170
Instead of having a dig through a spice rack and then below the countertop

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.679
There are a bunch of different cabinets where all of our pots and pans

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.829
silverware cups plates and

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.830
cleaning stuff under the sink

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.480
All live everything has its own spot everything fits perfectly

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.650
Above the kitchen we have two upper cabinets

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:04.090
The doors are secured with these little push button locks. So when they're pushed in they're locked. You can't you can't open them?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.509
You push them in the knob comes out and that's what you can pull

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.809
To access the inside of the cabinets. It's just kind of like our pantry for

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.510
what we need to

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.090
Munch on for snacks and use while we're cooking

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.059
they have nice gas struts to help them stay open so that you don't need to be like balancing the

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.369
Cabinet door on your head while you're digging through

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.129
and then they just easily close and stay locked with the push of a button so

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.040
our storage under the sink is

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.819
Pretty plentiful this first drawer is all of our cleaning supplies. We have all of our dishes and

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.320
cups and mugs

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.379
Everything is in a secured

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.349
cloth lined container wherever possible

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:57.129
So that minimizes any rattling while we're driving this last drawer under the sink is for all of our toiletries

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.910
So my toiletries trent's some makeup

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.930
Maybe like some lotion

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.150
it's pretty incredible how much you realize you don't actually need to take with you when you're

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.629
Living on the road and trying to be space efficient

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.629
So all of our toiletries everything that we could ever possibly need fits in that small drawer

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.119
We have one big drawer under the stove and oven combo that holds all of our pots and pans. So

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.760
Here we have

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.859
cutting boards mixing bowls couple different pots and pans

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.030
colander for making pasta our coffee grinder

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.840
Baking trays and it's funny. We don't even use

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.150
All of these we thought we needed one of each size. We tried to pare down

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.329
We still only use like two of these on the other side of the kitchen is the refrigerator

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.330
we have a lot of space a

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.940
nice drawer that pulls out

00:13:53.950 --> 00:14:01.049
To put fresh produce in and then the biggest upgrade for this fridge is that there's its own designated freezer space

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.340
We like to make a lot of smoothies. We also like to eat a lot of ice cream

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:11.880
So that was important and the freezer works quite well without using a ton of energy

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.609
Above the fridge is kind of a hidden drawer. So this actually pulls out and

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.000
holds all of our silverware knives

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.179
kind of like table spoon lighters

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.830
Spatula scissors measuring cups and it just slides right back in

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.489
Pretty invisible. So when we designed this man, we knew that we wanted a stationary bed and

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:42.150
The last band we have like a modular bed that turned into like a little booth where you could work and eat we didn't want

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.530
To give up the space where you eat and where you work, but we didn't want to have to you know

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.009
Change the bed around every time we wanted to go to bed or every day when we wake up

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.829
So we made a stationary platform bed

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.270
Frank's enjoying it right now

00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.449
but we also made this little booth area where we could sit facing each other which we found to be very

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.660
important where you can make a lot of eye to eye contact while you're eating

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.900
And then we designed this table here

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:17.300
It's on 500 pound drawer slide hinges or drawer slides 500 pound drawer slides

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.750
There's no way that these things would hold 500 pounds, but that's what it said

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.979
They were gonna hold so we know it's really sturdy really sturdy and secure

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:33.170
You can sit three people here comfortably and eat we can work. There's plenty of outlets around here to plug our laptops in

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.410
It worked out really well

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.940
Now when we set up these two booths or these two benches that create the booth

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.499
We wanted to have a lot of storage. We have a lot of different things that need to go in different places

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.310
This side of the bench here I

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.699
Created storage where we have extra towels blankets

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:59.300
A lot of our camera gear little shelfs that have all the charging stations for all of our electronics

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.940
Also has our weboost

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
mobile cell booster and

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.440
Pretty much anything else that just randomly needs to be shoved somewhere

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.989
It goes into this side of the bench this side of the bench is kind of like a utility cabinet

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.870
As you can see down here

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.680
this black grate

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:26.719
is actually our furnace it's a propane powered furnace runs off the same propane tank that the oven and the stove run off of

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.520
So since I was gonna take up so much space underneath this cabinet

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.320
This is also the cabinet that we put the instant

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.149
Propane water heater in so this is kind of like your utility closet

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.509
We do shove extra shoes things like that

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.340
That doesn't matter if they get a little bit warm in this cabinet

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:56.060
But this cabinets just kind of an open dry space for the utilities mainly being the furnace and the water heater

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.170
One thing we learned from our last van after spending so much time in it

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.420
A lot of people overlook the fact that you need a space for your dirty clothes to go your dirty laundry

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.010
And especially when you're out mountain biking and things are getting sweaty and dirty and gross

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.840
The last thing you want is to put your dirty clothes by your clean clothes or in your living space

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.860
Or around where you're cooking or eating so we actually made a desert

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:26.060
Laundry chute and we have a Patagonia black hole duffel, which is like an almost waterproof duffel bag

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.019
We put all the dirty clothes in there. It's locked away in

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:37.280
What's basically our garage, but it's also in that waterproof bag. So that nothing gets gross from our dirty clothes

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.389
Underneath the table. We've got a storage cabinet

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.199
you can probably hear the fan from our

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.790
Charge controller going crazy right now because we're pumping out a lot of solar energy

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.140
This is what we keep the Blendtec's where we keep the coffeemaker

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.730
random odds and ends

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:04.280
In the very back of here. There's a false panel in the back. That's where all of our fuses or breakers a charge controller

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:13.909
Pretty much everything that's electrical other than the inverter and the batteries is behind that panel now this

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.050
plywood right here underneath here is to

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.700
350 amp our

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:27.170
V-max tanks deep cycle batteries. That means we have 700 amp hours of battery power

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.730
which means we'll pretty much never run out unless we

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:37.849
Are crazy and use like multiple space heaters for hours on end or something like that?

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.459
It's a major overkill for what we need

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.920
But if you've ever had a van or a battery bank that runs out of electricity when you need it

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.259
You know that overkill is almost a necessity in situations like this

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.190
Just to the right of that cabinet over here

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.589
pretty much in-between the two batteries and the furnace is where

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.790
Our inverter is located. It's an Ames power

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:13.400
2000 watt inverter charger and that thing is money if you're looking for an inverter, that's the inverter to get

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.979
In the description below we'll put links to pretty much everything

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:25.099
So if you just scroll down you'll see a link to pick up pretty much every product in this van

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.919
I would say 90% of everything in here except for wood came off of Amazon

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.349
So we'll put links to everything so you guys can check them out and see if you want to pick some stuff up

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:42.020
Okay, so down here below the driver's side bench. We also have a propane detector

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.729
that's really important since the furnace and the hot water and the

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.999
Oven and stovetop are all run on propane

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.800
We want to make sure we're not at risk of blowing ourselves up and then over here

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.409
We have a carbon monoxide detector as well

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.289
Also just really important if you're going to be living in a van

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:08.269
Or any contained space to have some safety precautions set up. We have a nice little wall clock. It's those tiny cute

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.700
Decorative touches that make the space feel livable and like a home

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.239
Over here. We have a paper towel dispenser. Um

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.260
Which is a ratcheting paper towel dispenser. So the the towels don't unravel while we're driving

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.969
That's really nice and handy for right next to the cooking area above that

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:34.220
There's this little shelf of four different airtight containers. These have been awesome actually

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.539
To just store spices or coffee. We drink a lot of coffee. Um

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.820
flour sugar

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.560
stuff that we use

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.830
Frequently that we just want to have quick access to for for cooking above the driver's-side bench

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:57.619
We have this nice little alcove of storage which is cute but also very functional

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:03.109
We realized in our last fan especially if we're going to be mountain biking or going outside playing hard

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:08.120
We need to be able to air out our clothes because they get kind of stinky, but we want to reuse them

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:14.479
Which is gross but realistic, so we installed a bunch of hooks this time. So there

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:22.369
There are four hooks up here that are nice for airing out clothes or just hanging kind of whatever needs to be hung up

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:30.020
It's just nice a nice way to add some more storage in a small space and then over here again. There are some more hooks

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.980
and

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:38.690
A little shelf that we can put phones in and stuff at night while they're charging close to the bed kinda

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.899
That's basically our nightstand over here. We also have our

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.850
Thermostat, so this is a huge upgrade. We have a propane run furnace

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.119
And then we have this thermostat that keeps it temperature controlled

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.359
So we have it set right now to kick on if it ever dips below 55 degrees Fahrenheit which helps?

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.760
If we're camping in the mountains or we're out somewhere where it's warm during the day and cold at night

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.420
We know that we were going to be nice and cozy sleeping

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.799
It's also really nice in the wintertime if we want to go snowboarding or skiing

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:17.159
We can be sleeping in the snow and still be just as warm and comfortable we decided to go with a 5 inch

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.190
memory foam mattress we're both pretty tall and

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:28.350
5-7 Trent is like 6 1 and we have full clearance. We can spread out our toes don't touch we have

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.930
our all of our clothing storage

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:37.619
So kind of his and hers style cabinets. This is Trent's side

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.259
This is my side

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:46.680
We have a couple little baskets to hold like socks and underwear and small clothes

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.710
and then everything else is just

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.739
Supposedly neatly folded and tucked away it gets a little crowded in here

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.330
But honestly, this is pretty much all the storage space we need

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:08.820
Installed a dual USB charger right here next to the bed so we can charge our phones while we sleep

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:14.909
And then this is actually the light switch turns lights off and on and it's on a dimmer, too

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.910
So this will actually give the lights

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.200
Or brighten the lights back up

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.560
This here is the max air fan remote

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.270
You can do anything on this remote that you can do on the fan itself

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.250
You can set the thermostat on here so that it'll open and start circulating air at a certain temperature

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:39.660
We learned from traveling in the heat of the summer in our last man that windows and air

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.220
Circulation were really important if you were going to live in a van full-time back here

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.119
These two back windows were part of the van when we bought it

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.430
They don't open but we did install this motion windows sliding window

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.229
The head of our bed and this has been really clutch

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:03.499
For when you're hot at night and you need a little bit of air circulation you just slide this window

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.020
open or closed and

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:12.590
then having the remote control for the fan right next to our head makes it easy to open up the fan and

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:20.749
circulate that air creates an amazing wind tunnel that really cools down the van very quickly Trent also installed a

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:27.709
Window on the slider door. It's a CR Lawrence and the bottom panel on one side of it opens

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:33.170
So while we're cooking there's a little bit of extra air circulation there when you have all the windows open

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.559
The head of the bed the slider door and the fan

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.130
Circulating as well air moves quickly and keeps it nice and fresh really comfortable in here

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:49.849
alright, so located above the fridge and above the silverware drawer is

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:57.530
Our hanging wardrobe. We wanted to have a place where we could hang clothes to keep them

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.380
mostly wrinkle free

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:05.390
This is also where our fire extinguisher is stored

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.390
Yeah, that's the hanging wardrobe

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:16.520
Alright guys that pretty much does it for the inside of the van I think we've gone over every nook and cranny

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.280
There's any questions let us know but I think we've covered everything except for the garage

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:28.969
So let's jump around to the back of the van. I'll show you where the bikes go all of our dirty storage things like that

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.910
Alright, so this is the back of the van

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.890
Main reason that we did a platform bed was so that we could store the bikes

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.209
Underneath inside the van where we can lock it in the last van

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.819
We had people try to steal our bikes off the bike rack

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.459
While we were sleeping inside like right outside our back door not like made us feel really

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.280
Uneasy since mountain bikes are pretty expensive. So

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.360
We built this bed. Just high enough to fit both bikes inside. This is Ali's Santa Cruz Bronson

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.869
This is my Yeti SB 5.5 which is a 29. Er

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.099
with the front wheels off they mount on these fork mounts and

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.569
My front tire stores over here and her front tire stores on this side

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.619
So since we had to make the bed this tall in order to fit those bikes it really opens up a lot of storage

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.870
Well, you probably can't see

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:29.660
This lower compartment only goes in here maybe a foot and a half and the upper compartment goes all the way in

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.199
this is a spare picnic table or

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.650
Workbench or whatever it needs to be that we carry around

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:43.369
Normally, we'll have some camp chairs and then just extra storage space for larger items is kind of located here

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:49.969
But from here to that back wall underneath there is the 33 gallon freshwater tank

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.679
We kept the freshwater tank inside the vehicle so that in cold climates the water didn't freeze and we don't have any issues with that

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.139
This is also spare parts for the bikes

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.939
bike tools case we need to work on something on this side we've got

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.139
Both of our SI sucker bike racks

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.909
a couple different hydration packs

00:27:15.929 --> 00:27:17.929
For mountain biking and hiking

00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:22.549
Some more spare bike parts

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.740
Now

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.209
My tire comes out my helmet hangs here

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.299
Some knee pads Ally's helmet

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.440
this

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.799
ladder right here is a

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.789
collapsible

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:44.329
Eight-foot ladder or nine foot eight or nine foot. I don't remember big enough to get on top of the van

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.330
That's all we really need it for

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.729
Then there's also a collapsible bike stand that's in there

00:27:50.309 --> 00:27:52.020
In the very back

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.020
That's where our laundry is. If you remember from inside the van when you open up that little laundry chute

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.840
This is the back of that cabinet also the inverter and the water pump and water filtration

00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:09.589
System is all located in there as well. So not the pretty part of the van. This is definitely the utility oriented

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.070
part of the van

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.620
But everything's got its own little space in here helps us keep everything organized

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.069
So we installed one of these hanging shoe racks and we use it for

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.890
mountain bike shoes chain lube

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.600
sunglasses rags

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.260
Basically anything we need when we're getting ready to go biking

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:36.499
So you grab your shoes and your pads and your hydration pack pull the bikes out and you're ready to go

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.809
And I think that's about it for the back

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:46.670
For the garage and I think pretty much the only other things that we have that are outside is

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.720
the

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.160
Weboost RV cell booster. It's that white antenna

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.850
That's what actually receives the weak signal and then it boosts it and repeats it to an antenna that's inside the vehicle

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.059
Which is located inside that electronics

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.910
cabinet under the passenger side bench

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.640
Then we have the two solar panels

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.370
there 24 volt

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:17.750
280 watt solar panels so wired in series is 48 volts and 560 watts, which is definitely

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.510
Overkill, but like I've said before

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.610
Overkill's and necessity when you're living in a van and you don't want to run out of electricity because you need it

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.559
Blue cheese stuffed olives. Mmm

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.450

You know where we left off as soon as you get done clicking that?

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:21.860
Now that you've clicked that there's a little bell that's actually next to the subscribe button that turns on notifications

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.349
and then YouTube will actually

00:30:25.289 --> 00:30:29.719
when we post videos instead of you having to like look us up or search for it or

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.849
Occasionally it'll recommend a video click that bell right now then you'll get like a notification

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.489
It'll tell you when we post videos so you can watch all of them. And then if you could just like the video

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:47.299
That would be great too. And then like every other video of ours that you watch also

00:30:47.299 --> 00:30:52.158
I know it gets really broken record. It's kind of annoying but it helps us out and

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:57.379
All you got to do is click your mouse. So why not? We're gonna be traveling around

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.140
the United States and

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.499
Mountain biking hiking running climbing

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.399
yoga

00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:07.399
all of the outdoor things

00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:13.459
If we're near you we'd love to hang out with you. Give us a shout out in the comments if we're coming through your area

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.649
Yeah

00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:22.669
Converting a van is a really fun process whether you're gonna live in it or whatever your end goal is I highly recommend it

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:24.739
It's been a great experience for us

00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:30.919
If you have any questions about the van build itself trend here could answer all of them

00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:33.199
I would be happy to point you in history

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.609
You guys have any questions about the build by any of the specific products?

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.610
Like I said earlier

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.610
I'll put links to all the products

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.789
in the description

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:48.379
below if you want to shoot me any questions in the comments that you have about building a van or how to get started or

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:52.309
Basically any questions along the way I'm more than willing to help

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.479
Also, it's usually quicker to get a response from us on Instagram

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.640
So if you jump over to instagram and search tnt MTB shoot us a message on there

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.669
That's usually a quicker way to get a response than on youtube

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:10.369
