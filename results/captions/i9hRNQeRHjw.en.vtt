FIND OUT.

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:06.899
DAVE REUBEN HOSTS THE REUBEN

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.232
REPORT.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:08.634
WE DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:09.968
POLITICALLY BUT IS HE A

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.203
SINCERE BELIEVER IN FREE

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:11.570
SPEECH.

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:12.738
WE WANTED TO TALK TO HIM

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:13.205
TONIGHT.

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:14.139
DAVE, THANKS FOR COMING ON.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.541
&gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:16.875
&gt;&gt; Tucker: A LOT OF US

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:17.743
OVERESTIMATED THE

00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:18.477
WILLINGNESS OF THE

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:19.578
DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT TO

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.080
COEXIST WITH PEOPLE WHO

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:21.980
DISAGREE WITH THEM AND YOU

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.382
UNDER ESTIMATED THE REAL

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:24.716
THREAT, THE ACTUAL

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:25.517
EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO SPEECH

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:26.752
THAT WE FACE NOW.

00:00:26.753 --> 00:00:28.721
DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT?

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.356
&gt;&gt; WELL, I WISH I COULD SAY

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:32.057
THAT THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:33.225
SHOCKING BUT THIS IS EXACTLY

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:36.328
WHAT I HAVE BEEN RAISING THE

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.997
ALARM ABOUT ON MY SHOW FOR

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:39.131
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.566
AS YOU KNOW I COME FROM THE

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:40.866
LEFT.

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:41.433
I WAS A PROGRESSIVE.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:42.701
I STILL CONSIDER MYSELF A

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:44.570
LIBERAL IN THE BEST SENSE OF

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:45.604
CLASSICAL LIBERALISM AND I

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:46.272
BELIEVE IN THE INDIVIDUAL

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:47.173
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:48.741
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SEVERAL

00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:49.041
TIMES.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.009
BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS A

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.077
COUPLE THINGS HERE.

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:52.178
FIRST ON THE WAY THAT YOU

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.046
HAVE RESPONDED TO THE

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:55.815
ATTACKS BY NOT APOLOGIZING.

00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:57.216
I THINK THAT WAS EXACTLY THE

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:58.451
RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.020
YOU KNOW, ALL OF US HAVE

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.321
JOKED AND MADE MISTAKES.

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:03.856
ALL OF US HAVE A PAST.

00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:04.757
ALL OF US HAVE DONE THINGS

00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:05.958
THAT WE'RE NOT PROUD OF AND

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.960
A SERIES OF OTHER THINGS IF

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:08.794
YOU HAVE LIVED HAVE YOU DONE

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:09.762
THOSE THINGS INCLUDING, BY

00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:11.631
THE WAY, THE VERY SAME MEDIA

00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:12.598
MATTERS PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.400
AFTER YOU AND ALL THE MEDIA

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.237
ELITE WHO ARE -- THESE ARE

00:01:18.238 --> 00:01:18.638
PEOPLE.

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:19.772
&gt;&gt; Tucker: LET ME STOP YOU

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:20.973
THERE I AGREE IF I HAVE

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.041
WOUNDED OR WRONGED SOMEONE,

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:23.443
I WILL ALWAYS APOLOGIZE TO

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:24.877
THAT PERSON AND ASK FOR

00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:25.278
FORGIVENESS.

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.013
I DO IT EVERY DAY.

00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:27.547
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:28.915
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I'M NOT GOING TO

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:29.949
APOLOGIZE TO MEDIA MATTERS

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.384
OR SOROS GROUP.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:32.986
I HAVEN'T WRONGED THEM THEY

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:33.887
WRONGED ME.

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:35.288
I WILL NEVER BOW TO THEM

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.856
PERIOD.

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:38.524
EXCUSE ME, I COULDN'T

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:39.225
CONTROL MYSELF.

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.327
I'M FOR APOLOGY BUT NOT TO

00:01:41.328 --> 00:01:41.661
THEM.

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:43.296
&gt;&gt; WELL, I COULDN'T AGREE

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:43.596
MORE.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:44.931
BY THE WAY, THAT'S EXACTLY

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:45.865
THE MESSAGE THAT I THINK

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.400
YOUR AUDIENCE AND THE

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.334
AVERAGE AMERICAN NEEDS TO

00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:49.169
HEAR RIGHT NOW.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.138
WE HAVE WATCHED YEARS NOW OF

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.473
THE MOB COMING FOR

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:53.840
EVERYBODY.

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:55.341
AND AS YOU JUST LAID OUT, A

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:57.677
LOT OF THIS STUFF IS

00:01:57.678 --> 00:01:58.778
COORDINATED BETWEEN

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:59.813
NONPROFITS AND MEDIA

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:00.713
ORGANIZATIONS AND THE REST

00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:02.982
OF IT AND IT IS TIME THAT WE

00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:03.950
STOPPED GIVING INTO IT.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.452
AND NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:06.720
STOP GIVING INTO IT SO THAT

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:08.688
A GUY LIKE YOU ISN'T TAKEN

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.490
OUT AND THAT A NETWORK LIKE

00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.359
FOX ISN'T TAKEN OUT OR ANY

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.692
NETWORK.

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:13.760
WE ARE STILL FREE HERE IN

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:14.928
THIS COUNTRY FOR A LITTLE

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.129
WHILE LONGER I THINK AND I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.397
WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR.

00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:18.598
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.100
IT'S BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:20.901
REALLY TRYING TO DO IS

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:22.602
TRYING TO MAKE THE AVERAGE

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:23.737
CITIZEN, THE AVERAGE PERSON

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:26.406
WHO IS AN AMERICAN FEAR THAT

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:28.141
WHATEVER THEY SAID 20 YEARS

00:02:28.142 --> 00:02:29.409
AGO THAT SOMEONE CAN DIG UP

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.077
ON FACEBOOK OR WHEREVER IT

00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:33.680
IS OR SOME OLD AUDIO

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:34.414
RECORDING THEY GOAL AFTER

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:34.714
THEM.

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.750
YOU WERE JOKING AROUND WITH

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.118
BUBBA THE LOVE SPONGE.

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.719
I'M SURE AS A SHOCK JOCK DO

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.654
YOU KNOW OHIO WOULD LOVE TO

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:42.289
GET INVOLVED IN THIS FIGHT

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.623
IF HOWARD STERN HAPPENS TO

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:45.125
WATCH YOUR SHOW BY ANY

00:02:45.126 --> 00:02:45.492
CHANCE.

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:46.660
FOR 30 YEARS HE WAS THE

00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:48.028
NUMBER ONE SHOCK JOCK IN THE

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:48.462
COUNTRY.

00:02:48.463 --> 00:02:50.330
IMAGINE THE POLITICIANS,

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:51.532
ACTORS, MEDIANS, AUTHORS,

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.699
THAT WALKED THROUGH THAT

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.135
STUDIO AND SAID COMPLETELY

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:55.969
BANANAS CRAZY THINGS,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.604
SOMETIMES JOKING, SOMETIMES

00:02:57.605 --> 00:02:58.038
PARTLY TRUE.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.073
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:01.041
THE POINT IS THAT IF WE ARE

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.910
GOING TO COME FOR EVERYONE'S

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:04.612
PAST, GUESS WHAT?

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:06.313
THAT MEANS EVERYONE AND THE

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:07.348
SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.549
FOR YOU THEY BETTER WATCH

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.816
OUT.

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:11.252
AND THAT IDEA OF MUTUALLY

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:13.187
ASSURED DESTRUCTION IS NOT

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:14.421
IN THE -- IT'S NOT PART OF

00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:15.189
THE AMERICA THAT I WANT TO

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.123
BE PART OF.

00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:16.991
I WANT TO BE PART OF

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:18.459
SOMETHING THAT HAS A LITTLE

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.960
BIT OF FORGIVENESS THAT

00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:21.328
UNDERSTANDS WE ARE ALL

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.463
IMPERFECT CREATURES AND

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:23.430
LITTLE BIT MORE RESPECTFUL

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:24.965
OF OUR ABILITY TO AGREE TO

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:25.900
DISAGREE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.036
THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON.

00:03:29.037 --> 00:03:29.570
&gt;&gt; Tucker: EXACTLY.

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:30.905
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS I HAVE

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:31.739
RECEIVED, I DON'T KNOW,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.007
DOZENS OF TRANSCRIPTS OF

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:34.108
PROMINENT PROGRESSIVES

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.042
SAYING AWFUL THINGS ON THIS

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:36.477
SHOW OR THAT SHOW OR ATTACKS

00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:36.944
FROM THEM.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.546
WE COULD DO A WHOLE SHOW ON

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:38.846
THIS.

00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:39.947
THEY SAID IT, TOO.

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:41.248
I'M NOT DOING THAT BECAUSE I

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.283
THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:43.350
TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK AND

00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:44.919
MAKE JOKES AND MAKE MISTAKES

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.954
AND I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:47.755
THEIR GAME PERIOD.

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:48.890
I DON'T THINK IF I BENEFIT

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:50.726
FROM IT I'M NOT DOING IT

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.828
TELL US YOU I HOPE YOU WILL

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.895
COME BACK ON TO FURTHER

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:54.830
EXPLAIN IT WHAT COUNTY

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:55.764
AVERAGE PERSON WHO IS

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:56.531
ESSENTIALLY POWERLESS IN THE

00:03:56.532 --> 00:03:58.800
FAILS OF THIS DO TO PROTECT

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.869
HIS RIGHT TO HIS GOD GIVEN

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.203
RIGHTS?

00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:03.105
&gt;&gt; START SPEAKING UP NOW.

00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:04.206
YOU KNOW, THIS COMES UP

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:06.241
EVERY COLLEGE I SPEAK AT.

00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:07.442
EVERY PUBLIC EVENT I SPEAK

00:04:07.443 --> 00:04:07.709
AT.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.677
THIS IS WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE

00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:09.644
ARE ASKING ABOUT.

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:10.746
I AM AFRAID TO HE CAN SPOO

00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:11.012
UP.

00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:11.980
I WANT TO GET THE GRADE.

00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.281
I WANT TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:14.282
I DON'T WANT TO GET FIRED

00:04:14.283 --> 00:04:15.016
FROM MY JOB.

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:15.851
THAT FREEZING ABILITY THAT

00:04:15.852 --> 00:04:17.719
IS SILENCING GOD, DECENT

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.087
PEOPLE WHO USUALLY LEAN A

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:19.921
LITTLE BIT RIGHT.

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:21.056
THEY ARE USUALLY LIBERTARIAN

00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:22.524
OR CONSERVATIVE, SOMETHING

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:23.058
LIKE THAT.

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.126
IMAGINE IF EVERYONE STARTED

00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:25.060
OF SPEAKING UP.

00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:25.761
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:27.195
MOST PEOPLE ARE RACIST.

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:27.896
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MOST

00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:29.364
PEOPLE ARE BIGOTS OR WANT TO

00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:30.565
DO HARM.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:31.500
&gt;&gt; Tucker: OF COURSE NOT.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.268
&gt;&gt; GOOD PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:33.602
SPEAK.

00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:34.669
ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.403
BREAK THIS THING AND

00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:36.471
THEATION WHY THEY ARE COMING

00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:37.339
AFTER YOU BECAUSE HAVE YOU

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.274
BEEN THE MOST VOCAL IN THE
