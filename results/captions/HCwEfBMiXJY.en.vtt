00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.540
NARRATOR: Reaching the moon
was such an unbelievable feat

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.170
that even to this
day many people are

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.880
convinced the entire
event was actually

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.620
staged in a Hollywood studio.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.880
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest not only

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.580
did we land on the moon
but what we found there was

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.540
more incredible than we know.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.920
During the 1969 Apollo moon
mission, after the landing,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500
there was a very
strange two-minute

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.080
gap in radio transmissions.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.380
And what happened
during those two minutes

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.250
has been subject to
a lot of controversy.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.080
MISSION CONTROL: Neil, this
is Houston radio check, over.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.250
Columbia, this is Houston, over.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.040
ASTRONAUT: Small white object.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.000
NARRATOR: According to
scientists and NASA researcher

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.210
Otto Bender, various
ham radio operators

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.250
were able to intercept
secret communications

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.040
with mission control that
were not made public.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.420
The astronauts
apparently talked

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.120
about seeing extraterrestrial
objects on the moon,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.620
including flying saucers
parked along the edge

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.620
of a crater within their view.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.580
Now the truth of it is is
that each of the astronauts

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.380
had a separate medical channel.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.620
That channel was not public, and
it could have been very easily

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.380
used to communicate
information that you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.290
didn't want to be heard over the
general public transmissions.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.120
What's really interesting about
that story, though, is the fact

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.670
that within 30 minutes of
the landing on the moon,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.830
that story was
circulating around NASA

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.250
that, hey, guess what?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.460
They saw something on
the rim of a crater?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.500
They were all upset.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.830
They didn't know what to do.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.420
They didn't know if
they should go out.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.830
It is interesting when
you watch the feed of when

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.500
they came back from the moon.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.830
They're not sitting there
jumping up and down for joy

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.290
and saying I had
the most incredible

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.330
experience in my life.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.920
I was on the moon.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.170
They're not saying that.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.580
They look very sullen,
very depressed.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.960
They're looking down.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.750
They almost look like
they want to vomit.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.670
That's how disturbed they look.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.750
Could they have
seen something there

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.250
that they didn't want
to tell the public

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.460
because of the implications?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.000
I believe that what
this country set out to do

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.540
was something that was going
to be done sooner or later.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.170
We find for the first time
that man has the flexibility

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.210
or the option of either
walking this planet

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.120
or some other planet.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.210
It's a beginning of a new age.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.120
NARRATOR: After Apollo 11,
NASA would send six more

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.960
manned missions to the moon,
culminating with Apollo 17

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.380
in 1972.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.040
ALAN BUTLER: One of the
most interesting questions

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.420
with regard to our
interaction with the moon

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.250
is why we have never
gone back there again

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.670
since the Apollo missions?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.080
And what else is very telling
is that although the USSR

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.580
at the time was
getting to be quite

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.920
able to send its own
astronauts to the moon,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.750
it never seems to have done so.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.210
Could it be that there
were agencies associated

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.750
with the moon, aliens
or other beings,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.380
who had warned humanity to
stay away for some reason?
