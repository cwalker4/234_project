TO THEIR CONTROL.

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:04.464
SO WE TOLD YOU A LOT ON THIS

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:06.800
SHOW ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:07.600
DANGERS OF BIG TECH.

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.136
SOME OF THOSE DANGERS ARE

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:11.171
IMMINENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:14.240
AND THE MAIN ONE IS ROBOTICS

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.376
AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:17.711
REMARKABLY, THE PERSON, THE

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:18.445
POLITICAL FIGURE WHO IS

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.280
MAKING THE MOST SENSE ON

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.348
THIS SUBJECT WHO HAS THOUGHT

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.983
ABOUT IT MOST DEEPLY IS A

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:24.284
DEMOCRAT WHO IS RUNNING FOR

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:24.651
PRESIDENT.

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:26.419
HE IS ANDREW YANG.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.322
HE IS AN ENTREPRENEUR AND

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:30.523
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:31.391
CANDIDATE.

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:32.359
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.827
EXPANDED AUTOMATION COULD

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:35.028
POTENTIALLY CAUSE VIOLENCE

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:36.363
IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE NEED

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:37.263
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:37.964
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:39.232
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:39.933
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:41.468
ON AND I MEANT THAT WITH

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.202
SINCERITY.

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:43.436
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY IN

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:44.838
OUR POLITICAL CONVERSATION

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.473
DESCRIBE THE THREAT AS

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:47.941
CLEARLY AND COMPELLINGLY AS

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:48.641
YOU HAVE.

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:49.476
WHY SHOULD WOULD HE BE

00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:52.345
WORRIED ABOUT AUTOMATION?

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:53.947
&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:56.516
DROP WE AUTOMATED AWAY

00:00:56.517 --> 00:00:57.317
4 MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:58.251
MICHIGAN, OHIO,

00:00:58.252 --> 00:00:58.952
PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN,

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:00.220
MISSOURI AND THOSE

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.421
COMMUNITIES HAVE NEVER

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:02.222
RECOVERED WHERE IF YOU LOOK

00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:04.024
AT THE NUMBERS HALF OF THE

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:05.258
WORKERS LEFT THE WORKFORCE

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.526
AND NEVER WORKED AGAIN AND

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:07.594
THEN HALF OF THAT GROUP

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.864
FILED FOR DISABILITY NOW

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:12.098
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.166
MANUFACTURING WORKERS IS

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:15.001
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE TRUCK

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.102
DRIVERS, CALL CENTERS AND

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:17.303
FAST FOOD WORKERS ON AND ON

00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:18.972
THROUGH THE ECONOMY AS WE

00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:20.707
EVOLVE IN TECHNOLOGY

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:21.741
MARGINALIZES THE LABOR OF

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:23.510
MORE AND MORE AMERICANS.

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.144
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WHAT WILL THE

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:24.878
EFFECTS OF THAT.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.146
THAT'S A MASSIVE

00:01:26.147 --> 00:01:26.846
DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE.

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:28.048
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ONCE THAT

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:28.381
HAPPENS?

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:29.816
&gt;&gt; WELL, AS YOU SAID, I

00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:31.251
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:32.185
DISASTROUS WHERE IF YOU LOOK

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:33.253
AT TRUCK DRIVERS ALONE,

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:34.788
BEING A TRUCKER IS THE MOST

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.222
COMMON JOB IN 29 STATES

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:38.024
THERE ARE 3.5 MILLION TRUCK

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:40.427
DRIVERS IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:41.694
AND MY FRIENDS IN SILICON

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:42.962
VALLEY ARE WORKING ON TRUCKS

00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:44.064
THAT CAN DRY THEMSELVES

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:44.764
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:46.566
MONEY IS WE CAN SAVE TENS,

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:47.867
EVEN HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:49.302
DOLLARS BY TRYING TO

00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:50.203
AUTOMATE THAT JOB.

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:51.538
I WAS JUST WITH TRUCK

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.605
DRIVERS IN IOWA LAST WEEK

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:55.075
AND IMAGINING THAT COMMUNITY

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.076
RECOVERING FROM THEIR INCOME

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:57.844
GOING FROM LET'S CALL IT

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.145
$50,000 A YEAR TO MUCH, MUCH

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:00.346
LESS THAN THAT

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:00.847
CATASTROPHICALLY.

00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:01.781
IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:04.350
FOR MANY, MANY AMERICAN

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:04.984
COMMUNITIES.

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:05.685
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YOU ARE ONE OF

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.220
THE ONLY PEOPLE I HAVE MET

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.089
HONEST ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.692
INDUSTRIAL LABOR

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:12.725
INDUSTRIALIZABOR

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:12.759
INDUSTRIALIZATOR

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.026
INDUSTRIALIZATION.

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:14.561
ALL BECOME COMPUTER

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:15.595
PROGRAMMERS THAT DIDN'T

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:15.962
HAPPEN.

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:17.297
MY QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE TO

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:18.498
SIT PASSIVELY BACK AND LET

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.067
THIS HAPPEN TO HAPPEN TO THE

00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:21.401
COUNTRY.

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:22.569
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.069
FOR PRESIDENT.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.437
I THINK IT WOULD BE INSANE

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.539
TO WATCH THIS AUTOMATION

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.975
WAVE OVERTAKE OUR COUNTRY

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:30.210
AND ECONOMIES.

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:31.578
WE ARE NOT OSTRICHES.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.779
WE GET IT.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.980
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:34.581
REAL.

00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:35.782
SELF-DRIVING CARS AND TRUCKS

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:36.649
TESTED ON THE HIGHWAYS RIGHT

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.351
NOW AND WE NEED TO EVOLVE

00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:39.652
AND START PUSHING THE WAY WE

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:40.720
THINK OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:41.988
TO INCLUDE HOW OUR FAMILIES

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.623
ARE DOING, HOW OUR CHILDREN

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:46.226
ARE DOING.

00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:47.060
AND THINGS MATTER TO THE

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:47.627
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:48.895
G.D.P. IS GOING TO LEAD US

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:49.762
OFF A CLIFF.

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:51.664
YOU KNOW, ROBOT TRUCKS GREAT

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:52.398
FOR G.D.P.

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.267
TERRIBLE FOR MANY, MANY

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:54.834
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES.

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:55.768
GET WITH THE PROGRAM AND

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.036
FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACTUALLY

00:02:57.037 --> 00:02:59.772
MAKE THIS ECONOMY WORK FOR

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:00.173
PEOPLE.

00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:00.874
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I SIT WITH MY JAW

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.509
OPEN I AGREE WITH YOU SO

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.876
STRONGLY.

00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:03.776
LET ME ASK YOU FINALLY WHY

00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:04.911
ISN'T THIS A CENTRAL

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:05.912
QUESTION IN THE CAMPAIGN OF

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:07.747
EVERYBODY RUNNING FOR

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:08.681
PRESIDENT ON ANY SIDE AND

00:03:08.682 --> 00:03:09.883
WHY INSTEAD ARE THEY TALKING

00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:11.084
ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:12.519
ARE KIND OF FRIVOLOUS?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.253
WHY AREN'T THEY TALKING

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:13.987
ABOUT THIS.

00:03:13.988 --> 00:03:15.155
&gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD QUESTION,

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:15.488
TUCKER.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.422
ONE OF THE REASONS I'M

00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:17.690
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS TO

00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:19.225
PUSH THIS IN THE CENTER OF

00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:20.793
THE MAINSTREAM AGENDA WHERE

00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:21.528
EVERY CANDIDATE SHOULD BE

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:22.629
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.730
GOING TO DO ABOUT THE FACT

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:25.431
THAT WE'RE AUTOMATING AWAY

00:03:25.432 --> 00:03:26.499
THE MOST COMMON JOBS IN THE

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.433
ECONOMY RIGHT NOW.

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:28.468
AS WE ARE SITTING HERE

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.702
TOGETHER THE LABOR FORCE

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:30.470
PARTICIPATION RATE IN THE

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.238
UNITED STATES IS 63.2%.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.774
THE SAME LEVEL AS ECUADOR

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:35.408
AND COSTA RICA.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.076
AND IF ANYONE THINKS THAT'S

00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:38.244
WHERE AMERICA OUGHT TO BE,

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:40.113
THAT NUMBER IS EVEN GOING TO

00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:41.080
BE FURTHER CHALLENGED WHEN

00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:42.982
ALL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY COMES

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:43.449
ONLINE.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.384
MAKE AMERICA EMBRACE THIS

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:45.552
CHALLENGE OF THE 21st

00:03:45.553 --> 00:03:46.619
CENTURY AND THEN TRY AND

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.454
ADDRESS IT TOGETHER AS A

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:48.855
PEOPLE.

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:50.723
&gt;&gt; Tucker: LAST QUESTION.

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:52.292
SHOULDN'T PEOPLE WHO CITE

00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:53.860
UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS BE

00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.794
PENALIZED FOR SAYING

00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:55.395
SOMETHING SO STUPID?

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:55.828
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.163
WE HAVE A SERIES OF BAD

00:03:57.164 --> 00:03:57.497
NUMBERS.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:01.267
AND I REFER TO G.D.P. AS ONE

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:02.068
CERTAINLY HEADLINE

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.236
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:04.137
COMPLETELY MISLEADING AND

00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:05.638
ONE OF MY MANDATES AS

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.806
PRESIDENT IS I'M GOING TO

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:07.640
UPDATE THE NUMBERS.

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:08.575
THEY ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE TO

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:09.108
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:09.809
&gt;&gt; YES, YES.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.110
SO WE CAN KNOW WHAT'S GOING

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.377
ON.

00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:12.545
OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T MAKE

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:13.246
WISE DECISIONS.

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:14.514
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW AGAIN AND YOU

00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:14.814
KNOW.

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:17.016
THIS OUR LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:18.284
DECLINED FIRST TIME IN 100

00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:19.552
YEARS BECAUSE OF A SURGE IN

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.087
SUICIDES AND DRUG OVERDOSES.

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:22.088
HOW CAN YOU SAY AN ECONOMY

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.189
IS HEALTHY WHEN OUR PEOPLE

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.756
ARE DYING?

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:25.124
&gt;&gt; I LITERALLY -- I DON'T

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:26.092
EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ON

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:27.260
THE OTHER ISSUES AND I JUST

00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:28.295
SUPPORT WHAT YOU SAID SO
