THE PRES. HAS ENDORSED ME.

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.300
HE HAS ISSUED HIS THIRD TWEET.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.067
HE KNOWS I AM A BUSINESSMAN WHO

TRIES TO GET RESULTS AND I'M

00:01:53.267 --> 00:01:57.005

00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.139
CALIFORNIA.

00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:04.846
I THINK MR. ALLEN'S SUPPORTERS

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:05.580
ALL WANT A BETTER CALIFORNIA.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:06.347
I AM GOING TO REACH OUT TO

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.148
THEIR SUPPORTERS AND MODERATE

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:12.587
DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO

00:02:07.348 --> 00:02:13.121
CAN'T AFFORD A HOUSE, CAN'T

00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:13.788
AFFORD GASOLINE.

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.555
STUART: THAT MIGHT BE A

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:18.393
PROBLEM, YOU REACHING OUT TO

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:19.160
ANY DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE KNOWN OF

HAVING THE SUPPORT OF DONALD

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.762
TRUMP.

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:21.429
THAT IS NOT GOING TO GO DOWN

00:02:20.962 --> 00:02:25.099
WELL WITH ANY DEMOCRATS.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.736
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WILL BECAUSE OF

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.470
THE FACT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS,

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:31.472
THE CRONIES WHO ARE SELLING

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:42.517

00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:44.886
WHY ARE THERE 3 SOLID

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:45.620
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS?

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:46.320
THEY KNOW GAVIN NEWSOM WILL

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.088
TAKE THIS STATE OVER THE

00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.688
LIBERAL CLIFF HOLDING HANDS

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:49.690
WITH BERNIE SANDERS.

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.125
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:56.764
CALIFORNIA.

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:57.498
WORKING CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN

00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:58.266

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.067
DEMOCRAT MAJORITY, RUINED THE

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.404
WE WILL.

00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:10.244
POLICY, REPEAL THE GAS TAX, CUT

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:11.813
CORRUPTION AND MISMANAGEMENT OF

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:16.717
THE STATE.

00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:17.485
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

00:03:16.918 --> 00:03:17.919
BETWEEN ME AND MY REPUBLICAN

00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:18.653
