00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.700
SR: Hello, Sid Roth here, welcome to my world,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:15.440
where it's naturally supernatural! My guest
died, went to Heaven, but was sent back for

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.580
many reasons but one of the major reasons
was to reveal the secrets of Angels. Did you

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.230
know that your entire future was written in
advance, and there's books that have exactly

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:41.540
what you're supposed to do, and it's the job
of the Angels for to help you step by step

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.420
fulfill your destiny? But most Believers don't
know how to cooperate with the Angels! Would

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.530
you like to learn?
Audience: Yes! [applause and cheers]

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.040

Announcer: Is there a supernatural dimension?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:09.180
A world beyond the one we know? Can we tap
into ancient secrets of the supernatural?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:23.060
Can our dreams contain messages from Heaven?
Is God ready to bring a tsunami wave of healing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:34.320
onto planet Earth today? Sid Roth has spent
over 40 years researching the strange world

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.029
of the supernatural. Join Sid for this edition
of "It's Supernatural!"

Audience: [applause and cheers]
SR: Now, Kevin, you have told me many times

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:58.020
that there is an Angel that comes with you
to accomplish what you speak. Is that Angel

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.600
here now?
KZ: Yes, he's come.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.439
SR: I'm so glad you're here!
KZ: [laughs]

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.439
Audience: [laughs]
SR: [laughs]

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.460
KZ: And I'm even more relieved [laughing]
than you are about it. [laughs]

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.660
SR: [chuckling] Oh, okay. Now, you have a
mandate to teach on Angels. How did that come

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.310
about?
KZ: I was taught that we need to start to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.900
recognize the fact that we have been assigned
Angels that have read our books, in Heaven,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.860
according to Psalm 139. So this process of
them reading the books becomes the agenda

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.221
of Angels, which is the agenda of God! And
so this agenda of Angels come down and they

00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:43.260
make the agenda of Angels which is the agenda
of God our agenda. And that's their goal,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.480
is to cause us to do our books. They help
us, they assist us, so there's this mindset

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.780
that has to happen. And the Lord said to
me if this does not happen, this next move

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.600
of God will not be what He intended.
SR: Tell me about the first Angel you ever

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.080
encountered.
KZ: Well, Sid, well Sid I feel that people

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.120
talk too much about the devil, so they talk
about all the things that the devil's doing

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.120
to them. But if you talk, like one instance
where an Angel comes into your room like it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.590
did for me on this first time, and I was just
praying, I was just being a nice Christian,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.210
praying in tongues, pacing back and forth,
and all of a sudden, something shifted in

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.050
my room, and when I looked, the door had swung
open in my dorm room. And whatever came in

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.470
there, he was huge. I couldn't see in the
dark until he got close to me, but he must

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.280
have been 10 feet tall, and it looked like
he weighed 800 pounds. He was in full Roman

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.350
armor, centurion armor, that you can you can
look up! So he walked over to me, I had fallen,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.980
and I couldn't even move. The holiness of
God was just pulsating from him. He grabbed

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.480
me, he picked me up, and he said, "I have
been sent from the presence of the Lord to

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.040
tell you and to warn you that you must set
yourself apart. You must come out from among

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.100
everyone, and set yourself apart for the next
6 months." And he instructed me. He said,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.980
"Now there are people that are, are going
to actually be judged by God that are around

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.190
you right now. And they, you are not to be
their friends anymore."

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.690
Audience: Wow.
KZ: And he showed me who they were, and there

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.460
was a whole group of them. And I said I didn't
suspect any of this, so he told me, he said

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.000
he said, "Now you're going to set yourself
apart, and you are going to seek God, because

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.600
you are called, and the Lord has plans for
you, and you must do this." And all of a sudden

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.240
he stopped, and I said, "Continue", and he
said and he went like that, and he was listening

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.540
in his ear, and the Holy Spirit was speaking
to him,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.680
Audience: Hmm.
KZ: and he said, "I have been called to another

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.120
place. Go to the prayer", "prayer chapel,
and the Holy Spirit will finish my message."

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120
Audience: Wow.
KZ: And I said, "Well you're right here, just

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.040
go ahead and finish it!"
Audience: [laughs]

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.949
KZ: And he's he got he got he got upset with
me. He said, "I said go and pray, and the

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.800
Holy Spirit will finish it", and he turned,
and he started to run down the hallway, and

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.159
disappeared, into the air.
SR: And that was just his first encounter

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000
[laughing] with an Angel!
KZ: Yeah!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.659
Audience: [laugh]
SR: how there's something that a lot of people

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.540
don't understand. How does supernatural languages,
or speaking in tongues, coincide with these

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.820
messengers, these Angels?
KZ: When I was with Jesus, He showed me that

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.719
tongues was the number one way to enter
into the supernatural realm, while you're

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.060
doing your everyday life. And so I saw, though,
that when I prayed in tongues, I was praying

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.360
forth the will of God, according to Romans
8:26. So when in my weakness, the Holy Spirit

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.229
came in, and gave me the ability. Well, I
saw that Angels understood what I was saying

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.389
in tongues, but what I was saying in tongues
was the agenda of God, which when they looked

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.069
at their agenda that they were sent to help
me with, it was their agenda. So my agenda

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.469
was Angels' agenda, and it was God's agenda.
So why would you not pray in tongues all the

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:06.960
time, like Paul did?
Audience: [cheers]

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.559
KZ: Why would you not want to engage? And
I found myself in supernatural missions where

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.419
I felt like [chuckling] I was on some special
forces team. I had Angels that were taking

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.759
me places, and telling me go talk to this
person, and they would just be led to the

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:27.150
Lord immediately. And they're here right now,
Sid. They're every there's actually more Angels

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.720
with this group of people that we're talking
to, than there are people. There are at least

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.400
twice as many Angels
Audience: Wow.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560
KZ: in any one place.
Audience: [applause and cheers]

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.539
SR: Now, uh this it's going to get a little
crunchy. He had a meeting with some Angels

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:52.080
who identified themselves as Pentagon Angels,
and how they work to help the United States,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.340
and Israel! Be right back.
Audience: [applause and cheers]

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:05.620
[music] ANNOUNCER: We will be right back to
"It's Supernatural!"

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.440

[music] ANNOUNCER: We now return to "It's

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.000
Supernatural!"
Audience: [applause and cheers]

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.689
SR: He's having the time of his life. He has
uh the ability he's a seer to look into the

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:46.470
invisible world. Uh me, I can let him tell
me what he sees, and he's seeing so much stuff

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.830
going on! But if it's so much stuff going
on in here, it's going right through your

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.220
television and computer, I tell you. Tell
me about the Pentagon Angels.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.559
KZ: Well how that happened was I was at work,
and I 'd just checked into the hotel. And

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:04.810
when I went up to my room, I just told my
crew "I'll meet you for dinner", so we did

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.530
that. When I came back, I did not expect this,
you know, but when I opened my door to my

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.619
room, the power of God was so strong. Can
you imagine having the power of God in your

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:19.909
room stronger than any church service you've
ever encountered? And there's nobody in there,

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:26.320
I thought, until I heard the door shut, and
I turned to my right, and there, in the corner,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.539
were 6 Angels standing there, smiling, and
they looked like they were excited to talk

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:36.781
with me! And these didn't have wings, they
didn't have, you know, your standard they

00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:42.310
were just robed individuals. There were 6
of them, and they said, "We've been waiting

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:47.140
for you to come. We heard you're coming. We're
so excited", he says, "because you get it."

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.610
SR: [chuckles]
KZ: And I said, "I get it?" He goes, "Yeah!"

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:57.640
He says, "You operate in the Spirit, as though
we're real. And Angels love it when people

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.550
treat us as though we're real, and we're fellow
servants, because you know it says that in

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.790
the book of Revelation, that John was not
to worship that Angel because we are fellow

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.330
servants with you!"
Audience: Yes.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.380
KZ: And so they were so excited, and so they
began just to talk to me, and reveal the other

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.820
side to me, as I was standing there. And you
know what I said to them? I said, "No one

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.000
is going to believe this" [laughing]
Audience: [laughs]

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.660
SR: [laughs]
KZ: "if I ever tell anybody this!" And they

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:28.020
said "Well we heard that you worship
God everywhere you go, in your hotel room

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.850
after work. You work long days, and then you
walk in your room, and the first thing you

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.660
do is you raise your hands without music,
and you start to worship the Father God."

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.280
And they said, "Kevin, we have been sent to
talk to you about some things." And they started

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.720
to tell me about the move of God that was
coming, that was the Glory of the Father!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.760
So the Father was going to be revealed in
this last move! And they showed me how there

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.070
was the Charismatic movement, and there was
the Jesus movement, and now [chuckling] there's

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.820
going to be the Father movement!
Audience: Wow. [applause]

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.740
KZ: And the Father's been silent, in the
sense that He's spoken through His Son.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.720
SR: Right.
KZ: And so, they started to tell me all these

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.420
things, and they started to reveal to
me. They said really, the special forces Angels

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.740
are already on the ground, and all their equipment
for this next move! So don't wait any longer,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.680
because it's already rising, and the Glory
of the Lord is there. So they taught me, listen,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.880
Sid, they taught me how to yield to the Glory,
and speak from the Glory. So when the Glory

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.820
comes into a room, you speak from it, and
you become another person. And so they taught

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.930
me how to do that. They actually showed
me, I'll just tell you. They handed

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.900
me my books that I haven't even written yet.
Audience: Wow.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.420
KZ: They handed them through the veil a veil,
and they said, "These are from the Father

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.660
God. These are given to you, and they are
not to be touched by any other man, because

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.920
they are sacred. So don't let anyone edit
out anything that the Father God gives you to

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.760
write, because the people need to hear these
things." I said I said, "Can you guys come

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.780
with me?", and they said, "Oh no, we can't
because we're assigned to the Pentagon."

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.880
SR: Now this room you were in was right across
the street like from the Pentagon.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.720
KZ: Yeah! You could see the Pentagon through
my window. And I said, "You work at the Pentagon?",

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.560
and they said, "Yeah, those people over there,
they think they're running this country, but

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.520
we really" [laughs]
Audience: [laughs]

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.700
SR: [laughs]
KZ: [laughing] "we really are."

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.220
Audience: [laughs and applause]
KZ: [laughing] That's what they said!

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.680
They said, "We're there for "
SR: I haven't seen that

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.380
KZ: [laughs]
SR: on Fox or CNN lately!

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.760
Audience: [laughs]
KZ: [laughs]

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.420
SR: [laughs]
KZ: And I said, "Oh, people aren't going to

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.850
believe this, at all."
Audience: [chuckles]

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.040
SR: [chuckles]
KZ: I thought, "Oh." You know, so for a while,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.610
I never told anybody, but I they said the
importance was is that this country

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:44.640
must stay with its foundation, which is God
Almighty, and that the prosperity of this

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.070
nation was helping support missionaries all
over the world, they said.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.480
Audience: Yes.
KZ: And, that the interests of Israel were

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.280
their assignment at the Pentagon, so they
were under Michael, and they were sent as,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.860
under Michael the Archangel, sent to the Pentagon,
to make sure that Israel was always protected.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.200
Audience: [cheers]
KZ: And I just want to talk to the people

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.640
at home, because one thing that I noticed
about Jesus, when I had my Heavenly visitation

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:21.000
with Him, was is that I felt value, and
I felt secure. And I know that Jesus sent

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.760
Angels to make us feel secure. They're there
to secure your life, and to help you. But

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.420
you've got to remember something: Jesus values
you. The Father values you. And I'm telling

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.100
you this because you've got to stay in there
with God right now. Do not give in. Those

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.080
demons, they're going to have to stop tormenting
you at night. They're going to they're going

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.700
to stop, because I'm breaking the power right
now.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.240
Audience: Amen! [applause]
KZ: Those visitations at night are going to

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.820
be Angels! The Lord is going to turn it around,
and Angels are going to visit you at night!

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.520
You know, Sid, I hear people all the time,
they tell me um that, "You know the devil

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.860
said this to me, and you know, these demons,
they keep bothering me." But I hardly ever

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.480
hear anybody say, "Oh, my Angel came and told
me that I'm doing fine, and that, "Tomorrow

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.100
I got a big surprise for you." You know you
say that, and they think you're loopy!

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.120
Audience: [laughs]
KZ: But if you go to get a testimony service

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.620
at church, they'll tell you, like for 15 minutes,
what the devil's been doing to them all week.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.700
But, I'm sorry, I've just I just feel that
the church needs to turn around the Body of

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.620
Christ, that Messiah has delivered us!
Audience: [cheers]

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.260
KZ: And so the Angels have come to deliver
us! The Holy Spirit inside of us, He's a deliverer!

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.540
Audience: Yes!
KZ: And so it's time to start talking about

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.460
what the Angels are doing! They have the agenda,
and it's the agenda of God, and it's our books.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.660
SR: Speaking of the agenda of God, he learned
so much, and there he had an experience

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.170
that, you correct me if I'm wrong, you've
never really publicly shared before

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.270
KZ: Um hmm.
SR: on Mount Sinai. We'll talk about it when

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.680
we come back.
Audience: [applause and cheers]

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.920
[music] ANNOUNCER: We will be right back to
"It's Supernatural!"

00:14:04.260 --> 00:16:34.240
[Promo].

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:42.520
[music] ANNOUNCER: We now return to
"It's Supernatural!"

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.180
Audience: [applause and cheers]

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:53.600
SR: Kevin, you literally went to what you
call the command center in Heaven.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.020
What did you see?
KZ: Well I was surprised that Heaven is

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.440
a Kingdom of course you know the
Kingdom of God

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.460
but it has a military! And there was a
military department,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.060
and a military building, and there was a command
center. And Jesus was head of all the Angels!

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:17.900
He was the Lord of Hosts! And all the Angels
answered to Him, and there's all these different

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.140
ranks. And there's all different kinds of
Angels, there's more than we even know. And

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:28.200
they are asking Jesus, "What do we do about
this, because their book says this?" And they

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.059
have these books that they went and got! There
they've got people's names on them! "And this

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:38.510
is what You wrote about them, Lord, before
they were born. You wrote each one of their

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.380
days in a book. And so this is what's going
on, but we", "we need to know what we should

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.020
do about this, because", "if they're being
disobedient, or if they're in rebellion."

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:54.590
It's hard for an Angel to win people over,
so the Holy Spirit has to work, and Jesus

00:17:54.590 --> 00:18:00.780
has to work on other ways, so they send people.
They run into people, and the Angels are told,

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.640
"Okay, set it up so that they talk to this
person on the bus", and so you'll find yourself,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.160
if you're in disobedience, every year you'll
find yourself in the same spot and being told

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.140
the same thing, because the Angels put you
in a cycle. So the command center does all

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.160
this. They determine who they're going to
influence. Listen to this. It has to do with

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.680
a whole generation.
Audience: Wow.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.611
KZ: So everything that is done, God is thinking about
His family, but not just our generation, but

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:32.440
the next generation. And, they also have these
notes that say that a previous generation

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.420
prayed, so we have to honor that.
Audience: [cheers]

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.420
SR: Hmm!
KZ: Yeah!

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.540
Audience: [applause and cheers]
SR: Now this gets pretty deep!

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.880
KZ: Oh I'll tell you it does! [chuckles]
SR: Now, I want to hear about that experience

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.640
you've never shared publicly on Mount Sinai.
KZ: Well that, I'm telling you, I I don't

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.960
know where to start with that except that
I was writing in a book, by another title.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.840
And as I was doing that, I sat in my chair
that I write in, and the power of God was

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:02.940
so strong in my office, and all of a sudden
I didn't feel the chair anymore. And so I

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.890
knew that you know, something was shifting,
and that

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.660
SR: Uh you know as you're starting to share
this, the presence

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.960
KZ: Yeah!
SR: of God is getting stronger, and stronger

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.160
really, on what you're saying, right now!
KZ: Yeah.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.720
SR: Go ahead.
KZ: Well, what happened was as I went somewhere,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.080
and I, and I'm just being honest with you,
maybe people can help me out, because I can't

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.520
explain it! This happens to me, as a normal
Christian. I don't claim to have any rank

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.040
in the Body of Christ. I just I'm just a normal
Christian that prays in tongues. And I don't

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.000
think of myself as anything else, so the
playing field is level with this. I was doing

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.970
what God asked me to do, to write this book.
And I found myself on a mountaintop, very

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:49.870
high up, and there were Angels surrounding
the top of this mountain. And in the center,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:56.500
I saw a man talking, in the Glory, with someone.
I could not see who it was, but I believe

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.630
it was God, and it was Moses.
Audience: Wow.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:05.560
KZ: And I didn't know what to do, so I looked
down, and it looked like there was snow on the

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:12.460
ground, but it was this gray, slate-type rock.
And I kicked one of the rocks, and I thought

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.240
it was snow, but it didn't it didn't uh respond
like snow would.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.020
SR: Right.
KZ: It was white hot, from the person who

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:27.430
was standing in the center, God Almighty.
And the place was so holy that I couldn't

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:32.621
move anymore, but I felt at home. I felt clean.
You know the fear of the Lord is clean, it

00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:36.000
says. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom." I started to receive downloads

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.660
for this new book, called "The Agenda of Angels".
So then, I had I saw 4 of these Angels move

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.440
forward to talk to me, and one of them spoke,
and this is what he said. He said, "Go back

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:56.180
and tell the people not to grieve their Angels."
And I said, "I have. I've told them." He says,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:01.240
"It's not enough", and he gave me Exodus 23,
where it talked about the Angel that was sent

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.960
among the children of Israel, because God
couldn't be among them because they were

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.760
"stiff-necked and unbelieving".
Audience: Hmm.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:13.260
KZ: So, he said, "That Angel was grieved and
provoked." And its, and God said, "Don't provoke

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.860
that Angel, because he will not tolerate your
sin." And those Angels said, "It's happening,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.400
Kevin." And he said, "You need to go back."
He said, "The Angels have been sent to work,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.660
with man, and implement this next move. It
must happen, because the harvest must come

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.000
in", and I was back in my chair in my office
again.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.380
Audience: Wow.
SR: Hmh!

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.760
KZ: And the presence of God was so strong,
and the love of the Father. I feel that this

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:43.080
generation is so valuable to God, and I feel
it's time, uh and I know this as a fact: We're

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.780
going to get visited, and a lot of people,
whether they like it or not, the supernatural

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.260
is going to invade their environment.
Audience: Amen!

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:56.970
KZ: But I'm telling this now on this show
because I sense that the children of God who

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.900
have walked with God, they should be able
to jump in right now,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.340
Audience: Amen.
KZ: not wait, and that's what the Angels are

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.200
saying. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom", and don't provoke your Angel by

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.740
being unbelieving and -
SR: What do you mean by, "Jump in"?

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:18.220
KZ: Well, there's a river of life. I saw the
river of life when I was in Heaven, and it

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.460
was so beautiful, I knew if I got one drink
out of that river of life, that I would live

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.350
a thousand years, so I was like wanting to
go down there and drink! And but I didn't

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:34.900
get to, I got sent back. But here's the thing:
That river is coming up from within us!

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.940
Audience: Wow!
KZ: Jesus said that that river is coming up

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.500
from within us, and it's eternal life! And
I'm just telling you that the Angels are waiting

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.030
for us to tap into what God has already done
through Jesus the Messiah. We need to go ahead

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:54.840
and go to the altar, go back to the cross.
We need to turn our faces back towards the

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.981
Lord God, and allow the Angels to do their
job! That's what they would do if you were

00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:02.840
interviewing them!
SR: You know what I'm hearing you say? That

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.960
it's time for a new beginning.
KZ: Yeah.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.840
Audience: Amen. [applause]
SR: I'm hearing you say, "You know better."

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.640
"You know better." And it's time to stop
letting the flesh control your life.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.900
Audience: Amen!
SR: It's time to let God control your life!

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:28.320
Look in the camera, and I want you to pray
a prayer, that people surrender to God.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.280
KZ: Right now, just open your hearts.
Father, I just thank You.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.060
Just say it, Father, I thank You.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.500
SR and Audience: Father, I thank You.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.600
KZ: I relinquish my will to you.
SR and Audience: I relinquish my will to you.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.800
KZ: Tell the Angels to pull my book in Heaven,
SR and Audience: Tell the Angels to pull my

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.380
book in Heaven,
KZ: and allow the Angels to implement that.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.680
SR and Audience: and allow the Angels to implement
that.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680
KZ: I agree with Your will.
SR and Audience: I agree with Your will.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.560
KZ: I hand over my life to Jesus the Messiah.
SR and Audience: [music] I hand over my life

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.820
to Jesus the Messiah.
KZ: Everything I give to You.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.720
SR and Audience: Everything I give to You.
KZ: Nothing withholding,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.300
SR and Audience: Nothing withholding,
KZ: offering myself as a sacrifice,

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.540
SR and Audience: offering myself as a sacrifice,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.720
KZ: in the name of Jesus Messiah.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.340
SR and Audience: in the name of Jesus Messiah.
KZ: [choking up] Amen.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.060
SR: You've said that prayer, you meant it.
Get ready for the ride of

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.820
your life!
KZ: [chuckles]

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.120
Audience: Amen! [cheers and applause]
