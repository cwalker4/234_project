00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.143
- I do not.

00:00:02.143 --> 00:00:03.254
- Do you drink coffee?

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:04.087
- I do not.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:05.140
- That's crazy 'cause guess what

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.243
Mormons also don't.

00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:07.076
(giggles)

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.264
Hmm, getting warmer.

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:11.539
("In the Hall of the Mountain
King" by Edvard Grieg)

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.600
- Hi, my name's Isla Gizon.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.830
- You can call me Pastor Abe.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.640
I'm a traveling speaker.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.172
Evangelist, I just talk to people.

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:20.200
- [Interviewer] About?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.375
- Jesus.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:22.410
- [Interviewer] Are you religious?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.480
- I'm a seminary drop out.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.910
I actually was a youth pastor
for a handful of years.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.400
My old Pastor stole a
bunch of money from me,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.958
it's a long story.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:31.972
- [Interviewer] Today
you're gonna be guessing

00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:33.781
which religion everybody is.

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.616
- Oh, this is gonna be easy.

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.437
- 'Course I picked the
sluttiest outfit that I

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.207
(laughs)

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:40.770
- [Interviewer] Everybody,
walk on out there.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.443
- This is gonna be offensive.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.783
- [Interviewer] At your highest point,

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:48.616
how religious were you?

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.200
- Oh, I went through exorcisms,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.411
I cried after sex.

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.291
(all laughing)

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.557
Edit that part out. Edit it out.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.920
- Dude, your so hairy bro.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.360
- Blue Flamingo Members Lounge.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.963
Okay, sounds like a strip club.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.900
(laughs)

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010
- I'm like juggling
between Jewish and Muslim.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890
- Why, what makes you say that?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
- I'm guessing you're of, maybe perhaps,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.883
Middle Eastern,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.154
- Yeah.

00:01:22.154 --> 00:01:22.987
descent, yeah?

00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:23.820
- Yeah.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.653
- Oh my God, that's super offensive.

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:25.486
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:28.020
- You're like Muslim, Islamic, right?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.853
- Why do you say that?

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:30.640
- 'Cause of where your from.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.473
- Where am I from?

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:33.130
- The Middle East, bro. You're like hairy.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.470
- You're kinda hairy too.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.360
- Yeah.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.722
- Skinny jeans, hip, strip club.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:38.555
(giggles)

00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.770
So I think, atheist.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.640
- [Interviewer] Alright, next.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.473
- I'll take that.

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:43.579
- Thank you.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.710
- Okay.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.543
- Hi
- Hi

00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:47.000
(laughs)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.140
- Are you Jewish?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.000
- Why do you think I'm Jewish?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.843
- I'm starting to think that I think

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.590
that everyone looks Jewish.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.240
This is bad you guys.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.430
I've been binge watching
The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
- Like your sense of style,
very covered up though.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.980
The only part of your
skin I see is your face.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.220
- Evangelical.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.346
- Say John three sixteen.

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:08.179
- Oh God,

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.012
(laughing)

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:11.360
- Boom! I got, I know
exactly what she is now.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.993
You're Jewish. Say,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.971
I don't know anything in Jewish lish.

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:18.240
- L'chaim

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.050
- Oh, my gosh, this guy's a Jew.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.232
I mean, that sounded bad.

00:02:22.232 --> 00:02:23.065
(laughing)

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:23.898
That sounded bad.

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:25.180
(laughs)

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.448
I'm about to get in trouble for this.

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:27.347
(laughing)

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.853
- Oo, Oo.

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:29.686
- Thank you.

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:30.519
- What brand are they?

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.352
- I've no idea.

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:32.394
- You don't believe in brands.

00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:34.090
(scoffs)

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.750
Fascinating.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.670
- What?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.600
- You don't believe in brands.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.280
Which is kinda like not
believing in holidays.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.810
Which kinda sounds like
you're a Jehovah Witness.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.643
- What is your name?

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:45.476
- Shiraz

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:48.070
- Okay, so wine, you're Italian.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.055
And Italians are predominantly Christian.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:50.888
(claps)

00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:51.721
Hot now!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.070
- Oh man. What's your ethnicity?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.903
- I'm Israeli.

00:02:55.903 --> 00:02:57.760
- Is there any foods you can't eat?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.810
- Well I eat everything but in my religion

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.320
we can't eat pork.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.840
- Are you kidding me?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.034
- Wait.

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:06.370
- How many religions can't eat pork

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.283
other then the one that I know?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.515
- It's okay.

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.618
- Jewish, everyone seems Jewish.

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:14.030
(laughs)

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.810
- Okay, mm hmm yeah,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.070
the tattoo looks tribal.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.063
- You look,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.020
like Indian.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.853
She's Hindu.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.770
- Is it 'cause I'm brown?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.506
- Yeah, it is, a little bit.

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:29.620
- But you're brown too.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.630
- It looks like a Pacific Islander tattoo.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.963
So I would say Mormon. A
lot of Samoans are Mormons.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.790
- How's it?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.933
- Your Hawaiian bro.

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:39.766
(laughs)

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:40.750
- I was born in Hawaii.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.900
- Knew it, I knew it.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.010
- My mother's in Brooklyn.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.520
- So you've got some Puerto
Rican, your Catholic.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.650
Got it! You just gave it away bro.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.330
- Nice button up shirt.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.453
I feel like you just took
off your clergy collar.

00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:53.286
(laughs)

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:55.301
- Can you sing me your favorite hymn?

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:59.551
- ♪ They shall live at His command ♪

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.800
- You're a Jehovah's Witness.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.260
- You're a Father.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.160
You're a Catholic Priest.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.993
Motherfucker.

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:09.130
(laughing)

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.263
- Oh my God.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.950
- Are you Asian?

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.130
- I get that a lot but no, I'm Hispanic.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.338
- Oh, Catholic.

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:17.250
(tongue clicks)

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.830
- 'Cause I'm Hispanic I'm Catholic?

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.910
- One thousand percent.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.220
- Water proof shoes, that
means you're on the road a lot.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.170
Walking a lot, traveling,
doing important stuff

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.060
for the Lord.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.819
- Can you sing for me too?

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.819
- ♪ I see my mother kneeling
with her family each day ♪

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.730
- That sounded a lot like my cousin's

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.450
like when I would attend Mormon church.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.730
- Do you drink wine?

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.563
- I do not.

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:44.480
- Do you drink coffee?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.313
- I do not.

00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:47.120
- Does your church have
a basketball court?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.998
- Yes.

00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:49.980
- Ah ha! I got it!

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.813
- You're Mormon.

00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:51.646
- She's Mormon.

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:53.440
- Catholic. I got that one.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.629
Right on the money bro.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.910
- I love your head scarf.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.910
I don't necessarily think
that makes you Muslim.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.000
- Where are you from?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.020
- Ghana.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.570
- There's a lot of missionary
trips that goes out to Ghana.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.610
I'm a have to go with Christian.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.380
- Amish, they wrap their heads too.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.113
Black Amish curve ball.

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:16.238
(laughing)

00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:18.297
- [Interviewer] How do you think you did?

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:20.380
(laughs)

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.433
- Terribly.

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:24.350
- I think I only really got
the Catholic Priest right.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.496
- I think I got this
guy for sure, for sure.

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:28.810
The hairiness, I can't get over it.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.933
- [Interviewer] Raise your
hand if he got you right.

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:33.291
(laughs)

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.160
- Shut the front door.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.014
One, two, three, four.

00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:41.014
- Oh! Wow, I did so much
better than I thought.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.367
- Wow. Strip club man.

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:44.700
- Alright.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.180
So I'm actually Muslim.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.013
- Oh, Okay.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.540
- I just couldn't get
over the hairiness bro.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.460
- It's just, I feel like
I'm a bad representation

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.293
for Muslims.

00:05:52.293 --> 00:05:54.170
- No, no you're perfect bro.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.530
- Let's say if I was of Asian descent.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.363
- Are there a lot of Chinese Muslims?

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.330
- Yeah, there's like
a whole city dedicated

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.200
to Chinese Muslims.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.033
- I did not know that.

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:02.866
- Yeah.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.140
- I'm Jewish.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.080
- Oh, okay.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.170
- What gave it away?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.420
- I don't know dude, I'm
telling you, I thought everyone

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.606
was Jewish at first.

00:06:10.606 --> 00:06:11.439
(laughs)

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.580
- Were actually reformed
Jews, specifically.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.413
- What does that mean?

00:06:15.413 --> 00:06:17.300
- Judaism is a very strict religion

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.630
like they don't want men and women

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.810
to be in the same temples

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.460
and reformed Jews disagree
with that completely.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.150
- What stereotype do you hate
the most about Jewish people?

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.905
- People will assume that
I'm really stingy with money.

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.360
- Yeah I've heard that.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.193
- Yeah.

00:06:30.193 --> 00:06:31.880
- Not heard that you're stingy with money.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.977
I heard that stereotype
and it's fucked up.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:35.840
(laughs)

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.910
- Oo, I got you wrong didn't I?

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.189
- Yeah, you called me
Italian or something.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.560
(laughs)

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.808
I'm from Israel.

00:06:42.808 --> 00:06:45.157
- Oh! I would never have guessed that.

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:46.500
- I'm not Jewish.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.761
- I knew that.

00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:48.594
- What is your religion?

00:06:48.594 --> 00:06:49.427
- I'm Druze.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.030
- Druze, oh interesting.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.863
What is that?

00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:55.060
- So we come from the Middle East.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.270
- What about here in America?

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.640
How many Druze do you have?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.520
- I don't meet any Druze here.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.353
- Oh.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.203
- We have like five main
prophets that we believe in.

00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:03.400
- Who are the five?

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.733
- I can't say out loud.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.786
It'd be too offensive.

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:07.619
- Oh.

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:09.430
- We're not allowed to
say their names out loud.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.740
- Do you have to marry a Druze?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.573
- Yes.

00:07:11.573 --> 00:07:14.590
- So if you brought home like
a Korean, Black, Druze man

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.120
- I would be kicked out from my village.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.245
- Sorry Mom.

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:19.920
(laughing)

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.753
- Hello.

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:22.370
- Hi, so I'm Hindu.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.580
- Okay, but that's not
a Hindu tattoo, right?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.650
- No this is Fijian. I'm Fijian.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.483
- Oh.

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:29.880
- Yeah. There's a lot of Hindu Fijians.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.713
- Wow.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.804
- So basically the British stole my

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:36.040
great, great, great, great, great, grandpa

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.770
and took him to Fiji.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.603
- From India.

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:39.530
- That happened, yeah from India.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.646
- Those Brits man.

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:42.330
(laughs)

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.210
- Father.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.250
- I'm actually one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.682
- Oh, I knew there was one of you here.

00:07:47.682 --> 00:07:48.515
(laughs)

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:49.348
- Jehovah's Witness.

00:07:49.348 --> 00:07:50.356
- Yes.
- Oh!

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:53.070
- No that was really,
'cause I thought legit,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.147
yeah she's not gonna guess I'm JW.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:56.091
Oh, what?

00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:56.924
(laughs)

00:07:56.924 --> 00:07:57.757
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:00.130
but you guys don't even
celebrate your birthdays, right?

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.963
- Yeah, we don't.

00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:02.600
- So you've never a birthday party?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.433
- No.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:04.810
- Have you ever knocked my door?

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.643
- No.

00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:08.000
- If you did I would answer it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.339
- Okay, I appreciate that.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:10.258
- Next.

00:08:10.258 --> 00:08:11.550
(laughing)

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.290
- So I'm not Catholic.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.084
- Oh, what are you then?

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:16.100
- I belong to the

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.039
Church of Jesus Christ
of Ladder Day Saints.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.122
- Oh.

00:08:19.122 --> 00:08:19.955
- Have you heard of them?

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:21.330
- Yeah, yeah Mormons right?

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.643
- Yeah, but we don't go by Mormons.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.240
Yeah, 'cause we don't
wanna take Christ's name

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.260
out of the Church.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.180
- Does that mean a Mormon
doesn't call themselves a Mormon?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.070
- Not anymore, they advise
us to correct that now.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.110
- Oh, who's they?

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.140
- Our prophet.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.010
- Who's your prophet?

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.300
- President Nelson

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.300
- Oh, he's like the Pope
of the Mormon Church.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.550
- Yeah, we have a Ladder Day Prophet.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.780
- Oh, yeah that's what I
meant, that's what I meant.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.613
- Yes.

00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:45.446
- Ladder Day, my bad.

00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:47.920
- Why do everybody think
Mormons have many wives?

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.480
- Well back in the day, I guess,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.092
there wasn't husbands because
of the wars and stuff.

00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:54.900
- So it was just based on the fact

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.427
that there was a shortage of men?

00:08:57.427 --> 00:08:58.260
- Yes.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.905
- There's a lot of talk
about the Mormon underwear.

00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:01.738
- Oh garment.

00:09:01.738 --> 00:09:04.190
- Is that a true thing that
you guys never take off?

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.180
- Okay so,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.350
- That's a weird thing.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.520
I feel bad for asking.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.820
- It's sacred garments to remind us

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.770
of the covenants we make in the temple.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.990
- But you can never take that sucker off?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.610
- We don't have to
shower in it or anything.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.120
- You stick a middle finger before?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.110
- Yes, I have.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.220
- Can we stick it together?

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.137
Oh! Oh ho!

00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:22.870
(laughing)

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.040
Bad Mormon.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.424
- Oh, I got you right.
I know I got you right.

00:09:25.424 --> 00:09:26.400
(laughs)

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.690
I know I got, Christian right?

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.523
- Yeah.

00:09:28.523 --> 00:09:30.310
- Boom. We just have that telepathy going.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.164
- What type of Christian?

00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:33.570
- So my parents grew up Methodist,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.470
so I'm Methodist.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.303
- I grew up Methodist.

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:36.136
- Oh really?

00:09:36.136 --> 00:09:36.969
- With the flame on the side of the cross.

00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:38.310
- Uh huh, yes, yes.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.260
- Do you usually wear a head wrap?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.793
- I'm wearing it 'cause it's cold outside.

00:09:41.793 --> 00:09:42.626
- Oh.
- So.

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:43.500
- So is there a difference

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.580
between Christianity here

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.980
versus Christianity there?

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.480
- Yeah, so for me I grew up here

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.070
but my family is originally from Ghana

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.170
so they're a lot more strict

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.160
on what they believe and certain things.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.350
Like pre marital sex,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.990
same sex marriages, all of that stuff.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.160
Like I would say I'm more
open to like certain ideas

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.030
than they would be.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.863
- Well, thank you.

00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:03.696
- Yeah, no problem.

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:05.165
- Fellow United Methodist.

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:05.998
- Yes.

00:10:05.998 --> 00:10:07.130
- I've got a lot of student debt

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.179
from my Methodist upbringing.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:09.210
(laughs)

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.593
- I kinda did good.

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.867
- [Interviewer] How'd that go for you?

00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:15.020
(exhales)

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.960
- I feel bad 'cause I said a lot of stuff

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.000
that I feel like I'm a get in trouble for.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.833
- [Interviewer] Did
you learn anything new?

00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.922
- Druze, is that how you say it?

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:22.755
- Yeah, Druze.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.290
- Yeah, I learned that exists.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.640
- I feel very blessed

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.430
and I'm gonna probably go to heaven now.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.380
- [Interviewer] Raise your hands.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.213
Is he going to heaven?

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:36.405
(jeers and giggles)

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:37.576
- [Interviewer] Well good job.

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:39.826
(applause)

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:42.783
- Thanks everyone.

00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:44.569
(crowd murmuring)
