00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.019
you know what

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.920
the second best thing about being a
photographer is getting to drive the digger 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.520
now why am I here? why am I sitting in a digger? why am I in this sort of odd environment?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.400
well, I wanna talk to about practicing things now I learnt to drive a digger by

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.100
by doing lots of practice, but you ned to do lots and lots of 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.510
practice with your photography and you
can do that any way you like and that's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.040
why we're here, I mean look at this place right, just have a little look around.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.050
okay what pictures could you possibly
take here? it is uninspiring

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.540
it is a mess, we've got rubbish, we got wheelbarrows we've got all this kinda stuff going on.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.100
The thing is you can practice

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.450
some simple photography techniques
anywhere I said it so many times in your

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450
living room in the front room in the
rain

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.710
any way you like stuff like composition

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.350
you know creative things you can do
anywhere basic composition things we're

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.840
gonna do that in a minute the first
thing you have to get your head around

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.520
when you're learning about photography

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.160
is you've got to give up wanting amazing
pictures

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.509
when you see amazing pictures we'll go, I'm gonna buy a camera, I'm gonna shoot stuff 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.179
like that but you're not seeing the
dedication of work that went into getting

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.479
them

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.590
was talking to my friend Bella West, only last week actually 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.679
about her fellowship, she had fellowship
to the

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.670
master photographers Association she also got a fellowship to the British Institute

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.700
of professional photographers that's a
massive achievement

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.550
and people look at her panel of pictures and go wow isn't Bella West great? and 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.429
she is great

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.270
but what you don't see when you look at
the pictures in her panels

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
is that it took her six years

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.780
to produce what a dozen? a couple dozen pictures for her panels,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.360
six years work went into that she failed her fellowships 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.069
twice she had to change direction and
alter the whole project on many

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.069
occasions and had many nights staying up

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.750
staying awake crying tears all that
kinda stuff thinking about giving up

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.209
that is why now you can't just go and buy a camera and do that immediately, Now ok  

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.629
that's an extreme example but I just
wanna show you that by practicing

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.800
and a bit dedication you can practice
this stuff anyway that's why we're here.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.290
I'm gonna go and grab a camera, and show you what I'm on about.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.990
He's really lost it this time.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.570
Notice I'm using my old D300 and an ordinary lens, ok. This is my little 18 to 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.460
70. I'm not going to go into all the techy things, we're just gonna look at 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.680
composition, let's kind of 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.620
see if we can bring a couple of the
creative and technical things together

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.560
let's have a look a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.220
you know maybe how we use our zooms, and how we compose things, put those two 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.800
together.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.440
we might have to play with exposure I
don't know yet but the main thing is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.940
composition that's gonna make the
biggest difference so what can we do you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.750
know there's nothing there's a load of  rubbish,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.730
couple of old wheelbarrows ok, if I just sort of stood here and went 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.340
that's just ridiculous isn't it just a
complete load of rubbish

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.800
so think how can you do this,
compositions all about aligning things

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.010
and moving things around,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.410
so what would the wheelbarrows look like from a different angle? you know.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.160
 I'm using a wide lens, I got  18
millimeters on this, so let's maybe get  down 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.090
here and see, 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.970
okay it looks different

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.640
is still not very interesting but I'd
say it's got a little bit more

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.510
interesting

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.140
what if we got a bit closer get the
wheelbarrows to fill the frame a bit more, 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.200
its what I mean about practicing, and if I come in here 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.330
and take my white card out of the wheelbarrow, which we just used to 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.030
white balance the video camera

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.310
Come in here, get a bit lower, get like in here somewhere, we're getting in 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.269
close I'm putting this wheelbarrow

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.970
in the bottom right corner of the frame
and that one over to the left you know

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.410
we're starting to move things around and
practice

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.850
alignment here we go I'm focusing on this
wheelbarrow

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.550
using autofocus single point. I'm just lining things up 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.120
and there's another picture, 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.489
is starting to get more interesting it's
not brilliant

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.060
of course you're not going to see this picture on the walls in ikea, but you're practicing 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.930
something.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.780
what would it look like if we made the
lens longer and moved further away?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.820
you know this is all experiment, notice you don't just take the same thing over 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.549
and over again.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.360
what would happen

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.259
from back here and down low, I'm a bit too close let's get back a bit further, 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.360
see if we get the shot past the bucket
of the digger, I do love a digger. Here we go, 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.560
and I'm putting the wheelbarrows towards the of bottom of the frame

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.300
there we go Hey look

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.919
through four very 12 3 4

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.439
very different pictures of those
wheelbarrows but I think you'll agree

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.159
the last couple three pictures

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.469
look a considering lot more interesting than the first one you imagine what you can do when 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.259
you're somewhere were there is actually something that's

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.830
interesting to look at if you know those
techniques because you've practice them.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.090
Let's go and find another one. I like these, 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.560
that's why Lorna got here first because I pointed at them, 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.599
I like this shape, I don't know if there's a picture here or not but it's still something you can play with.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.819
I kinda like the light, it's a bit dull and overcast and boring 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.490
but look I just think that those angular shapes on this fence post and a bit of 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.689
sawdust maybe there's a

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.960
a graphics sort of a shape there, so how would we take a picture of it? if we just 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.219
standing up like that 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:35.969
oh yes that's very exciting isn't it, 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.669
don't think I can hardly contain myself. Think right, 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.849
use your, first block of photography.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.110
Well if we're going to have a graphic shot, recompose the picture,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.800
how would we do that well by moving and
shifting the camera around, so let's bend my 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.589
knees a bit

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.240
and see if I can get close, put these near the bottom of the composition, and 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.699
that running up through the middle, let's see what happens. So let's just kinda focus 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.849
on the post

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.550
it's almost like a inverted CND symbol

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.990
really rubbish doesn't it how can we
change it

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.250
that bright band of light running through the back is just kind of 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.779
a mess me learn from your mistakes by
looking at going that doesn't work that

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.969
some access distracting from the posts

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.120
well how could we lose them we could go
somewhere else obviously

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.469
but how about doing something technical
to assist your creativity

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.250
let's make the lens a bit longer

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.820
you know guys is seeing all this stuff
in my free videos so this might the lens

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.590
a bit longer

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.520
and trying to impose the same shot
because with a longer lens

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.800
what if we go all cum on hands up when
he shouting

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.270
we go okay

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.330
so let's take it from here he say

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.790
we got much the same picture BCN at
Brighton in the background has

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.639
disappeared

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.699
this is all good learning this is
learning how to

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.740
link your your creative brain with you

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.169
technical know-how you know this is
learning how to use your brushes wanna

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:11.770
be like return the shot the other way

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.130
everyone seems to want to hold a camera
like this when the beginning and I think

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.650
about that

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.350
all like that in my case okay let's get
a little closer

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.949
and tried again he is

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:29.130
that's a bit better

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.030
when you flick between them it seems to
suit the shape better I think minutes

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.090
you know vertical that way up some great
picture

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.470
that you just practiced a technique

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:48.470
I'm sure there's more you can do cups

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.000
going on the lawn exciting on bike too
many understand their anger like that

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.550
and even have a dog's poor in there this
is kind of a mess is Nathan I think how

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.330
could you compose that northerner

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.330
brushed the dogs gonna stay there far

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.520
what would happen if we got down low you
know is really tempting to just take a

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.260
picture of

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.380
the dog along with the cuts like
blackwell

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.920
have dolls latte how about now if we got
down

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.050
the dog level and said hello brush brush
and hope he doesn't do that

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.360
stop a I don't a case you you know

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.780
all for breath anyway okay let's see
into that one

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.900
thought we might get a dog shop we might
still

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.430
but look at these cops to taking a page
from from above

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.270
but just doesn't work there's a so how
about getting an onto Cup level

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.990
getting in a bit closer we don't really
want it from here

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.390
we don't really want I don't think bits
have car

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.210
and a bit a dog in the background daily
how could we lose that

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.260
think you know you see creative juices
in link into the technical a little bit

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.520
well we can make the lens a bit longer
I'll to the field of view is narrower

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.640
and we lost the dog leases putting a
place now who can't help it so we're

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.570
gonna guess kinda

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.310
national network sorry got sidetracked
sorry viewers

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.850
make the focal length: a bit longer and
focus in on the cups lying on the grass

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.080
that's not the nicest exciting picture

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.510
cuts lying on the lawn when you go back
to the first picture

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.730
here I would to dog pools 19 both
actually have merits

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.470
you see what I mean by changing
different things so we don't want the

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.030
dog in there

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.210
at all we wanna kinda look across the
cups maybe

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.890
well how bout now you may have to move
lorna in

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.490
on a comment here but change the angle
as for compositions all about

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.110
this change the background change the
angle let's stay down low

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:54.550
and practice try something differently
I'm gonna keep the lens fairly short

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.950
what are we on or not 150 this is what I
me also that doesn't matter what your

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.320
focal length is

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.310
mmm

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.040
one works that makes the picture look
nice so we need

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:13.040
so here we go leader he's got the cups a
little niece not a bad little picture

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.330
it's just in a different its

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.680
its practice that's the key to all these
things

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.800
you know you just kinda go like undying

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.839
that it just doesn't work does it

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:32.700
now I'm banged on about exposure and all
that kind of stuff because I just wanted

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.450
to show you

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.060
a way to practice something from
practice everything all at once

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.230
tantrum bite off more than you can chew
as you become more experience with each

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.380
of the different

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.490
disciplines if you like photography like
exposure using chat as a lack kinda

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.510
stuff I just want to demonstrate there's
no excuse

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.670
not being able to practice something
pretty much

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.110
anywhere thrifted practice in
composition and a composition is a

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.290
pic struggle for of people I've mostly
been talking about the said

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.920
to have my main building blocks for
photography only going to laugh but you

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.130
heard me say before guys assembling book
talk you can teach you how to think like

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.210
a photographer and that is

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.400
so important that's what we've just been
doing we've been thinking we've been

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.540
thinking how do we do this how can we
change that

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.170
we've been doing and the most appalling
environment and what would

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.220
it be like if you had a reasonable goal
Maddon

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.920
unite will be nice to be what it be like
a reasonable environment quite a nice

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.500
car made with the moment lawn

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.589
maybe he had a couple glasses of wine on
the floor and you practiced with that

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:38.200
what would happen if you're in a nice
living room near a window you put

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.820
something on the table when you practice
different angles and moving around in

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.560
the light you start to get

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.560
these techniques and see what a
difference it makes in the Praxis become

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.459
second nature

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:51.350
and in those amazing pictures you won't
become byproducts

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.740
knowing what you're doing they magically
materialize on their own

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.680
but you don't need to necessarily
upgraded camera he possibly need to

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.130
upgrade

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.470
your photographer

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.600
you are speaking environments I suppose
I better leg it before the people I'm

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.649
