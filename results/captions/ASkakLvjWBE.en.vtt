00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.470
Wayne Dyer: so what we have to do is learn how to

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.080
take this ego of ours this part of us

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.730
that believes that who we are is what we

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.010
have and what we do and what other

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.929
people think of us but remember if you

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.370
grow up believing that you are what you

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.300
do then when you don't you aren't and if

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580
you believe that you are what you have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.920
when it's gone you aren't and if you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600
believe that you are what other people

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.400
think of you your reputation which we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.279
raise people to believe it's Mike I have

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.480
to be concerned with what other people

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
think of me take this ego and retrain it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.820
and one of the ways that you do to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.700
retrain it is first you take this idea

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
that the ego has of fear what are you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.399
afraid of anybody out there what are you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
afraid of shift from fear to curiosity

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.750
become curious about what you're afraid

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.969
of that's what Lao Tzu taught me become

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.949
curious about what you're afraid of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.809
you're afraid of flying get curious

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.570
about that get interested in that you're

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.699
afraid of snakes you're afraid of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.129
disapproval you're afraid just shift

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.530
from fear and say I'm going to become

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.360
more curious about what I'm afraid of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.700
and then take all of the things that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.909
you're attached to like all of your

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.119
photographs okay all of your furniture

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.130
are like all of your clothing like all

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.810
of the stuff that you find so much

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.310
attachment to and start letting it go

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.689
start letting it go you know the day

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.930
that I turned that key on made the 11th

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.420
and 2006 I didn't even know where I was

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.829
going I just knew there was a shift

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.700
taking place I felt freer than I'd ever

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.909
felt I think in my life that's in my

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.180
mid-60s out there on a whole new

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.520
adventure and here we are talking about

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.909
on that on national television on PBS

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.460
take that idea that you have to be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.619
attached to things and know that you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.899
came in with nothing with no thing and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.299
you're going to leave with nothing with

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.850
no thing and understand that your life

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.509
is a parenthesis in eternity live there

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.910
without attachments and then take your

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.370
need to be in control

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.830
of yourself of others of the situation

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.170
and shift some control to trust begin to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.870
have it too loud sue is profound about

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.640
this and each one of the 81 verses it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.549
comes up about 60 times as you look at

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.909
letting go and letting God allowing

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.799
yourself to trust in your nature

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.200
allowing yourself to no longer believe

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.659
that everything has to be controlled by

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.810
me and that other people no longer have

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.909
to be in control of me as well begin to

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.340
trust instruct just like you did for the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.849
first nine months you trusted your nose

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.690
showed out your height showed up your

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.819
eyes showed up whatever it all showed up

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.220
it's all perfect it's all of us so why

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.440
not wander through your life and have

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.810
this wonderful peaceful knowing that

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.909
it's all fine and finally shift from

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.750
your sense of entitlement look nobody

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.849
nobody can treat me that way I'm

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.890
entitled to have this while I paid for

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.650
that I let go I mean back in one year I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.810
let go of all of my entitlements I have

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.609
I don't feel on the title to anything

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.989
I'm just here shift from entitlements to

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.160
radical humility

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.069
Lao Tzu speaks about it so often stay

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.280
humble stay low the greatest leaders are

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.250
the ones who do the least the ones who

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.859
stay back and and just model and allow

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.139
and at the end of the day in one of the

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.690
verses of the Dalit says the people will

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.299
say we did it ourselves we did it

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.310
ourselves in verse 49 of the daodejing

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.919
here's an exact quote the sage is kind

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.829
to the kind and kind to the unkind

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.129
because the nature of his being is

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.109
kindness and also be wise and help all

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.440
beings impartially abandoning none you

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.389
know what I do just before I did this

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.709
program I have to admit I was nervous I

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.550
was humbled by it like who are you Wayne

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.730
Dyer

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.890
who are you to read the Dow and believe

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.320
that you can interpret it on television

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.920
and interpret it in a book and spend a

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.860
year and like I got real humble with

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.990
that and you know what I say Dow which

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.440
is just another word for God or source

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.600
or Krishna or Allah or whatever you want

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.710
to call it guide me guide me now I have

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.330
that awareness before I come out of you

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.730
if you new says in the Course in

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.970
Miracles if you knew who walked besides

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.420
you at all times on this path that you

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.120
have chosen you could never experience

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.280
fear or doubt again I remember mother

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.930
Teresa saying to a dear friend of mine

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.150
who was asking what could he do what

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.900
could he do to do something for her he

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
was a name was Pat McMahon he was on KTR

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.360
radio in the Phoenix and he finally

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.930
mother Teresa said to him you can do

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.450
something for me she said tomorrow

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.230
morning get up at 4:00 a.m. and go out

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.750
onto the streets of Phoenix and find

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.090
someone who's living there who believes

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.780
that he's alone and convinced him that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.810
he's not that's what you can do that's

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.860
how Saints talk

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.530
that's how those loud Seuss book okay

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.170
let's go on to the next thought to

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.960
change so you're changing from not

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.910
trusting in your nature to trusting in

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.590
your nature your change your thoughts

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.420
from I need more to what I call living

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.120
contentment what is this thing about

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.880
more it's the if the mantra of the ego

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.430
isn't it I have to have more I have to

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.020
collect more stuff I have to have more

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.820
friends I have to have more money it's

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.260
more and more and more and more and more

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.380
when where you came from came from

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.560
nowhere you don't need anything it's a

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.470
continuous bombardment that we are all

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.750
exposed to in this whole world of

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.170
believing that we have to have more one

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.910
of the reasons why I love Public

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.830
Television so much you don't see ads on

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.170
PBS you don't have to be constantly

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.670
exposed to the idea that you have to

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.870
have more and you have to

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.550
and if you don't have this then you're

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.440
not complete and so on so we get

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.260
bombarded with this idea of attracting

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.430
more and Lao Tzu says live contentment

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.070
live in a state of being contented

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.250
here's the verse 81 the last verse of

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.950
the daodejing my favorite translation of

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.830
it and I put it right into the book

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.030
sages do not accumulate anything but

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.080
give everything to others having more

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.770
the more they give it's a great lesson

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.280
my son fans whose you know that were

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.930
very very close we just spent a couple

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.000
of months together over Maui just just

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.100
being together just being it was a

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.150
divine time and he came home with was

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.310
last summer he came home with 4 t-shirts

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.880
that he loved and I said well honey I

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.650
said which one do you like the best

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.240
he said well I that one over there that

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.680
blue one it's got the red and it's got

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.600
the drawing and it's got a surfer and I

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.490
said that's great I said I'd like to

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.150
have that one he said no no dad that's

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.560
my favorite that's the one I that's the

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.090
one I liked the best I said I know I

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.190
said that's the one would you mind if I

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.670
had that one he said I would mind a lot

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.740
if you had his helper he said maybe you

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.240
can have one I'm not so crazy about this

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.700
one over here I said so you're going to

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.350
give me something you don't like you

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.630
know I said I want that's the one I love

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.160
that because we have the same tape could

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.930
I have that one he's dead you're crazy

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.310
he said you can't have my favorite

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.020
t-shirt I said well I want you to think

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.950
about that I want you to think about

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.620
detaching and letting go and not needing

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.420
to have more and he's heard me talk

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.580
about this stuff his entire life so

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.400
finally he just you know I went in and I

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.230
tried it on and I said AHA distinguished

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.980
so great looking in the mirror and okay

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.140
that that that really is mine I said

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.640
yeah I said but you're gonna give it to

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.350
me he said no no I think so well just

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.330
think about it you know because I I'm

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.860
your dad and I'd really like to have

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.790
this so he reluctantly parted with it

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.570
and so the next the next that evening I

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.010
was still wearing the shirt and he

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.960
looked at me and he said that's my shirt

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.880
I said you know it fans I said that you

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.390
gave me the shirt I said I'm gonna wear

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.970
this shirt until you are happy that I

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.670
have your favorite shoe I'm going to

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.380
never going to take it off until you are

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.110
happy he said well you'll be wearing

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.870
that shirt a long time said well that's

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.240
ok so I wore it the next day I got up I

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.070
slept in it that night I got up to it I

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.040
did okay cut up the next morning I put

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.540
it on and that fans would come in and

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.430
we'd look at next oh you're still not

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.410
happy that you gave me something that

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.240
you really love because that this is

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.160
what it really means to be a sage this

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.440
is what it means to be a divine being to

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.420
be someone who's willing to depart with

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.490
not the things they don't like but what

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.260
they do like I wore it the next day I

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.220
wore it the next day

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.820
I worked for two weeks take it off only

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.130
to wash it put it right back on two

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.960
solid weeks he's one of my children will

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.540
treasure finally one day he said dad I'm

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.920
so happy I am so thrilled that you have

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.510
that t-shirt I said oh that's great I

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.220
can finally take this thing off I'm

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.630
going to I'm going to just give it away

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.970
but it's like what a great lesson in

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.850
that the idea that you take you know

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.470
there's a rule it's called the 80/20

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.940
rule and in the 80/20 rule it says

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.050
everything that you have all of your

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:09.950
stuff 20% of it is what you use all of

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.080
your clothes in your closet 23 just keep

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.410
using the same 20% over 80% of the

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.440
clothing that you have in your in your

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.950
closet for so many people is something

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.390
that you never use you don't work you

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.100
look at it you store it you think well

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.780
there might come a day I can't part with

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.330
that even though you've been carting it

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.800
around every time you move you move it

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.260
and you put it

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.620
take the 80% that you don't use says

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.880
loud to and give it away give it away

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.170
Lao Tzu says that when your cup is full

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.460
stop pouring when your cup is full stop

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.880
pouring we have an obesity crisis in the

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.790
United States in the Western world the

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.130
obesity crisis can be handled if you

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.310
just read the doll if you realize in

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.650
verse 33 it says if you realize you have

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.160
enough

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.290
you are truly rich if you could just

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.110
learn something called portion control

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.210
well you just take a bite and you say is

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.440
my cup full stop stop calling in other

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.780
words instead of filling yourself with

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.380
with that which is already a surplus and

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.600
the dollar teaches us to take surpluses

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.180
and to reduce them and to take

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.370
deficiencies and increase them so that

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.770
we create balance in our lives to be in

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.640
balance you can take the jewelry that

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.740
you don't use you can take the clothing

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.460
it and then once you've given away the

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.350
80% that you don't use take one of the

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.290
things that you really like and practice

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.540
giving that away it's such a wonderful

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.930
way listen to this poem it was written

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.970
by a great Persian poet named Hafiz says

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.100
even after all this time the son never

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.130
says to the earth you owe me

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.040
just look what happens with a love like

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.529
that it lights up the whole sky it

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:16.329
lights up the whole sky

00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:19.180
there's no always there's no owing you

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.449
don't have to be you can practice living

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:25.089
a state of contentment this was so

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:27.490
powerful for me you just can't imagine

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.639
how good it felt for one entire year to

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.670
walk through every day and say I'm

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.360
content I'm content I start out every

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.220
morning of my life the first words javi

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.230
says if there's only one prayer that you

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.769
say every day make it thank you just say

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:49.300
thank you that's how I start

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.630
wake up thank you God thank you thank

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.610
you source Thank You Dow whatever you

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.649
want to call the opening line of the Dow

00:12:56.649 --> 00:12:59.769
says the Dow that can be named is not

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:02.470
the Dow as soon as you put a name on it

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.019
it dissolves there's no name for it it's

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:07.990
just endlessly invisibly constantly in a

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.360
state of creating out of a state of love

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.139
the next thought that the dow teaches us

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:16.769
to change change your thoughts change

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:21.699
your life you really do see so much of

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:23.620
the previous PBS specials that I've done

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.889
on inspiration and intention these were

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.529
teaching people generically how to think

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:31.930
differently what Lao Tzu taught me was

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.870
what to specifically think in place of

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.110
thinking that instead of thinking that I

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.029
don't trust my nature he said trust your

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:42.639
nature instead of saying I need more he

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.490
said you need less more is less that

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.870
comes right out of a doubt next thought

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:54.250
move from thinking in a rigid way to

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.439
thinking and being flexible soft and

00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:03.880
allowing from rigidity to softness what

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.850
a wonderful transformation that is I was

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.189
standing looking at with my son Sam and

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:14.069
we were on Maui and we were looking at

00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:19.510
water as water was going against

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.090
some rocks and some cliffs and so on and

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.330
in these pictures in this in this moment

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.640
I said to my son I said which do you

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.050
think is stronger the water or the cliff

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.930
the water or the rocks which one do you

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.830
think is more powerful and stronger and

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.930
he said well he said the rocks obviously

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.040
they're stronger and they're bigger and

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.140
Owen said but I said water is very very

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.080
patient isn't it how much chance to

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.720
those rocks have if there were if they

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.490
if they want to survive I mean what

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.540
chance do they have that way and and

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.970
Matsu is speaking to us about

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.970
understanding our nature by examining

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.860
how nature works and then making it

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.680
apply to our thoughts so that a soft

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.410
thought a thought that isn't a rigid

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.510
thought a thought that doesn't say you

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.130
have to be this way or you have to be

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:15.730
that way

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.330
a thought that is not stiff a sock that

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.660
water he there are so many references to

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.250
water and what we can learn from water

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.240
here 75% water the planet is 75% water

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.880
we are water the rest of us is just

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.250
muscled water it's just it's all water

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.590
and water is soft water can enter

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.780
anywhere you get into a conflict with

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.670
somebody else and you picture yourself

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.180
as water you can enter with water in any

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.190
place that there's an opening if you can

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.670
visualize yourself as a being who moves

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.220
into the space of water if you can see

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.020
yourself that way you can just enter

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.880
into those places and the people that

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.140
you love and your children and your

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.080
spouse and anyone at all and an enter

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.070
there softly hears verse 8 the supreme

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:08.220
good is water which nourishes all things

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.120
without trying to and verse 78 right

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.480
smack out of the doll nothing in the

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.520
world is softer and weaker than water

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.740
but for attacking the heart the

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.860
unyielding nothing can surpass it there

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.540
is nothing like it here it is I asked

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.870
when I

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.730
this set this beautiful set and thank

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.130
you designers for this I asked if I

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.150
could have water on the on mistake they

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.839
did it they figured it out there's a now

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:46.279
I'm going to try to get some of this

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:48.890
water okay so you get down here and it

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.839
just stops Allen just scoop this up at

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:53.300
night okay no tighter you hold it the

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.890
less chance you have of doing anything

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.720
with it isn't it how can I experience

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.930
water the way to experience water is to

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.950
just get saw just get unbending and

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.809
there it is that's what water is the

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:07.370
minute that grass but the minute I try

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.559
and Lao Tzu is saying the same thing is

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:12.260
true in everything in your life the more

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.630
you glass the more you try to hold on to

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.199
it the more you try to be rigid with it

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:21.530
the less control you have of the softer

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.160
you are the less rigid you are the more

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.850
flexible you are as a person the more

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.970
you can accomplish and this is a great

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.059
way to practice and parenting as well

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:38.840
and this idea that a rigid thought how

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.910
many times have you heard this idea that

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.340
if I tell you something I'm going to

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.350
stay consistent with it we have a set of

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.870
rules these are the rules and we'll do

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.730
it this way and the dialogue says the

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.890
more rules you make the more rule

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.430
breakers you create

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.650
it's true the more rules you have in

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.240
your house about how everything has to

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.059
go we had in our house my wife would

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:04.020
have a big jar of M&amp;Ms

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.400
peanuts you know different with all

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.960
these different multicolored ones and so

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.330
and the kids in our house because we

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.680
didn't feed them sugar and we didn't

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.300
give them sodas and stuff like that so

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.700
they you know they were just more like a

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.140
decoration every once in a while someone

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.580
would take them they'd hardly ever be

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.590
replaced now when we had kids come over

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.470
to our house who weren't ever allowed to

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.720
have such horrible things you should

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.640
have seen their behavior you know they

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.200
would scoop them up they'd be putting

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.210
them in their pocket and they get their

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.130
curses and they don't put it up you know

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.510
the whole thing would be empty I said

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.110
what are you doing well well you mean

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.460
you could just have these whenever you

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.890
want them well we don't really have any

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.800
rules about that it's just it's not

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.600
something that we encourage or

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.630
discourage it's just there it's like

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.900
Emerson had a wonderful line he said a

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.290
foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.640
little minds a foolish consistency a

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.460
rigid consistency so that there are many

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.440
people who will say if I say it on

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.200
Monday you can be absolutely certain

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.420
that on Wednesday I'm going to believe

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.090
the same thing regardless of what might

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.480
happen on Tuesday now Tuesday might have

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.610
something real that you might want to be

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.870
changing your mind

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.590
you might want to say you know I thought

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.200
that this time but now I've seen this

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.600
and now we can shift and you can see how

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.600
this can become when and so much about

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.730
the dollars on leadership leadership in

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.350
the family leadership in the community

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.850
leadership geopolitically less rigidity

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.270
more openness more willingness to listen

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.920
and say I changed my mind

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.900
because a foolish consistency is the

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.190
hobgoblin of little minds and what I

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.790
believed on Wednesday has changed

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.690
because of what happened on Tuesday now

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.790
another important thing to say to your

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.010
children to your friends to your lover

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.929
to your spouse's to whomever

00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:09.850
to the people you work with words that

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.100
were so terrified to say but which give

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.960
us a sense of living with the doubt I

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.110
don't know I don't know I'll look it up

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.129
say it

00:20:21.129 --> 00:20:25.659
I don't know doesn't hurt say it again

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:29.919
I don't know isn't it fearful I mean so

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.450
many things and it's like very freeing

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.490
because my kids call ask me something of

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.779
it I don't know they say dad you know

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.179
everything you know everything I said

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:42.610
well I don't know that and I'll look it

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.230
up I will try to find an answer to that

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.740
but I don't quite know I know that what

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.559
even you know I spent 20 years running

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.279
and I ran every day for 20 years for 22

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:56.710
years without missing a day 8 miles

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.529
never missed a day that's Richard all

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:03.669
right I'm call that obsessive but you

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.590
brush your teeth every day I used to say

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.720
and you don't call that obsessive and

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.029
you go to the bathroom every day and you

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:11.919
don't say well he's obsessively doing

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:15.190
that again today you don't do that but

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.220
anyway what I learned is that in even in

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.169
the world of exercise there are certain

00:21:20.169 --> 00:21:22.389
things that are built in to make us

00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:24.399
widget to make us stiff to make us hard

00:21:24.399 --> 00:21:28.090
and we lift and we run and we kick and

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.360
we this is what we call getting working

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.369
out there's another kind of working out

00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:35.139
that it's ancient it goes back to the

00:21:35.139 --> 00:21:37.269
time of Lao Tzu and before which is

00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:40.509
called yoga and yoga means union it

00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:42.549
means union with your source and when

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:44.769
you do yoga you can stay in the same

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:48.249
place you can do the equivalent of 8

00:21:48.249 --> 00:21:49.899
miles when I used to run 8 miles I had

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:51.399
to run four miles that way turn around

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:54.100
four miles back and I'd be sweating now

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.230
I can do yoga and I can just stand in

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.350
one place in a 90 minute by being supple

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.929
by making myself stretch by not being

00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:04.990
hard and rigid I can you know I can get

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.460
that out there I can get that leg up I

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.289
can do these kinds of things and nine

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:10.539
and ninety minutes later you know it's

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:12.369
like I'm totally sweating until it and I

00:22:12.369 --> 00:22:14.799
feel so different I used to when I would

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.990
go out at night to eat or something

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.759
after running so many miles running

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:19.549
marathons and

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:21.049
those things I'd go to get up and it

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.539
would be okay going to take a little

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:25.580
while okay and everything what's that

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.090
like

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.649
that doesn't happen anymore because I've

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:29.210
given up hard

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.749
I've given up being rigid and

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:34.669
substituted it for being supple for

00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:38.269
being flexible for living a life in

00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:40.970
which I don't have to always be so Fiat

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.039
listen to this verse of the daodejing

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.570
one of my all-time favorites verse

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.429
number 76 a man is born gentle and weak

00:22:49.429 --> 00:22:54.970
at his death he becomes hard and stiff

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.450
all things including the grass and the

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:04.700
trees are soft and pliable in life dry

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:10.809
and brittle in depth stiffness is thus a

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:15.739
companion in death flexibility is a

00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:19.429
companion in life and it's not just for

00:23:19.429 --> 00:23:23.419
how you exercise it's how you think how

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:25.899
you think
