00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
The Chair now recognizes himself for questions.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.840
Mr. Rubin, have you read the House resolution?

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.049
Pardon me, yes, Sir, I have.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.960
What is your understanding of what this committee has been asked to do?

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.940
My understanding is that the Committee has been asked to

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.380
review the incidents related to the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.289
Benghazi attacks and in all of the, as you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.820
described it at the beginning, and all of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.460
the aspects that it seeks.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.440
So, your understanding is that we have been asked

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.230
to look at all policies, decisions and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590
activities that contributed to the attacks?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.040
It's certainly that's our understanding and and we we support

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.870
providing information related to that request?

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.810
That affected our ability to prepare for the attacks?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.200
But if that's the committee's, if that's ultimately

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.340
the decision to...

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.540
But you've read it, right? You've read the resolution, right? You're not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120
disagreeing with my interpretation of the resolution, are you?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.010
We defer to the Committee's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.719
direction on on how it wants to proceed...

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.730
including Executive Branch efforts to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.289
identify and bring to justice the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.850
perpetrators of these attacks, did you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.290
read that in the resolution?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
Eh, Sir, I don't have it in front so I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.210
can't quote... I'll be thrilled to get you a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.860
copy of the resolution, but for the meantime,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.479
you're just going to have to take my word that

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.200
it also says Executive Branch efforts to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.120
to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of these attacks.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.900
That's in the resolution. Can you tell me

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.570
specifically how our interviewing

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.930
witnesses is going to jeopardize the prosecution?

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.580
Sir, the Department of Justice has been clear with...

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.939
I'm asking you, it was in your opening statement

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.820
I'm asking you, you tell me, a former

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.310
prosecutor, how our interviewing

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.689
witnesses that have already been

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.119
interviewed by the ARB, already been

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.950
interviewed by the best practices panel,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.899
and frankly, already been interviewed by

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.540
the State Department, the video that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.939
you showed us last week, that agent

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.189
interviewed the witnesses in preparation

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.389
for a video. So if the ARB and the best

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.420
practices panel and your own Agency can

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.049
interview people in preparation of a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.489
training video, how can Congress not interview those witnesses?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.980
Sir, no one has said the Congress cannot interview...

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.840
You just said that it would jeopardize an ongoing

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.910
prosecution and I just asked you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.319
specifically, how?

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.870
My understanding, and I am the chief

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.340
liaison to the house for the State's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.980
Department is that our colleagues at the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.749
Department of Justice have been in touch with...

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.120
Specifically, who told you that?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.120
My colleagues within the State Department who work on the sub-committee...

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420
I'm looking for a name, because I've got to clear up

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.209
this misconception that simply talking

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.040
to a witness who's already talked to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.159
three other investigatory bodies that

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.409
somehow or another Congress cannot talk

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.909
to these witnesses even though

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.430
apparently everybody else can.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.260
I'm curious to how that jeopardizes an ongoing prosecution?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.360
Sir, I'm not an attorney,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.260
I'm not a prosecutor, what I am is the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.090
Chief Liaison to the House for the State

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.069
Department and what I'm conveying is

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.659
that the Justice Department has told us

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.639
that this could have an impact and they

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.290
would like to have a conversation with

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.730
you and your committee about that.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.980
When you, do you believe that Congress has the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.200
constitutional authority to provide oversight?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220
Everyday I do that with my job, yes, Sir.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.120
So you do agree with that.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.849
What what is your interpretation of the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.709
phrase all policies, decisions and activities?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.300
In what context?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.080
In any context how about contributed to the attacks?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.000
What is your understanding of all

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.640
policies, all decisions, all activities.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.560
The approach that we're taking at the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.629
State Department is to provide materials

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.820
to the Committee at the direction of the Committee.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.920
The requests for interviews

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.859
that you have reiterated here today I am

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.560
explaining that the Justice Department

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.759
has said that they would like to have

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.769
conversations with the Committee for the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.599
concern about the protection and welfare

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.759
of these agents in an ongoing investigation.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.600
I want to ask you something,

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.620
I want to ask you something, ok, because there

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.349
are 12 people up here who may not agree

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.049
on another single solitary thing but

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.759
every one of us agrees that we don't

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.129
want to do anything to jeopardize the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.590
physical security of anybody who works

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.019
for this government nor does anybody on

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.819
this dais want to do anything to

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.219
jeopardize an ongoing prosecution.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.829
Okay, can we stipulate that? That nobody wants

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.359
to do either of those things? Certainly.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.489
Will you also stipulate that you can

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.740
talk to witnesses while preserving their

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.990
identity and not jeopardizing an

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.410
ongoing prosecution?

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.220
I am confident that in the conversations

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.910
between the Justice Department and the Committee

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.040
that those modalities can be discussed.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.890
I am not the expert on... Mr Rubin, Mr Rubin

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.430
Do you see the Justice Department at this hearing?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.640
No, Sir.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.600
Do you know why they're not at this hearing?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.300
No, Sir.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.820
Because we don't have any issues with them.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.760
That's why they're not here.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.880
You just cited a reason to deny access to witnesses even

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.100
the Justice Department hasn't cited.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.600
So, what I want you to do is help this

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.980
Committee gain access to precisely the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.130
same witnesses that everyone else from

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.680
the ARB to the best practices panel to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.800
your own agent who compiled a training

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.640
video had access to the witnesses.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.410
Sir, as I said in my opening statement,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.450
we are happy to have the conversation

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.730
with you and your staff on how to engage

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.770
on this and that is something that we're

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.730
open to, we have never said no.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.980
Well, and I appreciate that, I appreciate that,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.120
but but I want to make sure that you and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.240
I have a clear understanding with each other.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240
If six people observed an

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.740
important event and you were being

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.780
asked to write a final definitive

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.910
accounting of that event, how many of the

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.510
six would you want to talk to?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.160
Sir, I understand...

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.200
It's not a trick question. I

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.300
I know it's not a trick question and and

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.010
I understand the point and this is why

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.660
we are here... Well, if you understand the point...

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.700
This is why we provided the quantity of

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.830
documents and works in collegial , er, terms...

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.540
Mr Rubin, we're going get, we're

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.010
gonna get to the quantity of documents in

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.169
a minute, I noticed that you said forty

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.870
thousand, that's an impressive number.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.480
That's 40 copies of Doctor Zhivago,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.820
that's 40 copies of Crime and Punishment,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.530
that's a lot of, that's a lot of pages.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.260
40,000, out of how many?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.680
That's our question, how many documents?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.400
Is 40,000 half? Is it all? Is it two-thirds?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.060
We have made a comprehensive

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.230
search and, as you know, the State

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.420
Department spans 275 missions overseas, 70,000...

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.340
I'm not asking you to bring any

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.680
ambassadors back ... we have a comprehensive amount of ...

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.040
I'm not asking you to bring any

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.120
ambassadors back to search for emails.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.660
I'm not. Not a single one.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.680
How many employees does the State Department have?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.700
Roughly 70,000.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.759
70,000? Correct. Right, and

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.339
we have asked for emails from? 7 floor principles.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.400
Do you think that is a

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.110
reasonable request when you have been

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.270
asked to study all policies, all

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.970
activities and all decisions?

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.900
In your, in your Committee's December letter where it

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.699
named principles at first many, in fact

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.949
all, of those principles have, there are

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.960
emails, there are documents related to

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.289
them in that 40,000. In an addition, you and your...

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:10.929
Is it your testimony that we have all of the

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:12.460
emails that we've asked for?

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.740
What you and your colleagues prioritize Secret..,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.940
former-Secretary Clinton's emails and that is

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.480
our priority as I stated in my opening...

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.560
Well, I would say multiple emails, if there are

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.890
multiple email accounts, we want all of the emails, okay?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.280
and we we agree and we

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.500
are I as  I said earlier...

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.940
Well, you may have noticed

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.259
my colleague from Maryland use the word

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.800
"glacial", I find that, I find the use of that

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.530
word interesting when you vote against

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.720
constituting a Committee, when you

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.340
threaten not to participate in the

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.289
Committee, when you continually

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:43.820
threaten to walk away from the

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.370
Committee, when you can't identify a

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.199
single solitary person that you would

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.360
issue a subpoena to, when you were

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.860
prepared to have an ask and answered

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.500
website before you got the fifteen

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.090
thousand pages of documents that you

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.880
just provided, when you expect members of

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.080
Congress who are having conversations

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.449
with people on airplanes to stop the

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.049
conversation and say "Let me go get a Democrat."

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.320
You heard the word glacial.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.090
We're going to pick up the pace.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.520
We're going to pick up the pace. I have no

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.240
interest in prolonging this.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.849
None. Sir,... So, you're going to have to pick

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:18.380
up the pace with us, okay?

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.169
Absolutely and this is why that we are

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:23.750
here today, I we have made two witnesses

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.630
available since the Fall of last year, we

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.539
are prepared to at any time, proactively as

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:31.580
you and your colleagues know. 
I appreciate that Mr

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.169
Rubin. Are you familiar with the subpoena

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.630
that dates back to 2013 that the

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.310
Oversight Committee sent with respect to

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.409
the ARB? Yes. Okay,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.950
ARB is a statutory creation, you agree?

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.529
Congress created the ARB? Yes, it did. Do you

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.839
agree Congress can amend or alter or

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:51.410
enhance the ARB?  If it's an Act of Congress... If it's a statute, sure,

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.360
Congress can change it, right?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.250
You agree Congress should provide

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.070
oversight over one of its statutory creations?

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.170
Yes, Sir. How can we do that if you will

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.850
not give us the documents related to the

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.770
ARB? How can we possibly do that, Mr.  Rubin?

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.300
Sir, first, of the 40,000 pages of

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.529
documents that the Committee has

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.200
received, many of those are, in fact,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.510
related to the ARB. 
Mr Rubin, I

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.240
appreciate, I really do, I really do.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.209
I appreciate the word "many". I appreciate

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.060
the 40,000. I keep coming back to one

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.670
word that's in the House resolution and that

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:32.360
word is "all". Sir... Do we have ALL ... What

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.279
... of the documents? ... What we what we have

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:36.890
communicated to you and and your staff

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.110
and what we've been grateful for is the

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.720
Committee's explanation of its top

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.560
priorities and we would very be very

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.149
honored to continue to have those

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:50.420
discussions. If the ARB, as you've

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.430
noted here, becomes the top priority well

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.550
that is certainly... Mr Rubin, we shouldn't have to

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.810
pick among priorities. You have 70,000

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.890
employees.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.320
I mean, what we're not going to do is

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.140
identify one tranche of emails and then

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.360
two months later go to depose or do a

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.160
witness interview with that witness and

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.810
then two months later get another tranche

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.390
of emails. When our colleagues on the

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.709
other side, who by the way, had no

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:14.120
interest in forming this Committee

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.040
whatsoever, but are now ironically

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.690
complaining about the pace of the

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.130
Committee that they had no interest in

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.230
forming whatsoever, it's not for us to

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.690
pick up the pace... So... And I'm looking to

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.329
you to help me do that. And and that's

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:27.890
why we're here and that's why we have

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.680
continually engage proactively with you

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.000
and your Committee and we're happy to

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.399
continue to do so. Okay,... And I would mention

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:38.219
the 70,000 employees are engaged in their jobs...

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:39.800
I appreciate that. I don't want any

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.640
ambassadors, security guards, I don't want

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.900
anybody taken off of an important job

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.720
but compliance with congressional

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.760
inquiries is important and if you have

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.620
time for condemn demonstrations or

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.140
culinary diplomacy I think you have time

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.510
to comply with a legitimate request for

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.640
documents from Congress and I'm sure you

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.050
will agree and with that I would like to recognize

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.930
the gentleman from Maryland.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.320
I'm
