00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.819
Hi, I'm trisha Barker and my near-death experience story was featured on

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.139
Annie's I survived Beyond him back season 1 episode 5

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.329
I was sandwiched in between two very lovely people who had heart attacks and had a near-death experience

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.789
that way I had a car wreck [and] I was a senior in college at the time and

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.109
this race

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.179
Was a symbol [Austan] 10k was a symbol of me getting my life back together

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.929
Stopping the partying and figuring out what I was going to do with the rest of my life

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.359
I was about to [graduate] with an English degree, but I did not want to teach I wanted to go into editing

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.799
Maybe law school down the line because I grew up poor wasn't interested in teaching and that's an important fact that features in the near-death

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.789
experience later

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.870
well

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.390
This wreck of it during the wreck. I'm broke three, Vertebrae

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.250
they're completely shattered and pieces of the bone fragments were pressing on my spine and I was

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.209
Beginning [to] lose feeling in my left leg I had a lot of internal injuries my right ankle was fractured as well

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.790
And I didn't have health insurance, so I wasn't given a painkiller or tylenol. They knew I needed surgery

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.319
I was just strapped to a board and left there screaming for hours sometimes other times. You know nurses would come and talk with me

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.040
Eventually I found a doctor who was willing to operate on me, but she had been on [duty] for 40 hours and Dr.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.889
[Philon] was probably about my age now she went home

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.269
took him about the shower had some dinner rest, and then came back and operated on me and I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.900
Was very grateful to sign this form that said?

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.089
[17%] chance of death, and I thought [ah] I'm young. I'm healthy you know signed it. I'll be fine

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.229
I mean, they just make you sign this right well the next thing I knew the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.110
Anesthesiologist [put] the mask over me, and then I was out of my body [now] [at] the time

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.709
I was agnostic and so I was so shocked that the spirit goes on I wanted to pop back into my body and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.579
Wake up, and tell all [my] friends. Hey, we do go on even if I had to die

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.329
I just wanted to come back and say we definitely go on I know

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.999
That much so that far into the near-death experience

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.919
I realized that then I was kind of looking around the room and I looked [down] in my body and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.159
Surgery is brutal there was so much blood. Maybe my internal injuries were causing me to lose so much blood

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.270
[I] don't know but my back was open that part of my hip was opened up

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.219
And I was looking down at this kind of way from the top of the ceiling kind of a 360-degree

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.820
Vision and I could see the doctors and I could kind of I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.740
Knew what they were thinking what they're doing and and you know the surgical techs were handing

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.609
Tools back and forth and then I saw the most amazing

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200
beings, they are

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.339
Sometimes called higher beings by other writers I called them angels

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.550
I didn't have any other term they were just gorgeous and tall taller like seven eight feet and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.010
they come to me immediately by sending this light from their eyes into my spirit body and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.089
Immediately I felt calm that everything was going [to] be okay, and they said we're here with you don't worry

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.709
And then they said very clearly watch this and they wanted me to see that they could hit send this healing light

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.550
Through the surgeons, and they did this they sent this incredible light

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.950
through the surgeons and into my body

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.769
and I saw that the bone fragments would be picked out [of] my spine and [that] I would walk I would be fine and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.450
Then I was meant to remember somehow that they could work through

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.999
Through people [now]. I I was pretty sure the doctors weren't aware of this, but they worked through them nonetheless

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.040
Then I noticed that the monitor flatlined and what [know] I'm dead

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.369
And I didn't know how they were going to revive me my back was already opened

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.399
I didn't know how much more blood I could possibly lose

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.220
And I didn't want to see that [seen] so it was out of that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.040
Room and when your spirit body you just think and then you're outside the room so suddenly

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.739
I was no longer in [that] operating room, and I was in the corridor, and I ran into my stepdad

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.159
Now this is my verifiable incident um

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.359
Dr.. Jan Holden a few other researchers from ions are always curious about people that have verifiable incidents

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.649
But my mom and Stepdad were health meds at that time and I didn't think he would eat a candy bar

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.770
But [I] saw him getting this candy bar and later verified on that my mom saw him with the candy bar

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.250
Well, I kept going and then I was out side of the hospital, and it was nighttime

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.919
over Austin, and I have felt this oneness with everyone that I'd ever known but I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.000
specifically zoned in on

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.869
People who I didn't get to [know] who were really lovely and I thought oh what a shame you know their hearts were so

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.520
Beautiful and for whatever reason I've been shy or closed off for judgmental

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.879
and I didn't take the time to get to know these [people] and the light wanted me to see that judgment and fear and and

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.529
Self-consciousness prevented me from knowing some really beautiful people these these uh people that I worked with that trans amigos were

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.960
Single moms some of them were just in the restaurant business, and I thought because I [was] a college [student]

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.759
I didn't have anything in [common] with them, but they were worried about me. They prayed for me

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.739
They wondered why I was depressed that I saw how gorgeous their hearts were and I thought

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.249
Okay, if I come back then I really need to open up to more people and see their hearts

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.989
And then I had this life review and the light was [not] an all judgmental

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.159
Anything that I've done to harm myself the light just felt sad [for] me and wish that I've been better to myself

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.719
But it didn't judge me. It didn't you have said it. I was bad in any way

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.710
It loved me so much

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.610
And it only wanted me to love myself

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.630
With that same love and I think that was a message that if love is all that [matters] and all that we take with us

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.450
You know from our interactions with others certainly?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.540
part of that love needs to be towards ourselves

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.020
And so loving ourselves and taking care of ourselves is important and what the light wants what God wants

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.720
so I felt that love and then as

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.669
I was doing my life review I ended up at about five years old

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.210
and the spirit wanted me to see that I

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:14.830
had strong Faith

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.229
And I was very much in touch with nature as a child and that was [a] beautiful place to be and that

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:27.699
Was a lesson that I needed to bring back is the power of nature is an amazing thing and then the minute

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:34.179
I thought about that suddenly. I was in this otherworldly place, and the grass was so green the light was so bright and

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.780
It felt like heaven perhaps

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.909
But mostly I was at peace even greater peace and as I was walking through this grass

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:49.119
[I] wanted to come back and remind others to connect with nature that there's so much peace and

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.619
Beauty and joy that can be had in nature and that it's important to spend time peaceful time in nature

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.319
So as I was walking through this gorgeous field [I] came upon my grandfather

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.989
and he was the only person I knew at [that] [time] and

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.509
Who had died and he said?

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.369
Come on, Georgia get on this truck, [and] so I did that sometimes when I was a kid

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.370
I would sit in the back of a pickup truck

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.299
[my] feet would drag the ground and through this tall grass and so I did that

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:24.039
For a while, and [I] was happy and enjoying myself, and then he turned his head [back]

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.429
and he was like hey Trisha you want to keep going and

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.430
The light was out of up to the right and it was so beautiful

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.400
And it beckoned me

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.639
And I said definitely being this adventurous soul that I am I was like you know there

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.068
And so I was flying towards the light as I was flying towards the light I could feel different people's prayers

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:50.649
I could feel my mom's prayers my dad's prayers this my grandmother this one particular aunt

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:52.789
wanted

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.809
Me not to die because [she] had lost her daughter in a car wreck

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.959
[and] it was very painful for her and I could feel her praying to God saying please don't let Joyce's my mom's name

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.159
don't let Joyce go through the same thing that I went through and losing her daughter and

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:11.259
So I felt that I thought oh how sweet and I almost wanted to come back for [that]

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:17.889
But the light was so incredible I'd never felt any love like that. You know a [mom's] love romantic love

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:25.060
In comparison to that love it was the best feeling I've ever felt in my life so as I was going

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.299
Towards that light. I was whole and complete and happy

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.180
wanted for nothing [and]

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.900
I just felt disconnected from my life back there

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.740
I didn't want to go back and

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.950
Then suddenly the light said look down, and I saw this river and this river was beautiful

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.009
And it looked like a river life, you know many

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:51.159
Many miles of a flowing river and then there were all these tiny little lights

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.499
And I thought oh those are souls and their lights are turned on and I saw other souls that

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.990
You know not in this flow [that] were

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.930
covered by darkness in a sense and that too may look like fear from that point of [view] and

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.450
the light then showed me my own soul, and it had grown [very] large and

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.650
Full of light, especially since I was so close [to] this light

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.900
And it said that I needed to be a teacher and that all these little lights were my students

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.279
And I would help them turn on their lights and go out into the world and remember their soul

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.099
Remember their connection to nature let go of fear

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.239
embrace their passion live life to the fullest and believe that we do go on and that these bodies are just a

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.550
costume that we put on for [awhile] I

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.169
Didn't want to be a teacher. I argued for a moment, but there's no arguing with God

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:47.440
I'm God is your [guy's] guidance counselor. You're sent back, and so that was the last memory that [I] have is

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.330
being shown that I would be a teacher so [sent] back into my body and

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.209
The next thing I knew a nurse was feeding me ice chips and she asked do you remember your name?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.110
And I said yes, I remember her name her name [is] Trisha

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:09.219
And I was so disappointed to be just me and my particular self and consciousness when I had once been

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.359
one with all this consciousness and intelligence and amazing

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:19.779
Possibilities outside of my body, but I still had the memory [of] angels and and the memory of God

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:23.499
And how great it felt to be in that place?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.129
So you know flash-forward hears later?

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:34.299
I did get my teaching certification when went back to Austin I did heal rather well ran the Austin 10k and

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.059
the very next year and I

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.270
Got my teaching certification the next year after that

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.370
I taught English in Korea on the East Coast and herlands

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:52.059
In San antonio [in] [Dallas] and in fort worth and [I've] had an amazing time working with students

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.140
Teaching has been such a blessing I would not have picked it for myself. I

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.929
Have felt free and happy and guided many times in the classroom

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.160
And I think sometimes I'm lucky enough to feel those angels working through me

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.829
Maybe not for everyone but for certain people perhaps who need it who [are] in desperate need of health

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.330
I have felt guidance from the other side and in those moments

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.879
I [remember] the angels who work through my surgeons, and I know that I was meant to see that for a

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.430
particular reason and I

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:31.540
Have loved every minute of it. My story was also featured in National Geographic this spring in

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.570
2016 and when I told my story to the researcher I realized it was time that I write it

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:45.429
So I started writing my memoir which features a lot of my life after the near-death experience because I think the after-effects are pretty

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.830
important and interesting a lot of

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.410
People who are in the ears come from this place of love and alterations touristic?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.220
feelings for everyone and

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.580
Sometimes they're a little bit childlike and they can be taken advantage of by by different people

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:09.249
and I was you know very young in my 20s and early 20s then and you know I had a

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:14.769
man who was in [a] writers group and who was sexually harassing to me and

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.309
It was a friend that I knew on some level

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:24.190
But he was a very sick guy and that I had a stalker, and I had many things in my life [that]

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.109
shipped me up and made me wonder about people and

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.210
their perspective

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:36.639
But [I] think the point of all of that is to stay in this place of light and no matter what happens

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.410
[I] am [not] this body. [I] am so much more. I know that and the near-death

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.220
has changed my life for the [better] and

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.080
I

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.790
Can't wait to tell my full story through this book so thanks for listening to my video and may you be blessed
