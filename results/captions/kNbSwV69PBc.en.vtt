00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.540
Sid: My guest can see into the invisible realm.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.720
He's seen demons, he's seen angels.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.820
He's prayed for people with cancer, AIDS,
and they've been healed.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.620
Next on this edition of “It's Supernatural!”
[music]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.220
Centuries have come and gone offering wisdom
and understanding throughout the ages.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.440
Today there should be nothing beyond one's
power to discover.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.340
And yet the strange, unusual and mysterious
world of the supernatural defies understanding.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.960
Stay tuned for a unique and powerful investigation
into a curious undiscovered universe only

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.760
on “It's Supernatural!”

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.820
[music]

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.940
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative reporter.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.059
I have to tell you, my guest provokes me to
jealousy, because from a young child he's been

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.820
able to see into the invisible world.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.380
He's been able to know things that would happen
in the future, and they actually happen.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.260
He's been able to pray for people even with
leukemia.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.980
Tell me about that person with leukemia.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.439
Don: Sid, that was an interesting experience,
and that came after I had been walking with

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.100
the Lord for quite a while.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.880
And it was stemmed - a lot of people think
that when you're praying for people and there's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.649
that kind of anointing on your life, that
you're always this like perfect person, and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.720
I think that's how sometimes people think,
“Oh, God would never use me.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.660
You must be perfect.”

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.420
And that's not at all how it works.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.280
That was actually stemmed from me actually
being depressed and I wouldn't get out bed.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.219
I had been believing for a particular wife
for some period of time and I wasn't seeing

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.520
any results, and I just started saying, you
know, “This faith stuff, forget it.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.840
I'm sick of this.”

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.120
At that point in my life God was not really
dealing with me like a baby.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.159
He was dealing with me a little more mature,
and so He just kind of gave me five scriptures.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.399
Very quickly I looked at them, and He basically
said, "Okay, now you get up and get out of

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.240
bed and you go in faith, or you stay in that
lower realm of depression."

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.760
And I said, “Wow. Okay.”

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.040
You know, it's that easy to fall out of faith
just by letting our self - that depression

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
hit us.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.720
And I started realizing "... without faith
it is impossible to please God", and that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.760
we're supposed to walk in a constant attitude
of faith, and that actually is fighting the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.420
fight of faith, or fighting that battle is
to literally fight back the discouragement.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.780
It's so easy to quit.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.640
It's so easy to die.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.660
Sid: You know, Don, there are - you're looking
at me right now, and there are people in various

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.360
stages of depression.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:50.240
There is a presence of the most Holy God that
will go right through your television set,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.540
and that presence will destroy that depression.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.160
So what did God tell you to do beyond get
out of bed and grow up?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.540
Don: Well he said, “You stop giving into
that.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.780
You stand up and dare to believe in me.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.420
I called you to start believing in me."

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.500
So I said, “Okay, fine. I'm up. I'm out of bed.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.620
What do you want to believe for?”

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.240
And God goes, “Cancer.”

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.060
And I said, “Cancer?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.600
Could we try something a little easier?”
Sid: [Laughs]

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.280
God immediately lets me see my heart, “Like
what, You think You're going to heal cancer?”

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.250
And I go, “Oh, that's right; You're the
healer, not me.”

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.460
And I said, “Okay fine, you want to heal
cancer?

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.960
Great.”

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.260
And so I start praying for cancer.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.940
He shows me a vision of a little boy with
cancer in a hospital.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.080
And as I'm praying, I all of a sudden stop
and I think, “Wait a second.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.940
You're going to have to be a little more specific
about - am I in Fantasy Island?

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.650
I mean, I'm seeing this vision, or is this
real?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.460
I don't - what do I do beyond this?”

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.000
Just then the phone rings.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.560
It's a Messianic believer, and she calls up
and says, “Don, I know that God uses you

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
to heal people, and well, I know you're busy,
but would it be too much to ask?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.420
One of my students has got leukemia.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.660
His mom just called me.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.580
He's in the hospital; he’s supposed to die
in the next two days.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.200
Would it be too much to ask for you to come
down?"

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.220
And I said, “No, and not only am I going
to come down," I said, “God is going to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.720
heal him.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
You would not believe what I just went through
at my house hanging out with God."

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.440
And so a few minutes later -
Sid: Now when you make a statement like that,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560
Don Paul, you are really putting everything
on the line because you didn't say, “Oh

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.680
I'll go and do a nice cosmetic prayer.”

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.900
You said “God is going to heal him.”

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.020
That's pretty strong.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.340
Don: But it's easier that way.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.980
When God sets it up and shows you there's
no risk; the risk is when you do it and God

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.120
hasn't shown you.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.480
Sid: Okay. You go to the hospital. Then what?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.240
Don: Okay.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.760
So we make arrangements down at the hospital.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.600
As I'm walking down the corridor, now keep
in mind God and me, were having a whole experience

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.100
at home.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.260
My depression, you know, doubt, unbelief,
getting into a place of faith then seeing

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.000
the vision, and I'm really caught up into
this atmosphere with God.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.980
Now we're at the hospital, and as I'm walking
down the corridor toward the boy's door, the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.230
Holy Spirit speaks and he says, “Now listen,
I don't want you to go by what you see.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.040
This little boy has been on chemo, radiation.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.620
He's not going to look good at all, and I
don't want what you see to pull you out, because

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.170
if you can't stay in this atmosphere where
you know I'm going to heal him, you won't

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.900
be able to bring him to that place, and I
don't want you being brought to where he's

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.380
at, where it's impossible."

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.760
So I walk into the room expecting to see the
worst, knowing God is going to heal him.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.340
I walk in, he's all tubed up.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.100
Everything, you know, barely can breathe;
just horrible.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.920
And I talk to him for a few minutes and, now
this is the first time I prayed for somebody

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.650
and I didn't feel the presence of God.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.590
Now for those of you that don't understand,
sometimes believers will feel the presence

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.700
of God, sometimes like warmth or heat, they'll
feel that.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.440
This is the first time I did not feel the
presence of God before he did a miracle,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.640
which is really interesting.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.280
God showed me that a lot of times we'll feel
that presence to help our faith.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.580
But see, he had given me a word so I knew
he was going to do it.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.120
See, God is trying to get us to believe even
if we don't feel the presence.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.540
That's really interesting.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.680
So here we are a few minutes later.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.960
They're singing songs, worshiping God, and
I'm praying for the boy.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.720
I pray for his salvation and baptism in the
Holy Spirit.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.740
Sid: To be filled with God's spirit.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.800
Go ahead.
Don: Yes, to be filled with God's spirit.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.200
And now he's in bed.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.040
He's laying down; he barely can breathe, okay.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.710
His lungs are just full of fluid.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.090
I reach over and I say, “God, clean out
his lungs."

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.760
I figured in my mind it would take two to
three weeks, you know.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.340
Instantly stuff started coming up.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.320
All of a sudden, the nurse comes in.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.680
The boy - the guy is getting his lungs cleaned
out.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.380
People are worshiping Jesus.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.260
Everybody is, you know, and the nurse is like,
“What's going on in here?"

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.140
Because it looked like it was out of control.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.520
And I said, “We're done."

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.560
And we walk out of the room.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.300
Now see, I had told the boy, I said, “Sit
up and act like you're healed."

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.500
That's when it happened.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.120
Okay.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.780
So we're out of the room.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.740
I get a call a few days later and she says,
“You're not going to believe this.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.080
The little boy's mom just called me.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.220
The doctors don't understand what happened.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.860
Not only is the little boy healed, he is outside
playing with the next door neighbor kids like

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.220
nothing ever happened."

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.760
Sid: I've got one question for you.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.260
Don: What?

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.800
Sid: What happened to your depression?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.140
Don: (LAUGHS)
Sid: (LAUGHS) You know what happened to his

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.640
depression?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.660
We'll be right back after this. Don't go away.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:23.540
[music]

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.280
Hello YouTube mishpochah!

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.760
Mishpochah is a Hebrew word; it means family.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.140
This is Sid Roth.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.360

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.860
[music]

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.380
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter, and I'm here with Don Paul.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.300
And as I said at the beginning, he provokes
me to jealousy.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.480
He can see in the invisible realm.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.040
I mean, I hear God's voice but the way, uh-oh,
I just heard God's voice.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.640
You see, when you say it you hear it.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.680
I just heard God's voice.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:12.120
He said that someone has just been healed
in their neck and back, and someone without

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.840
any hope, hope is going to come.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.600
There are people with AIDS.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.140
When you got full blown AIDS, there's not
much that medical science can do.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:32.400
But there is a doctor that can help you when
regular doctors say there's nothing we can do.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.460
His name is “the Messiah of Israel”, “Yeshua
or “Jesus”.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.980
AIDS, Don Paul, have you ever prayed for someone
with AIDS?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.879
Don: That's interesting.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.100
I was part of a ministry team for several
years in Los Angeles, California.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.999
And one particular person that's come into
mind, I remember taking him to the ministry

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.760
several times.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.220
Now the first time he's riding in my car I
get a vision, and in the spirit realm you

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.580
had mentioned about the demonic as well as
angels.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:08.639
In the spirit realm I saw like a black angel,
if you will, very dark, shining high and lifted

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.560
up over his life, and it was a spirit of death
that was trying to kill him.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.220
I didn't even know he had AIDS at the time.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.740
I knew -
Sid: Do you believe that when someone dies

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:22.140
there's always like a spirit of death that's
ready there to take them?

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.180
Don: Oh sure. There's all kinds of spirits.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.280
There's all kinds of spirits.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.000
Sid: I guess most people it would blow their
mind if they could see into the invisible

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.500
world.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.740
Don: Well God told me a long time ago, he
said, “Don, why do you think I want you

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.900
to be obedient?"

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.280
And I immediately heard from all the years
of music that I had been involved with,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.480
I immediately heard, [singing] “Under my
thumb" [talking] like Mick Jagger.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.620
Sid: Before you were a believer you were involved
in the music scene.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.240
Don: Right.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.720
And so when God was saying, “Why do you
think I want you obedient?"

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.860
And I was thinking, you just want to rule
over me.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.240
That's what came up. And God said, “no.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.639
And he opened my eyes and he showed me the
demonic realm that's all around us.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:02.149
And he said, “I don't let you see this
most of the time because if I did you wouldn't

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:03.300
enjoy your life."

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.559
Then he showed me like a fist coming out of
this realm and he said, “But I see it and

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.740
when I say “Duck”, I mean duck.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.140
In other words, I'm trying to protect you."

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.399
And part of the reason I think God lets me
see things is because I'm so stubborn sometimes

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.040
and so intellectual, it's like “Well, that
doesn't make sense.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.700
I don't want to do it.”

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.160
Then he shows me the spirit and I go, I understand.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.100
No problem.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.500
Sid: So you're with this fellow with AIDS.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.300
Don: And I'm with this fellow and I see this
spirit of death that's looming over him.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.580
We start going through - he actually went
through, he came out of a homosexual lifestyle.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.460
That process with him went on over several
years because he would come in, get healed,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.120
get delivered of the demonic spirits he had
opened his soul up to, walk clean for a while,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.220
then fall back into the sexual sin, and then
walk clean again, and fall, and he would be

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.520
going through the deliverance.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.920
And you know the Bible talks about, you know
-

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.600
Sid: Seven times worse.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.120
Don: Right.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.220
Luckily, he was baptized in the Holy Ghost.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.800
And at that point it was just a battle for
his soul.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.380
And so our team continued to stand with him
and others, and as we would battle that through

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.140
and battle that through.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.880
Today he's a minister, he’s got a ministry
to the homosexual community.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.480
He is married.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.660
He has got a beautiful child and none of them
have AIDS, and none of anything, and that's

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.520
a testimony to our Papa.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.020
Sid: Tell something that I'm very, very curious
about.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.900
You were into rock type music.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.000
You were a musician.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.560
Now knowing what you know, things that many
people watch on television, the music that

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.260
the teens take into their house, how dangerous
is this in the invisible world?

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:45.860
Don: Well as you know, Lucifer was the head
musician.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.680
We always hear that.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.519
Music - coming from music I can really talk
boldly.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.900
I will just say the music I was involved in,
which was rock and roll, there was a lot of

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.840
spirits, a lot of doors that get open through
music.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.560
Rebellion enters in.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.080
It is powerful and influencing.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.220
Something that comes to mind is a lot of times
parents will say, “Turn off that music;

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.160
it's giving me a headache.”

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.480
That headache, most people don't realize,
that headache is spiritual oppression.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.779
Music is designed as we worship God or as
we praise how wonderful he is, the presence

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.700
of God inhabits the room.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.780
When we lift up the demonic realm through
that music we evoke demonic spirits.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.360
We will feel that like a headache.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.260
It's not a headache.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.360
It's spiritual clogging.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.340
It's a heaviness that comes in.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.460
And what happens is you can get so under that
music that you don't feel that.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.580
When I was submitting through my season of
healing and deliverance, I remember when my

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.800
spiritual father came up and said, “Well
you kind of got this heavy metal, this rock

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.300
and roll spirit over you."

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.300
Something in me said “What is he talking
about?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.180
That's who I am.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm a musician.”

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.380
And I heard God say, “You came to submit."

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.629
And I said, “Okay fine. I submit to you but
not this guy.

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:02.180
He doesn't know what he's talking about."

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.680
So the guy is praying for me and I'm like,
“He's pushing me down!”, you know, as

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.360
I go to the ground.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.140
Okay.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.240
The next day I get -
Sid: Wait a second. What happened?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.220
Explain this to me.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.600
Sid: What do you mean He's pushing you down?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.600
Don: Well he's praying for me and I'm starting
to be slain, or -

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.520
Sid: The Spirit of God is putting you down
on the floor; is that what you're saying?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.020
Don: Right.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.100
But that spirit of rebellion that's in me
is saying, it's that voice that's in me that's

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.600
saying, “No, this guy is pushing me to the
ground”, because it's that spirit that was

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.980
just fighting him the whole way down.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.440
But I did yield and let that man of God pray
for me.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.000
The interesting thing was the very next day
my best friend guitar player came in the room

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.060
to do a session.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.120
When he entered in, whoa, I felt that heaviness.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.780
And until I yielded to get delivered of that
spirit, I couldn't discern that spirit.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.860
And see, a lot of people, the cleaner we get
in the spirit, the more we discern other spirits.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.580
Isn't that interesting?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:55.560
Sid: What about we watch on television and
we see psychics and we see “The Exorcist"

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.720
or things along those lines?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.580
What could happen to people watching those
things?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.260
Don: Did you ever hear the terminology, “Curiosity
killed the cat"?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.980
Sid: I've heard that.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.520
Don: Okay.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.651
The Bible says, "... think on these things",
"... lovely ... and pure …”, and it’s

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.140
not that God is trying to keep us from having
fun.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:14.420
In fact, when I was first around healing and
deliverance ministries, God was saying, “Don,

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.119
it's not that I don't want you to have fun”;
He said, 'there's just certain things that

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.060
are called sin and if you do them you open
your soul up."

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.800
And the demonic realm will try and transfer.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.900
It's exactly what they used to do with the
Jewish sacrifices that they used to do.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.680
They would pray - when they would sin, a spirit
would enter in, whether it was murder, adultery,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.180
whatever.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.360
The priest would pray the spirits or the sin
into the scapegoat, shut the door of life

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.780
and that was how they kept people spiritually
clean.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.800
And God was saying, “It's not that I don't
want you to have fun you just need to understand

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.900
there's a spirit realm that you open your
heart and soul up to.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:55.780
And when we look into dark corridors of depravity
in different areas, by curiosity, we get ensnared.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.140
Sid: Did you hear that?

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.460
There is a danger.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.380
But I've got some good news for you.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.720
There's a power that's greater, greater than
that danger.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.500
We'll talk about it when we come back.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.700
Don't go away.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:14.280
[music]

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.840
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative reporter.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.780
Next week we're going to have a man, he calls
himself Dr. Purpose.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.760
Let's go into the control room and talk about
next week's guest.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.540
Janie, Dr. Purpose, what is his purpose?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.060
Janie: Dr. Purpose helps people to find their
purpose.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:41.360
He says what we love, what makes angry, what
makes us cry, what irritates us shows us really

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.880
what our purpose is.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.580
I mean, people are always asking, why am I
here?

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.620
What's my purpose in life?

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:56.480
He had an angelic visitation and that angelic
visitation led him to understand these principles

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.480
about purpose.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.309
Sid: And what's so wonderful is it's not just
psychological principles, it's supernatural

00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:10.060
principles that will allow an individual to
not only find their purpose in life, but to

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.760
focus that purpose and make their life count.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.700
I've got here in the studio, I don't know
what to describe.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.500
You keep provoking me to jealousy.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.940
Don: [Laughs] Are you Jewish?

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.660
Sid: Yes.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.300
But doesn't the Bible say that you're supposed
to provoke the Jewish people to jealousy?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.040
Don: You didn't know that I knew.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.260
Sid: I mean, I'm sure that you did.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:40.200
But we were talking about people that either
ignorantly or even on purpose open themselves

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.280
up to the demonic by music or by what they
take into their home.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:52.700
But how does someone that has opened that
door get rid of what's happened, and even

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:59.859
better than that, I know that there's greater
power in the name of Jesus than there is in

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.440
the demonic realm.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.060
Explain that though.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.960
Don: Well you said it yourself.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.860
You said sometimes people do things by omission
and commission.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.700
Isn't that what they had, Israel had the
sacrifices for?

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.579
Sometimes people did stuff because they just
wanted to.

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.080
Sid: Right.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.100
Don: Sometimes they didn't understand that
they got spiritually defiled.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.740
Okay.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:23.019
Well God loves us so much, he makes a plan
and a way to get sanctified or cleansed of

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.440
the demonic realm, and that's the blood of
Jesus.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.740
See, Jesus was the final sacrifice.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.559
He was the Lamb of God.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.600
I want to just tell anybody if you're going
through any problems, people - I just met

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.760
a woman again the other day, hearing
voices and hearing all kinds of things.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.080
Cry out to God, you know, ask him to come
into your heart and to cleanse you with that

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.580
blood.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.240
And when we by faith partake of that wonderful
miracle that he did we can partake of the

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.040
blessings.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.120
I've seen demons scream.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.640
And you can say anything you want to them,
Mohammed, Buddha.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.220
You can say anything.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.300
You say the blood of Jesus, those demons say,
“Not the blood!

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.180
Not the blood!"

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.620
And I at first thought this whole blood of
Jesus, this is funny.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.900
But when I saw –
Sid: Wait a second.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.640
I have not seen something like this before.
Don: Okay.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.880
Sid: I believe it, but I haven't seen this
with my eyes.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.000
In other words, you can see in the invisible
realm and see a demon that's sort of attached

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.680
to someone?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.100
Don: In a healing or a deliverance, yes on
that, too, but in a healing or a deliverance,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.820
what made me a real believer was seeing people
prayed for.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.720
We had celebrities like Denise Matthews, you
know which is Vanity.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.799
She's now a minister. She used to be with Prince.

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:35.850
A lot of people came through the ministry,
a lot of Hollywood celebrities, and different

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.080
people would have manifestations as they were
going through their healing or deliverance.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.600
And the one thing that really stood out to
me was how much, when they started saying,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.940
“And oh the blood of Jesus" or saying, “The
blood of Jesus is against you, devil, loose

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.660
them," and the demon would answer back, “not
the blood," I suddenly went if the demonic

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.260
hates the blood of Jesus, I'm no dummy, I
love the blood.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.340
Come on, give it to me, anything to cover
me.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.880
See, because it's the blood of Jesus that
shields, protects us from that demonic realm.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.920
Sid: Are you afraid of the demonic realm?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.800
Don: No. And I respect the warfare that
we're in, but I'm not afraid of it.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.480
You will not move in the power of God if you
have fear in you.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.080
And a lot of people don't understand this,
but God said,”I’ve not given you a spirit

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.400
of fear, but rather love, strength and a sound
mind."

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.940
That reveals that fear is a spirit.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.200
God says that the devil controls you all your
life through fear.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.480
One of the first things God has to do is deliver
fear out of you because you cannot stand in

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.560
a spiritual battle or a healing.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.720
People believe God to get healed that they're
so full of fear that they're going to die

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.260
and then they wonder why they have such a
problem.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.660
You've got to let the Holy Spirit root the
fear out because “… we are more than a

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.920
conqueror ….” Once you know his power
as you yield to God and allow his spirit to

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.389
come into you, and to fill you with his power
and authority, see, the devil is not afraid

00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:57.360
of me.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.600
The devil is scared to death of the presence
of God.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.120
Sid: Okay, but when sometimes I'll pray and
I won't see any difference, and I might think

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.060
it hasn't worked.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.320
I'll say, “the blood of Jesus" and I haven't
seen anything happen.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.160
What's going on in the spirit realm?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.420
Don: I have seen, the Bible says, “The wicked
melt in the presence of God."

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.060
So when I was learning my little spiritual
Batman utility belt and I wanted as many weapons

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.620
for my warfare as possible, I found out that
worship was one, because God inhabits the

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.420
praises and the wicked melt in his presence.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.500
I have seen demonic, when you say the name
of Jesus, I've seen visions as God was revealing

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.040
things to me where the demons literally cringe
and pull back.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.120
I have found by even going into a bad situation,
you know, a woman is about to get mugged or

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.700
something on the street, if you'll just start
yelling out in faith, “Jesus!

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.800
Jesus!

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.580
Jesus!" into the situation, the whole atmosphere
will change.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.860
Sid: But you know what I think though, Don?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:01.020
I think when you say the name and you don't
see a result, you're having an effect and

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.120
they're just continuing their lie to you.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.660
Don: Right.
Sid: But I haven't seen this like you have.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.440
Don: Right.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.660
Yeah. The thing is you must continue in faith.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:16.200
And again, your - you get your faith exercised
by, you know, going through the trials and

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.380
tribulations.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.680
We all have faith exercises.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.640
Some people say, “Oh well, God wouldn't
have you believe for a Mercedes.”

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:28.600
Well if you were a rich kid and you were given
Volkswagens your whole life, for you, a step

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.040
of faith might be to believe for a Mercedes.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.100
If you rode a bicycle your whole life, believing
for a Volkswagen would be a big deal.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.560
So God does give us different types of faith
exercises.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.280
Sid: Has God ever given you money supernaturally?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.720
Don: He has met needs as I've given into his
purpose.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.420
He has come back and taken care of my needs
and yes he has.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.840
Sid: I don't think you want to say this, but
I want to get you to say this.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.780
Tell me what you saw happen in your hand.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:01.419
Don: Well it's really about leading up to
the place, because if I just jump there then

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:04.259
we miss the whole dynamics of what he was
teaching me, and I don't know if we have time

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.120
to go through that.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.240
I have tapes that go into more detail.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.700
But I had basically been giving into
ministries. I was fasting.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.460
I was standing and I had four dollars to my
name.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.280
And I met a ministry where I'm meeting the
ministry team that I'm part of at the time

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.940
and they were asking to do an offering.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.240
Now I had been fasting for two or three days,
and I knew at the end of that meeting I was

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.820
going to buy myself a cheeseburger, coke
and fries for that four bucks.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.700
And I heard one of the ministers say, “Maybe
we should put an offering plate in case anybody

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.400
wants to give."

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.360
And I went, “Woo, do, do, do - not me.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.340
I know what I'm spending that money on.”

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:45.240
And a few minutes later they asked for that,
and I really recognized that I was in fear

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.300
to give because back then I thought you would
die if you fasted more than three days.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.100
Okay.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.340
I end up giving two dollars of the four dollars
that I had into that offering plate.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.880
And then I said, “Okay God”, because what
was going through my mind was, “Wait a second,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.080
I'm not playing church here.”

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.640
I walked out of church as a little boy because
no miracles were happening.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.160
I want to know God.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.600
And I told him, “If you'll be the God of
the Bible I'll follow you.”

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.240
So I gave the two dollars and I said, this
thing either works or it doesn't.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.280
And so now I'm in faith.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.340
Okay God, what are you going to do?

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.120
What are you going to do?

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.140
And he has me go down to the hamburger place.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.180
I was challenged three times by unbelief that
nothing was ever going to happen.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:31.539
And finally the presence of God actually multiplied
my four dollars back, and I actually bought

00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:32.539
the cheeseburger, coke and fries.

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:36.990
Sid: Let me just tell you the interesting
thing is he didn't want to say that because

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.500
he felt too many people would be skeptical.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:46.360
But he saw the money multiply, multiply in
his hands.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.080
Can you imagine what that would do for your
faith?

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:56.640
But I believe we're in a time in history where
God is going to build you up to be the man

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.420
or woman he's called you to be.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.440
There is a destiny on your life.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:11.080
If you will tell God you're sorry for your
sins, believe that blood of Jesus washed your

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.480
sins away and say, Jesus, I make you my Lord.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.380
I want to know you.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.460
I want to know you.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.300
I want to hear your voice.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.420
Someone's back has just been healed in Jesus'
name.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.620
That hope that you didn't have before, it's
flooding you right now.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.840
You're being flooded with supernatural faith
right now in Jesus' name.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:54.220
