00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.300
It's graduation day at a children's
school in Tokyo.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.780
From the metro station it's just ten
blocks to their school,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.180
but these children aren't totally safe. Old men
from their community have to stand at

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.960
every corner to make sure that these
kids aren't harassed or bullied.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.800
It's happened before. In fact, there's been a
lot of rallies in Tokyo lately:

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.320
protesting these kids and their school.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.060
This is because, even though these kids

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.400
and their parents were born in Japan,
they're not Japanese.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.700
This is North Korea's bubble in Japan.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.060
It's a community of about 150,000 Koreans,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.420
holdovers from the 1940's when
Japan's military forcibly brought over

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.860
their relatives.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.660
They run a network of
schools, where they teach their kids

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.500
about Korean history, teach them Korean
language. They teach them the ideology of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
the great leader Kim Il-Sung.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.300
The guards are here this morning because three days ago,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.360
North Korea tested a bunch of
missiles that landed right off Japan's shores.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.060
Before the students can leave, they have
to change out of the traditional Korean clothing.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.900
But this community isn't giving in to the pressure.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.980
Their schools are the place
where they can protect their identity

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.160
and quietly revere their great leader
and the homeland that he founded.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.440
A place none of them have ever lived.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.160
This North Korean bubble is a nation within a nation,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
whose borders are made out of
culture, language, history, and ideology.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.740
And it shows how borders exist as much
in our minds as they do on maps.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.900
In 1910 the Korean Peninsula was annexed by
Japan's expanding empire. During its rule

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.590
the empire brought tens of thousands of
Koreans to Japan, mainly to work and to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.910
serve in their army. Or in the case of
Korean women, to serve as sex slaves in

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.040
brothels for Japanese soldiers.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.370
Japan's empire grew until 1945 when World War II,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.019
brought its sudden defeat and the loss of
much of its empire, including Korea.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.190
The Koreans who were in Japan were free, but
they found themselves in a country that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.000
didn't recognize them as citizens. The
United States and the Soviet Union

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.010
quickly filled the power vacuum of this
newly liberated Korean Peninsula and two

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.640
new countries were formed: the U.S.
backing the new South Korea, and the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.630
Soviet Union backing the North,
installing a rising leader, Kim Il-Sung

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.780
who a few years later invaded the
U.S.-backed South, starting the Korean War.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.380
Most of the Koreans in Japan went back
to Korea, but about 600,000 decided to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.660
stay in Japan.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.140
The Korean War changed everything,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.120
creating a bitter division between these
two new Koreas. So the Koreans in Japan

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.110
could no longer just be Korean. They
suddenly had to choose which Korea they

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.020
affiliated with. Almost all of them had
originally been from what was now South Korea,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.720
but this new North Korea began
paying special attention to the Koreans

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.860
in Japan, sending the money and helping them
build schools and businesses.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.020
Effectively, helping them build a cultural border, to
help protect their identity and language

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.860
against the Japanese society that sought
to change or destroy it.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.500
This school where the graduation is
taking place, was built with funding from

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.140
Kim Il-Sung in those early days, after
the war.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.180
For these stateless Koreans in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.180
Japan, this support from a faraway
government built trust and loyalty to a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.680
regime that they had never actually
lived under.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.300
The North Korean backed organization in Japan
called themselves the Chongryon and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.840
over the following decades they built a
network of schools, banks, and gambling parlors.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.640
They became rich, and started
sending millions of dollars back to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.140
North Korea to support the regime. In
their heyday the Chongryon was worth

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.400
around $25 billion dollars.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.820
But something happened that would mark the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.080
beginning of the end for this North
Korean business empire in Japan.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.020
In the late 70's North Korea started sending
spies disguised as fishermen to Japanese

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.160
beaches, to start kidnapping Japanese
citizens. They brought them back to North Korea

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.960
so that they could use them for
their language and cultural

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.980
understanding of Japan, so they could help
train their spies. The victims, including

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.320
a 13 year old girl who allegedly died in
captivity, gripped the nation's attention for years,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.900
their stories making their way into pop culture,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.520
their faces known to every
citizen. Around the same time, North Korea

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.449
began developing its long-range missile
program, a program that would eventually

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.919
lead North Korea to having nuclear
weapon delivery capabilities. Both the

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.610
nuclear and abduction issues came to a
head in the early 2000's, when North Korea

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.630
withdrew from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty, a treaty that

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.440
prevents countries from building more
nuclear weapons. The regime also

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.199
officially admitted that they were
behind some of the kidnappings of

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.940
Japanese citizens. This set off a wave of
violent attacks and hate speech

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.240
against North Koreans living in Japan.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.100
The Japanese government demanded that
the Chongryon repay its outstanding debts.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.040
When the organization couldn't do this,
they were forced to declare bankruptcy.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.580
Many of their buildings, including their
headquarters, were seized.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.570
The organization was left in financial ruin,
with only its network of a few dozen

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.729
schools standing. These schools became
the next target for Japanese animosity

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:12.900
towards North Korea.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.320
Korean students suddenly found
themselves in the middle of this heated

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.840
international conflict.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.940
This graph shows the amount of state funding for

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.100
Korean schools by Japanese prefectures over time.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.240
2006 was the year that North Korea tested a
nuclear weapon. And you can see the

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.290
immediate drop-off of funding every year
thereafter. Prefectures providing

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.680
tuition subsidies for Korean schools
went from 28 in 2006, down to 12 today.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.950
Education officials specifically cite
the abduction issue as well as the

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.020
general "situation" in North Korea, as
their motive for defunding the schools.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.420
Japan's Ministry of Education declined my request for an interview

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.500
on this, but I did talk to an
anti-Korean activist who defended these

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.720
actions by putting the issue into terms
that I, as an American, could understand.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.800
As I visited these schools and talked
with these people who live in a country

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.600
that is openly hostile towards them,
I found myself torn. This organization

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.420
pledges allegiance to a regime that has
committed some of the most horrific

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.040
atrocities that our modern world knows.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.000
Each and every conceivable
human right is violated.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.440
There are 80,000 to 100,000 people who are languishing in political prison camps.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.400
Yet at the same time, they are also victims of severe
structural discrimination.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.680
The U.N. and other international bodies have
repeatedly condemned the Japanese

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.500
structural discrimination against
Koreans. The North Korean community often

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500
cites this as validation for their
plight, but the U.N. has also called North Korea's

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.720
human rights violations so grave
that they have "no parallel in the contemporary world".

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.620
When you ask them how
they reconcile this contradiction, the

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.500
response is always some version of:

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.760
"any
country has human rights issues."

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.780
At first I found this astounding, that

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.350
there could be such a willful ignorance
to the atrocities of the North Korean

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.030
regime, but the more embedded I got into
this North Korean community in Japan, the

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.420
more I realized that, to this
marginalized community, North Korea

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.830
represents more of a refuge of safety
for their identity - something they crave

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.280
while they're living in a country that
is actively working to diminish their

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.760
heritage and culture.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.880
While younger generations are more likely to assimilate into Japanese society,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.440
the Chongryon have done an exceptional job

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.760
at cultivating the strong Korean
identity despite all the pressure and

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.640
hardship. In their last year of high
school the students have an opportunity

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.180
to go visit North Korea.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.100
Seeing and hearing the accounts of this highly

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.910
choreographed visit to Pyongyang, is
all you need to understand the

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.100
relationship that this disenfranchised
community has towards its adopted homeland.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.000
I visited the North Korean university where
they've curated a museum dedicated to

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:29.370
everything Korean. Every rock, tree,
species of fish, plant, animal, root, that

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.420
has ever existed on the Korean Peninsula
is found in this museum, which was built

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.690
with support from the North Korean
government. I had never seen such a

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.460
meticulously comprehensive collection to
enshrine a place in a history.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.220
This place does not exist for visitors. It's much
more of a statement that, in spite of

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.260
intense pressure and hostility, Korean
culture endures in Japan.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.100
North Korea isn't their home country in the way that you
would think. They weren't born there,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.740
they've never lived there, but they see
it as their home country because the

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.700
country that they were born in actively
works to make their lives harder.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.160
Like in many parts of the world,
right-wing nationalism is surging in Japan.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.380
Anti-Korean rallies are on the
rise, according to an investigation by

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.940
Japanese law enforcement. Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe is a fierce nationalist and

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.660
he's caught up in a scandal right now
for having given secret donations to an

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.970
ultra-nationalist kindergarten with anti-Korean views. Japanese nationalism leads

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.590
to discrimination against Koreans.
This causes the Koreans to resist Japan

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.800
as their home country, looking to a
country they've never lived in for

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800
support and protection of their identity.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.060
Affiliating with this universally

00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.310
reviled regime, that routinely vows to
destroy Japan creates more resentment

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.390
from the Japanese population and
politicians, leading to more

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.680
discrimination which leads to again
deeper commitment to North Korea as a protector.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.760
And in my mind there's no
doubt that the cycle will continue.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.340
While I was in Japan making this video, I
also spent a lot of time with these

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:51.100
ultra right-wing groups who are anti-Korean and I didn't go into that much in

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.520
this video, but I made an entire separate
video about the rise of right-wing

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.000
politics in Japan and kind of the anti-Korean sentiment and where that comes

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.100
from, from like a historical perspective.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.640
And of course: big THANK YOU to lululemon

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.600
who is a sponsor of Borders, they sent me
these ABC pants a while back that I've

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.200
been wearing. They are sturdy, and
flexible and you can wear them when

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.010
you're hiking or when you're at home. So
thank you lululemon, but more importantly

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.040
thank you for supporting Borders and
making this project possible. I'm gonna

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.640
leave a link here for the lululemon shop
for men online, and you can check out

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.560
your own pair of ABC pants.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.790
Alright, we're three episodes into

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.540
Borders, we have three to go. Get ready
for next Tuesday when I publish the fourth.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.240
And wish me luck in the meantime
I've got a lot of editing to do.
