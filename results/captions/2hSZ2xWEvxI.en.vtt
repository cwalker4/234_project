00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.330
During the final decades of the Galactic Republic,
a male of the Chiss species was born on the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.950
planet of Csilla. And while Mitth'raw'nuruodo
and his brother Mitth'ras'safis grew up as

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.100
mere commoners, they both proved skilled in
their own ways, with Mitth'ras'safis going

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.300
into politics and rising to the rank of Syndic,
while Mitth'raw'nuruodo used his tactical

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.800
brilliance to join the Chiss Expansionary
Defense Force, quickly reaching the rank of

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Force Commander.
Their achievements were noticed by the ruling

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.540
families of the government, and so both brothers
were made merit adoptives of the Mitth family,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.320
also known as the 8th ruling family of the
Chiss Ascendancy.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.110
Mitth'raw'nuruodo or Thrawn as he would come
to be known in the core worlds, continued

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.560
his impressive rise to power, becoming the
youngest to ever reach the rank of Commander.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.850
His success led the 8th ruling family to make
raise him further in status, becoming trial-born,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.080
meaning he was eligible to become a permanent
member of the family.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.960
During much his time with the Defence Force,
Thrawn commanded the Combat Cruiser Springhawk,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.600
and explored many areas within the Unknown
regions, becoming the first known Chiss to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.530
make contact with humans, when he saved the
light freighter Bargain Hunter from a pirate

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.290
attack. Through the use of the trade language
Sy Bisti, Thrawn was able to communicate with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.360
them, befriending them somewhat and learning
Basic from their interactions.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.450
Sometime later, Thrawn received word about
a Vagaari ship near Chiss Space, a species

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.070
known for piracy and slavery who had been
pillaging the areas outside Chiss borders

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.140
for a decade.
He then ordered the Springhawk to pursue the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560
vessel, defeating and boarding their ship
to learn more about their kind, while also

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.970
discovering a great deal of treasure looted
from various worlds.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.560
Thrawn tried to use this as evidence for the
Chiss to send more ships against the Vagaari,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.140
but was instead chastised for his pre-emptive
strike philosophy, since it went against his

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.180
species moral code.
Undeterred and unwilling to allow the Vagaari

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.380
to continue raiding unopposed, Thrawn ignored
the wishes of the ruling families, even willing

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.810
to risk his status with the 8th ruling family.
He then engaged the enemy again, capturing

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.319
one of their Gravity well projectors, so it
might be studied and used against them. But

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.290
having lost some of his men during the confrontation,
the event was reported to the ruling families,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.200
who again admonished Thrawn for his actions.
Still unrepentant, and eager to eliminate

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.731
the Vagaari threat once and for all, he embraced
an opportunity that presented itself, when

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:35.271
he encountered a convoy of ships from the
trade federation in the unknown regions. Though

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:39.550
they outnumbered and outgunned Thrawn’s
forces, the Chiss commander was able to use

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.260
his tactical wisdom to utterly defeat the
enemy ships without suffering even a single

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.010
casualty.
Boarding the main ship he soon discovered

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.060
they were representatives of Chancellor Palpatine,
leader of the galactic Republic, also known

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
as Dark Lord Sidious. They told him they were
sent on a mission to destroy the Jedi ship

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.821
Outbound Flight, which sought to explore beyond
the galaxy. But this had to be stopped, because

00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:06.650
of a group of potential enemies known as the
Far Outsiders, who were amassing forces at

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.720
the edge of the galaxy in preparation for
a massive invasion. If these hostile aliens

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.520
were to capture the Outbound Flight, they
might learn of the Republic, placing them

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.270
in great danger. And so Lord Sidious had decided
the ship must be destroyed.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.760
Thrawn even spoke to the Dark Lord directly,
confirming the story. Sidious was impressed

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.980
with Thrawn’s military abilities and so
ordered his men to share their intelligence

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.210
about Outbound Flight and the Far Outsiders,
while Thrawn agreed to help stop the ship

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.860
before it could leave their space.
At the same time, he used his human ally Car’das

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.840
to feign betrayal and lead the Vagaari to
attack Thrawn’s position, even gifting the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.709
enemy some battle droids.
But the Chiss Commander orchestrated events

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.320
so that the Vagaari would attack at the same
time Thrawn’s fleet confronted the Outbound

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.690
Flight, causing his enemies to attack each
other, and allowing for his forces to slip

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.840
in and do massive damage. In addition, the
battle droids Cardas had given to the Vagaari,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.840
turned against them in the midst of battle,
killing the Vagaari leaders onboard their

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.260
flagship.
When Thrawn contacted Jedi Master Joris C’boath,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.470
commander of the Outbound Flight, asking him
to surrender, the force user refused, then

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.370
using his powers to force choke thrawn.
Defense Force soldiers responded quickly,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.530
reassigning vessels to emit heavy radiation
onto the Jedi’s ship killing Jorus C’boath

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.909
and breaking the force choke threatening Thrawn.
And while their quick thinking saved his life,

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.659
the event also gave time for the remaining
Vagaari vessels to escape.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.749
They were then visited by Chaf'orm'bintrano
of the Fifth Ruling Family who they suspected

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:42.680
has come to reprimand Thrawn and possibly
confiscate the Outbound Flight’s technology

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.490
for himself. And so Thawn’s brother Mitth'ras'safis,
also known by his core name Thrass, flew the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.349
ship away before it could be seized, and thereby
giving Thrawn a bargaining chip he could use

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.599
to avoid punishment from the government.
Unfortunately however, the Outbound Flight

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.680
was never heard from again, and with the loss
of the ship, Thrawn’s brother Thrass also

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.529
disappeared.
Over the next few years, Chancellor Palpatine

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.050
contacted his new Chiss ally a number of times,
attempting to enlist his aid.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.599
Thrawn, fed up with the politics of his people,
and eager to work for Palpatine, then decided

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.699
to orchestrate his own downfall, continuing
his pre-emtive strikes against Chiss enemies,

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.070
until eventually stripped of all rank and
status within the ruling families. Exiled

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.780
to a primitive and isolated world in the Unknown
Regions.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.979
Surviving there for a time, he eventually
escaped onboard an Imperial Star Destroyer

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.550
that came to the planet pursuing a smuggler
named Booster Terrik. Thrawn used his knowledge

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.289
of the terrain and tactical brilliance to
organize a number of attacks against their

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.400
encampment, then hiding in a power generator
casing to get onboard their ship.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.240
Yet when he attempted to leave his hiding
place he was captured by the imperials who

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.180
were monitoring the area.
Thrawn, obviously outnumbered and without

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.559
recourse, quickly surrendered to them, but
avoided punishment by greatly impressing Imperial

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.020
Officer Voss Parck, who was stunned that the
former Chiss commander had been capable of

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.349
doing so much damage on the planet and infiltrated
their ship all on his own.

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.969
And so Parck brought Thrawn back with him
to the former Republic now Empire, presenting

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.689
him as a gift to Emperor Palpatine, in the
hopes it would please the dark robbed leader

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.839
and make up for their failure to capture booster
Terrik.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.710
Palpatine was pleased to finally meet Thrawn
face to face, and while he publically insulted

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.779
him to keep up appearances in the royal court
about the government’s distain for non humans,

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.580
in truth he was happy to recruit Thrawn into
the empire, with Parck acting as his trainer

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.490
and mentor until beginning his training at
the private Imperial Academy of Carida.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.559
Although he faced constant discrimination
for being nonhuman, he quickly rose through

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:48.369
the ranks, even coming to teach at the Academy
for a time, before heading back out to further

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:53.449
explore the unknown regions. This time with
Imperial support, setting up a military presence

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.270
in the area. Thrawn’s ultimate goal, was
to help Palpatine unite the galaxy together,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.469
so they might have the strength to resist
the Far Outsiders threatening the Chiss and

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.080
so many others.
And so with this goal in mind, he organized

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.539
a vast network of allies, spies and contacts
throughout the Unknown Regions, creating a

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.439
territory known as the Empire of the Hand,
ruled by Thrawn. And while he remained loyal

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.689
to Emperor Palpatine, considering his territory
as under the umbrella of the larger Galactic

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:26.089
Empire, he administered the region differently,
ruling through consent rather than terror

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:28.969
and granting planets and systems far more
autonomy.

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.499
Thrawn’s rise to power also came to the
attention of the Chiss, and while the Ruling

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:38.199
families still saw him with destain, many
others rallied to his cause, increasing the

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.119
size and quality of his forces in the area.
After years of dutiful service to the empire,

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:49.030
Thrawn was given command of the Star Destroyer
Vengeance, serving under the dark jedi Inquitor

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.699
Jerec. Jerec survived order 66 but was later
captured by the Empire and avoided death by

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.759
accepting the dark side.
Working together, Jerec and Thrawn destroyed

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:03.330
the rebellion on Sulon, and executed the force
sensitive Morgan Katarn.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.909
The following year, the Imperial superweapon,
known as the Death Star, was unveiled to the

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:12.889
galaxy following the destruction of Alderaan,
which was known to have deep ties to the Rebel

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.870
Alliance.
In response, the Rebels attacked and destroyed

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.869
the death star. Made possible by Luke Skywalker,
the powerful force sensitive child of Darth

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:26.210
Vader, raised away from his father on tatooine
under the supervision of Obi Wan Kenobi. Master

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.580
Kenobi looked out for the boy from afar, but
when the time came, began his training as

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.979
a jedi.
Two weeks later, Thrawn and 9 other Imperial

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.539
officers were called into a private meeting
with Emperor Palpatine, and apprised of the

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.180
situation. Although Thrawn suggested immediately
attacking the rebel base, Palpatine chose

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.700
to wait and ordered them to investigate the
identity of the pilot responsible for the

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.490
destruction of the death star.
Several months later, Thrawn, now at the rank

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.511
of Senior Captain, was given command of the
task force admonitor and returned to the Unknown

00:08:56.511 --> 00:09:02.270
regions where a new warlord named Nuso Esva
was rising in power, conquering his own territory

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:07.750
and raising a mighty fleet. Thrawn originally
attempted to ally himself with Esva but was

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.690
rejected, leading to hostilities between them.
The warlord however proved a tactical genius,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.370
equaling Thrawn and proving difficult to defeat.
With Palpatine unable to provide reinforcements,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.030
Thrawn turned to Darth Vader who granted his
request, in exchange for the Chiss captain’s

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.200
help in locating a rebel base.
Engaging with the Eastern fleet of Nuso Esva

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.910
in the Poln system, the combined forces of
Thrawn and Vader proved victorious.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.620
In the chaos of battle, a group of rebels
on Poln minor managed to escape the area with

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.270
a number of stolen supplies. Thrawn was able
to use the list of items taken to create a

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.080
profile of where they were going, and was
therefore able to locate the rebel base, fulfilling

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.710
his promise to Lord Vader.
After the fighting, he was introduced to a

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.980
group of 5 former stroopers who deserted after
one of them killed an imperial officer. They

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.340
were now known as the hand of judgement and
impressed Thrawn not only with the fighting

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.070
skills but also with the tolerance for other
species. And so rather then turning them over

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:09.740
to the Empire, he hired them to train a new
army known as the 501st Stormtrooper legion

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.950
that would include member of many different
species and would operate exclusively within

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.500
the Empire of the Hand.
Thrawn’s continued success eventually led

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.270
to his promotion to Vice Admiral, then made
grand admiral in a private ceremony on Coruscant.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.740
However his rank was largely kept secret with
the Empire, as only 12 Grand Admirals were

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.630
allowed to exist, and all the position were
filled.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.380
Yet despite his favor with the Emperor, Thrawn
did not follow orders blindly, even refusing

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.890
a direct order on several occasions, when
he felt the mission was doomed for failure

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.610
and would waste resources.
During one such occasion, the Emperor was

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.870
outraged and named him a traitor, then assigning
another officer to the mission. However when

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.210
the attack proved a failure, the Emperor gained
a new respect for Thrawn’s judgement.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.920
The Chiss Grand Admiral had risen so high
he was even granted the title of Warlord,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.300
but soon found that others within the Imperial
Court did not appreciate his rapid rise to

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.490
power. And so many began to plot against him,
hoping to have him exiled from the core.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.120
Palpatine and Thrawn used this an opportunity
and staged the Grand Admiral’s fall from

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.240
grace, wherein his allies were demoted and
he was effectively exiled, sent to the unknown

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.320
region on a mapping mission. This however
was exactly what Thrawn wanted and allowed

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.180
him to return to his work in the Empire of
the Hand.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.840
With fresh imperial resources, the grand admiral
was able to construct a number of Imperial

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.090
bases and settlement, using ruthless tactics
to conquer new worlds. Only once did Thrawn

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:38.650
fail in defeating enemy forces and so ordered
the planet’s destruction. Though many civilizations

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.300
were destroyed, Thrawn made sure to allow
their art work to survive, having a deep personal

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.180
fascination with the subject, using his studies
of different species art to learn about their

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.060
culture so he might better understand how
to defeat them in battle.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.420
Thrawn’s forces even began to operate in
Wild Space, but found it difficult to gain

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.610
and maintain territory, and so concentrated
primarily on expanding within the unknown

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.300
regions.
After successfully quelling an attempted mutiny

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.820
and his continued success in conquering new
worlds, Thrawn was recalled to Coruscant where

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.820
he was inducted into the Order of the Canted
Circle.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.300
Before returning to the unknown regions, Thrawn
agreed to help Darth Vader on a mission against

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.200
the Black Sun criminal cartel. He was then
rewarded by the Dark Lord by being given command

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.850
of the Noghri, a species who were saved from
total destruction by the Empire, and so offered

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:30.320
their allegiance in return, becoming private
Imperial commandos used directly by Vader,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.070
Sidious and now Thrawn.
The Chiss Grand Admiral then worked with Vader

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:39.370
again to uncover a rebel base on Derra IV,
which in turn led them to send probe droids

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.680
throughout the western reaches, until finding
the main rebel stronghold on Hoth. After the

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.600
battle of hoth in 3 aby, Thrawn continued
his work with vader, attacking a rebel space

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.070
station in the outer rim.
Although the Empire seemed to be making progress

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.121
in their war against the rebellion, they were
forced to go the defensive for a time, when

00:12:57.121 --> 00:13:02.140
Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin staged a coup
d’etat, attempting to capture palpatine

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.630
and take over the empire. However Darth Vader
and Thrawn quickly came to the Emperor’s

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.310
rescue, though Zaarin managed to escape. Thrawn
was then assigned to capture the rogue imperial

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.820
who was continuing his war against the empire,
sabotaging imperial manufacturing facilities.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.010
Thrawn took the place of Zaarin and became
an official grand admiral, eventually finding

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.840
the traitor and seeing him killed.
The Chiss Imperial then returned to the Unknown

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.670
Regions where he learned of a rebel attack
on the second death star in the battle of

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:34.070
Endor, learning of the deaths of Darth Vader
and Emperor Palpatine.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.840
Following the Battle of Endor, Thrawn focused
his attention on securing and defending the

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.170
Empire of the Hand, while the remnant of the
Palpatine’s government scrambled to defend

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.410
against the rebels which soon established
themselves as the New Republic.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.540
Fortunately for Thrawn, the new Republic was
unaware that Demetrius Zaarin had been replaced

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.240
as the 12th Grand Admiral, which meant no
one was searching for the Chiss Imperial.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.090
During his time away from galactic events
near the core, Thrawn’s forces battled the

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.920
Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, who’d been making advances
into Chiss space.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.620
Meanwhile the Empire which had lost ¾ of
former territories, were now under the command

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:15.360
of Ysanne Isard who kept in contact with Thrawn,
though he did not trust her to rule the Empire.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.070
And as the New Republic continued to win victories,
more and more ships were being transferred

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.150
out of Thrawn’s command, to aid in the war
effort.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.650
Despite the chaos in the galaxy, The Grand
Admiral never forgot the real threat waiting

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:33.430
from the far outsiders, and so continued to
work to defend against their impending invasion.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.890
Part of this mission involved recruiting worthy
officers, such as Soontir Fel, a hero of the

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.670
Empire turned Rebel agent. Although Isard
wanted to execute the traitor, Thrawn had

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.380
him sent to the unknown regions, where he
explained the larger goal and the threat of

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.270
the far outsiders.
Fel, seeing the seriousness of the threat

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:56.630
and that Thrawn was a non-oppressive, yet
also highly intelligent ruler, he was swayed

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.880
to join the Empire of the Hand.
In 8ABY Thrawn at last defeated he outlaw

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.070
Nuso Esva who died in the Battle of Quethold.
And while the Grand Admiral’s efforts were

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.670
successful in securing his own territories,
the Empire itself was at the point of collapse.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.710
On Coruscant, Isard had been ousted from power
and the remaining moffs squabbled amongst

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:37.170
themselves.
Thrawn personally took command the Star Destroyed

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.120
Chimaera, with Gilad Pellaeon as his first
officer. Some in the ruling council also gave

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.760
their support, sending him a small fleet,
but most moffs hoarded their resources and

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.810
sent nothing. In addition many that did come
to support Thrawn did so in order to use him

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.100
as a puppet.
But Thrawn proved both strategically brilliant

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.029
and politically astute, able to slowly gain
the support of a large portion of the Empire,

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:04.570
winning a number of victories against the
New Republic through his campaign in the outer

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.240
rim, and even gaining the allegiance of the
influential D’asta family, who held the

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.640
largest private military fleet in the galaxy.
Part of Thrawn’s success revolved around

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.520
his continuing study and appreciation of art,
which informed his strategic thinking as he

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.180
interacted with the various species of the
galaxy. This then led him on one occasion

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.010
to Tatooine, where an auction was being held
for a famous Alderaanian painting which was

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.110
taken off world before the destruction of
the planet.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.730
However others had also come to bid on the
item, such as Han Solo of the New Republic

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.380
and his wife Leia Organa who were on a mission
to retrieve the key code hidden within the

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:44.560
painting. This code gave entry to the Shadowcast
Communications network which the rebels created

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.400
years earlier to communicate in secret with
their agents.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.030
After the New Republic successfully won the
auction, Commander Quenton, Thrawn’s representative

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.510
on the planet attempted to take it by force.
And so a fight broke out, with the painting

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:02.490
stolen and new republic agents fleeing into
the desert. Eventually Thrawn’s people tracked

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.179
down what they are after, but not before Han
and Leia removed the code, then escaping the

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:10.459
planet.
Early on in his campaign, Thrawn sought an

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:14.669
imperial storehouse that once belonged to
palpatine, containing schematics to a cloaking

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:20.319
device and at least 20,000 Spaarti cloning
cylinders. With the cylinders, Thrawn could

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:25.269
rapidly create a clone army for his fleet
in a renewed offensive against the New Republic.

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:29.730
In order to prevent Clone Madness, a disease
in which clone’s were driven to insanity

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.240
by prolonged exposure to the force, Thrawn
had beings known as ysalamiri which he’d

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.649
discovered many years earlier, learning that
they possessed a natural ability to suppress

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:40.789
the force around them. With many ysalamiri
together in one place, the effects of the

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:41.789
Force could be neutralized for a very large
area.

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:44.960
After a number of victories against the New
Republic, and with his support amongst the

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.224
remaining factions of the Empire increasing,
Thrawn found the storehouse he was after on

00:17:49.224 --> 00:17:54.170
the planet of Wayland. However what he did
not expect to find was the clone of Joros

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.669
C’Baoth, who had used his force powers to
become the ruler of the local population,

00:17:58.669 --> 00:18:03.730
often using his abilities to control their
actions directly. The Grand Admiral saw almost

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.590
immediately that he was suffering from clone
madness, but felt a powerful jedi could prove

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:13.009
useful to his efforts, and so made a deal
with C’Baoth, requesting the use of his

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.950
abilities such as battle meditation, in exchange
for offering to find him Luke skywalker along

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:22.690
with his pregnant sister Leia, whose children
would likely inherit force capabilities. In

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.789
this way C’boath could start a new Jedi
Order which he would personally lead and shape.

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:32.749
An offer he could not refuse.
Thrawn immediately began activating Clones

00:18:32.749 --> 00:18:37.300
and while normally Clones needed a year to
develop a healthy mental state, the Imperials

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.660
were able to produce them within 20 days,
thanks to the ysalamiri which blocked the

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.909
Force from hindering their progress.
This increased personnel meant he would soon

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:50.039
have a large army capable of dealing a crippling
blow to the New Republic.

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:55.450
In addition, Thrawn had discovered a new form
of gathering intelligence known as Delta Source.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.059
Audio recording devices scattered throughout
Coruscant, which Palpatine used to spy on

00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:04.750
the population and his government officials.
Through Delta Source, the Empire was able

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.860
to track down Luke and Leia, sending Noghri
Commandos to capture them who even after several

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.730
attempts proved unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, Thrawn next moved on to the problem

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.110
of acquiring more ships for his new personnel,
and set about stealing a number of Plasma

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:23.190
Jet Mole Minors from Lando Calrissian, in
order to use their plasma torches to attack

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.509
and breach the hull of warships, which they
could then steal for the Empire.

00:19:27.509 --> 00:19:31.919
However during the Battle of Sluis Van, the
unexpected presence of Han Solo and Lando

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:37.149
Calrissian aboard the Millennium Falcon disrupted
the Empire’s plans, ultimately defeating

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:41.970
Thrawn. Yet while they suffered a setback,
the new republic suffered heavy casualties

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.369
and Thrawn was undeterred, confident they
would be victorious in the end.

00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:50.919
With the larger threat of the Far Outsiders,
ever present in his mind, Thrawn continued

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:55.520
to work towards a unified galactic government,
which could be militarized in anticipating

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.940
of the coming invasion.
In addition to the remnants of the Empire,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.260
now largely under his control, he possessed
the ability to clone an army, and so was in

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.110
need of ships for his new personnel. After
their defeat at Sluis Van, Thrawn ordered

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:13.169
his first officer Gilad Pellaeon to reach
out to the criminal underworld and offer 20%

00:20:13.169 --> 00:20:17.350
above market value for any armed ships over
100 thousand tons.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.929
With his numbers now steadily growing, Thrawn
increased his attacks against the new republic,

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:26.190
raiding convoys along major trade routes.
He also sought to destabilize their government

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.629
by planting evidence against Supreme Commander
Gial Ackbar, leading to his arrest, on charges

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:35.789
of treason. This then allowed for Ackbar’s
political rival Borsk Fey'lya to take command,

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:39.409
dividing the loyalties of the Defense Fleet.
And while Thrawn was succeeding with many

00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:43.870
of his plans, he was still having trouble
capturing Luke and Leia for his temporary

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:48.590
ally, Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth. Starting
to have doubts about the loyalty of the Noghri,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.570
who led his commando units, he personally
went to their homeworld where he discover

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.009
that Khabarakh, one of their warriors may
have betrayed the Empire. Khabarakh, having

00:20:57.009 --> 00:21:01.429
discovered that Leia was the daughter of Darth
Vader, believed his loyalty must first be

00:21:01.429 --> 00:21:05.710
to descendant of their savior, and helped
her come to their planet and try to sway the

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.639
Noghri against the Empire.
After the arrest of the traitor, Thrawn left

00:21:09.639 --> 00:21:13.749
their world and went to Endor searching for
the Milenium Flacon. While in the system he

00:21:13.749 --> 00:21:18.130
met with Mara Jade, who had been captured
by Imperial forces, but used her former rank

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.169
as the Emperor’s Hand to get the meeting.
In an attempt to have him remove the bounty

00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:26.980
of 20,000 credits, on her friend Talon Karrde,
she told him that they could offer the location

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.090
of the legendary Katana Fleet, 200 slave-rigged
Dreadnaughts which would serve him greatly

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.379
in the battles ahead.
Thrawn agreed to the deal, but would not leave

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:39.690
it to chance, and so secretly tracked Mara’s
ship when she departed, using her to find

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.230
and capture Karrde. Mara Jade was furious
for his betrayal of their agreement, and attacked

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:49.230
thrawn with her force powers. However his
Noghri bodyguard Rukh quickly intervened and

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.529
she relented.
Thrawn, then tried to renegotiate their deal,

00:21:52.529 --> 00:21:56.299
saying that once they gave him the information
about the fleet, they’d be allowed to go

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:00.419
free. But Mara no longer had any trust left
in the Empire, believing it was not the same

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:04.909
government she once served, and so left to
go find Luke Skywalker, and enlisted his help

00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:08.010
in rescuing Karrde.
Although they were able to free him, before

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.990
he could reveal the location of the Katana
Fleet, Thrawn had a backup plan, tracking

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.200
down a smuggler named Hoffner who also knew
where they could be found. However, Talon

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.549
Karrde was now working with the New Republic,
and so both factions learned of the fleet’s

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:24.999
location. Yet it was the empire’s forces
which arrived first, able to capture all but

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:29.019
15 of the ships.
A battle soon erupted over the remaining vessels,

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:33.929
but Thrawn was unable to aid his forces due
to the Jedi Master Joruus C’Boath, who demanded

00:22:33.929 --> 00:22:38.039
an immediate audience and used his force powers
to prevent Thrawn from leaving.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:42.580
As a result the Empire lost the battle and
was forced into retreat. Nevertheless, they

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.309
captured the vast majority of the Dreadnaught
fleet, and so Thrawn was now prepared to launch

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:51.179
a final campaign towards victory. Although
confident he would succeed, he also understood

00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:55.769
nothing was guaranteed, and so put in place
a number of contingency plans in the event

00:22:55.769 --> 00:23:00.640
of his defeat. One such plan was to have a
special clone of himself prepared in a secret

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.559
location, who could continue his efforts to
secure the galaxy after his death.

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:09.070
He also scattered a number of sleeper clones
throughout New Republic and Imperial space,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:14.070
which could be used in the future as a resistance
army against the far outsiders, if both galactic

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:19.059
governments should fall. With his contingencies
in place, Thrawn went on the offensive, capturing

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:23.519
the planet of Ukio and many others.
With Admiral Ackbar having been reinstated

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:27.840
to his position, the New Republic regrouped
and tried to counter-strike against the Empire,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.419
targeting their Shipyards to slow down their
manufacturing capabilities. Meanwhile, Talon

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:37.179
Karrde, was working to create an alliance
of smugglers to aid the New Republic in their

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:40.269
struggle.
Thrawn, now ready to push into the core worlds,

00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:45.580
captured Mrisst and laid siege to Coruscant,
placing 22 cloaked asteroids around the planet,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.100
while giving the impression there were many
more, forcing them to keep their planetary

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.289
defense shields activated, and preventing
them from leaving the planet.

00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:56.669
In order to lift the siege, the New Republic
required a crystal gravfield trap, making

00:23:56.669 --> 00:24:01.730
a plan to capture one from an imperial shipyard.
While capturing Xa Fel, Thrawn learned of

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.789
an attack against Tangrene, but suspected
it was a misdirect, instead ordering his forces

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:10.220
to the Bilbringi shipyard where the real assault
was occurring.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.620
Although Imperial forces were well positioned
to destroy the enemy fleet, the smuggler’s

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.129
alliance led by Talon Karrde soon arrived
and came to the aide of the New Republic.

00:24:19.129 --> 00:24:23.399
Nevertheless, Thrawn might have been victorious
in this battle, had it not been for the betrayal

00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:26.940
of the Noghri.
After leaving the Noghri homeworld, Leia Organa

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.059
had presented evidence that the Empire had
been poisoning their planet, to make them

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:36.039
dependent and keep them subjugated. And so
they pledged themselves to help Leia Organa,

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:39.799
joining Luke and Mara Jade on a mission to
the planet Wayland, where they confronted

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:44.940
Joruus C’boath and killed the mad jedi.
While on board the Chimaera, commanding at

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.909
the battle of Bilbringi, Thrawn learned of
all that had occurred on Wayland, but it was

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:53.010
too late, as his Noghri bodyguard Rukh stabbed
him through the chest.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:57.470
Declaring that the Noghri had been avenged,
Rukh tried to make his way off the ship, but

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:02.169
was killed by Imperial forces. With Thrawn
dead, Pellaeon had no choice but to order

00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:06.899
retreat, giving victory to the New Republic.
Although the Empire continued on for a time,

00:25:06.899 --> 00:25:12.340
without a strong central ruler like Thrawn
they largely fell to infighting, and by 11ABY

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.950
had lost most of the gains achieved by the
Chiss Commander. In 18 ABY, Gilad Pellaeon,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.490
once again went to war with the New Republic
but was defeated, leading to the signing of

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.870
a peace treaty the following year.
Meanwhile Thrawn’s clone continued to grow,

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.710
while the Empire of the Hand awaited the return
of their leader, having been told that he

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.639
would reappear 10 years after his death. However
the clone was involuntarily destroyed by Mara

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:41.779
Jade and Luke Skywalker, when they entered
the facility and activated the defense systems.

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:46.570
The Empire of the Hand meanwhile, attempted
to go forward, honoring the legacy of Thrawn

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.280
by continuing to prepare their sector of space
for the invasion of the Far Outsiders. However

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.350
with their leader dead, and his clone destroyed,
they soon diminished in power, and disbanded.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:03.340
And so in 25 ABY, when at last the Far Outsiders,
also known as the Yuzan Vong invaded the galaxy,

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.549
they found only a weakened New Republic, and
a shattered Imperial Remnant, quickly able

00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:11.630
to overpower their both and bring utter devastation
upon the galaxy.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:17.179
Many years later in 55 ABY, as a result of
all that had occurred, the Imperial partisan

00:26:17.179 --> 00:26:24.690
and polemicist Lenang O'Pali wrote about Thrawn:
"I am baffled by critics who accept Mitth'raw'nuruodo's

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.700
account of his discussion with Palpatine about
the Far Outsiders, yet refuse to revise their

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.149
opinions about either man. They ignore what
Mitth'raw'nuruodo reported Palpatine believed:

00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:40.220
that the weak Republic would be defeated by
the Vong, and had to be reforged into an orderly,

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:45.230
militarized society able to resist them. They
refuse to consider the possibility that the

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.660
Empire's apparent brutality and ruthlessness
were necessary parts of preparing for that

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.320
terrible war. Why do they refuse to do so?
Because that would lead them to the only logical

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.710
conclusion: that Palpatine was right."
