00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.358
- The five best luxury hotels
on the Las Vegas Strip.

00:00:03.358 --> 00:00:04.970
I'm Chris, this is Yellow Productions.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.387
I do travel guides that are fun,

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:07.545
informative, and entertaining.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.238
This is part of my series
of Las Vegas travel videos.

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:12.271
It's actually kind of a sequel to my video

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.414
on the five worst cheap
hotels on the Las Vegas strip.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.240
I thought I would do one
about what's great to stay

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.765
and not just the ones
that are awful to stay.

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:22.525
But if you wanna check
out some more of my videos

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:24.127
on Vegas, you'll find links in the

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:26.561
description below, or at
the end of this video.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.611
Las Vegas has a staggering number

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.585
and variety of hotels to choose from.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.186
You wanna stay in Venice, Italy?

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:33.019
They got that.

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.212
You wanna stay in Paris, France?

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:35.045
They got that.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.199
New York City, they've got that too.

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.165
But in this video, when
I'm talking about luxury,

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.257
none of these hotels are gonna be cheap.

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:44.635
The cheapest here probably starts at $200

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:47.134
on a good night and goes up from that.

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:48.886
And how did I pick the top five?

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:51.620
Well, based on Trip Advisor rankings,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.078
and also my own experiences
in a lot of these hotels.

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:57.722
Those two combined gives us the top five.

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.698
There will be a few honorable mentions

00:00:59.698 --> 00:01:01.391
before we get to number one, as well.

00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:02.452
We'll start with number five and

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:04.295
work our way down to number one.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.129
The fifth best luxury hotel on

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:07.640
the Las Vegas strip goes to the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.774
Four Seasons Hotel and the Delano Hotel.

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:12.609
Chris, I'm confused, why are two

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.618
hotels in the number five spot?

00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:16.019
Actually, you're gonna find I'm

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.543
gonna do this quite a bit in this list

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.136
because both of these hotels,

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:20.838
the Four Seasons and the Delano

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:23.452
are in the Mandalay Bay complex.

00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:27.272
The Mandalay Bay, that big gold
tower right there behind me.

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:29.007
Well, the Four Seasons, it's the

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.586
35th to the 39th floor of The Mandalay Bay

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:34.187
and then the Delano, it's a separate

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:36.353
tower next to the Mandalay Bay.

00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:38.953
Collectively, these two hotels get 8000

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.854
reviews on Trip Advisor
and people love them.

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.873
When you arrive at the Four Seasons valet

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.623
it feels hard to believe
this hotel can be in Vegas,

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:48.989
let alone connected to the Mandalay Bay.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:50.942
It's a gaming-free sanctuary,

00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:52.665
and it's the southern-most hotel

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:55.067
on the main part of the Las Vegas strip.

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:57.418
The Four Seasons hotel has it's own lobby,

00:01:57.418 --> 00:01:58.967
two of it's own restaurants,

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:01.721
Charlie Palmer Steak and the Veranda.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.562
It has it's own swimming pool,

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.903
it's own spa, basically it has a lot

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:07.347
of it's own things but it's connected

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:09.249
to the Mandalay Bay Casino and

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.279
all the things the
Mandalay Bay has to offer,

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.234
so if you also want to access the

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:15.758
big Mandalay Bay pool
you can do that as well.

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:17.266
The con for the Four Seasons,

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:21.701
it's 100% valet parking, which
is why I prefer the Delano,

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:24.839
which is that big tower on
the side of Mandalay Bay,

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.329
and what I like about the
Delano is it's directly

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.418
connected to the Mandalay
Bay's parking garage,

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:32.826
so you can park your car and it's a really

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:35.076
short walk to actually get into the hotel.

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:38.742
The Delano has 1,117 rooms, and it's for

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.188
guests or travelers that
want a quite retreat

00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:43.591
but still near Vegas hustle and bustle.

00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:45.222
The Delano is a prime pick.

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.230
At the Delano they've
tried to take elements

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.630
of the desert and incorporate
them into a breezy hotel

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.855
to make you feel like
you're right by the beach.

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:55.271
The views from the rooms are spectacular.

00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.415
The biggest cons of both of these hotels

00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:00.975
is the south location, they are really far

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:02.657
from everything else on the strip.

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.118
Though, there is a tram that'll take you

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.135
from the Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur,

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:09.344
and then you're kind
of close to the action.

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:11.085
The fourth best luxury hotel on the

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:13.405
Las Vegas strip is Caesar's Palace.

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:16.172
On Trip Advisor this has 14,000 reviews,

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:19.073
four and a half stars, Caesar's Palace.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.296
It is center-strip, it
doesn't get any more

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:22.925
center-strip than this, and I've been

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.575
to Ceasar's Palace, it has this great

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:26.682
Roman theme and it's one of the few

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:28.535
older hotels on this strip that

00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.395
has managed to actually
stay nice and luxurious.

00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:33.119
They've kept remodeling it, they've been

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.279
updating things, they've
been building new towers.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.954
I think some of the nicest rooms are

00:03:36.954 --> 00:03:39.215
in the Augustus and Octavius towers.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:41.182
They've got their own entrance off of

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:43.240
Flamingo road and so you don't have

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.531
to go through the casino to get in there.

00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:47.759
Caesar's Palace has lots
of high-end restaurants,

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.485
but if you want extra high-end, even more

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:51.775
high-end rooms, I don't know
if you can see the sign,

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:54.854
but in this building right
here is the Nobu Hotel.

00:03:54.854 --> 00:03:57.444
It's another one of these
hotel within a hotel

00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.521
kinds of things, a boutique hotel.

00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:02.474
But that's the highest end
part of Caesar's Palace.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.791
Caesar's Palace is also a
great place for shopping.

00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.675
They have a large shopping
mall known as the Forum Shops.

00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:11.675
It has 270 stores occupying
636,000 square feet,

00:04:13.144 --> 00:04:15.176
and in fact this shopping mall

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:17.345
is the highest grossing shopping mall

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:21.412
per square foot of any shopping
mall in the United States,

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:23.069
and if you don't wanna
shop, it's worth a visit

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.281
just to ride on the curved escalators.

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.670
You don't see those everyday.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.249
Next up, coming in at number three,

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.232
we've got the Bellagio Hotel.

00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:31.682
The Bellagio is a classic.

00:04:31.682 --> 00:04:35.435
15,000 reviews on Trip
Advisor, four and a half stars.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:38.485
What I love about the
Bellagio is it has a classic

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:41.503
Vegas feel, but not
classic and run down like

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:45.372
the downtown hotels, classic
and upscale at the same time.

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:48.990
It's on a huge property of 67 acres.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.408
It's got a big pool complex, and of course

00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:55.109
it's got the iconic fountain
show that's in front.

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:57.127
The Bellagio, truly amazing.

00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:59.803
One of the highlights of the
Bellagio is the conservatory,

00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:03.318
this little kind of greenhouse
section with the glass roof

00:05:03.318 --> 00:05:06.819
always has lots of neat
plants and displays and

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.178
it changes multiple times
throughout the year.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:11.771
So whether you're staying
at the Bellagio or not,

00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:13.889
you should definitely
check out the conservatory,

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.256
and there's a garden store next door

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:19.774
so you can pick up souvenirs
of the garden variety.

00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:21.259
For this particular display in the

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.257
conservatory they've got two swans.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.461
They're actually
animatronic and they move.

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.678
Each one is made of 10,000 feathers.

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.696
That tells you the detail
that goes into these exhibits.

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.161
The second best luxury
hotel on the Las Vegas strip

00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.954
is the Wynn and the Encore.

00:05:36.954 --> 00:05:40.065
Collectively, these two
hotels have 35,000 reviews

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:42.950
on Trip Advisor, four and a half stars.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.534
The Wynn opened in 2005.

00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:47.001
Between the two of the hotels,

00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:51.120
they have about 4,700 rooms,
and what makes the Wynn

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.321
just amazing is how they've kind of taken

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:56.838
floral and plants and put them everywhere.

00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:58.346
I mean, when you walk in to the Wynn

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.365
it feels like you've stepped off the strip

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.058
into an alternate floral universe.

00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:04.891
It is a great place to get away

00:06:04.891 --> 00:06:07.660
from the hustle and bustle
of the Las Vegas strip.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.611
It feels very relaxed inside the Wynn.

00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.701
It also probably helps that
the Wynn is one of the largest

00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.580
grounds of the Las Vegas
hotels, it is on 215 acres.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.580
It has it's own golf course
that's part of the property.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.699
The rooms at the Wynn
start at 600 square feet,

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.283
and they are also described as very red.

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.083
The Wynn is also home to one of Las Vegas'

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:32.827
premier pool clubs, the Encore Beach Club.

00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:37.121
If you are a pool club goer,
you will like the Encore.

00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:39.038
The biggest con about
the Wynn and the Encore

00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:41.886
is it's location, it's not
quite the center of the strip.

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:44.379
It's sort of on the
northern part of the strip.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.408
It's across form the Fashion
Show mall right there,

00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:51.926
and directly next to the
Venetian and the Palazzo,

00:06:51.926 --> 00:06:53.860
but going north from here there's

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.225
pretty much nothing right now.

00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:57.161
There's new hotels under construction,

00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:59.111
but they've been under
construction for a long time,

00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:02.080
and it's a long haul to
like the Circus Circus and

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.798
then the Stratosphere which
are the next hotels that way.

00:07:04.798 --> 00:07:05.935
But before I get to number one,

00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.563
just a few honorable mentions
that I couldn't leave out.

00:07:08.563 --> 00:07:10.238
The first honorable mention are

00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:12.497
the Sky Suites atop the Aria Hotel.

00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:16.383
There's 442 rooms at the
top of this hotel, the Aria,

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:19.467
that are their ultra
premium, super luxury rooms.

00:07:19.467 --> 00:07:23.286
They start at $700 and go up to $7000.

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:25.608
The smallest room is 1,000 square feet,

00:07:25.608 --> 00:07:27.520
going up to 7,000 square feet.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.805
These rooms are bigger than my house.

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:31.155
If you've got the cash and that

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:32.556
doesn't seem like too much money,

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:34.307
then definitely consider the Aria.

00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:37.374
It has a great location,
center-strip, and great views

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.557
from the Sky Suites
all the way at the top.

00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:41.376
The second honorable mention
goes to another hotel

00:07:41.376 --> 00:07:43.068
in the same city-center complex.

00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:44.777
This one is the Mandarin Oriental.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:46.836
Tucked away down there at the bottom

00:07:46.836 --> 00:07:51.046
you can see there's the
little hotel logo right there,

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:55.981
it's that fan, and it's this
tall building right here,

00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:57.966
but the Mandarin Oriental
is famous for having

00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:00.666
excellent service, some of
the best service in Las Vegas,

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:03.575
there's also no casino
at all so you can go in

00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:04.885
and get to your room pretty quick,

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.193
don't have to deal with slot machines,

00:08:06.193 --> 00:08:08.470
dealers, cigarette smoke, all that stuff.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.237
The only reason it
didn't make the top five

00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:13.896
is it's becoming a Waldorf
Astoria in a month or two

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.970
and so I'm not sure how it's gonna change

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.107
with the change to a different chain,

00:08:18.107 --> 00:08:20.774
but it's worth considering,
Waldorf Astoria might continue

00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:23.075
the great tradition of
the Mandarin Oriental.

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:26.210
The third honorable mention
goes to the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.844
This one right here, it's
also located pretty much

00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:31.727
center-strip, just right next
to the city center complex.

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:33.702
It is currently the only Marriott

00:08:33.702 --> 00:08:36.147
affiliated hotel on the strip.

00:08:36.147 --> 00:08:39.197
The Cosmopolitan caters to
the younger demographic.

00:08:39.197 --> 00:08:41.716
It's known for having some
of the best restaurants

00:08:41.716 --> 00:08:44.667
in the city, though on
the trendy, younger side,

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:47.974
and many of the rooms
actually have balconies, too.

00:08:47.974 --> 00:08:50.667
A lot of Vegas hotels
don't have balconies,

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:53.759
so if you want a balcony,
consider the Cosmopolitan.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:56.555
One final honorable mention
before we get on to number one,

00:08:56.555 --> 00:08:58.603
and this one's at the MGM Grand.

00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:01.612
If the Sky Suites at the
Aria were not high-end enough

00:09:01.612 --> 00:09:04.831
for you, check out the Sky
Lofts at the MGM Grand.

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.598
It's about 50 boutique
suites that they have.

00:09:07.598 --> 00:09:09.709
They're dual-level lofts to be made

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:11.660
to feel like a Manhattan loft.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.027
These rooms start at $1,000 a night.

00:09:15.027 --> 00:09:18.278
The smallest room is 1400 square feet,

00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:21.094
and each one of them at the MGM Sky Lofts

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.247
comes with a private butler.

00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.774
And now the number one best luxury hotel

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.983
on the Las Vegas strip, drum-roll please.

00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:30.260
Well, you've probably already guessed it

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.579
'cause you've got the theme which is,

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:32.909
I always stand in front of it,

00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:35.533
but it's the Venetian and the Palazzo.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:39.037
These two hotels, connected
together form the world's

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:43.356
second largest hotel complex,
with over 7000 rooms.

00:09:43.356 --> 00:09:45.463
These two hotels together on Trip Advisor

00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:49.297
have 45,000 reviews,
four and a half stars.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:52.326
The Venetian originally opened in 1999.

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:54.743
The Palazzo opened later, but together

00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:57.627
they have this great
theme of Venice, Italy.

00:09:57.627 --> 00:09:59.946
They've got canals, they've got gondolas,

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:03.747
they've got a great recreation
of St Mark's square.

00:10:03.747 --> 00:10:06.614
I mean, I just love the
theme of this hotel.

00:10:06.614 --> 00:10:09.921
It is also the world's
second largest casino,

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:12.256
in addition to being the
second largest hotel.

00:10:12.256 --> 00:10:14.441
The only casino larger than this one,

00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:17.608
it's the Venetian in Macao, in China.

00:10:17.608 --> 00:10:21.969
The rooms here, they
range from $179 a night

00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:24.505
in the low season, up to $10,000.

00:10:24.505 --> 00:10:27.206
But what I like about
the rooms in the Venetian

00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:29.330
is that they're basically all suites.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.297
They have a living room and a bedroom.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.375
Big rooms, the standard rooms at

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.342
the Venetian start at 650 square feet.

00:10:36.342 --> 00:10:38.719
They're among the largest on the strip.

00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:41.027
They have floor to ceiling
windows, a king size,

00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:43.843
pillow top bed dressed in
Egyptian cotton sheets.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.747
The most memorable
thing about the Venetian

00:10:45.747 --> 00:10:47.947
is it's huge array of restaurants.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:49.815
You can find everything inside.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.265
There's even more restaurants at

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:53.098
the Venetian than at the Caesar's Palace.

00:10:53.098 --> 00:10:56.467
It feels like an entire
city, inside of a hotel.

00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:58.667
It's great for people
who wanna go to Vegas

00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:00.802
and plant themselves in one place.

00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:03.186
And if you like nightclubs it's home

00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:06.194
to the Tao nightclub,
which is a Asian themed

00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:09.322
nightclub and it's one
of Vegas' most popular.

00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:11.322
The Palazzo is the extravagant,

00:11:11.322 --> 00:11:13.357
younger sibling of the Venetian.

00:11:13.357 --> 00:11:15.490
The rooms at the Palazzo are a bit bigger,

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.641
and they start at 720 square feet,

00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:20.433
and it's based on the same kind of

00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:22.518
renaissance, Italian aesthetic.

00:11:22.518 --> 00:11:24.945
The Palazzo is a little bit more modern,

00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:27.646
but it's still reminiscent
of classic Italy.

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.412
And I also like that you can get

00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:31.597
from their parking garage to your room

00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:33.847
without having to go through a casino.

00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:35.551
Oh, and did I mention the themeing.

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:39.118
I love the whole of Venice,
Italy, shopping area.

00:11:39.118 --> 00:11:41.732
I mean, it's a little
bit cheesy, but frankly

00:11:41.732 --> 00:11:44.219
I think it's the best well-done theme

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:46.612
of any of the Las Vegas hotels.

00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:48.121
Well, there you have it, the best

00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:50.412
luxury hotels on the Las Vegas strip.

00:11:50.412 --> 00:11:52.490
