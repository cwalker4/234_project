00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi, it’s me, Tim Dodd, the Everyday Astronaut!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.050
What rocket has 9 engines on its first stage,
is built by a privately owned aerospace company,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.780
uses the most advanced manufacturing techniques
available, is one of the cheapest rides to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.279
space and has a body that’s almost entirely
made out of carbon fiber?

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.939
If you said SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket you’d
be wrong! (its body made out of aluminum)

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.419
Move over SpaceX, there’s a new kid on
the block!

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.529
Well, maybe don't move over, but pull up a chair
to the orbital class rocket table!

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.550
That’s right, Rocket Lab has officially
become the second privately owned rocket company

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.510
to achieve orbit with their beautiful Electron
rocket.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.650
Today we’re going to give you a deep run
down on some of the exciting features about

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.780
the Electron, then we’re going to compare
it to similar rockets including other upcoming

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.130
small sat rockets, and past small sat rockets
like SpaceX’s Falcon 1.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.590
We’re even going to throw in a Falcon 9
for comparison to see which rocket takes the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.020
cake for the cheapest ride to space with a
cost per kilogram comparison.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.620
Oh, and I mean it when I say cake, I had this
made for the winner.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.100
Let’s get started!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.840
On January 21st, 2018, Rocket Lab officially
became the second private company to make

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.249
it into orbit on private funds, and the first
private company to launch something into orbit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.189
from a private launch site, launching their
Electron rocket from their gorgeous launch

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.289
pad located on the north island of New Zealand
on the Mahia Peninsula.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.869
The mission was cheekily named “still testing”,
a fun follow up to their first test flight

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.829
of the electron called “It’s a test”
and their upcoming launch will be called

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:52.829
“It’s Business time.”

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.829
I love that.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.219
Not only was the mission a perfect success
on just their second attempt at an orbital

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.039
flight, but they even stowed away and tested
a secret kick stage that allows for flexibility

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.590
in satellite deployment.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.969
It all went off perfectly and is incredibly
impressive!

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.130
And to top it ALL OFF, Rocket Lab went even
one step further and included ANOTHER secret

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.360
item inside the payload fairing, a little
treat for all of us humans down here on Earth

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.140
called Humanity Star.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.970
Ok, so they basically launched a disco ball
that would be highly reflective and due to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.080
its spin would create a beautiful blinking shooting
star when viewed under the right conditions

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.080
here on Earth.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.760
Unfortunately it’ll only stay in orbit for
a couple months after it launched, so by the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.530
time you’re watching this, it’ll probably
be too late to see it.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.800
Actually as I'm editing this, I just found
out it deorbited today, Thursday, March 22nd, 2018.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.980
Rest in pieces Humanity Star.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.060
The company is already full of fun, young
and fresh aerospace culture, again,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
akin to SpaceX.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.920
For instance they made T-Shirts from this
quote -

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.960
"As in do you want to hold at t minus 18 or
20?"

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.720
"I never want to hold again"

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.900
Ok, now before we get into the awesome Electron
rocket that completed this exciting feat,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.750
let’s do a quick summary on who Rocket Lab
is.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.510
Rocket Lab is a United States aerospace manufacturer
who’s funded entirely by private investment

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.510
from backers.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.650
Their CEO and CTO, Peter Beck, founded the
company in 2006.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.040
A fellow New Zealander named, uh, Mark….

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.180
Mark…

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.120
Rocket...

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.600
No seriously.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.660
Mark Rocket was a seed investor and co-director
from 2007 until 2011.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.710
What a fitting name.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.650
Rocket Lab’s goal is to provide a dedicated
launch vehicle for the growing small satellite

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.230
and cubesat market.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.290
Typically, smaller satellites have to hitch
a ride on a bigger rocket and they take a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.930
back seat in priority as well.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
A good example of a secondary smallsat payload
getting the short end of the stick is SpaceX’s

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.410
fourth Falcon 9 mission, CRS-1, which launched
in October of 2012.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.300
SpaceX launched their first contracted Dragon
Capsule stuffed with supplies to the International

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.940
Space Station, but they had a secondary payload
of an Orbcomm satellite that weighed only

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.090
172 kgs or 379 pounds.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.900
One of the 9 Merlin engines on the first stage
of the Falcon 9 failed on ascent, which resulted

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.040
in the secondary payload failing to enter
its proper orbit and due to International

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.100
Space Station visiting vehicle safety rules,
SpaceX wasn’t allowed a chance to boost

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.590
the secondary payload into its proper orbit,
which resulted in its loss and reentry just

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.660
four days later.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.760
So Rocket Lab’s business case is to cater
to this market that previously hasn’t had

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.790
very good options other than ride sharing.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.872
Rocket Lab plans to launch around 50 times
a year and they say they're licensed to fly

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:39.790
every 72 hours which is 120 times a year,
making for great flexibility and opportunities

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.270
for these smaller payloads.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.530
With this increased launch cadence, Rocket
Lab also says they have an incredibly agile

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.850
approach to booking a flight.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.790
RocketLab can fulfill a launch in weeks rather
than months or YEARS for more traditional

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.530
aerospace companies...

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.600
Now we’re talking!

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.490
Speaking of flexibility, they can also launch
their Electron rocket from Cape Canaveral

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.980
in Florida, or the Pacific Spaceport complex
in Alaska if the customer would need those options.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.400
So you might be asking, what the heck has
Rocket Lab been up to since their founding in 2006???

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.240
Well, in 2009 Rocket lab became for the first
private company in the Southern Hemisphere

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.550
to reach space with their Atea-1 sounding
rocket.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.340
This thing was tiny, basically a giant hobby
store model rocket only capable of launching

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.419
2kgs or 4.4 pounds into space on a quick suborbital
hop…

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.630
After just one launch, Rocket Lab decided
to move onto the next thing.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.931
The rocket that followed is the Electron,
and it is awesome.

00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:37.950
Here’s a quick rundown.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.490
The Electron is a 2 stage orbital rocket which
uses RP-1 fuel and Liquid Oxygen for its propellant,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.740
which is very common among rockets such as
Russia’s Soyuz rocket, the Saturn V, SpaceX’s

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.620
Falcon 9, ULA’s Atlas V, the first stage
of Orbital ATK’s Antares and many, many more.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.340
The Electron uses 9 Rutherford engines on
the first stage, and one vacuum optimized

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.930
Rutherford engine on the upper stage.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.550
This is the same configuration as SpaceX who
uses 9 of their Merlin engines on the first

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.790
stage, and one vacuum-optimized Merlin engine
on the upper stage of their Falcon 9 rocket.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.210
The Rutherford is an awesome little engine.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.490
Instead of using gas generator turbo pumps
which burn fuel and oxidizer to pressure feed

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.380
the combustion chambers like virtually all
other rocket engines ever, the Rutherford

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.680
uses electric motors to spin the pumps.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.530
This has a few cool advantages, one, it’s
awesome.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.530
RIGHT?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.389
It’s like a hybrid rocket engine!

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.820
And I’m thinking less Toyota Prius, more
La Ferrari on the cool hybrid scale.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.000
Two, the engines are easy to start up and
throttle, replacing hardware with software.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440
I love that.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.430
And three, Rocket Lab claims they reduce mass
compared to a more traditional gas generator.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.580
The next point might sound good, but it might
not be very good the more you think about it.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.940
Instead of burning rocket fuel to power the
pumps, it just uses batteries!

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.449
That’s great, right?

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.770
No need to waste fuel spinning the pumps!

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.580
Well, there’s actually some disadvantages
here.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.560
For one, electric batteries, despite great
improvements lately in density and power output,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.900
are still WAY behind the energy density of
rocket fuel.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.150
That means in order to get the same amount
of energy from a pack of a lithium polymer

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.460
batteries, it would weigh more than just having
that amount of extra fuel on board.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.320
The other problem is when a battery is discharged,
it still weighs the same amount, and therefore

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.150
it's just dead weight once it’s been expended.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.370
Unlike propellant, which when in the process
of being used up by those gas generators is

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.229
literally thrown out the back of the rocket,
thereby making the rocket continually lighter

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.880
and that means there's less mass for the engines
to have to push around.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.350
Ah but here’s a cool caveat.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.990
Rocket Lab came up with a wonderful solution
to this problem to help offset that downfall.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.979
On the upper stage of the Electron, there
are a few banks of batteries that detach when

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.320
they’re depleted.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.820
Freeing up the dead weight!

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.820
Brilliant!

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.460
The Rutherford engine is also almost entirely
3D printed using an electron beam melting

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.240
process to save time and money.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.479
They can print a rocket engine in just 24
hours.

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.410
The cool tech doesn't end there!

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.160
The main body of the rocket and the fuel tanks
are made out of an advanced carbon composite material.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:15.000
This is very hard considering how cold liquid
oxygen is and how it tends to not play nicely

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.669
with carbon fiber.

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:20.980
But it’s lightweight and strong and helps
make the Electron very mass efficient.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.440
Rocket Lab also takes another page from SpaceX’s
playbook by making their own flight computers

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.639
in house.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:31.140
This allows them to make highly customizable,
small and common avionics hardware.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.960
Lastly, we learned that not only did the Electron
perform perfectly as planned, it actually

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.110
exceeded public expectations by testing out
a kick stage on their successful mission which

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.360
Rocket Lab later announced was a complete
success.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.260
Their kick stage consists of a small 3D printed
engine called the Curie, which produces a modest

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.540
120 Newtons or about 27 pounds of thrust and
runs on a “green” mono prop fuel.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.110
What’s a kick stage?

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.330
A kick stage is like a mini upper stage.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.480
It’s normal for rockets to deploy their
payloads into an elliptical orbit, meaning

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.700
the orbit looks like an oval instead of a
circle.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.710
The spacecraft then normally has to circularize
itself using its own onboard thrusters which

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.610
are often very underpowered, time consuming
and can detract from the lifespan of the mission.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.740
So a kick stage simply does one final burn
at the highest point of the orbit to put the

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.360
payload into a final circular orbit, leading
to a lot of flexibility, and increasing the

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.960
options of where the Electron can deliver
the payload.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.180
BONUS STAGE!

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.960
It can also help deliver multiple payloads
to multiple destinations.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.250
And as if ALL of this wasn’t enough, Rocket
Lab even makes their own cubesat dispensers

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.250
in house!

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.180
It’s called Maxwell, and it’s quite beautiful.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.180
Are you excited yet?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.360
Well, I think it’s time to do a side by
side comparison of the Electron vs some other

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.600
smallsat launchers past, present and future.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.760
So to start off the comparison, let’s talk
about some competition.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.740
Beginning with maybe the Electron’s most
direct competitor, the Vector-R made by a

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.450
US company called Vector Space Systems.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.940
The Vector-R is in the testing phase and has
only launched a pair of test flights.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.330
The Vector-R has yet to attempt an orbital
flight, but hopes to attempt one mid 2018

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.950
from their launch pad in Virginia known as
MARS Pad 0B.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.750
Next we have Orbital ATK’s air-launched
Pegasus launch system.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.690
That’s right, air launched baby!

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.260
This is a rocket that’s carried up to 12
km’s or 40,000 ft by an L-1011 jet where

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.300
it’s then released and shoots off into orbit.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.220
It was first launched in 1990 and is still
in operation today.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.740
Next we have another air-launched concept
rocket called the Bloostar by a Spanish Company

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.360
Zero to Infinity.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.339
This is one of my favorite future smallsat
launch vehicles.

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:50.940
It's a rocket that’s a donut, with another
donut inside and then a muffin inside that

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.940
that's carried up to above 99% of the atmosphere
to 30 km’s or 19 miles in altitude by a

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.790
large high altitude balloon where it’s then
released and shoots off into orbit.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.040
I’ll do a video in the future about air-launched
vehicles, because I think they’re super

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.950
cool and it’s a question a lot of people
ask often, “why don't they just launch a

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.060
rocket from a balloon or jet?”...

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.150
So stay tuned, or if you’re watching this
in the future and I’ve already shot it,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.200
it’ll appear here in a YouTube card.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.960
And last we have a former smallsat rocket,
the Falcon 1.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.089
The Falcon 1 was SpaceX’s first rocket.

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:27.670
It was the first rocket to reach orbit by
a private company on its fourth launch attempt

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.110
in 2008.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.300
It only launched one more time in 2009 before
Spacex moved on to its big brother, the Falcon 9.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.899
So first let’s line up these rockets in
a side by side in length comparison.

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:44.191
The Electron stands at 17 meters long, compared
to the Vector-R at 12 meters, the bloostar

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.170
which is around 3 meters, the pegasus which
is 16.9 meters and the Falcon 1 which was

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.780
21 meters tall.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.580
Next let’s check out their width.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.740
The Electron is 1.2 meters wide same as the
Vector-R, the Bloostar is just over 2 meters

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.480
wide, the pegasus 1.3 meters, and the Falcon
1 which was 1.7 meters wide.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.180
So how heavy of a payload can each system
deliver to Low Earth Orbit?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:16.420
The Electron can launch 225 KG, the Vector-R
50 KG, the Bloostar, 75 KG, the Pegasus 443

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.340
KG and the Falcon 1 670 KG.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.940
So now for the big, or hopefully small question,
price.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:31.730
The Electron is $5 million, the Vector-R $1.5
million, the Bloostar $2.5 million, the Pegasus

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.459
$40 million and the Falcon 1 would cost around
$7.5 million in today’s money.

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:39.050
Now for the fun part.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.430
$ per KG.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:50.350
The Electron costs $22,222 per KG, the Vector-R
$30,000 per KG, the Bloostar $25,000 per KG,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:57.690
the Pegasus $90,000 per KG and the Falcon
1 would be $11,194 per KG.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.620
Let's see those in order of $ per KG ratio.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.050
Some notes about these numbers.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.200
Number one, of all these options, only the
Electron and Pegasus are CURRENTLY available.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.560
I expect Bloostar and Vector-R to be available
to customers here soon, but if you want to

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.300
book a dedicated launch vehicle today for
your smallsat, it really does look like the

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.390
Electron is a fantastic option.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:25.670
Also, don’t take my cost per KG as stone
cold fact because it was nearly impossible

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:31.870
to find quotes to compare the exact same orbital
parameters, so these are just decent estimates.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.779
Earlier, we compared the Electron to SpaceX’s
Falcon 9 rocket due to their similar engine

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:37.870
configurations.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.980
So just for funsies, let’s just put these
two vehicles side by side to compare them,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.820
shall we?

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.100
Woah.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.839
The Falcon 9 is huge!

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:53.579
Standing at 70 meters or 230 feet tall, it
is a significantly larger vehicle than the

00:13:53.579 --> 00:13:57.000
Electron which is at 17 meters or 56 feet
tall.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.860
The Falcon 9 is also just over 3 times wider
at 3.66 meters or 12 feet wide to the Electron’s

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.970
1.2 meters or 4 feet wide.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.899
Now here’s where things get kind of silly.

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:13.589
The Falcon 9 is capable of putting 22,800
kgs to Low Earth Orbit compared to the Electron's

00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:15.650
225 kgs.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.110
The Falcon 9’s launch cost is $62 million
to the Electrons $5 million.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.290
So lastly, we get their dollar per KG ratio.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.390
Remember, the Electron had an impressive $22,222
per KG to low Earth orbit.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:37.490
But… that’s nothing compared to the Falcon
9 which has a ridiculous $2,719 per KG and

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.790
that’s without factoring in SpaceX’s future
price drops due to being able to use previously

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:47.080
flown launch vehicles which hopefully will
bring the the cost down another 30-50%.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.089
So I know this comparison isn’t fair and
it's not meant to put the Electron down, but

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:54.339
for now, SpaceX, you still get the cake.

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:57.200
Or what’s left of it…

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.050
BUT WE CAN’T END THERE.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.130
We’re excited about the Electron!!

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.339
It’s awesome!

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:07.529
It launches from the most beautiful place
in the world, it’s carbon fiber, it’s

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:11.310
got an awesome hybrid electric turbo pump
and 3D printed engines!!

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.970
I mean come on.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.380
So let’s end with what exciting things Electron
has in store.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.769
As we mentioned before, RocketLab’s third
mission will be called “Business Time”

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:24.040
and will be launching two Lemur-2 cubesats
for the company Spire Global.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.230
The fourth mission will feature a dozen cubesats
for NASA!

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.160
But one of the most exciting destinations
for an upcoming Electron mission is...

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.050
You're not going to believe this...

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.050
The MOON!!

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.050
That’s right!

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.279
The Electron is launching for Moon Express
which is a Florida based company whose goal

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.500
is to eventually mine the moon!

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.510
They were competing and the leading contender
to take home the Google Lunar X prize, a 20

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.520
million dollar top prize contest that ended
in March of 2018…

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.560
The award would have gone to the first privately
funded team to land a spacecraft on the moon,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.930
travel 500 meters and transmit back high-definition
video and images.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.990
Unfortunately, despite trying really hard,
Moon Express and Rocket Lab didn’t make

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.320
it by then, leaving the prize unclaimed.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.550
This will be a mission you absolutely cannot
miss.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.660
It’s so cool to think that such a small
launch vehicle is capable of an awesome feat

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.990
like doing a moon mission.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.360
While we’re talking about the future, let's
talk about the future plans of Electron.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.130
I reached out to Rocketlab and asked them
about reusability and any future plans for

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.320
upgrades or larger launch vehicles.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.769
Here’s their response:

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:32.340
“Currently, Rocket Lab are focusing on ramping
up production to enable unprecedented launch

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.160
frequencies and to service the numerous customers
on our launch manifest.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.100
Electron was designed from the beginning to
be quick, efficient and low-cost to produce.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.510
This path was chosen over pursuing reusability
due to the added research and development

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.360
time needed, and the importance of wanting
to open up access to space as soon as possible

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.230
for our customers who (until Sunday) had no
dedicated, affordable orbital launcher.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:02.420
The added mass associated with booster reusability
also impacts the payload capability of small

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.929
launch vehicles more than larger launchers,
so there are no current plans to pursue reusability

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:08.929
in the future.”

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:09.929
I get it.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:14.360
They have such a small payload capability
now, adding hardware for reusability would

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.589
just cut into that already limited payload
mass.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.530
And although I agree, they should ramp up
production and get to making some money, I

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.000
hope that someday they make enough money to
start looking towards bigger and reusable

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.209
launch vehicles.

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:31.730
Besides, their electronic turbo pumps would
make for a very precise, highly controllable

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.840
throttled rocket engine for propulsive landings.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.170
Woah that was a mouth full.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:42.230
Let’s try that again a little simpler Their
engine that has that electric motor would

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.010
be good at landing a rocket because it is
precise and quick to react to stuff.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.010
There.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.010
Much better.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.730
So all in all Rocket Lab is the new cool kid
on the block in the orbital rocket game.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.260
They’ve got an exciting future and are doing
an excellent job of bringing everyone along

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260
for the ride.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.850
I look forward to seeing much much more from
them!

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.560
What do you think about Rocket Lab?

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.890
