00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.110
I'd like to stick garden gnomes in this building

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.330
Yeah, I guess you would

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.850
Hi, death will find you soon

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.070
I'm not sure you'll be remembered

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.480
You're the devil

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.570
That little boy has like a thousand freckles

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.260
And everybody's all "ewwwww"

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.500
Like there's goobers on his bod

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.380
I'm done listening

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.900
You know, Ted's always kinda freaky

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.090
He eats hair

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.720
Human hair

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.890
He's the first one to say "Let's go out and eat hair!"

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190
It's wonderful now and again

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.100
See?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.750
Mmmm, hair, mmmm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
If there's one thing our country doesn't need more of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.320
It's goose diarrhea!

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.260
I heard you got orange rugs here

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.780
That's a lie

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.500
Hey could you cut me a rug here?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.710
A rug?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.560
Yeah. An orange one

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.020
No, we don't make them

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.520
I know

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.040
This one's a classic

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.470
Jordan the centipede taught me a card trick

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130
Mmm hmm mmmm

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.690
Thank you

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.440
You got happy cheer!

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.600
Ewwww, look!

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.230
I went down to the summer camp and took a can of gasoline

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.890
Don't light the cabins on fire

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.090
I wish I couldn't, but it's too late

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.560
Ah, well doesn't that mean you go to jail?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.740
No, because I ran away

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.420
You know what, I just love to twerk

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.280
holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.030
I've been testing out some new campaign slogans that are a little less obvious

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.940
I need a bogel for the glotch

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.200
Stop Volution

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.980
Your face isn't my face

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.780
That old man just took your spork

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.930
If you want boyfriend time, then you must be a girlfriend

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.980
I hate pervy records

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.910
Mhhaaah pfrengh! 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.170
Hmm, i wanna use that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.690
I made a hole and then barfed on the beach

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.870
I made a hole and then barfed on the beach

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.210
I made a hole and then barfed on the beach

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.690
This great nation's like a pork pie

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300
Juicy America!

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.460
Gabe?!

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.080
Hey, who hates cigarettes?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.880
I do!

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.440
Hooray for you!

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.980
You know, originally Heidi wanted to marry a different fella

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.170
She wanted Herbert Spinnecki

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.040
Yeah, he was into football

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.520
Herbert was beautiful

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.180
He was just always very open and sensuous with me, you know?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.850
Like on the weekend, he'd bring fruit and lay by the fire with me

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.150
and tell me I looked like a French model

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.190
What?! 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.090
Why'd you even tell them that?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.950
Yeah, he's still a really close friend, the Spinnecki

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.050
I didn't know that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.580
Mm-hhhm

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.800
He's in the kitchen right now

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.100
Wait, he's here?!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.070
Mm-hhhm

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.930
Is he

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.100
Mmm-hhmm

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.720
What does this mean?

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.540
Yeah, whatever

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.340
At least I know she's mine

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.390
I don't wanna ask who the baby daddy

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.090
I know it's him.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.050
Don't make us kiss now
