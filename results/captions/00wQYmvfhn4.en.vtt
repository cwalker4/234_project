00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.772
I would like to talk to you
about business.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.606
The thing that everyone
on<i> Shark Tank</i>

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.442
<i> thinks they have
 a great idea for,</i>

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.609
<i> even this guy.</i>

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.312
Our cakes...
are made of foam,

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.581
and they're rentals.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:16.849
-Wait!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.885
So, I can neither have my cake,
nor eat it too?

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.755
I am in,
here is a million dollars.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:23.956
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.624
Small start-up businesses
like that

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.360
hold a special place
in America's heart

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.762
and politicians from across
the political spectrum

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.998
love to talk
about how important they are.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.167 line:0%
Small business is the backbone
of the American economy.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:37.203 line:0%
Small businesses
are the backbone

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.938 line:0%
of this nation's economy.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.207
BOTH: Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.842
BOTH: Small businesses are
the backbone--

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.211
ALL: Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.346
ALL: Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.083
ALL: Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.851
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-It's true.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.854
"Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy"

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.590
is that rare thing that
every politician agrees on.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.525
It's that,
support the troops,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.728
-Ted Cruz can go fuck himself...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.430
...and South Dakota senator
John Thune can get it,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.167
-he can get it!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.635
Now, look, it can feel like
we're in a golden age

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.904
of small business start-ups, but
that isn't actually the case.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.839
The rate at which new businesses
are been created

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.341
has actually being
steadily falling

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.543
since the 1970s.
And I would argue that

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.012
one of the reasons for that,
is that big businesses,

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:21.447
have been getting even bigger,

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.716
which brings us
to our main topic tonight,

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.217
"Corporate Consolidation."

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.786
Recent years, have seen

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.188
record highs
for mergers and acquisitions.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.856
As you would know,
if you've ever watched

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:33.560
the thrilled reactions they get
on business news.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.196 line:0%

continues to be hot.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.098 line:0%

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.139 line:0%
It is shaping up to be another
"Merger Monday."

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.273 line:0%
They don't call it
"Merger Monday" for nothing.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.042 line:0%
-Media mega "Merger Monday."
-"Merger Monday."

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:51.177 line:0%
M-- M-- M...

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.512 line:0%

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.220
Okay, that was obviously
a little nauseating, but also,

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.123
pressing a button on TV
is a little bit dangerous

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.125
because someone could take
that footage

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.461
and then loop any sound
that they want under there.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.497
Now, obviously I'm not immature
enough to do that

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.400
but if I were
it would look like this.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.035 line:0%

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.147
The point is--

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:31.116
This point is, all this
merger activity

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:33.752
has all made some sectors
of our economy

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.855
ridiculously consolidated.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.935
Yeah, we down to just four
major airline choices,

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:52.705
and no that does not include
jetBlue because that

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.073
is not actually an airline.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.243
It's just a very expensive way
to eat those weird blue chips...

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.178
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...which are, and this is true

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.780
-just sliced Grover arms.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.116
Look, and airlines here are
just the beginning.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.418
The rental car business

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.554
is now 90 percent dominated
by just three companies.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.892
The U.S. beer industry
is 70 percent controlled
by just two companies,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.661
and online search engines are
of course as we all know

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.198
dominated by one major player.
That's right say it with me,

-Bing.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:24.436
That's right. Bing, the best way
to Google something.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.407
In fact, look,
full disclosure here.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.541
Even our own parent company,
Time Warner

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:31.844
is currently trying to merge
with AT&amp;T,

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:35.414
which makes this story
a little dangerous for us to do.

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:37.417
Although you know,
that is presuming

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.985
that AT&amp;T executives manage
to get there shitty service

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.554
working long enough to see it.

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-AT&amp;T,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.925
it's the top
telecom company around

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.360
alphabetically and nothing else.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.130
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-Look, even some brands,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.965
that you might think
of as indie

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.435
now have multinational owners.
Burt's Bees?

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.171
It's-- it's not run

-called Burt.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.307

Tom's of Maine,
the deodorant

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.178
which did so little to deodorize
your freshmen year roommate.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.515
That's not owned
by Colgate-Palmolive.

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.617
And then there was Goose Island.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.086

<i> -hops on their faces.</i>

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.590
But what they don't mention

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.259
is that Goose Island
is owned by Anheuser-Busch,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.894
and that farm that you just saw

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:25.064
is located at
822 Budweiser Loop.

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:29.001
It's presumably just passed
Bud Light lime-a-rita boulevard.

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.038
Basically, if you see the mass
grave of Clydesdale horses,

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.305
turn left and you're there.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:35.441
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And it says something

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.677
about the rapid rate of mergers
that even Jim Cramer,

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.780
occasionally
finds himself in disbelief

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.114
at one happening.

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:45.251

in the aluminum can industry.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.755 line:0%
Ball Corp's acquisition of Rexam

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.323 line:0%
is taking the number
of competitors

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.824 line:0%
in this space down to,

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:56.128 line:0%
-from three to two.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:58.130 line:0%
How did they let that happen?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.432
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.968
It's not great when
a business casual Louis C.K.

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:04.470
with a sound effects board

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.940
is saying, "Holy shit
this was a really bad idea."

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.041
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But,

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.743
but
"how did they let that happen?"

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.378
Is actually
a really good question.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.148
And the answer is interesting,
because we've had

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.883
anti-trust laws on the books
for more than a century.

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:21.119
And I'm not saying that
every single merger is bad.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.723
Sometimes businesses
getting bigger can lead

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.458
to greater efficiencies
and improvements.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.626
The tension is between
allowing that

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.996
and preventing them
from doing real harm.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.363
So it's a-- it's a balance.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:34.032
But since the late 1970s,
that balance

00:05:34.132 --> 00:05:37.336
has tipped decidedly in favor
of being merger friendly,

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:38.937
which has led
to real problems.

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:40.473
And let's start
with the obvious,

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.542
for workers, mergers can
often mean big layoffs,

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:45.945
but it's not just employees
that can suffer,

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.881
consumers can too,
as Jim Cramer explained,

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.716
in that aluminum can segment

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:53.319
in an inexplicably
sarcastic tone of voice.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.022 line:0%
I always say competition,
while great for you, a consumer,

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.624 line:0%
is it enough amount of profits.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.226 line:0%
Sometimes a business would be
a total monopoly

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:04.263 line:0%
with no competition whatsoever,
and while that's the ideal,

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.031 line:0%
it's very rare to see
a genuine monopoly,

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.234 line:0%
-because of course,
it's against the law.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:11.270 line:0%
Which brings us to the next
best thing, an oligopoly,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.106 line:0%
where a handful of companies
control an entire industry,

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.741 line:0%
co-existing peacefully

00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:17.944 line:0%
without much in the way
of price competition.

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:20.679
-That's a weird tone to use...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.015
...to describe something
that's clearly awful.

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:27.486
It's rare to see genuine
bestiality because of course
it's against the law.

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.455
Which brings us to the next
best thing,

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.390
having sex
with the stuffed animal

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.259

of a real horse.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.463
And-- And for sense of what
it can look like

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:41.167
when a handful of companies
co-exist peacefully

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:42.969
without much in the way
of price competition,

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.470
just look at airlines.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.273
In 2012, one airline executive
told an industry conference,

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.476
Consolidation has allowed us
to do things like

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.578
ancillary revenues,
which is jargon

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:55.581
for all those fees
that drive you fucking crazy!

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.816
Now, American was the first
major airline

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.786
to charge you for your
first checked bag back in 2008,

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.522
and back then people
could not believe it.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.258
NEWSCASTER:<i> American Airlines
 will soon charge $15</i>

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:08.293
<i> for the first checked bag.</i>

00:07:08.493 --> 00:07:10.763
<i> That on top of a fee

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:20.472
Yes!

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:23.275
First, that is clearly
a delightful man.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.011
Although, it does makes you
wonder whether he

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.014
fills his bags full of underwear
and nothing else.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.017

-But-- But within months,

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.621
and it was essentially
industry standard.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.456
And it is easy
for that to happen

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:39.525
when there's only a handful
of big players.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.895
In fact since then they have
added and increased bag fees

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.565
multiple times,
often moving in tandem,

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.767
which is how those fees have
gone generating around

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:50.502
540 million dollars a year
a decade ago,

00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:53.172
to 4.2 billion dollars now.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.741
And that is infuriating.
After all,

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.242
if I wanted exorbitant fees

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.778
that keep getting raised all
the time despite shitty service,

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.114
I'd become a customer of AT&amp;T.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:03.415
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:05.218
-Fuck you AT&amp;T!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.487
Even if you take over
you'll never be my real dad!

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.422
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:13.392
And, look, you-- you may
well be angry

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.061
with the service you get
from airlines

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.962
but thanks to consolidation,

00:08:17.062 --> 00:08:18.965
they don't really need
to give a shit

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.533
about what you think.

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.867
And if you don't believe me?

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:25.003
Remember that awful video that
went around earlier this year.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.140 line:0%
NEWSCASTER:<i> The shocking images
 of a passenger</i>

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.942 line:0%
<i> caught in a travel nightmare.</i>

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.345 line:0%
<i> A man visibly shaken

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:36.548 line:0%
<i>and then dragged of a United jet

00:08:36.648 --> 00:08:39.584 line:0%
<i> All after refusing
 to give up his seat.</i>

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.687
Yeah,
that's the most horrifying thing

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.388
you can possibly see
on an airplane,

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:46.292
unless your in-flight movie
is<i> The Boss Baby.</i>

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:49.127
A movie that combines
the unbearable smugness

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.996
of Alec Baldwin
with an unbearable smugness

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.665
-of a baby.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.533
Now, in the wake
of that incident,

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:56.535
people said
it was a PR nightmare

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:59.204
and there was talk on Twitter
of boycotting United.

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:03.309
The problem is on certain routes
they're the only option.

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.711
So, a boycott is gonna be
pretty hard to pull-off,

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.147
and that is arguably why
their CEO

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:11.083
was later able to open his
earnings call for that quarter,

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:13.719
by describing a period in which,
I will remind you,

00:09:13.952 --> 00:09:16.188
a passenger had his teeth
knocked out

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:18.557
on one of United's planes,
like this.

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:22.694 line:0%
OSCAR MUNOZ:<i> Welcome to
 a terrific second quarter,
 strong financial</i>

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:27.700 line:0%

<i>operational results. And as you

00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:32.672 line:0%
<i>I want to thanks them for their

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:36.842 line:0%
<i> We continue to find new

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.278 line:0%
<i> and make the more comfortable
 on our airline.</i>

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:40.680
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And you know what?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.549
Is it really any wonder that
their earnings stayed solid.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.118
United, is sometimes
the only way to get

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:47.253
to where you are going.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:48.954
Which actually explains
their new slogan,

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:52.524
"You wanna fuckin' roller blade
to Houston? Shut up and get in!"

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:53.859
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.529
And when and industry gets
too consolidated,

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.231
any company trying to compete
with them

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:02.734
or survive in their
supply chain, can get crushed.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.138
Now we all know about Amazon,
Walmart or Google,

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.574
but there are less
obvious examples of this too.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.344
Take eye-wear. Now if you go
into a Lens Crafters,

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.445
you'll see frames
by brands like um,

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:16.448
Prada, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Burberry
and Ralph Lauren.

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:17.849
All of which it turns out,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.519
are made by an Italian company
called Luxotica,

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:24.857
which incidentally also owns
Lens Crafters and Sunglass Hut

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.993
and Pearle Vision and runs
Target Optical,

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:31.663
and Sears Optical. So, what can
happen when a smaller company

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.666
goes up against them?
Well, just ask Oakley.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.702 line:0%
BRETT ARENDS:
<i> Oakley was a big competitor</i>

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.804 line:0%
and they had a fight
with Luxotica

00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:41.206 line:0%
and Luxotica basically said,

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:42.842 line:0%
we're dropping you
from our stores.

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:44.176 line:0%
-And--
-They refused

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.478 line:0%
-to sell their glasses...
-BRETT: Yeah.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.012 line:0%
-...in their store?
-It was a dispute about pricing,

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:49.215 line:0%
and they dropped Oakley
from the stores.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.950 line:0%
And Oakley's
stock price collapsed.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.786 line:0%
There were some issues between
the two companies

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.555 line:0%
in the beginning
of the 2000s, but...

00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:00.459 line:0%
both of them understood
that it was better to go along.

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:03.662 line:0%
We merged with Oakley in 2007.

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:05.197 line:0%
-You bought Oakley.
-So we're talking--

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.533 line:0%
They tried to compete
and they lost

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:08.834 line:0%
and then you bought them.

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:11.703 line:0%
I understand your theory, but...

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:14.840 line:0%
they understood that life
was better together.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.341
-Whoa!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:19.144
That is the menacing tone
of a Bond villain,

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:20.712
They understood that life was

00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:23.683
better together, Mr. Bond, no?

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.551
That is the first time

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.353
that I've ever felt sorry
for Oakley.

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.221
The official sunglasses
of guys who

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.624
un-ironically use
the term "finger blasting."

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:34.994
And-- I think
it's a sponsorship deal.

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:37.396
And-- And there is one
more victim of consolidation

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.697
that you may not think about,

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.833
and that
is the products themselves.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.035
Because
heavily consolidated industries

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.870
can lose the incentive
to innovate

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.807
and the best example of this
may be the cable box

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:50.643
beneath your TV.
If you have one of those,

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:51.910
you probably hate it.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.046
Because it's huge, it's glitchy,

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:55.981
and it's may be one
of the largest energy

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.716
consuming items in your house

00:11:57.816 --> 00:12:00.485
even when it's turned off.
But if you think about it,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:03.155
cable companies have no real
incentive to improve them.

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:05.590
They're essentially regional--
regional monopolies.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.059
And again, they know

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:09.461
that you basically
have no where else to go.

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:12.564
And you can't even smash your
cable box out of frustration,

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:14.933
because you're renting it
and they'll then charge you

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:17.303
hundreds of dollars
if you don't give it back.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.037
Which is why
we went through the trouble

00:12:19.137 --> 00:12:21.740
of blowing this one up for you.
Please take a look.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.974
There you go.

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:24.476
Pretty cathartic to watch,
right?

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.077
-I hope that helps.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.681
Feel free to watch it again
in slow motion.

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:38.457
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:47.900
I want you to know
that box suffered.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.769
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-The point here is,

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:54.273
we seem to have forgotten,
how important Anti-Trust is.

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.710
And now are being forced
to live with the consequences.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.713
Because this issue affects
almost everything you do.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.148
Angry at banks?

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:04.717
Well, the industry's dominated
by just these four.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.819
Frustrated with your
health insurance provider?

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.821
Odds are, it's one of these.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.223
And if this whole story
is infuriating you so much

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:13.959
that you're yearning
for the sweet escape of death?

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.361
Well bad luck,
because the casket industry

00:13:16.461 --> 00:13:18.831
is controlled
by these three companies.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.565
Oh, and it gets even worse.

00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:23.402
The after life is actually
controlled by one religion.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.803
I'm not saying which one,

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:28.006
but when you find out
you're gonna be so mad.

00:13:28.106 --> 00:13:29.341
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:32.010
-The point-- The point is--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.779
The point is, we have laws

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.915
to prevent the worse effects
of consolidation.

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:39.918
And it may well be time
to more aggressively use them

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:43.221
to impose strict standards
and to empower the FTC

00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:45.190
and the DOJ's
anti-trust divisions.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.259
And that is something that
most people

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:48.560
would really get behind,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.696
and nearly
every politician should.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:54.099
After all, there is one thing
they can not stop saying.

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:57.469
ALL: Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.772
Well, if they
really believe that,

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:02.374
it may be time for them
to stop talking about backbones

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.109
and actually fucking grow one.
