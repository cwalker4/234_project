00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
So

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.969
Basically it's going out so I'm a Christian and um

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.069
You know, I can't give any like direct evidence

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.039
For God but I feel like there. Well, I think that there is a

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.830
strong evidence that we can see

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.090
by

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.229
You know, I'm sure you guys have heard it that we think God's thoughts after him. So

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.289
There's like that universal need for

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.489
Love justice order peace and

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.629
Basically, it says derivatives of his nature

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.989
that have been

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.070
transferred to us

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.169
Because we're in the image of God. This is what you believe like. Yeah, we take on his likeness. So

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.539
That's my I mean, that's what I feel the is God horny

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.749
Yes. Well, that is God horny

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.548
Because I think horny thoughts and if I'm thinking horny thoughts after gods like does that mean that God's horny oh

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.990
I know but you're you're referring to something. That's a physical

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.280
I'm saying there's there's something deeper the look that needs that for like

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.430
How you love your wife or daughter or?

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.289
These are like derivatives of his nature. Sure. How could we know that?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.279
Okay, I mean I know it's been said and I know you believe it we can speak it I mean no no no

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.349
No, no, okay. I agree with you that we think so. I let's pick one. How about love? We are we good with that

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.769
Okay. Okay. I agree that I have loved that. I experienced love that. I love people. How can I know that I'm

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.649
experiencing that after God

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.529
Well because it's um, it's something that's innate within you like, okay

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.290
Then that would mean I mean if it's innate to Matt then why would you think it was

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.829
Something from a god? if you think it's innate to him?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.500
Well, I'm saying it's universal so it's within every human being right because we're social animals

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.469
You've now successfully described humans. I'm asking what makes you think that these are

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.810
indicative of a God that we're getting it from a God that we're thinking this after God you came in with a really

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.340
nifty kind of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.520
Footprints style of message and I'm asking that's what you believe. Why would we believe it?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.850
Okay, well I it's just um

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.179
Let's see. So I start with that point with you know, the we think you know, all these are are

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.320
Derivatives of God and you can't start with that point. That's the finish that that's what we're trying to establish

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.889
How do you get to that point that you think these things are derived from a god?

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.659
So me saying that every every human being in the world like this was a global like universal

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.980
First of all, that's not true

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.440
but

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.699
But but basically you don't think they're all like but I'm saying these aren't all you don't think there are people that don't experience love

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.759
That there are people with with particular psychopathy is that are abnormal that don't experience

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.670
Oh, I'm just saying it's not necessarily your ubiquitous, but even to the extent that it's ubiquitous

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.100
If every if every human being experienced love that's a human attribute, that's a human attribute. How do you tie that to go?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.790
Well, I mean, that's I

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.639
I mean, I I don't I guess I can't yeah

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.679
I would think that your your line of reasoning here and I'm just gonna guess from many years of doing this is

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.489
I have no other explanation for why all human beings would experience love

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.250
Except that this is what God wants us to experience

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.489
Okay, he's asking is that close to how your thoughts went

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.339
Yeah, I mean I'm just looking at like okay justice order

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.830
Like what why do we have these desires within because we have empathy and we have to share space with other people

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.519
We're social too - I mean if we weren't a social species if we were more like, you know

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.410
Foxes or snakes we would probably experienced this to a much lesser degree

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.710
But as a social species we experience these things like most other social species experience them

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.339
Ok, so I have to sit here and I have to share space with Tracy and believe me. It's not a half-two

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.410
It's Tracy's my favorite person on the show

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.869
So this is one of my favorite weeks ever

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.419
But Tracy and I have to share space and so that even if we don't fully understand the motivations

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.199
there are entirely pragmatic secular justifications for

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.319
The how and why we interact there's a the game theory questions where we're trying to study this stuff and the prisoner's dilemmas and all

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.319
This stuff but the end of the day even if I was completely selfish

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.609
The selfish thing for me to take care about is to make a world that benefits me and it benefits me

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.099
to encourage cooperation

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:25.289
To encourage right these sorts of emotional things to encourage a sense of justice would encourage the forgiveness that we talked about to discourage

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.629
Revenge those things there are pragmatic justifications for them. But even if we had no known

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.119
justification what justification would we ever have for saying these are

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.089
necessarily or even likely the result of a god

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.089
Well, why why are all these

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.039
Equal to a a positive outcome like,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.969
Why are the tongue deep because that's the goal?

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.409
I guess that's what I'm trying to express here is like why is he cool something? That's

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.639
Like by you seeking out justice by you

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.690
trying to

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.639
Get along well with her

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.448
Yeah, I guess I mean, that's the goal

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.999
Well what he's explaining is that number one even like even if he wasn't motivated it would be self-serving

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.270
Like it's still self-serving even if he doesn't want to do it

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.240
He sees the benefit to doing it, right but what I'm saying, it's funny. We're talking about something within

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.529
like so if the world has certain like it's like a video game like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.560
You know, there's there's certain

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.949
Variables and

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.289
Why do the just like seeking justice love

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.070
Being equal to like a positive outcome

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:42.729
That make sense

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.848
it's just about I mean what you're calling a positive outcome is surviving and thriving and

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.509
If animals didn't want to survive and thrive

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.449
They probably wouldn't have made it this far on the planet by now

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.609
Right an animal that doesn't want to survive and doesn't show any propensity toward thriving

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.989
Right, but you're still explaining something, huh?

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.098
I'm trying you're looking at the outcomes of the successes of

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.419
Evolution so far see if you list the things that benefit us and then say why do they benefit a sense of justice?

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.039
Benefits us and you're saying why does a sense of justice benefit us?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.089
That's not even a why question

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:26.099
It's just a fact that this does in fact benefit us like you might as well be asking

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.549
You might as well be you might you might as you might as well be asking

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:35.189
Why does food make me feel good? Why don't any poison instead of an apple?

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:38.759
right because I don't want to die and

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:44.219
Because that's I mean if I wanted to die, I would eat poison. It's just a physical fact

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:51.089
It's a physical fact of the universe and Apple contributes to my well-being drinking battery acid does not to say why that's the way

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.949
This isn't a human thing. This is an every species thing. Yeah

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:03.239
Right. I mean they don't all do I mean all species are doing things they in some way benefit their survival and if they can

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.589
Achieve it they're thriving. But even if we had no answer, how could you get to God from there?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.999
Okay, well I would take a step here and move forward -

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:21.539
Okay, so I've been I've been studying a near-death experience type stuff and you know

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:26.128
It's a lot to get into but I have I just have some points here. I want to touch on so

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:33.448
The fact that somebody is floating either their body they're able to recall. Hey, no, no, no

00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:38.429
No, you don't get to say it's a fact that someone is floating out of their body what you're talking about is reports

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.250
so when I ask you how you can get from these universal human emotions to a god and

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.000
You either acknowledge that you have no answer or you want to move on to near-death?

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.310
Experiences and then when we talk about nearly those experiences you start with the fact that someone is floating out of our body

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.310
That's not a fact

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.540
Okay, how do you demonstrate that?

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.479
Well, you do realize that we've we've tested

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.599
These sorts of things. All right, you do realize that

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.270
We've tested these sorts of things and we can test them, you know

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.259
Like you put a note up on a the top shelf in the in the operating room

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:16.919
And yeah, did anybody see the note did they read the note they're not able to recall right? Yeah. Okay unsurprisingly

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.560
All right

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.560
But even if they did even if they did even if we knew that people could leave as their bodies as a fact

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.080
How hell does that get you know, god, it doesn't

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.350
That's just something else that you need an explanation for

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.820
if you let me just kind of so just the fact that

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.879
okay, there's multiple reports of

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.440
Somebody in floating above their body. I mean that could be I guess it could be something to do with the brain, you know

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.440
we haven't

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360
I've had that experience in my own, um,

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.190
Experience with them sleep paralysis. Yeah, and that experience of floating above a

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:59.549
Dying or drugged altered brain I fail to see why anybody thinks is that's going to give you a more accurate representation of reality

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.520
But here's the thing. There are countless reports of

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:09.689
Indian gurus who survive on what they call prana they claim that they eat nothing that they just get energy from the Sun

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.260
Lots of reports of that does that mean we have good reason to believe it's true

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.389
Well, I mean, I'm just saying like your point

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.150
So the fact that there's floating, you know

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.959
Somebody can see their body and they're calm and then there's a light that they encounter it kind of

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.680
You know and then you you kind of go to the Mount of Transfiguration when Christ. Oh my gosh

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.280
Oh, do you realize that not all these stories are remotely the same right and that these stories are being created by humans

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.509
who are to have these ideas you might as well be saying that the propensity for people to describe an alien abduction as a an

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.209
almond headed almond eyed creature is

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.669
evidence that those are the aliens that are actually doing the abduction instead of saying that these stories started after

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.690
2001 a Space Odyssey and after these sort of after that what people's notion of an alien changed to aliens used to be

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:08.419
Monsters and robots and then they became kind of an ore and that became the narrative for everybody

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.920
if you've been raised with religious ideology in the notion that you have a soul and you go through this experience of

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:21.169
nearly dying and your brain is starved of oxygen and then when you recover

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:28.549
You have to figure out what happened when you were seemingly out of it. Is it more likely that a brain invents a story?

00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:32.119
That's consistent with their religious beliefs or that those religious beliefs are true

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.389
Well, I mean, it's it's something you have to investigate, you know before you it's also really easy

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:47.118
Because people with the same religious beliefs don't even necessarily have the same experience

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.309
Right, but they typically like I've not heard of anybody

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.759
They usually encounter beings like human

00:11:56.369 --> 00:12:00.979
form, they don't see like an animal come to him or you know, like, uh, I

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:09.289
Heard a panel on near-death experiences where one woman just had the experience of like flying over a landscape. She didn't have beings

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.928
Right, well, I'll just I mean that could be something that just you

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.329
Know is but the fact that there's a consciousness and they're able to recall

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.789
Wait, you were assuming they recall it right? That is this is what they're saying. They remember after they wake up now. We don't know

00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:36.709
We don't know that their memory at this point of what actually did or didn't go on while they were unconscious is accurate

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:40.068
but we do know that memory is malleable and flawed and

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.669
We invent fictions all the time. We lie to ourselves all the time about what we experience and what we remember happens all the time

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.059
Mm-hmm

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.259
No, I mean yeah

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:56.959
I've been studying it a little bit and there have been some some reports that are kind of like off from

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.879
What is typically reported?

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:06.289
It doesn't matter if everybody reported the exact same thing if every human being who had nearly died and been resuscitated

00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:09.139
Reported almost word-for-word the exact same thing

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:11.238
I floated up out of my body a

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:17.629
Bunch of naked Pixies surrounded my head and told me that I was bound for a wonderful place and then you drew me back here

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.570
Does that mean we have good reason to believe that they were actually bound for a wonderful place?

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.739
Well, I mean what else is gonna convince you that I mean evidence evidence. That is good

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.770
Okay, I mean you're saying you're saying that everybody on this planet

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.849
Died and they reported the same exact thing that we're talking about floating that naked Pixies or what it yes

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.880
You know why they're... why is that

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.030
Because it's not telling me about what is with respect to Pixies in another universe

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.739
It's telling me what people say and portray about their experience

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:04.560
Yes, they don't even have good reason to think that what they experienced was accurate was like a literal accurate. It is an unfalsifiable proposition

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.600
the fact that human beings have similar

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.300
Experiences and relay those experiences in a particular way does not mean that those were experiences point to a truth

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.180
Yeah, if I dream that I have a dead relative if I dream that I have a dead relative that comes to me and

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.040
talks to me one night right in a dream and

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.620
I wake up the next day. I have no way to differentiate

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.229
They actually came to me in some way and spoke to me in an unconscious state

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.489
Versus I dreamed that they came and spoke to me while I was asleep

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.460
There's no way that even I as the person who had the experience

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:47.969
Would know that the difference and there's certainly no way that I as someone who didn't have the experience could do it

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.440
So I certainly couldn't believe based on Tracy's report. I wouldn't even be able to believe it

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.159
Like I would have to say I don't know it would be my defense for near death

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.280
So if if it lines up with what how so the fact that they come across a light

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:06.509
they have a sense of love and peace, which I feel or

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.369
It is God's nature. Okay, how do you know that? Um

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:18.030
Well, the Bible says that you know, why should we care or believe that the Bible says what why should we care?

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.030
believe what the Bible says

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.909
Well, you just said like well you were just asking a question

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:30.750
I'm trying to ans... like respond by and no no, here's the problem. You completely missed the 2001 analogy

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:37.109
The fact that people have experiences that are consistent with the Bible is irrelevant if they understood what the Bible was saying

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.179
If they had exposure to what the Bible says, it's it's trivial that they would have

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.520
experiences or report experiences that were consistent with the Bible just like if they are aware of

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.940
How culture has changed with regard to aliens because of 2001?

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:56.999
Or sorry Close Encounters. The Third Kind is probably what I should have said Close Encounters would be the one that that fun only changes

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.179
What you're doing is saying yeah, but all these people are reporting these same types of aliens, and I'm asking you, okay?

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.250
But you don't have any reason to think that those alien

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.599
Experiences are accurate just because they're consistent and then you're saying yes

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.159
But they're also consistent with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which all these people saw. Yeah

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.630
okay,

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:24.450
I mean that I was just it corrupts your subject pool. Well, what I'm trying to do is from the majority of these

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.040
experiences that

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.740
These people experience I still line up with with God

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.640
Yeah, and the majority of alien experiences line up with Close Encounters of the Third Kind

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.680
Well, I know but God revealed himself through Christ and that okay

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.460
and close encounter reveals itself through a film that was produced

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.660
But also saying God reveals themselves in Christ is absurd

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.890
There is there is no Christ

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:58.619
There is nobody for you to talk to and by the way in the same way that Tracy's dead grandmother can't reveal herself

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.320
Through Tracy to me

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.229
God can't reveal himself through another person to you

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.100
But you're also making mountains of assumptions when you say God reveals himself through Christ

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:13.438
Because you're starting with the belief that the Bible is true and accurate and it's a representation of what God thinks and what God wants

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.420
And this Jesus story and all this other stuff

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:21.300
You are biasing all of your thoughts by beginning with the conclusion that you have a narrative that's believable

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.949
And the question is why should anybody believe that narrative?

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.260
Okay

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.550
well

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.550
You know with my starting

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.729
You know how you're saying the the footprints, you know were thinking God's thoughts after them, you know

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:45.360
Love just peace order all these are kind of derivatives of his nature that have been Pass to us

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.120
And you said is vengeance and anger species?

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:55.770
Yeah, I mean those are also I mean it's amazing that god is really like people

00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:02.789
Pray, like I mean is it isn't it possible that people are just attributing their natures to God

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:10.439
Isn't it possible that people are making up gods that just happen to be a lot like themselves

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.829
And and even before you answer anger before you answer

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:24.360
Because you're adopting a Christian model. Do you think that all those other religions people invented gods that were just like them?

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.959
or do are all those other gods real -

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.519
Well, I think there's stronger evidence for Christ because you know this

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:44.120
That doesn't remotely come close to answering the question about whether or not you think all those other people made up gods that were like them

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.420
Okay

00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:55.649
That doesn't remotely come close to answering their question either. Well you think about Allah is and this doesn't really come remotely

00:18:55.649 --> 00:18:57.640
Can you answer the question?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.460
Okay. Well, maybe I'm not understanding the question

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:07.500
Do you think that all of the all gods that you don't believe in were invented fictions of people creating their God?

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.549
We talking like zeus, thor...

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:17.819
Holy crap, all of them. How many do you not believe in? How what you I apologize. Let me backtrack

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.080
because

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.580
I've made this question as simple as possible, but your religious beliefs your religious beliefs are

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.520
Preventing you from answering honestly

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:34.799
Because you're afraid that there's some trap that's going to expose a flaw in your thinking that's what's going on right now

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.719
You believe in Jesus you believe in the biblical Jesus, right?

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.910
Yes, you don't believe in other gods. You don't believe in in the God of

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:52.679
Islam or the gods of Hinduism or the gods of any of the other religions ever you don't believe in any of those, right?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.710
Certain mythological... Yes, god, but Allah

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.410
Jehovah that's that is

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.890
The God that I follow he's saying those are the same God in his head

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.580
Yeah, okay saying like they're they're just interpreting

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.230
Their view of that same God in a different way, but it okay

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:19.719
You know that will sidetrack us... that'll sidetrack us into how do you know your way of interpretation is right?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.879
But right so let's just go with Zeus

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:30.730
Okay, you think Zeus is an invented fictional real okay, oh you'll go further you think it's just not real

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.450
Correct, okay

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:40.689
If we know people can invent gods and we know people have invented gods or at least you are convinced that people invented gods

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.570
How is it that you exclude yours?

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.750
From being invented

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.239
Mm. I just I mean, I think there's a stronger evidence for

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.789
For Jesus Christ, I mean he revealed himself. That's the difference. There we go. That's my answer

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.499
Okay, you realize that answer says absolutely nothing because you say there's stronger evidence

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.460
But you didn't present any evidence and then you say he revealed himself, which is absurd

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.379
Well, he came down and how do you know that or how do you know that? I?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.500
I mean

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.280
Okay, were you there

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.440
I've got to take a step of faith? I wasn't there. Why would you take a step of faith?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.549
Is there any religion that I couldn't believe if I just took a step of faith? I?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.019
Just feel like there's stronger evidence because he kicked like there's

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:39.460
Where's the evidence? What is the evidence? Okay, so you you're telling me that you don't believe Jesus ever existed. I'm not convinced

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.210
je... I'm not convinced that Jesus existed. I'm also not convinced that he didn't exist

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.489
I'm not I'm definitely not convinced that if Jesus existed that he was in fact divine

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.950
Okay, well I mean I just feel like he okay he came down he died

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:02.110
He was he came down and he died for Humanity. He came down and he died

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.309
Right, how do you know he came down and where did come down from?

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:14.259
he came, hehehe, he came from heaven how do you know that he's always existed

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.089
How do you know that go back to Genesis? How do you know that you Genesis doesn't mention Jesus and

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.860
Genesis is irrelevant because you don't get to cite Genesis as if it's evidence for something

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:35.109
Means that that's my response what I respond is, you know, he came down

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.760
You know, he died. I understand what you believe. I'm asking why you believe it

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.880
Okay, so you're okay the Bible is

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:52.239
New Testament talks about that. I know you what you're gonna say is like why should I have any?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.100
reason to believe that that

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:01.930
Document is true, correct? Why can't I think some other document like, you know the Great Gatsby no no, no. No

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:08.049
No, I don't care about a document. I don't care about other documents. Okay, I'm asking why I should believe this one is accurate

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.700
Okay, well

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.160
Christianity is is spread worldwide

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.370
It's why I believe it's the largest religion the largest or second largest depending on how the numbers work out

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.660
But that has no...

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.310
The truth of an idea isn't impacted by how many people believe it how long it's been around or anything else?

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.310
So you can't go with which one's older you'd have to be Jewish?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.139
You can't go with which one's larger you'd probably be Muslim or potentially depending on how the numbers work

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.969
But it just doesn't make any sense if you want with oldest, you'd probably be Hindu. Yeah, well, right

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:52.689
Well, I'm not gonna go with personal experience because I know how that goes. Yeah, I'm just so I'm literally I'm serious

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:57.970
I've been doing this so seemingly for ages and all I want to know is why should I believe?

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.040
that the Bible is telling me the truth about what actually happened and what is

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:13.780
Okay, so I would say the revelation of Christ the fact that Christianity is the

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.110
strongest consensus of

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.170
humans on the earth believe in that

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:27.520
So because it's popular you're saying because it's popular because a lot of people believe it I should believe it too. That's what you're saying

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.859
well, I'm just saying like if if this person came down and and they were

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.800
Not legitimate just like our somebody else who pops up and creates a cold

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.620
Do you think that that person is going to be able to create a following you mean like Muhammad Jesus Christ?

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.620
You mean like Muhammad? I?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:56.700
I mean he did, you know, but so so it's possible then it's possible to get billions of believers

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.960
centuries afterwards

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.460
Even if you're a fraud, okay

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.520
Buddha

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.160
okay

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.820
So well, I'm just saying like the that's about being how I'd respond like the strongest

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.090
consensus of the... consensus of people believe in that faith that

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:21.550
Yet you acknowledge that you just acknowledge that that's not a way to tell whether something is true and yet you come back to it

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:28.030
okay, the number people believe something may be able to tell you the number of people who believe something to come meet you at your

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.180
House today has he ever come at you at your house

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.300
He has not hey, do you know of anybody who's ever had him come and meet him at their house

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.010
Well, that's okay

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.999
And I'm not trying to be condescending but that's what the Jews

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:50.020
Said to him when he was on the cross come down off the cross and come to my house and prove that you're real

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.900
I'm pretty sure if he's sitting there on the cross. I don't have a question about whether he's real

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.290
I have a question about whether he's divine there there was you know, they

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:57.890
they were

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.579
Asking the same question that you were that you have right now

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.140
Let me let me leave you with this because we let me leave you with this because we're like 25 minutes over time

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.319
If you go through if you go through and you read the story

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:14.289
Jesus was tempted right by Satan. Okay, and in the Bible that you believe

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.660
Yes, okay, so Jesus is tempted what were those temptations

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.310
Food temptation of power

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.650
See what else I

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720
know that that one was like

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.339
Cast yourself down that doesn't have angels catch. Listen, let's go with the easy one

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.340
Well, Jesus is God, right?

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.600
Right and he knows what God knows cuz he's God

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.579
And he's and he's existed forever cuz he's God

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.509
Okay, and he knows what's gonna happen later, right

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.549
Right, okay now Satan I'm assuming you think that he was real and the temptation was real

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:11.110
Satan I do believe he's real sure. So Satan has been in God's presence and knows that God is real

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:19.990
Right and Satan knows that God is all-powerful and is the ruler of everything correct

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.170
Correct

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.810
If I walked into your apartment or your house if you got a big-screen TV

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:37.330
Yes, I do cool and I said to you if you bow down and worship me I'll give you that big-screen TV

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.330
What would you say?

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.419
I'd tell you to get out wouldn't you say it's already mine

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.450
How stupid is it?

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.019
for Satan to tempt Jesus with what is already his

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:55.360
Why no, but doesn't it say that how can it be a temptation? power over to Satan?

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:02.080
As he's given power over to him that God is as they've got it Satan is the god of this ages

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:11.080
I believe what does Jesus care about all the lands that he surveys and ruling them if he's God and rules the fucking universe

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.560
There's a problem here if I walk into your house and offer you your own TV

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.529
The point the correct response is to point out how absurd it is

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.620
For me to try to tempt you with something that is already yours

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:33.939
Not only is it an absurd thing to do but both of the entities involved both Jesus and Satan

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.600
Would have already realized how absurd that this was

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.780
The story okay is obviously fiction

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:50.020
that part of the story is unequivocally for that sure and I okay so

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:59.619
See, so Jesus came and he was supposed to Humble himself and be a perfect sacrifice for people, correct, wasn't he already? Perfect

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:01.619
Why would he have to be perfect?

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.179
Well, I'm saying like he had to maintain that perfection until he went and died on the cross

00:29:08.779 --> 00:29:14.888
Okay, so a part of that a part of that would be having to Humble himself and

00:29:17.059 --> 00:29:19.059
You know be strong and

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:26.049
Fulfill. How strong do you have? How strong do you have to be to turn down someone offering something that's already yours.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.470
I don't think that takes strength will

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.299
If you offer me the money that's in my wallet, it doesn't take strength for me to laugh

00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:40.209
Right, but I think it was it was not only was

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:43.279
He was he was humble in himself

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:47.049
I mean now he was studying like an example for human beings like

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:52.479
wouldn't want a better example to be like what the hell is wrong with you offering me the stuff I already own

00:29:56.239 --> 00:30:01.599
I mean yeah, this story is absurd think about it some more but we're like way over time, we are...
