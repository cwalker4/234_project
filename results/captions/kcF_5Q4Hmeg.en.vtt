00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.940
GUEST: I brought a musk ox, a bart piece by
an Inuit stone carver.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.119
On a trip in the 1980's to Inuit country in
Canada.

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.800
I went to this gift shop.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.390
This looked more like a museum piece, so I...
acquired it.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.970
APPRAISER: The artist's name is Mark Tungilik.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.270
You purchased it in the 80's.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.100
I don't know how long the store had it, but
Mark was born in 1913.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.160
And he died in 1986.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.510
GUEST: They gave me a brochure, and it looks
like these musk ox were 1960's.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.100
APPRAISER: Yes it was, it was a theme he was
heavily into at that particular time.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.160
In terms of carving, Inuit art has been around
from prehistoric times, but it was in the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.920
40's, the Canadian government stepped forward
to help organize the Inuit first people of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:13.170
Canada to have a guild to ensure that they
would get a fair price for their work.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.460
Your piece is made out of soapstone, and the
horns are made out of whale bone.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.479
When it came out of the box, I was in love
with it from the second I saw it.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.020
He's appreciated in price, not as aggressively
as some of the artists of the time.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.840
The largest market for them, obviously, is
in Canada.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.880
And, there are auction house that dedicate
themselves to their sales, and a lot of these

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.170
artists that began carving in the 30's, 40's,
50's, and 60's are achieving prices in the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.909
tens of thousands of dollars.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.759
So, Bob, you bought this in a retail setting,
and you paid?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.810
GUEST: About 800 dollars, I think.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.829
APPRAISER: OK.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.409
Well, these pieces are selling now in the
auction market for about 2000 to 2500 dollars.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.740
It wouldn't surprise me if you returned to
Vancouver area or any part of Canada and found

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.200
them, again, sitting in retail galleries and
selling for 4000 dollars.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.520
GUEST: Wonderful.
