[Applause]

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:02.436
Sid: Hello.

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:03.437
Sid Roth here.

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:08.542
Welcome to my world where
it's naturally supernatural.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:13.247
My guest died, went to
Heaven, but was sent back with

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.950
revelation of the
invisible world.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.187
Most Bible believers
don't have a clue.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.022
Most non-believers
don't have a clue.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.325
All the action is occurring
that's causing all the things

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:29.663
going on, good, bad or whatever
in your life from

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:30.931
the invisible world.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:36.970
He even downloaded how to
have every one of

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.106
your prayers answered.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.942
Anyone interested
in finding out?

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:45.279
[Applause]

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:49.616
Is there a
supernatural dimension,

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:54.288
a world beyond the one we know?

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:58.859
Is there life after death?

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.263
Do angels exist?

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:08.435
Can our dreams contain
messages from Heaven?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:13.874
Can we tap into ancient
secrets of the supernatural?

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:17.711
Are healing miracles real?

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.682
Sid Roth has spent over 35 years
researching the strange world of

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:25.385
the supernatural.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:32.559
Join Sid for this
edition of It's Supernatural!

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.197
[Applause]

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:37.864
Sid: Hello.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.533
I'm here with my
friend Kevin Zadai,

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.868
and Kevin was having
a dental procedure.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.070
He died.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.438
He went to Heaven.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.640
You didn't want to come back.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.342
Kevin Zadai: No Sid, I did not.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:53.046
I still can't understand how
beautiful Heaven is and how

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.548
different it is to be down here.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:55.148
It's so slow.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.817
I just can't understand.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:58.652
Sid: What do you mean so slow?

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.322
Kevin Zadai: This realm is just
working so slow because it's a

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.156
fallen realm.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.659
And so once you experience the
other realm you don't want to

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.426
come back.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.627
I mean, there's no way
that you want to come back.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.162
And so he did send me back.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.898
He wanted me to teach people
about prayer and how it works,

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:13.367
and so that they
don't get disappointed.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:17.137
But this realm is in
a slow mode to me.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.772
It's everything slow.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:25.512
Sid: Now I feel such a
strong presence of God as we're

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.713
speaking right now.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.883
Let's just kind of jump into it.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.419
What do we do?

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.089
What's the first thing we should
do to get our prayers answered

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.024
all the time?

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:39.226
Kevin Zadai: When
Jesus was talking to me,

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:44.598
Sid, he wanted me to come back
and tell people to be aware that

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.100
their prayers will be answered,
but they got to get on the same

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.668
page as him.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.971
And so he has a
command about him,

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.040
and when he would talk he'd say
this is the way it is:

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.509
"We've had meetings without you.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.212
We don't include you on
the planning part of it,

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.149
but this is the way it is and
if you will get on the same page

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.451
then you're going to have
all your prayers answered.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.620
Everything you desire when
you pray if you believe,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.654
you shall receive it."

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.790
That's what he told me.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.697
Sid: You said that we have to
pray ourselves into our answer.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.899
What does that mean?

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:23.503
Kevin Zadai: Well I saw,
Sid, that the Spirit of God was

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:28.175
standing by to coach us, and so
he was there to tell us exactly

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:32.079
what to say, what to pray for
and that he would give us in

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.680
advance glimpses of the future.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.349
And so he was there to
help us pray into our future.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.819
You see, Jesus told me, he said,
"I'm sitting here right now

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.888
looking at your future
because it's my now.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:46.560
But it's your future, but you
can see it now if you will stay

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.661
with me in the secret place."

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.931
Sid: And that's
something that we've heard,

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:54.768
the secret place, but
what exactly is it,

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:59.039
how can we get there and
how can we stay there?

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.241
You look to me
like you stay there.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.111
Kevin Zadai: Well
it's a safe place.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.648
Trust me, if you came back to
a place that's not like Heaven

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:13.487
you're going to find the closest
place you can to God and that is

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:14.421
right in the secret place.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.424
He showed me where it was and I
was amazed at how the Cherubim

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.060
are on each side of
God and they cover him.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.598
He said, "Kevin, if you'll stay
right there in the secret place

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.900
of the most high, right
there under my wings,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.936
 which is the Cherubim
wings, then he said,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.572
"all these things are yours."

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.909
And the verses 9
through 16 go through,

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.044
in Psalm 91 go
through those benefits.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.514
But he said, "If you're not
making the most high your

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.350
dwelling place, if you're not in
the shadow of the most high then

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.887
these things, these
goodies," he said,

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:50.657
"are not for you because
you're not close enough to me."

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:56.129
Sid: You were telling me about
you have seen since you've been

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.233
back here on Earth, it's always
at times you can see what's

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.202
going on in the invisible realm.

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:04.304
You saw something
in New Orleans.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.238
Tell me about that.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:05.939
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.376
I wondered why the Lord had sent
me and my wife to New Orleans

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:13.847
because it's such a
hard city in many ways.

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.683
And so he told me, he
said, "Because I trust you."

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.519
And so we began
to pray thinking,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.754
okay, well this
is our assignment.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:23.290
So we spent a lot of time in
prayer and all of a sudden our

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.592
eyes started to be open to
what's going on around us.

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:30.230
And we would pray and spend time
with the Lord in long periods of

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.431
time and actually fast.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.934
And our eyes were
open one night,

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.570
and saw these entities that
were coming from the city of New

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.306
Orleans, they were coming out
into the rural areas where we

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:40.006
lived.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.108
And I had not seen
them until them,

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.145
but I could suspect it's like
some of the people at home would

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:47.914
know they could sense when
something is bothering them,

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:52.018
I saw three entities coming up
from New Orleans and I saw an

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.922
angel come and
visit in our house.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:59.426
He grabbed me and he said, "I've
come in answer to your prayers."

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.762
He picked me up and he blew
those entities back to New

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.431
Orleans, back to the city.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.700
And he said, "This is how we
take care of things

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.903
on our side."

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:18.678
And he dropped me, he put me
back on my feet and flew away,

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:22.882
and I thought, you know, what
else is going on that we don't

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:23.750
know about.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.218
But I just want to speak to
the people out there right now

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.320
because I feel like a lot of you
are going through some things,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.522
but you have to know that
the angels have been sent to

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:33.126
minister for you and to you, and
that they have come and answered

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:33.760
prayers.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.264
The angel said to me, "I come in
answer to your prayers and we're

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:40.133
going to take care of this, and
this is how we take care of it.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.901
And I'm telling you right now by
the Spirit of the Lord that this

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.969
show is for you.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.139
I'm speaking to you because you
are going through some attacks.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.309
And I'm telling you by the
Spirit of God that the angels

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.912
are going to be dispatched and
they are going to help you in

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:55.081
this fight, and not to give up
because the Lord is with you in

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.117
a great and mighty way."

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:59.119
[Applause]

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:04.324
Sid: I want to get in
that secret place 24/7,

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:09.796
so that among other things all
the promises of Psalm 91 are

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.599
going to be activated
in my life and

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.367
I want you to get there, too.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.102
We'll be right back.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.470
[Applause]

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.174
We'll be right back
to It's Supernatural!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:58.411
We now return to
It's Supernatural!

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.148
[Applause]

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.117
Sid: I want to talk to you
about this invisible realm.

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:09.823
There are what you call momentum
breakers and you identify who

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.125
these momentum breakers are.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:13.893
You call them assassins.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:14.761
Explain.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:18.365
Kevin Zadai: I explain it this
way because when I came back I

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:22.202
realized that I did not
distinguish that my enemy hated

00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:24.037
me and wanted to take me out.

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:27.741
And I think as Christians we
lose our edge that there is an

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.011
enemy that hates us and we think
that somehow that he doesn't

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.580
really hate us, that he just
is misunderstanding and doesn't

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.882
understand what's going on.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.785
But these demon spirits
that come after people,

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:40.320
they're momentum breakers.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.890
What they do is if a Christian
starts to break through and

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.526
break away from the
system of this world,

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.396
they start to get
into a pace, I call it.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:52.098
Jesus said that when you get
into a pace then you stay in

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.533
that pace for the race.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:58.004
He said these enemies know that
if you continue in that pace

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.005
you're unstoppable.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.841
So Jesus told me, he said
that these assassins come.

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:04.778
Their whole goal
is to take you out,

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:09.149
because Christians, he told
me, Christians have to start

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.751
realizing that these demons'
goal is to take you out and that

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:15.188
is why you need to be
sober-minded like Paul told

00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:15.822
Titus.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:19.559
And so I tell
people all the time,

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.529
listen, there's things that are
being sent out to you and they

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.500
are to trip you so that you
never get to that momentum that

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.802
breaks out.

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:31.337
And so that's what
Jesus sent me back for.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:34.340
He said, "Tell the people that
they can break out and that the

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.577
devil is going to throw
everything he has to stop them,

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.014
but if they'll continue in
their pace they're unstoppable."

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:44.350
Sid: What are some of the areas
that these momentum breakers

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:51.191
that these are actual demons
whose job is to be an assassin.

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:56.529
They don't care if you die, they
want to stop you from having

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.499
that momentum that God has for
you to fulfill your destiny.

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.400
Kevin Zadai: Yes, sir.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.503
I felt, Sid, that after, the
Anointing is strong right now

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:06.940
because this is some of
things that will happen.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.509
You'll start to set
times aside to pray.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:13.313
You'll start to say the right
things that the Lord is saying

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.848
to you and repeat them.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:18.284
The angels start to come because
they are attracted to what's

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.519
written in your book.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:21.020
So when you start
things..

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.855
Sid: The Book of Life.

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:22.522
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:27.026
So then these demons will come
and what they'll do is they'll

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:30.830
start to do things that will
show that your relationship with

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.933
God is not what you thought it
was because things will start

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:34.834
happening that are bad.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.970
And the Lord said this has
nothing to do with me and my

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.006
relationship with them, that
these bad things are assassins

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.609
that are supposed defame.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.943
They're sent to defame God.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:47.180
So you think that because you
prayed and you started doing

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.884
things in a direction that it
just could increase the warfare,

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.952
and see, they want
you to back off.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.120
The demons want you to back off.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.288
Jesus said don't.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:58.091
Keep pushing through, keep
in your pace and he said,

00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.826
you'll gain
momentum and break out,

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.095
and there will be no demons.

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:04.164
[Applause]

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:09.235
Sid: In other words, what he's
saying to you and what you're

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:12.305
saying to them is don't give up.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.574
That's the word for you.

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.844
Stop, don't give up.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:18.645
Okay.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.512
So you went to Heaven.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.547
You saw the Book of Life.

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:24.551
What was that like seeing a
book that tells your whole life,

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:25.451
all the future?

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:26.586
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:29.355
I saw that Psalms
139:16 was absolutely true.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:33.226
I saw that people's names were
on the bindings of the books and

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:35.195
they were the acts of
God through individuals,

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.563
and everybody has a book.

00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:39.832
And I saw the angels are only a
sign to help people with their

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.069
books, and so most of the
time when people get in trouble

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.405
angels come and rescue them,
but that's not their main job.

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:48.708
Their main job is to
help you with your book.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:54.180
So when you pray in tongues you
actually have the Spirit of God

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.916
reading your book
and your angels say,

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.484
hey, that sounds familiar.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.587
That's the code words.

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:01.988
They're like military officers.

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:04.490
They'll just get
ignited and start to do that.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.992
They'll just
accomplish the book.

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:10.563
So remember, angels are sent
back to do your book and there

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:13.233
is a book written about
you before you were born.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.068
Sid: So if I'm
hearing you right,

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:18.805
what you are saying is there's a
book that has your whole life.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:23.309
Nothing happens on Earth
unless a human speaks it and by

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:28.848
speaking in tongues your book,
you are speaking your

00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:29.482
entire destiny.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:30.717
That book is so specific.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:34.554
You told me that you saw exact
amounts of money people

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:35.622
would make.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.389
Explain that.

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:37.323
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.993
There was one of the books
was a friend of mine and he was

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:44.263
actually very wealthy as a young
man was going to make a large

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.032
amount of money
in this lifetime.

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:47.066
Jesus had it down to the penny.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:51.070
He said, "This is what he'll be
worth when he passes away and

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.171
comes with me."

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.574
He said, "He's not
trained in the Spirit.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:55.942
He's not speaking in tongues."

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.178
And so the Spirit of God is
not allowed to have utterance

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:01.614
through him, which means
that he's not reading his book.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.450
His book says, okay,
this is what he showed me,

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.785
and Jesus pointed to the figure.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.888
It was four times the amount
that he was going to make if he

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.490
didn't speak in tongues.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.695
So if by speaking in tongues, it
increased his net worth in his

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:19.332
lifetime, four times, not
because he was focused on

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:23.136
riches, but because the Spirit
of God was leading him into all

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:27.407
truth, which in fact was God's
assignment for him to make money

00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:28.341
for the Kingdom.

00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:32.745
Sid: Jesus said there was a
number one way to get into the

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:33.746
Spirit.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.115
What was that?

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.784
Kevin Zadai: He said it
was praying in tongues.

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:41.421
Sid: When he came back he
provoked everyone in my

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:46.759
audience, in the studio and
at home right now to jealousy.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:53.132
He came back playing, he went to
having zero musical instruments,

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:57.236
he came back
playing nine instruments.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:14:02.742
But then Jesus wasn't quite
happy the way he played the sax.

00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:08.281
So Jesus gave him special
lessons to play the sax.

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:11.651
Did Jesus play that same sax
you're going play when

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.919
we come back?

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:15.154
Kevin Zadai: Yes he did and
he was really good at it.

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:19.525
[Applause]

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:25.598
Sid: Why am I feeling
such a presence of God?

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.733
I just heard a
word of knowledge.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.901
There's someone with
a pain in your neck,

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:33.172
if you move your neck you'll
see that the pain is gone,

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:37.510
and in your head there's
like migraines or tumors.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.079
And backs are being
healed right now,

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:43.416
and hips, fingers, arthritis.

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:47.720
Why did this just hit me?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.491
I mean, the Spirit hit me
and then I just

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.091
started giving words.

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.493
And by the way, you are healed.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.928
What's going on?

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.530
Kevin Zadai: I also feel
like joints are being healed,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.600
and also I have the word
for kidneys and livers,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.203
that there's healings going on
right now with blood issues and

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:06.272
it has to do with the
kidneys and the liver,

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.641
and there's somebody
who just got healed,

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.176
their eyesight just got healed.

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:10.943
Sid: Okay.

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:16.282
When we come back I'm going to
commission Kevin to play the

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:21.087
sax, the same type of
sax he saw Jesus play,

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.690
the way Jesus told him to play,
and I believe you're going to

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.694
prophesy with music
for specific people.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:31.297
When you aim that
sax at the camera,

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.766
you at home are
going to get healed,

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.035
and when you aim that sax
at our studio audience,

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.937
who knows that's
going to happen.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.338
I see what's going on with him.

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:41.140
Be right back.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.441
[Applause]

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:45.812
We'll be right back
to It's Supernatural!

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:22.134
We now return to
It's Supernatural!

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:25.404
[Applause]

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:28.841
Sid: Now Jesus taught Kevin how
to play the sax the way Jesus

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:33.980
played it, but he also taught
you how to pray the way he

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.847
prayed.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.615
What did he tell you?

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.617
Kevin Zadai: He told me that I
didn't have enough depth in my

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:42.121
prayers, that I didn't have
enough access to the depths of

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:42.822
my heart.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:44.890
And he explained
it as this, Sid.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.128
He said in Psalms 16, David
wrote that prophetically for me,

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:49.996
he said.

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:54.667
Jesus said that David wrote
that psalm and he memorized that

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.702
psalm because when he
was in the depths of Hell,

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.572
he said he that verse of
that psalm over and over again,

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:03.609
and he said, "I cleared away out
in that place for you and for

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:07.380
everyone, and Messiah to
pray from those depths."

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:13.853
He said, "I prayed myself out of
Hell because I had the Psalm 16

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:17.923
and I prayed that continually
and then the Holy Spirit came

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.492
and resurrected me."

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:23.095
He said, "When you pray, you
pray with that kind of fervency

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:26.098
where you know who you are
based on the scripture."

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.468
Because he said, "I had no
witness when I was down there.

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.237
I had no Holy Spirit help."

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.939
He said, "If the Father
had not given the command,

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.976
 he said, "I would sit down
there until he gave the command

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:38.244
for me to be resurrected.

00:19:38.244 --> 00:19:39.545
That's how much I trusted him."

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.113
He said, "That's
where you pray from.

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.683
You pray from those
depths, that trust."

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:48.854
Sid: And then he visits you
and taught you how to play.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.257
But what kind of
sax did he have?

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:53.726
Kevin Zadai: It was interesting
because there are several types

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:54.427
of sax.

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:57.596
Sid: I think in terms of a
sax that's kind of curved.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.431
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:19:58.431 --> 00:19:59.732
And I have all of them.

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.702
But this particular one
he had was a soprano sax.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:07.073
It was a beautiful gold
saxophone and I was sleeping at

00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:08.908
the time, and I heard something.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:11.310
So when I woke up he was
standing there and he had this

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.645
sax in his hands.

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:14.180
And he started to
play it over me,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.615
because he sings songs
of deliverance over us.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:20.219
But I found out that he was
playing this beautiful saxophone

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.690
over me and he took it away from
his mouth and handed it to me,

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.292
and he said, "You play."

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.260
And I go, "Lord, I
can't play like that."

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.797
He said, "That's because
you're doing it wrong."

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:33.199
He said, "Let me show you."

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.533
He said, "Stand up."

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.302
So I stood up, my
wife was still sleeping,

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:38.504
and I looked
around, and he goes,

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:40.239
"See all that
around you," he said,

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.308
"that's the Holy Spirit and
the presence and Glory of my

00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:43.542
Father."

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.077
He said, "That's always there."

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:48.547
He said, "What's wrong is you're
not breathing in Heaven first."

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:50.983
He said, "Breathe that in first
and then blow it through your

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:53.085
horn and it will
work out just fine."

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:57.923
So I took a big breath and all
this gold air around me went

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:01.127
inside of me, and I put that
horn that he handed to me in my

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:05.564
mouth, and I blew, and it was
exactly like Jesus had played.

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:08.167
And so he taught
me that, he said,

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:10.436
"Everything you do, Kevin,
should be from the breath of

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.103
Heaven."

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.773
Sid: I am going
to stretch Kevin.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:18.778
He has played instruments in
front of groups of people and

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.714
people have been
healed, been delivered.

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:24.483
But I want him to
do something else,

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:27.052
something that I don't believe
anyone has asked him

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:28.154
to do before.

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:33.692
I want him to take that same
type of saxophone he

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.161
saw Jesus play.

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:36.195
What is it called?

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.296
Kevin Zadai: Soprano saxophone.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:42.368
Sid: A soprano sax, and I want
him to prophesy over selected

00:21:42.368 --> 00:21:46.872
people in our studio
audience by not his mouth,

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:52.244
but by that golden
breath coming out of the sax.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:57.683
And then I want you to look
at the camera and prophesy to

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:01.954
specific people at
home through that music.

00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:07.626
And I believe we're going
to get amazing results.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:08.460
Kevin Zadai: Yes.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.729
Sid: I've heard of this before.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:14.900
Now we're all
going to witness it.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.238
Kevin, get that anointed
sax, take a deep breath of that

00:22:19.238 --> 00:22:22.741
golden oxygen and play.

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.677
Kevin Zadai: Amen.

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:32.351

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:02.581
Sid: Next week on
It's Supernatural!

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:03.415
Randy Clark: Hello.

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:04.416
I'm Randy Clark.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:07.653

I know thousands more will be

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.354
healed through this program.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:12.291

yourself or you want to see

00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.293
others healed,
