THIS IS-- THAT IS REAL POLITICS.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:53.820
&gt;&gt; THAT'S REAL POLITICS.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.388
&gt;&gt; I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH IT.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.123 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS CARING
ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT WERE YOU THERE TO TALK
ABOUT?

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.262 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; SMALL TOWNS, LIKE 3600
PEOPLE.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.365
THERE WAS A NEW YEAR'S EVE
CELEBRATION THAT IS NOT REALLY

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:08.902 align:end position:100%
SANCTIONED BY THE TOWN BUT IT IS
HILARIOUS AND WE DO IT EVERY

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.638
YEAR LIKE A LITTLE DISCO BALL
DROPS IN FRONT OF THE BNG AND

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.972
THE WHOLE TOWN COMES OUT.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:17.477
AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE [BLEEP]
SAFE.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.413
AND THE POLICE CAME THROUGH,
MAYBE TEN AFTER MIDNIGHT WHILE

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
EVERYONE WAS IN THE STREETS,
HUGGING AND KISSING.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.918
BY THE WAY I SHOULD TELL YOU,
THIS IS LEAK IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:25.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
TRUMP COUNTRY.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:33.059
BUT CULTURALLY THERE IS LIKE A
BERNIE SANDERS IN THE TRUMP-- .

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: 3600 IS A SMALL
TOWN.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:35.995
&gt;&gt; IT IS A SMALL TOWN.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.098
&gt;&gt; Stephen: A UNIVERSITY TOWN.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.299 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; IT USED TO BE.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.770
ANT YOK UNIVERSITY USED TO BE
THERE, JOHN LITHGOW IS FROM THAT

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.074
TOWN, COR ETA SCOLT KING, IT IS
A SUB VERSIVE, WEIRD PLACE.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:48.241 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.677 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE AUSTIN OF
OHIO.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.379
&gt;&gt; IN A WAY, VERY MUCH SO.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.485
WITH NONE OF THE MONEY AND FUN
STUFF TO DO AT NIGHT.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.353
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT THE NEW YEAR'S
EVE PARTY.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.689
&gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE THE BIG DAS, SO
THE POLICE CAME THROUGH AND

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUSTED IT UP.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.193
AND A GUY, APPARENTLY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.496
BUT SOME GUY GOT TASTED.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.997
&gt;&gt; Stephen: FOR DOING WHAT?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.764 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:15.168
I THINK THE POLICE TRYING TO GET
OUT OF CAR AND HE HELD THE DOOR

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.336 size:88% position:56%
SHUT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:22.775
AND THEY TASED HIM AND THE CROWD
WAS DRUNK AND THEN THE

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.712
POLICE-- THE FEELING IN TOWN IS
THE POLICE GENERALLY OVERREACTED

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.349
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CULTURALLY
SENSITIVE TO HOW THE TOWN

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
FUNCTIONS.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:34.954
NOW I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ACTING
CHIEF OF POLICE BUT THEY MADE A

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:35.388 align:start size:88% position:13%
HUGE MISTAKE.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.224
IT WAS REALLY LIKE COME ON, MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.360
SO PEOPLE WENT AND VOICED THEIR
OPINIONS.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.098
IT SEEMED STRANGE IF IT IS ON
THE NEWS, BUT IN THE TOWN, IT IS

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.234
JUST LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AM
LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS, IT'S LIKE

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:53.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE SIMPSONS.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.507
YOU SEE THE SAME PEOPLE EVERY
DAY AND I'M LIKE THE LOCAL

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.311 size:78% position:39%
CRUSTY THE CLOWN.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
(APPLAUSE).

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.351
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT, 30
YEARS IN, 30 YEARS IN, OKAY SO

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.855 align:end position:100%
30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DOING
COMEDY, ARE YOU DOING THESE NOW

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:09.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
16 DAYS.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.993
THERE ARE A LOT OF MUSICIANS.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.262
&gt;&gt; COMEDIANS DRK DSH LIKE, THIS
WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT ME

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:21.167
AND CHRIS ROCK HAVE EVER
OFFICIALLY HEADLINED TOGETHER.

(APPLAUSE)
AND.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.343
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU GOT THE
CHANCE, THE ROOTS, ERICA BADOU,

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.779 align:start size:88% position:13%
SOLANGE AS YOU SAID WILL BE
JOINING YOU.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.080
GOOD LUCK WITH THE RUN.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.515
I'M SURE IT WILL BE GREAT.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:39.752
I'M HOPING I GET IT A CHANCE TO
SEE IT.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.421 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE IF YOU COME.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:46.292
YOU SHOULD JUST POP BY AND DO
LIKE FIVE MINUTES.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:50.830 align:start size:88% position:13%
(APPLAUSE)
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.431 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WOULD LOVE IT.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.735
&gt;&gt; WE DO A THING AT THE SHOW, AT
MY CONCERTS WHERE NOBODY HAS A

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.505
CELL PHONE SO ALL THIS, YOU
KNOW, COMEDIAN WITCH-HUNT STUFF

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:00.340
DOESN'T HAPPEN AT MY SHOW.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.210
HAVE I A WIDE MARGIN OF ERROR
AND A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS GET

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.144 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAID AND DONE.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.914 align:end position:100%
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ARTISTS
TO REALLY FLEX THEIR MUSCLES

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.750 align:start size:88% position:13%
WITHOUT THE FEAR OF THE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THE OVERLY

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
SENSITIVE.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.320
AND WE ALL GOT TO KIND OF
RECALIBRATE OUR EARS A LITTLE

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.523
BIT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HEAR
EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTAND EACH

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:17.824 align:start size:88% position:13%
OTHER.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:23.429
AND I THINK COMEDY AND MUSIC IS
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
(APPLAUSE).

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.767
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK I SPEAK
