EXAMINER, IT ALL STARTED TO MAKE

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:19.498 align:start position:0%
SENSE.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:24.436 align:start position:0%
WHOEVER IT WAS USED A
PEDIATRIC-SIZE NEEDLE TO MAKE

00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:28.908 align:start position:0%
THE TINY PUNCTURE WOUND IN
MICHELLE'S LEFT ARM, SINCE THERE

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.977
WAS VIRTUALLY NO HEMORRHAGING.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.181
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE
HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF SOMEBODY

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.017
WHO HAS A LOT OF SKILL IN THIS.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS

00:08:40.752 --> 00:08:43.489 align:start position:0%
THE WORK OF A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL, MOST LIKELY

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:47.993 align:start position:0%
SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN A HOSPITAL
AND PROBABLY SOMEONE MICHELLE

00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:49.428 align:start position:0%
KNEW.

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.032 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHOEVER HAD INJECTED
MICHELLE HERNDON WAS SOMEONE

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:57.836
THAT, FOR WHATEVER THE REASONS
WERE, SHE HAD TRUSTED ENOUGH TO

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.205
OFFER THAT PERSON HER LEFT ARM.

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:03.442
&gt;&gt; SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO ADMINISTER THE DOSE AND THEN

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:08.147
CLEAN UP AND TAKE THE MEDICAL
WASTE THE 60 FEET FROM HER BODY

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.482 align:start position:0%
WHERE IT WAS LOCATED.

00:09:10.515 --> 00:09:15.254 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHO WAS THIS
PERSON?

00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:18.557 align:start position:0%
TO FIND OUT, DETECTIVE
MARC WOODMANSEE CAME UP WITH AN

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.962 align:start position:0%
IDEA THAT CHANGED THE COURSE OF
THE INVESTIGATION.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:28.701 align:start position:0%
HE TOLD ANALYSTS TO TEST THE
SYRINGE CAPS FOUND IN MICHELLE'S

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.969 align:start position:0%
TRASH.

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:32.538
&gt;&gt; I CAN REMEMBER SEEING MEDICAL
STAFF HOLD NEEDLE CAPS IN THEIR

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.708
MOUTH WHILE THEY WERE GIVING AN
INJECTION, AND I THOUGHT THAT

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.711 align:start position:0%
THERE WAS A POTENTIAL THERE FOR
SALIVA DNA.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:43.215 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THAT WAS RATHER
BRILLIANT, IN FACT.

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:47.886 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: DNA ANALYSTS
SWABBED THE NEEDLE CAPS AND

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.522 size:81% position:41%
FOUND BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:54.493 line:0%

00:09:55.794 --> 00:10:01.567
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AND SCIENTISTS ALSO
FOUND DNA INSIDE THE SYRINGE...

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.270
&gt;&gt; I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT
MS. HERNDON'S DNA WAS PRESENT IN

00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:06.304 align:start position:0%
ONE OF THEM.

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:10.342 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: ...PROOF IT HAD
BEEN USED ON MICHELLE.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:14.513
&gt;&gt; THE SUBSTANCE THAT WAS FOUND
IN THE CATHETER WAS A MIXTURE OF

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:16.782
MICHELLE'S BLOOD AND PROPOFOL.

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:19.585 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: MICHELLE'S DEATH
WAS NOW CLASSIFIED AS A

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:24.623 align:start position:0%
HOMICIDE, AND THE MURDER WEAPON
WAS PROPOFOL.

00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.661 align:start position:0%

PROPOFOL-RELATED DEATH, EVER.

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:32.398 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHO WANTED
MICHELLE DEAD?

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:39.571
&gt;&gt; Narrator: MICHELLE HERNDON'S
DEATH HAD BEEN RULED A HOMICIDE.

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:43.175 align:start position:0%
THE CAUSE OF DEATH -- AN
OVERDOSE OF THE PRESCRIPTION

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:45.778 align:start position:0%
DRUG PROPOFOL.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.981 size:88% position:44%
PROPOFOL IS A SHORT-ACTING

GENERAL ANESTHESIA.

00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:55.821 size:84% position:42%

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:59.625 align:start position:0% line:0%

MIGRAINES.

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:04.096 line:0%

MIGRAINES.

00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:12.504 line:0%

LIFELONG MIGRAINE SUFFERER.

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:18.310 align:start position:0% line:0%

WERE BAD.

00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:20.646 size:88% position:44% line:0%
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER HAD ONE, BUT
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM THESE

THINGS TELL ME THEY'RE JUST
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND WOULD GO

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:26.385 align:start position:0% line:0%
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO GET
SOME RELIEF FROM THE PAIN.

00:11:26.418 --> 00:11:29.221
&gt;&gt; Narrator: WAS IT POSSIBLE
THAT MICHELLE HAD SOUGHT PAIN

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.891 align:start position:0%
MEDICATION FROM SOMEONE<i> OTHER</i>
THAN HER DOCTOR?

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.627
&gt;&gt; THEY JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF
MICHELLE KNEW ANYBODY IN THE

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.762 align:start position:0%
MEDICAL FIELD...

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:39.898 align:start position:0%
THE ONLY PERSON I KNEW WAS
OLIVER.

00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:44.036 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: "OLIVER" WAS
30-YEAR-OLD OLIVER O'QUINN, AN

INTENSIVE-CARE NURSE AT
SHANDS HOSPITAL ON THE CAMPUS OF

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:50.776 size:81% position:41%
THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA.

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:54.546 align:start position:0%
A BACKGROUND CHECK REVEALED
MICHELLE AND OLIVER WERE CASUAL

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:55.481 align:start position:0%
FRIENDS.

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:58.150
&gt;&gt; I'D DESCRIBE HIM AS "QUIRKY."

00:11:58.183 --> 00:12:00.619 align:start position:0%
AND "ODD" IS DEFINITELY A GOOD
ADJECTIVE.

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:04.156
THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
HIM, SOMETHING THAT HE FELT LIKE

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:07.726
HE HAD TO GO THE EXTRA MILE TO
PROVE HIMSELF, WHERE MOST PEOPLE

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:10.195 size:78% position:39%
WOULD JUST BE THEMSELVES.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:13.132 align:start position:0%
THE WAY HE ACTED ABOUT MICHELLE,
I KIND OF KNEW FROM WHEN HE

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.934 align:start position:0%
FIRST MET HER THAT HE HAD HAD A
CRUSH ON HER.

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:19.171 line:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE MADE COMMENTS TO
BOTH HER FRIENDS<i> AND</i> HER MOTHER

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:22.808 align:start position:0% line:0%
THAT HE WAS WEIRD AND THAT SHE
FELT SORRY FOR HIM.

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.311 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THEN POLICE
DISCOVERED SOME TROUBLING

00:12:26.344 --> 00:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
INFORMATION.

00:12:27.512 --> 00:12:30.983
A REVIEW OF MICHELLE'S PHONE
RECORDS SHOWED THAT O'QUINN'S

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:34.953 align:start position:0%
INTEREST IN MICHELLE BORDERED ON
HARASSMENT.

00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:38.590 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE HAD CALLED
MICHELLE HERNDON 43 TIMES IN

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:40.259 align:start position:0%
LESS THAN A MONTH.

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:42.895 align:start position:0%
AND HE HAD CALLED
MICHELLE HERNDON EVERY SINGLE

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.498 align:start position:0%
DAY FOR NINE STRAIGHT DAYS
PRECEDING HER MURDER.

00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:47.800 size:78% position:39%
HE NEVER CALLS HER AGAIN.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.068 align:start position:0%
HE KNOWS THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO
ANSWER.

00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:53.572
&gt;&gt; Narrator: O'QUINN'S JOB IN
THE INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT WOULD

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:57.609 align:start position:0%
HAVE GIVEN HIM ACCESS TO
PEDIATRIC BUTTERFLY I.V.s LIKE

00:12:57.642 --> 00:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
THE ONES FOUND IN MICHELLE'S
TRASH.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:05.217

THEY COULD LINK O'QUINN TO THE

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.685 size:75% position:38%
TWO BOTTLES OF PROPOFOL.

00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:10.155
&gt;&gt; THE IMPORTANT THING TO ME AT
THIS POINT IS TO TRACK THESE

00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:10.755 align:start position:0%
DRUGS.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.224 size:78% position:39%
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?

00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
HOW CAN I PUT THEM IN AN
INDIVIDUAL'S HAND?

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:17.129 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE VIALS OF
PROPOFOL HAVE A

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:21.767 align:start position:0%
NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL NUMBER AND
A LOT NUMBER.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.003 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THOSE SPECIFIC BOTTLES OF
PROPOFOL WERE SHIPPED BY

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:27.773 align:start position:0%
McKESSON DISTRIBUTORS OUT OF
LAKELAND, FLORIDA.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:30.442 align:start position:0%

WERE SHIPPED TO THE

00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:33.812 align:start position:0%
SHANDS HOSPITAL AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA.

00:13:33.845 --> 00:13:36.548 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE SHIPPED DURING THE
TIME PERIOD OF WHEN

00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.617 align:start position:0%
OLIVER O'QUINN WAS EMPLOYED
THERE.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.421 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SPECIFICALLY, THEY
WERE PLACED IN AN AUTOMATED

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:46.592 align:start position:0%
DISPENSING MACHINE IN THE
HOSPITAL I.C.U.

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.928 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I TRACED IT TO A MACHINE THAT
OPERATES KIND OF LIKE A SODA

00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:51.096 align:start position:0%
MACHINE.

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:53.765 align:start position:0%
YOU PUNCH IN THE PATIENT NUMBER,
AND IT DROPS A BOTTLE OF A

00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:56.902 size:88% position:44%
PHARMACEUTICAL IN YOUR HAND.

00:13:56.935 --> 00:14:01.139
&gt;&gt; Narrator: TO GET THE PROPOFOL
FROM THE DISPENSING MACHINE, A

00:14:01.172 --> 00:14:05.277 align:start position:0%
HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE HAD TO ENTER
HIS EMPLOYEE NUMBER.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:12.284 align:start position:0%
AND WHOSE CODE WAS ENTERED TO
GET THESE TWO VIALS?

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:16.255
REGISTERED NURSE OLIVER O'QUINN.

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.491
&gt;&gt; SO, I ACTUALLY HAD THAT
PROPOFOL ALL THE WAY FROM THE

00:14:19.524 --> 00:14:22.961 align:start position:0%
MANUFACTURER IN MASSACHUSETTS TO
OLIVER O'QUINN'S HAND IN THE

SURGICAL-INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT AT
THE HOSPITAL.

00:14:25.697 --> 00:14:29.468 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: ALL INVESTIGATORS
NEEDED NOW WAS A SAMPLE OF

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:35.073
O'QUINN'S DNA TO COMPARE TO THE
DNA ON THE NEEDLE CAPS FOUND IN

00:14:35.106 --> 00:14:37.209 align:start position:0%
MICHELLE'S TRASH.

00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:40.612
WHEN POLICE WENT TO QUESTION
HIM, THEY LEARNED HE HAD FLED

00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:44.016 align:start position:0%
THE COUNTRY AND WAS IN IRELAND,
WHERE HE HAD APPLIED FOR A

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.851 align:start position:0%
NURSING LICENSE.

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.553 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T EVER INTEND ON
COMING BACK TO THE U.S.

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:51.690 align:start position:0%
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EXTRADITE
SOMEONE BACK FROM IRELAND.

00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:55.060 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I SPOKE WITH THE LADY WHO WAS
IN CHARGE OF JUST EXTRADITION

00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:58.864
FROM THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND,
AND I TOLD HER, "LOOK, I'VE GOT

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.299 align:start position:0%
A WARRANT IN MY HAND.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:01.967 size:84% position:42%
I WANT TO ARREST THIS MAN."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.003
AND SHE SAID TO ME, TO THE
EFFECT, YOU KNOW, "SLOW DOWN,

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:06.571 align:start position:0%
COLUMBO.

00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:09.541 align:start position:0%
IT'S GONNA BE -- IT'S A VERY

00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:12.911 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT WHAT WAS
O'QUINN'S MOTIVE TO KILL

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:14.413 align:start position:0%
MICHELLE?

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:19.451 align:start position:0%
AND WOULD INVESTIGATORS FIND A
WAY TO GET HIM BACK TO THE

UNITED STATES?

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:27.960

MICHELLE HERNDON.

00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:35.334 align:start position:0%
FIRST, THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THEIR PRIME SUSPECT,

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:38.503
OLIVER O'QUINN, WOULD KILL HER.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:43.342 align:start position:0%
AND SECOND, O'QUINN HAD FLED THE
UNITED STATES TO IRELAND IN

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.978 size:84% position:42%
ORDER TO AVOID PROSECUTION.

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:50.582 align:start position:0%
TO SMOKE HIM OUT, INVESTIGATORS
CONTACTED<i> THE IRISH TIMES</i>

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:52.250 align:start position:0%
NEWSPAPER.

00:15:52.283 --> 00:15:55.220 align:start position:0% line:0%

MURDER IN THE UNITED STATES,"

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:04.262 align:start position:0% line:0%
AND THEY PUBLISHED IT ON THREE
SEPARATE OCCASIONS.

00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:08.767
&gt;&gt; Narrator: FACING INCREASING
PRESSURE, O'QUINN LEFT IRELAND

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
AND FLEW TO THE WEST-AFRICAN
COUNTRY OF SENEGAL, WHERE HE WAS

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.742
IMMEDIATELY TURNED OVER TO U.S.

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:19.011 align:start position:0%
AUTHORITIES.

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:23.148 align:start position:0%
ONCE IN CUSTODY, INVESTIGATORS
GOT A COURT ORDER TO OBTAIN

00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:29.221
O'QUINN'S DNA SAMPLE, WHICH WAS
THEN COMPARED TO THE DNA FOUND

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.690 align:start position:0%
ON THE SYRINGE CAP.

00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
IT MATCHED.

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:35.460 line:0%
&gt;&gt; TO ME, I WOULD EQUATE THAT
WITH GETTING THE SUSPECT'S

OLIVER MADE A GREAT MANY

MISTAKES, THANK GOODNESS.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:46.705 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: OLIVER O'QUINN WAS
CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE

00:16:46.738 --> 00:16:47.873 align:start position:0%
MURDER.

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:52.110 align:start position:0%
THE ONLY REMAINING QUESTION WAS
MOTIVE.

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:55.647 line:0%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW HE TRIED VERY HARD TO
INFUSE HIMSELF INTO MICHELLE'S

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.385 line:0%
LIFE, AND, MOSTLY OUT OF PITY
AND FEELING SORRY FOR HIM, SHE

00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:03.488 align:start position:0% line:0%
WOULD BRING HIM ALONG TO DO
THINGS WITH, TO GO OUT TO WATCH

00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:07.259 align:start position:0% line:0%
A BAND, TO MEET IN THE MORNING
AND HAVE COFFEE.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:11.596
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT IN CUSTODY,
OLIVER TOLD A FELLOW INMATE HE

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:15.667 align:start position:0%
GREW ANGRY WITH MICHELLE BECAUSE
HE OVERHEARD HER DURING A

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.871
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION SAYING
SOMETHING UNFLATTERING ABOUT

00:17:19.904 --> 00:17:20.972 align:start position:0%
HIM.

00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:24.776 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE MADE SOME COMMENTS OF A
DEROGATORY NATURE ABOUT

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:28.113
OLIVER O'QUINN -- COMMENTS THAT
SHE DIDN'T EXPECT FOR HIM TO

00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:29.681 align:start position:0%
HEAR, BUT HE DID HEAR.

00:17:29.714 --> 00:17:35.087
&gt;&gt; Narrator: HE HEARD MICHELLE
REFER TO HIM AS "AN ANNOYING

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.288 align:start position:0%
LITTLE MAN."

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:40.058
&gt;&gt; AND WE BELIEVE, BECAUSE OF
THAT, THAT SENT HIM INTO THIS

00:17:40.091 --> 00:17:44.129
MIND-SET THAT, "IF YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO BE MINE, THEN YOU'RE

00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:45.730 size:81% position:41%
NEVER GONNA BE ANYBODY'S."

00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:49.301
&gt;&gt; AND THE INMATE STATED THAT
OLIVER CONFIDED TO HIM THAT SHE

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:52.237 align:start position:0%
NEEDED A LONG SLEEP.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.174 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: PROSECUTORS BELIEVE
O'QUINN HATCHED A PLAN.

00:17:56.207 --> 00:18:00.278
HE TOLD MICHELLE THE NEXT TIME
SHE HAD A MIGRAINE HEADACHE,

00:18:00.311 --> 00:18:04.850
HE'D BE WILLING TO COME TO HER
APARTMENT AND GIVE HER SOMETHING

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:10.222 align:start position:0%
THAT WOULD GET RID OF THE PAIN
QUICKLY.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:14.626
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS HE GOT THE
PROPOFOL FROM WORK, TYPING HIS

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:18.430 size:78% position:39%
EMPLOYEE NUMBER INTO THE
MEDICATION-CONTROL SYSTEM

00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:26.438 align:start position:0%
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT
THIS VERY ABUSE.

00:18:26.471 --> 00:18:30.842 align:start position:0%
THEN HE WAITED FOR MICHELLE TO
CALL.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:36.715 align:start position:0%
WHEN SHE DID, OLIVER PUT HIS
PLAN INTO ACTION.

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:40.485
ON THE NIGHT MICHELLE HAD THE
MIGRAINE, OLIVER STOPPED BY HER

00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:43.889 align:start position:0%
APARTMENT ON HIS WAY HOME FROM
WORK.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:48.793 align:start position:0%
HE INJECTED MICHELLE WITH A
LETHAL DOSE OF PROPOFOL USING A

00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:51.730 size:75% position:38%
SMALL PEDIATRIC SYRINGE.

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:56.434
BUT HE DID SOMETHING MEDICAL
PROFESSIONALS OFTEN DO -- USED

00:18:56.467 --> 00:19:01.840
HIS TEETH TO PULL THE PLASTIC
CAP OFF THE SYRINGE AND LEFT

00:19:01.873 --> 00:19:06.745 align:start position:0%
BEHIND THE DNA THAT LATER
IDENTIFIED HIM.

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:13.451 align:start position:0%
MICHELLE WAS DEAD WITHIN
SECONDS.

00:19:13.484 --> 00:19:18.456 align:start position:0%
HE POSITIONED HER ARM UNDERNEATH
HER BODY SO THE NEEDLE MARK

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:24.529
WOULDN'T BE EASILY NOTICEABLE.

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:28.700 align:start position:0%
HE THREW THE SYRINGES AND
PROPOFOL BOTTLES INTO A PLASTIC

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:32.804
BAG, WHICH HE TOSSED INTO THE
DUMPSTER BEHIND MICHELLE'S

00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:37.709
RENTED HOME, NOT REALIZING THE
OBVIOUS -- THAT THOSE SERIAL

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:40.412 size:75% position:38%
NUMBERS COULD BE TRACED.

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:44.449 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT THE PAIN WAS
SUCH THAT SHE ENTRUSTED

00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:47.886 align:start position:0%
OLIVER O'QUINN TO ADMINISTER THE
PAIN RELIEVER.

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:50.789 size:84% position:42%
AND I THINK THAT HE TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THAT TRUST AND

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.692 align:start position:0%
INTENTIONALLY TOOK HER LIFE WITH
THE PROPOFOL.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:58.063 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: OLIVER O'QUINN WENT
ON TRIAL FOR FIRST-DEGREE

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.231 align:start position:0%
MURDER.

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:03.168
HIS DEFENSE CLAIMED HE GAVE
MICHELLE THE PROPOFOL TO HELP

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:06.805 align:start position:0%
RELIEVE THE PAIN FROM HER
MIGRAINE HEADACHE BUT

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:10.742
ACCIDENTALLY GAVE HER TOO MUCH.

00:20:10.775 --> 00:20:14.112 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION OF PROPOFOL TO

00:20:14.145 --> 00:20:17.449 align:start position:0% line:0%
MICHELLE HERNDON WAS AN
ACCIDENTAL DEATH.

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:20.085 align:start position:0%
THIS WAS AN ACTION CONSISTENT
WITH HOMICIDE.

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:23.255 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE JURY DIDN'T
BELIEVE IT, EITHER.

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:27.125 size:75% position:38%
O'QUINN WAS CONVICTED OF
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:31.563 align:start position:0%
SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON
WITHOUT PAROLE.

00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:36.201 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST-REPORTED
CASE EVER INVOLVING MURDER BY

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:40.772 line:0%
THE USE OF PROPOFOL, SO THIS
ENTIRE CASE WAS DRIVEN BY AND

00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:42.173 align:start position:0% line:0%
SOLVED BY FORENSICS.

00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:46.044 line:0%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO EYEWITNESS, SO
HOW DO YOU PUT A PERSON THERE

00:20:46.077 --> 00:20:48.113 align:start position:0% line:0%
WITHOUT EVIDENCE?

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:51.082 align:start position:0% line:0%
I MEAN, WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE, I
DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE

00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:52.350 align:start position:0% line:0%
WORKED.

00:20:52.383 --> 00:20:56.087 line:0%
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY DID THEIR JOB, AND
THEY DID A GREAT JOB, AND IT ALL

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.255 align:start position:0% line:0%
CAME TOGETHER.

00:20:57.288 --> 00:21:00.592 line:0%
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER HAD A CASE WHERE
THE SMALL THINGS MATTERED SO

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.826 align:start position:0% line:0%
MUCH...

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.530 align:start position:0% line:0%
WHERE SOMETHING AS SMALL AS A
NEEDLE MARK OR THE AMOUNT OF DNA

00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:09.334 line:0%
LEFT ON A NEEDLE CAP PLAYED SUCH
A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE RESOLUTION

00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:10.535 align:start position:0% line:0%
OF THE CASE.
