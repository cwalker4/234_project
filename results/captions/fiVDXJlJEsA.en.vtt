00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
- Well, it's a new year, it's a new you.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.180
And this episode is all
about taking control

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.904
of your money with the Baby Steps.

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:10.487
(upbeat music)

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.150
Can you believe it, you guys?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.160
It is 2019.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.910
We are a week into the new year,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.580
and it is just already so fantastic.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.670
So, a lot of you are going to have

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.000
some New Year's resolutions

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.870
that you're going to be working toward,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.330
and some of them are going to be
some financial resolutions.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.350
In fact, the second
most popular resolution

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.130
in America is paying off debt.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.410
So if that is you, you have
come to the right place.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.660
Because for 25 years,
there is a proven plan

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.320
that has helped millions
of people get out of debt,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.350
live on a budget, fund
retirement, fund college,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.900
pay off their house, and be
able to be crazy generous.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.180
I mean, all the things.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.750
And I'm dedicating this
entire episode to this plan.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.420
The plan is called the Baby Steps.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.253
And I'm really excited about it

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:11.390
because I'm going to bring on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.120
two special guests to help me out.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.590
You're probably not going to be
very shocked on who they are.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640
That's right—Dave Ramsey is coming over

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.970
and Mr. Chris Hogan.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.690
So, we're going to be sitting down together,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.390
walking through this plan.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230
Now some of you—you
have completed the plan.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.650
You're just like, being
incredibly generous,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.630
making all the money.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.020
You're doing awesome.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.930
Some of you are in the
middle of this journey.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.360
Maybe you're paying off debt

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.080
or you're funding your emergency fund.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.090
And others of you haven't even started.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.480
But no matter where you are,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.500
you're going to enjoy this episode.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.640
But I can't stress it enough—

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.000
for you to win, you have to have a plan.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.930
And the Baby Steps are seven steps

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.810
that are so easy to understand,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.840
so you're not going to be
confused in this episode.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.080
You're not going to be like, what?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.040
No, very easy to understand.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.867
But here's the kicker: It's hard to do.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.784
(soft piano music)

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.690
All right, this is the time in the show,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.880
Real Talk with Rachel,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.710
where it's usually me
talking about how I decided

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.790
to quit the marathon, quit training,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.670
because running is stupid for me.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.550
It's true.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.960
Or maybe about me purchasing a workout app

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.190
that was a hundred dollars
that I've never used.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.160
You know, all the things
that I've messed up on,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.550
which I'm great at sharing.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.420
But I decided that this Real
Talk—it's gonna be about you.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.020
Because you need to have
Real Talk with yourself.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.600
That's right. If you're
sitting there watching this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.040
and you're like, I am
miserable financially.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.560
I feel like we're living
paycheck to paycheck,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.150
we're not making progress.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.580
I need something different.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.610
Well, guess what?

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.530
This is your year.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.550
But here's the deal,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.350
if you don't like where you've been

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.870
and you don't like the results,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.620
you have to change.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.290
That is the definition of insanity:

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.560
Doing the same thing
over and over again

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.230
and expecting a different result.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.230
You have to do something different.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.320
But that is going to be
very uncomfortable for you

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.940
and it's going to be hard.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.360
But it is worth it.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.060
None of us like change.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.470
When you get in a habit of something,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.590
changing is really, really hard.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.710
But again, in order to make
better results for your money,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.400
you have to change.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.310
So I want you to look at
yourself in the mirror

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.050
and you say, okay, I'm doing this.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.330
I'm gonna do something different.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.040
And here's the deal—if
you feel overwhelmed,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.870
why don't you try this
for the next six months.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.020
In July, if you hate this plan

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.430
and you like your old life better,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.710
go back to your old life.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.380
Listen, I'm not mad about it.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.920
But I guarantee you, 99%
of you are going to be like,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.190
this is the most free I
have ever felt with my money

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.270
because suddenly you have
learned to control your money—

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.040
and your money doesn't control you.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.810
So, that's the deal, you guys.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.270
New year, new you.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.563
We're going to change.

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:50.146
(upbeat music)

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.010
Well, you're still here,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.490
so we're going to begin the
journey with Baby Step 1,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.900
which is save a thousand dollars

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.150
in the bank as a starter emergency fund.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.420
This is key because this is
going to be your cushion

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.370
between you and life before Baby Step 2.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.810
So, this is a very important step.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.740
But here's the deal—

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.320
this is probably the easiest
step of the Baby Steps,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.810
but it's also the hardest.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.930
It's the easiest because
it's a thousand dollars.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.060
Like, you can do this within
a few weeks or a few months.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.580
Like, I want you to do
this so, so quickly.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.880
You know, work extra if you have to,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.580
sell something, do whatever you can.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.570
Scrape up a thousand
dollars and put it away.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.270
That's all you gotta do.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.710
But it's going to be the hardest step

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.920
because that means that
you are now entering

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.790
into a journey that you have
never experienced before.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.050
And you're actually saying out loud,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.410
okay, I'm doing this.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.440
I'm going to be committed to this change.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.870
But this thousand dollars,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.770
it is going to be like the
pat on your back going forward

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.810
because once you can accomplish this,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.760
you're going to have more money in savings

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.340
than the majority of Americans,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.340
and it's going to feel so incredible.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.250
So, how do you get a thousand dollars?

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.940
Well, here are 10 quick ways

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.910
for you to save a thousand dollars.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.330
Number one: get an extra job.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.970
Bring in some extra income.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.440
Maybe you want to drive
for Uber, wait tables,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.530
or maybe you have a skill like photography,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.860
and you can charge for it.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.380
Whatever it is, find that
extra income—work extra.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.620
Number two: work overtime
at your current job.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.030
Make some money.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.170
Number three: sell something.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.040
You guys, we have so much crap
in our lives and in our house

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.100
that we don't need, that we don't use.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.550
Get rid of it!

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.890
And then, after you're
further along in the steps,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.570
maybe if you want to go back and
buy something else, you can.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.030
But for now, get rid of it
and sell it and make money.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.390
Number four: stop eating
out for a couple of months.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.820
That's right. Restaurants—
quick place to spend money.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.460
Number five: get rid of cable.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.760
Number six: drop memberships
and subscriptions

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.810
that you aren't using like
Spotify or your gym membership.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.240
If you're not using
these things, drop them.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.970
Don't pay for them every month.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.280
Number seven: Airbnb your
house while you're out of town.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.460
Number eight: shop your insurance rates.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.410
You can save a lot of money doing this.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.540
Check out our ELP program
by clicking the link below.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.780
Number nine: reevaluate
your cell phone plan.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.630
Look and say—okay, are
we using all the data?

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.610
Maybe we can change something,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.937
maybe we can go get a cheaper plan

00:06:16.937 --> 00:06:18.740
and save a lot of money that way.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.610
And number 10: buy generic brands.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.680
Medication, makeup, food, all the things.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.960
Make sure that you are
saving money that way.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.550
And to help you keep track
of the thousand dollars

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.550
you're saving for and to help you reach

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.170
your other financial
goals as you pay off debt,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.360
make sure to download my goal tracker.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.050
So click the link below for that.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.040
Alright, coming up next is the man

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.420
who created the Baby Steps, my dad,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.218
Dave Ramsey, to talk us
through Baby Step 2.

00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:50.801
(upbeat music)

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.270
Well, welcome back to the show.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.350
- Wow, I'm here.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.370
- I know. You're back.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.046
Thanks, you couldn't stay away.

00:07:00.046 --> 00:07:01.420
I know, I know.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.780
- Well, The Rachel Cruze Show calls, you come.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.430
- It is true, people, it is true.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.010
So, we're on to Baby Step 2,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.890
and Baby Step 2 is paying off

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.700
all of your debt except for your house.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.960
And you do this by
using the debt snowball,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.040
and that is where you list
out all of your debts,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.270
smallest to largest, regardless
of the interest rate,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.630
pay minimum payments on everything,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.490
and you pay off the smallest debt first.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.230
And so, we find that people
gain incredible traction

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.830
and they really win with this method.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.280
And, on average, people are
getting completely out of debt,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.630
except for their house,
in 18 to 24 months.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.840
So, it's pretty powerful—this whole idea.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.320
So, when you started this whole program.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.080
I mean, you're like the Godfather

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.420
of the Baby Steps and all of the things.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.470
So what caused you, first and foremost,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.830
to be like, yeah, you
need to be debt-free.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.470
Like, what's the point
of even being debt-free?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.950
Those people watching that are like, eh?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:52.783
Is it that big of a deal?

00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:54.240
What would you say?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.590
- Well, I mean, I saw in the Bible

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.560
that it says the borrower
is slave to the lender,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.590
and we had just gone broke

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.270
and lost everything because of that.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.760
And so, just from a risk-management standpoint—

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.650
that's where it started,
because it's like pain avoidance,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.110
because we've been through
so much crap, you know?

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.050
And then the next thing that happened was

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.990
I started realizing you actually—

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.530
your most powerful wealth-building tool is your income.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.940
And when you don't give
it to someone else,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.830
you can use it to become
an everyday millionaire.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.180
You can use it to change your family tree.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.040
You can use it to be
outrageously generous.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.990
But when you give it all to Countrywide

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.490
and Citibank and Lexus
in the form of payments

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.577
and Mastercard and Visa and
American Express, and so on.

00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:41.220
You know, you don't have any money.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.310
And so it's kind of a math thing

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.580
that you're giving up your power,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.780
your mathematical power to build wealth.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.810
- It's so good, and there's such freedom.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.260
We've talked about it on the show.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.060
Not only mathematically and financially—

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.830
when you don't have debt
and you don't have payments—

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.510
but emotionally and spiritually.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.340
It changes your whole life,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.390
your whole being when
you have no payments.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.280
When you don't owe anyone anything,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.630
you do have this sense of freedom

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.590
that you get to choose things in your life

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.410
that you otherwise wouldn't be able to

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.260
if you had to go to that job

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.230
and make that money just to pay the bills.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.970
- And, you know, I kinda
thought the first time,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.360
my first understanding of the borrower

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.150
is slave to the lender was the math thing.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.007
- Yep.

00:09:19.007 --> 00:09:20.770
- That when you give all
your money to someone else,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.370
you're kinda owned by them, right?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.660
I got that part.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.610
But what I didn't realize is,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.003
slaves don't have choices.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.150
Slaves—it's tough to have relationships because people are pulling you around.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.620
You know, you're going to
a job you hate everyday,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.090
putting up a toxic environment
just to pay freaking bills.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:43.090
You know, slavery has
societal, relational,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.170
spiritual, not to mention
mathematical, implications.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.370
And so that Scripture really
does have a lot of layers.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.430
You can just keep peeling them
off and then it keeps going.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.380
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.330
So, when you look at the math side

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.390
of doing the debt snowball

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.020
and paying it off smallest to largest,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.681
I've heard the argument
over and over again.

00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:01.514
(Dave groans)

00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:03.150
We should pay off the
highest interest rate first

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.850
because mathematically, that's correct.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.230
And we laugh all the time like,

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.063
well, if you're doing math,

00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:08.340
you wouldn't be in credit card debt.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.370
So math doesn't always
apply to the situation.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.620
But 25 years ago, when you started this

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.650
and you fought against that,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.700
what made you do smallest to largest?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.200
What was kind of the "aha" moment?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.750
- Well, what we realized
was the problem is not math.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.230
And if the problem's not math,
you can't fix it with math.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.270
The problem is the person in the mirror.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.900
And so, what happened was,
the first thing I ever did,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.410
you know, in terms of
interacting with the public,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.120
trying to help people,
was one-on-one coaching.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.770
And we would have people come
in that were in foreclosure

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.150
and they were behind on
their credit card bills,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.320
and I would get everything
arranged in their budget

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.220
to where they could get caught up.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.300
And then they would be okay
and avoid their bankruptcy.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.310
It was a one-on-one coaching
session, that's all we had.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.250
- Yep.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.877
- And then I would see them six
months later and I would go,

00:10:50.877 --> 00:10:51.710
How's it going?

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:52.900
"Oh, we filed bankruptcy."

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.908
What?

00:10:53.908 --> 00:10:56.690
You know, I had all the math done for you.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.460
And it wasn't a math thing.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.293
- Yep.

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:00.640
- It was a behavior thing.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.690
The stuff that was going on in their lives

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.600
was still going on in their lives,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.200
and if you don't change the
person, the math doesn't change.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.920
When people change, numbers change.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.050
That's what Hogan says.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.980
Not when numbers change, people change.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.040
It doesn't go that way.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.860
So, what we figured out
was that personal finance,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.700
and we say it all the time,

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.010
is 80% behavior, 20% head knowledge.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.710
The problem is not math.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.930
The problem is me, I'm
the geek, I'm the guy.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.200
When the problem is
chocolate chip cookies,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.009
if I'm trying to lose weight, you know?

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:34.010
So we figured out the chocolate

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.690
chip cookies are not the problem.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.700
It's the guy eating the cookies.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.040
It's 80% behavior, it's
20% head knowledge.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.190
You know we really—

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.960
you cannot work out enough to lose weight

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.310
if you eat an elephant.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.020
I mean, you just can't do it.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.580
And the same thing is true
here with your money situation.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.280
You know, you cannot make enough money

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.730
to outearn your stupidity.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.655
I tried it.

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:01.470
I'm good at making money,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.160
but you have got to control
the person in your mirror.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.970
And once we understand that, then we go,

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.520
well, if we're going to solve this—

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.570
if it's a psychological behavior problem,

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.010
then we're going to solve
it with a psychological

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.480
behavior answer/solution.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.620
And so that's why the debt snowball works.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.710
And all these other theories,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.420
and all these people who
want to talk about this

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.630
are just people that don't want to do it.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.940
They don't want to do the hard work

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.960
of dealing with the person in your mirror.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.750
That's harder work than trying to find

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.540
some math thing that fixes it.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.910
Math thing's not going to fix it.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.410
It's not going to fix it.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.590
The thing that's going to fix
it is when you fix you.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.140
That's it.
- And yes, it is.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.040
It is so true. But the hard thing is,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.400
no one likes change, right?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.550
You've been doing the same
thing over and over again

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.580
and you get in this rhythm in life,

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.900
and to get out of that orbit
and to do something different

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.500
is hard and it's intimidating.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.770
So, what would you say
to someone that's like,

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.420
I know I need to, but I
don't even know what to do,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.470
if I can even do this.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.452
Like, what would you say

00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:55.285
to someone?
- List from smallest

00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:57.750
to largest, when you pass
the little one, you'll go,

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.660
maybe I can.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.493
- Yep.

00:12:59.493 --> 00:13:01.760
- And then, when the
second one goes (gasps).

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760
Maybe I can (gasps).

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.330
And your hope starts to increase

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.176
because your successful level increases.

00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:08.009
- Yep.

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:10.547
- You know, the first time
the child rides the bicycle

00:13:10.547 --> 00:13:12.025
and you let go of the seat,

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:14.480
(gasps) maybe I can.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.560
That's all it is.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.540
And it's a behavior thing because
you're building confidence

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.750
and hope and you're saying,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.990
this system will work.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.880
Maybe, finally I can get
control of my money.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.840
- Yep, it's so good.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.930
And I think when you get
to the point in your life,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.830
and we say this over and over
again, that you say like,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.610
I'm sick and tired of
being sick and tired.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.610
Because I do talk to some people like,

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.070
yeah, I kinda sorta think I
wanna kinda get out of debt,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.800
maybe, kind of. (laughs)

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.250
I'm like, yeah, that's
probably not gonna happen

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.570
because getting out of debt's hard, right?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.840
It takes sacrifice, it
takes intentionality.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.673
So what would you say to someone?

00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:45.480
Because a lot of people watching

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.900
are in the middle of getting out of debt.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.860
So what encouragement would you give them?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.693
- It's hard.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.310
But it's worth it.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.020
It's hard, but it's worth it.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.750
You know, putting up with
your spouse at times is hard,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.030
but Sharon and I've been married 37 years.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.250
It's worth it.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.000
I get to play with grandbabies,
my babies, and you know,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.530
it's worth it to pay a price to win.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.360
It's worth it, but it's hard.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.925
If it was easy, everybody'd be rich.

00:14:14.925 --> 00:14:17.570
- (laughs) So good, so good.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:18.850
Okay, you guys, that's it!

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.760
Baby Step 2. You heard it straight

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.630
from the horse's mouth.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.850
(Dave laughs)
Is that a saying?

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.528
- Could be the mouth.
- Is that a saying?

00:14:24.528 --> 00:14:26.680
(Dave and Rachel laugh)

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.630
So good, okay.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.130
Well, we're going to bring
you back on the show

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.390
later on the episode to talk
about another Baby Step,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.402
so thanks for being here.

00:14:33.402 --> 00:14:35.985
(upbeat music)

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.650
Once you are completely debt
free, except for your house,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.410
the next step is Baby Step 3,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.800
and that is getting three to six months

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.900
of expenses saved in the bank.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.080
A question I get asked a lot is,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.300
Well, should we have like
three months of expenses

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.930
or should we be more like six?

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.480
And I'm like, it doesn't really matter.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.650
Wherever you want to go.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.200
And I'll be honest, it's funny.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.680
Usually a lot of men land at
like the three-month mark.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.630
Like, once they get three
months, they're like,

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.020
alright, let's move on, Baby Step 4.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.660
A lot of women are like,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.180
I like to be more around
the six-month mark.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.030
Women's number one financial
fear is the lack of security.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.960
So naturally, they're going to lean

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.350
more toward the six month.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.500
I know I do.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.690
We actually have an emergency
fund for our emergency fund

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.310
because that way I just want to make sure

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.480
we have a ton in savings.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.540
It just makes me feel better,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.020
so I personally lean more toward six.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.440
Winston's probably like most guys.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.010
He'd probably lean more toward three.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.550
But whatever you want to do.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.490
Now again, these expenses
are your operating expenses.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.650
This is not you, you know, budgeting,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.770
Okay, if I wanna go on a
huge fashion shopping spree

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.040
or we're going to go on vacation.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.370
No, no, no, your operating expenses.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.130
Like, what is the amount
of money you need to have

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.580
to keep the lights on, to
keep food on the table,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.990
to keep things operating
like they would be otherwise?

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.360
That is what the emergency fund is for.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.730
It's there in case of a job loss,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.990
it's there in case of a medical emergency.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.930
Whatever comes up that is
unexpected and a big emergency—

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.550
this fund is there to catch you.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.870
It's like your major safety
net between you and life.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.160
And you have to think
of this as insurance,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.380
not an investment.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.530
Say it with me through
your phone or computer:

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.570
Insurance, not an investment.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.430
You're going to get a pile
of money saved in the bank

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.470
and some of you out
there are going to be like,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.230
oh my gosh, we could invest this

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.420
and make so much more money.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.660
It's just sitting there, making nothing.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.140
Listen, that is what it is for.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.040
You have to think of this as insurance.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.210
Because you want to be
able to keep it liquid—

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.510
you wanna be able to get to it quickly.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.010
So, I would recommend having
this in a money market account,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.690
or even you could do a
traditional savings account.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.340
But it needs to be there so
that you can get to it quickly.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.560
I went into my Facebook community

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.980
and I found some people
that are in Baby Step 3,

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.127
and this is what they said:

00:17:01.127 --> 00:17:02.917
"It feels like my worries dissipated

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.480
because of no-debt life

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.277
and the fact I was able to accomplish

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:08.577
Baby Step 2 on schedule.

00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:11.467
Losing extra overtime
to spend with my kids

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:13.377
doesn't bother me anymore.

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:16.487
That was the very
surprising experience I had.

00:17:16.487 --> 00:17:18.777
I listen to the podcast every day,

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:21.807
write on my journal, do
my budget religiously,

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:25.947
and being intentionally
positive 98% of the time.

00:17:25.947 --> 00:17:29.700
Single mom of two here
and it can be done."

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.170
Melrose, you're killing it.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.500
Such a great job.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.407
Tiffany said, "We stayed
motivated by sacrificing a lot

00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:39.277
so that we could see a lot of
progress being made quickly.

00:17:39.277 --> 00:17:40.717
We looked at our budget often

00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:44.517
and forecasted when we would
get the next $10,000 paid off

00:17:44.517 --> 00:17:47.237
and when we would be
completely debt-free.

00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:49.047
It feels great knowing that

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:51.457
we were on our way to building wealth now

00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:54.330
instead of just paying
for bad decisions."

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.610
Guys, Baby Step 3—it is possible.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.390
It is possible, and
could you just sit there

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.860
and imagine having no debt

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.270
and having three to six months

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.260
of expenses saved in the bank?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.740
Incredible. It put you at a
completely different place

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.260
mentally and financially.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.230
It's so great.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.610
You can do this.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.350
Alright, coming up next is
the man with the voice of God

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.400
Chris Hogan.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.983
(upbeat music)

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.436
Welcome back, Hogan.

00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:27.657
- Thank you, it's good to be with you.

00:18:27.657 --> 00:18:28.490
- Thank you!

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.740
Seriously, last time you
were on, everyone raved.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.927
They loved you, so I was like,

00:18:31.927 --> 00:18:32.957
gotta get him back.
- Oh, they're so nice.

00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:35.010
You're nice. You all are very nice.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.600
- Okay, so now we're in the
process of the Baby Steps

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.900
where you are completely debt-free,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.960
you have a fully funded emergency fund.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.210
So Baby Steps 1, 2, and
3, you do individually.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.410
Now Baby Steps 4, 5,
and 6, you do all together.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.930
- Rachel, thank you for
for pointing that out

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.800
because a lot of people
get confused there.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.340
So it is important—you're doing 4,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.450
5, and 6 at the same time.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.830
- But in this order.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.330
So, Baby Step 4 is—

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.380
- Yes, this is where you're investing 15%

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.510
of your household income into
retirement types of accounts.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.210
Rachel, that can be 401(k)s,
403(b)s, IRAs, or Roth IRAs.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.470
It's very important to set

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.530
that money aside each and every month.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.360
So, you want to sign up to
where it's done automatically—

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.830
it's not anything you have to think of.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.790
You can do that in your HR department

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.300
as you enroll in your 401(k).

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.240
But listen, make sure you get with

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.170
an investment professional to guide you.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.680
They're a lot of options of
things that you can invest in,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.960
but you want to make sure you're
picking the right things.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.260
But as you do this 15%
of household income,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.460
over time what'll happen is
you'll start to build wealth.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.790
This is not money for a
down payment on a home.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.340
This is not money for a wedding,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.420
and Rachel, it's not money for a vacation.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.300
So let that money sit
there and grow for you.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.260
I promise you, it will put you on the path

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.620
to becoming an everyday millionaire.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.839
- Because if someone cashes
out that money early,

00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:49.672
what happens?

00:19:49.672 --> 00:19:50.550
- Well, there's a lot of penalties.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.550
I mean, I tell people you could lose 40%

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.000
or more of that money
to taxes and penalties.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.510
So, you don't want to do that.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.060
You want to leave that money alone,

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.020
and if there's something
you're wanting to save up for,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.650
get an extra job, work
overtime, get some cash.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.370
But this is a dream fund.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.640
A lot of people don't understand,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.360
with the 401(k) and 403(b),

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.210
what you're trying to do is save up

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.440
enough money to replace
your paycheck later.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.660
So the money you're putting in

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.570
will become your paycheck later in life.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.010
But we need to let it sit there.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.000
Rachel, money has two best friends.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.470
- Ooh, BFFs.
- Time and compound interest.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.560
So when you put money in your 401(k)

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.030
and let it sit, it'll grow.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:26.863
- So good.

00:20:26.863 --> 00:20:28.900
So that kind of reminded me that you guys,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.770
if you're on Baby Steps
1, 2,or 3,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.060
that means you are not funding retirement.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.930
You're stopping retirement.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.880
Now that's going to freak
some people out because—

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.703
especially people that have
been doing it for a while.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:38.790
- It is.
- The fact that they have

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.887
to stop, they're going to be okay, right?

00:20:40.887 --> 00:20:42.027
- Right. Oh, you're going to be okay.

00:20:42.027 --> 00:20:43.260
And what I've told people,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.280
because a lot of people have said that.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.140
Chris, I don't want to stop.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.847
I said, Okay, don't
think of it as stopping.

00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:48.210
Let's pause.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.210
We're going to pause the
401(k) so you can give

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.130
all your effort and attention
to attacking the debt.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.010
And so it helps them to be able to see it.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.250
And someone said, "Well,
Chris, I feel bad."

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.077
I go, "Yes, feel bad about the debt.

00:20:59.077 --> 00:21:01.417
So move focus forward faster

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:03.010
so you can start investing again."

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.180
- That's good, so Baby Step 4—

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.700
you're taking care of
yourself with retirement.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.010
And then you go on to Baby Step 5,

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.760
which is funding your kids' college.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.700
So, there's a couple of
ways you can do this.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.040
You can do it through an ESA,

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.550
which is an Educational Savings Account.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.040
And this is great
because it grows tax-free.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.810
Now, there is a limit of how much

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.160
you can put in per year
and an income limit.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.330
So if you make too much money,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.560
you may not qualify for an ESA.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.350
But if you do, what's great
is you look at it and you say,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.760
Okay, let's just say
you have a newborn baby

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.210
and you start putting
$2,000 in every year.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.910
By the time they're 18 years old,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.340
they're going to have $120,000
to be able to go to college.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.740
I mean, it's phenomenal.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.573
So starting early.

00:21:41.573 --> 00:21:42.840
Now, some people, you're like,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.210
okay, that's great if I had a newborn,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.370
but I have a 10 year old.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.810
So if you do the math that way,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.670
if you fund it for just 10 years,

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.930
let's say, maybe eight years,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.620
it's going to be around $38,000,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.320
which is still a great
head start into college savings.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.210
But if you can't do the ESA—

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.800
again because you want to put more money

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.260
in your college account,
your kid's college account,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.330
or you make too much money to qualify—

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.860
then you can look into 529 plans.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.270
And a 529 plan I would
say, like your retirement—

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.980
you're going to want to go and talk

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.680
to someone who's a professional in this

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.040
because there are some bad plans out there.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.873
- There are.

00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:16.590
I don't like the state-directed ones.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.360
State-directed means they're picking out

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.600
what you can invest in.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.723
I want people to have freedom and options

00:22:20.723 --> 00:22:22.580
to be able to pick what works for them.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.330
- Yes, so talk to a SmartVestor Pro

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.150
for all the things with retirement,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.870
and when you're starting
to fun your kids' college.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.250
But the beautiful thing
about college too is that

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.440
if you are at the point and you're like,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.290
wow, I have a junior in high school

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.123
or a senior in high school

00:22:35.123 --> 00:22:36.660
and we aren't even on Baby—

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.050
you know, we're doing Baby Step 4—

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.930
and we're just now
starting Baby Step 5.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.220
You can still help your
kids go to college debt-free

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.750
because people can still go
to college debt-free today.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.780
- Oh, they really can.
- It is true.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.840
- And Rachel, guess what?

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840
I tell people all the time.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
They go, well, my kid,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.930
I don't want them to work
while they're going to school.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.110
Well, listen to me.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.440
Yes, they can.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.350
They can work and go to school at night,

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.500
or they can work at night and go to school

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.333
during the day.
- Or part time!

00:22:58.333 --> 00:22:59.940
I mean, yes, it's insane, I know.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.460
And actually, students
that work 20 hours a week

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.756
graduate with higher GPAs
than students that don't work.

00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:06.589
Isn't that fascinating?
- Well, and Rachel,

00:23:06.589 --> 00:23:09.110
they learn time management,
they learn life skills

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.390
that they're going to have to
apply when they graduate.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.110
Oh, and by the way, there are scholarships

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.550
and grants out there too, Rachel.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.330
I've heard you tell people
about that for years.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.600
- Yes, that's free money.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.410
And then also parents out there—

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.500
number one piece of advice through all of this,

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.060
if you have a student going to
school soon is school choice.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.660
Picking a school you can afford.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.110
Private colleges on
average are costing $26,000

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.910
a year in tuition versus
an in-state school,

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.260
which is around $14,000.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.420
Community colleges are sometimes free,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.660
depending on your state,
and even as low as $5,000.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.290
So, check out those options.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.420
Don't just assume, okay,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.090
my kids have to go to a private college

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.840
or this great college to succeed.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.300
That's a lie. That's not true.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.430
So, you're funding, again,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.010
retirement with Baby Step 4,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.360
and then the extra money you have,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.970
you're putting toward your kids' college

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.490
in an ESA or a 529 plan.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.060
And then you're going to put any other

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.900
extra money you have toward the house,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.330
which is Baby Step 6.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.760
- Yes, Baby Step 6 is about attacking

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.970
and paying off the house.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:06.970
You know, a lot of people say,

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.740
Chris, the American
dream is to buy a home.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.820
No, the American dream is to own a home.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.040
There's a difference
between buying and owning.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.100
Buying is where you've
signed the paperwork, right?

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.930
I'm a former banker, I know that.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.820
But owning it is where you've
attacked it and paid it off.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.000
So, a couple of things
I want to tell people.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.970
As you're doing Baby Steps 4 and 5,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.110
you're saving for your future,
you're saving for college,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.920
I want you to throw any
extra money toward the house.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.980
An extra $200–300 a month
will make a big difference

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.750
in you attacking and paying off the home.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.633
And a lot of people, Rachel,

00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:41.160
have never envisioned them
owning their home, right?

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.660
And this is where you have it.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.070
They'll send you the deed in the mail,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.910
and that means you
don't owe on it anymore.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.200
So, how do you get there?

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.780
You have to do it intentionally.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.780
So that's looking at it—

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.310
be aware—and budgeting
is absolutely crucial.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.784
And so if you're out there right now,

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.820
and you've got a 30-year
fixed rate mortgage,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.110
I want you to go get a quote

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.470
on refinancing to a 15-year fixed.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.303
- That's good.

00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:03.570
- The payment's going to go up $400–500,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.500
but we're talking about a
difference of 15 years, Rachel.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.770
This is a big deal.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.520
So, for the people that are intentional,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.900
attacking and paying off
the house is a big step.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.120
But imagine this.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.170
Let's say you're behind saving
for retirement a little bit.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.370
Imagine your mortgage payment
not leaving you, right?

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.190
Imagine whatever it is
you're paying right now

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.750
on a mortgage payment not leaving you,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.940
but you're able to save
more toward college,

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.320
and then invest more
right for your future.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.970
It would allow you to
catch up exponentially.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.140
So, attacking and paying off
the house is a huge step.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.970
Don't listen to the
people out there that say,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.934
hold on to the mortgage for the tax surge.

00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:37.822
- For the tax surge, okay?

00:25:37.822 --> 00:25:38.964
That's a big lie.

00:25:38.964 --> 00:25:39.797
So explain that.
- Yeah, it makes my hair grow.

00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:40.630
It makes my hair grow.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.720
It gets me riled up
because it's not truthful,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.350
and I want people to know the facts.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.150
You want to pay off that home and own it

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.110
and remove the risk out of your life.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.640
If you own it, nobody
can ever foreclose on it.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.070
Nobody can take it away from you.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.210
So I want to encourage
people to stay on the path.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.410
It leads you to progress.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.333
- Yes, and majority of people

00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:59.550
with the whole tax deduction
thing, mathematically speaking,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.370
you're going to be paying more in interest

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.390
than you would it not
being written off, so.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.223
- Oh, it is.

00:26:05.223 --> 00:26:07.470
And you have to fully itemize
to be able to deduct that.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.480
And you can only deduct it
for a certain number of years.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.380
So anyway, it's an excuse
to keep a mortgage.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.213
- Pay off the house, people.

00:26:14.213 --> 00:26:15.390
Pay off the house.
- Pay off the house,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.960
free up your money, and be
able to save for college,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.480
be able to save for your future,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.970
or be able to take a
trip and enjoy it, right?

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.090
I want people to keep
more of their own money.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.923
- So good.

00:26:24.923 --> 00:26:25.850
So, you guys, if you could imagine

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.300
being at the end of that step,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.570
which means you have no
debt including your house,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.160
you're funding your retirement,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.640
and you're funding your kids' college,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.600
you have an emergency fund—

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.250
like all the things are taken care of.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.510
At that point, you might
even be self-insured,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.770
meaning that if something
were to happen to you,

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.130
you have everything taken care of.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.180
So you may not even need life insurance.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.370
But a lot of you are probably
not there yet and that's okay.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.750
But while you're working
through the Baby Steps,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.130
you need to make sure you
do have life insurance.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.410
And with the correct amount
of coverage that you need,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.243
isn't that right?

00:26:57.243 --> 00:26:58.076
- Oh, it is.

00:26:58.076 --> 00:26:59.830
Life insurance is absolutely important.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.480
It's a part of making sure
that your family is protected.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.040
And I also want to encourage people

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.960
to make sure you're getting some quotes.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.080
Look at this and understand—

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.720
find out if you can save money

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.530
because that saved money
creates margin in your budget,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.260
and that allows you to be able
to do more in other areas.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.540
Rachel, it boils down to being

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.244
more intentional with your money.

00:27:17.244 --> 00:27:18.077
- Yeah, it's so good.

00:27:18.077 --> 00:27:19.550
And Winston and I use Zander Insurance

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.860
because they make it so easy.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.897
And you use Zander too, don't you?

00:27:21.897 --> 00:27:22.730
- I sure do.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.920
- Yeah, they're so great.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.960
They will do all the work for you

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.270
to make sure that you're
getting the best rates possible.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.440
So we recommend getting 10 to
12 times your annual income.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.990
So make sure to go to zander.com
or click the link below.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.823
Alright, coming up next,

00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:37.320
I'm going to bring my dad back on to join us,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.970
and we're going to finish
out with Baby Step 7.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.829
The last and final Baby Step.

00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:42.662
- It's gonna be fun.

00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:43.495
- It's a good one.

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:46.078
(upbeat music)

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.780
So our big saying around here is:

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.940
Live like no one else, so later you can

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.550
live and give like no one else.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.850
So our goal for you is not
just to win with money,

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.030
but to be able to win with money

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:09.030
so that you can become an
incredibly generous person.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.150
So, you all are here to talk about

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.692
probably the most fun Baby Step.

00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:13.525
- I think so.

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.660
- So at this point people
are completely out of debt,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.750
including their house.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.970
They don't even have a house payment.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.180
They're funding retirement,

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.350
putting money away for kids' college.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.350
And now there's nothing left

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.310
but to really build wealth
and be incredibly generous.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.808
So, that's pretty fun, right?

00:28:27.808 --> 00:28:30.710
- It puts you in a position
to have that kind of fun.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.450
- Yes, so let's talk
about the fun you can have

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.680
and the importance of giving

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.490
and truly living with that open hand.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.050
- Well, for the first thing that happens,

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.640
for Sharon and I when
we finally got there,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.600
is this weird thing happens.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.693
You're like, I'm going to be okay.

00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:51.776
And you can take your eyes off of you.

00:28:51.776 --> 00:28:53.588
And as soon as you do,
you know what you see?

00:28:53.588 --> 00:28:55.036
Other people.

00:28:55.036 --> 00:28:57.300
And you see this need.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.650
And so the first thing
that happened with us

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.810
was just some random acts of giving.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.343
But and then it's like, you know,

00:29:04.343 --> 00:29:06.727
I just had this blast, like
Christmas the other day, right?

00:29:06.727 --> 00:29:09.963
You know, a month ago our company,

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.610
we gave $800,000 to our team.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.840
A thousand dollars each for
Christmas for 800 people.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.470
But I mean, it was fun!

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.530
I had fun!

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.190
I did not like go, oh, I hate doing this.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.590
It was fun because we had the money

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.200
and everybody had a blast.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.350
And, you know, you just don't find

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.450
people upset about generosity.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.283
- It's so true.

00:29:33.283 --> 00:29:35.490
And, Chris, I feel like we
talk about the joy of giving

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.040
because really giving gives
you this amount of joy

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.110
that you can't get anywhere else.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.943
- It really does.

00:29:40.943 --> 00:29:41.933
I mean, Rachel, when you put yourself

00:29:41.933 --> 00:29:44.850
in a position to be able to be aware,

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.690
when the Lord prompts you to give

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.020
or to do something and
you have that margin,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.890
you're able to do it with joy.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.500
And giving has a two-way blessing.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.130
You bless the person that receives it,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.020
but you also feel a blessing.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.853
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

00:29:57.853 --> 00:29:58.860
- And I'll never forget a time

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.610
that I was at Waffle
House with one of my boys

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.130
and met the waitress.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.680
Turns out she was about
five months pregnant.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.180
Her fiance had broken up with her.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.810
I mean, she had gone
through some life stuff.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.620
And I felt in that moment that
I knew what I was going to do.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.640
I knew I was going to leave a big tip.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.270
Well, my son saw this
dollar amount that I put out

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.560
and I said, "Alright, buddy, let's go."

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.100
He goes, "No, dad, we
gotta wait on your change."

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.530
And I'm like, "No, no."

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.230
Now, you all know I can't whisper, right?

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.200
I've been banned in 48 of the
public libraries in America.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.530
But I'm trying to get him
out before she comes back

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.860
because have you ever had somebody

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.300
try to block your blessing?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.174
You know, you try to do something nice?

00:30:32.174 --> 00:30:33.070
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, totally, totally.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.690
- Well, it creates awkwardness, right?

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.910
So anyway, I'm like, little boy,

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.381
if you don't get up I'm
gonna tase you, you know?

00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:39.820
So I get him outside and we get over

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.130
to the side of the building.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.870
And she comes back and she
sees the dollar amount.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.450
And I'll never forget her picking it up

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.460
and putting it to her heart.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.980
And that expression, and I'll
never forget standing there

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.770
with my son where I've told
him it's good to do good.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.890
You need to do good.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.250
But Rachel, he did something
you talk about in your book,

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.650
Smart Money Smart Kids.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.130
It's more caught than taught, right?

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.260
And my son caught me

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.020
doing something good.
- Sees it, so good.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.370
- And I will never forget that moment.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.020
It stuck in my head.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.720
And so I want people to give.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.490
I want people to do it,
but let your kids see you.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.030
Let them be a part of that
and watch what happens.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.440
They learn to give as well.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.040
- Totally, I think that's
such a great point.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.240
And so for you guys working this plan,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.520
you may not be at Baby Step 7,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.970
but the beautiful thing that we teach,

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.790
that we are hardcore on is
that you need to be giving

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.640
no matter where you are in the process.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.360
So even if you are getting out of debt,

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.210
giving is still at the top of your budget

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.260
because it's a habit you create.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.410
And a lot of people believe, well,

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.790
if I just make more
money, then I would give.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.623
And that's not the case.

00:31:36.623 --> 00:31:37.543
It's not, it's not a math--

00:31:37.543 --> 00:31:40.090
- You would give more, but
you won't start giving.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.960
- That's right, that's right.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.860
It's not a math issue, it's a heart issue.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.270
Kind of like what we talked
about earlier, but it's true.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.930
So, making it a habit now,

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.630
giving a little until you can be able

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.320
to give a lot here in Baby Step 7.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.200
Well, I think this is
so fun having you guys

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.690
be able to talk about this because it is,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:57.640
it's a point for people
to look at that Baby Step

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.540
and to work toward—
because what you can do

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.260
in your life and others
is just incredible.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.093
And just like you said,

00:32:04.093 --> 00:32:05.800
it's true there was a study done that said

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.430
you have momentary happiness
when you receive a gift,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.900
but you have longer term happiness

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.610
when you are actually the giver.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.040
And what it does to change
you and your family, and it is—

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.620
it's just—I say it over and
over again, but it's true.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.880
It is the most fun.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.510
- Yes, it is.
- It is the most fun

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.350
you can have with money.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.160
So, if you had one last
piece of encouragement

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.760
for people throughout all the Baby Steps,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.680
what would you say?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.400
- When you pay a price
to win, it's worth it.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.233
We say it all the time,

00:32:30.233 --> 00:32:32.420
and the Baby Steps are a
process you're going through,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.110
and you are living like no one else,

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.250
so that later you can live

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.030
and give like no one else.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.380
What if you could do some of the things

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.760
we're talking about right here
and it not affect your life

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.490
because you'd done such a good job?

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.323
You can do it.

00:32:48.323 --> 00:32:49.690
- It's good.
- Yeah, I would tell people

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.410
that regardless of
where you are right now,

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.120
don't get distracted
and believe in yourself.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.570
You know, it is a plan worth
working, and I promise you,

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.500
once you get there, you're going to look back

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.240
and you're going to be able
to encourage other people.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.742
So stay plugged in.

00:33:01.742 --> 00:33:03.940
Keep understanding why you're doing this

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.830
to be able to be a blessing to others.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.240
- So good, so good.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.800
Well, you guys, if it makes
you not want to start this plan,

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.570
I feel like you're not
alive watching this.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.620
So I'm excited for you guys
and the journey you're on

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.630
and the fact that we all get to sit here

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.480
and help with that is a
true honor on our part.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.630
So, thanks you, guys, for being on.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.150
Seriously, I really appreciate it.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:23.983
- Thank you.
- Very cool.

00:33:23.983 --> 00:33:26.516
(upbeat music)

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.470
- Well, it's my favorite time of the show.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.640
That's right, celebrating you guys

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.440
with She Works Hard Saving Money.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.297
Sarah said, "As soon as we
finished Baby Step 3,

00:33:42.297 --> 00:33:44.607
we started an international adoption

00:33:44.607 --> 00:33:46.927
and now we help others adopt.

00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:49.047
I started a group to help people come up

00:33:49.047 --> 00:33:51.500
with adoption fundraising ideas."

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.620
So great, Sarah. I love that.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.447
Cassandra said, "We had mismatched,

00:33:55.447 --> 00:33:58.077
hand-me-down furniture for 10 years.

00:33:58.077 --> 00:34:02.607
We agreed when our mortgage
was 3/4 paid we would celebrate

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:06.187
so we sold the old
furniture and got this.

00:34:06.187 --> 00:34:09.007
It makes me so happy to
have furniture that matches

00:34:09.007 --> 00:34:11.287
and I know nothing will compare

00:34:11.287 --> 00:34:14.770
to that paid off mortgage in 2019!"

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.670
So awesome, Cassandra.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.927
Kelsey said, "Three years ago,

00:34:17.927 --> 00:34:20.717
my dad graciously gifted
my husband and myself

00:34:20.717 --> 00:34:23.567
with our honeymoon hotel in Maui.

00:34:23.567 --> 00:34:25.727
My dad travels all the time for business,

00:34:25.727 --> 00:34:28.177
so he's saved up quite a few

00:34:28.177 --> 00:34:30.637
hotel rewards from his business trips,

00:34:30.637 --> 00:34:33.347
plus he's gone through FPU with my mom.

00:34:33.347 --> 00:34:34.707
I guess you could say they're living

00:34:34.707 --> 00:34:36.437
and giving like no one else.

00:34:36.437 --> 00:34:38.367
We are still to this day humbled

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:41.670
and thankful for such a generous gift."

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.670
I love that, you guys.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.020
You guys are killing it.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.490
So remember, if you want to post on social

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.630
what you are saving up for,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.860
or how you're working to save money,

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.947
post a picture and put "she works hard

00:34:51.947 --> 00:34:54.600
saving money" as the hashtag.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.020
Well, this was such a fun episode.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.780
I hope you guys feel encouraged

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.180
and have the tools you need

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.760
to start winning with your money.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.610
Now, if you want to take it a step further,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.520
you need to go through
Financial Peace University.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.950
And Chris Hogan, Dave Ramsey,
and myself—we're all in it.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.190
It is the proven program
that will help you

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.870
never worry about money again.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.340
The average person that goes through

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.340
Financial Peace University
pays off $5,300 in debt

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:27.340
and saves $2,700 in the first 90 days.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.060
You guys, that's crazy.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.680
