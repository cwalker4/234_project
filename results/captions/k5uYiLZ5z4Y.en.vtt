00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
after the event we had yesterday with
catching our students they catching the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.610
poacher but I seen a poacher you know
shoot a deer out of the out of his truck

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.940
what's up guys welcome back to the
channel

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.890
today we're in Pennsylvania we're going
over this brand new lease property that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
just picked up about two weeks ago we're
beginning the process of managing the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.609
area scouting it and so forth
today we're going through or we're going

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
to be hanging some no trespassing signs
I know it's not gonna be foolproof you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.480
know 100% but at least it's something
you know I can say I did I put up I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
tried it's not gonna be a hundred
percent I know that but I'm gonna go

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.050
through mark the property the scouts the
more get more detailed information about

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.600
the property line make sure nobody's in
here trespassing and so forth we're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.500
overlooking this about I think it's
about a 15 acre field and it's full of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.020
just some old grasses and mainly Queen
Anne lace which deer do not eat but I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.380
think later in the spring we're gonna go
through we're gonna kill a lot of this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
and go ahead and and Bush all get and
probably either spray it with some

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.000
antler grow or over seeded it with
something but today we're also going to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.630
be going through get some soil samples
there's a back field that's gonna be a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.409
beautiful food plot I'm gonna get the
soil sample in there but the main thing

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.009
right now is we're going to go through
mark the property line with no

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.810
trespassing signs we got the ATV and
hope you guys spend the day and follow

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.520
along when this on the journey of
turning this property into something

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.600
that I've always you know wanted to do
is you know manage a property and and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.700
things like that so I hope you guys
follow

00:02:52.689 --> 00:03:00.530
we just got done marking the street with
no trespassing signs and again I know a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.040
lot of people are they're going to say
well it's you're wasting your time it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.220
worthless but they're not just for you
know people that are trying to trespass

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.750
there are four people that if I bring a
guest or you know something like that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.890
they know where they're at at all times
I cannot tell them ahead of time hey the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.370
property's posted with this type of this
type of sign if it's not this type of

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.970
sign on there guess it's you know it's
not my property so you can't go on there

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.650
so it's not just for trespassers it's
also for people that I bring out as

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.389
guests as well so we're just going
through and kind of Mark it off the

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.819
property line now with some ribbons
that's what the landowner wanted he just

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.220
he wanted to use ribbon so that's what
I'm doing it's a straight shot this way

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.579
like 300 yards we're just going to mark
it off and we're gonna head back to the

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.840
truck and then get some other stuff done
several hours into it you guys can see

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.239
we got posted signs all along this field
on the road there's one there all the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.389
way down outside we also have them
across the street so the fields more

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.290
actually went down the road down this
way marked all the way down the road to

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.659
the line property line and then cut into
the woods tomorrow morning we're going

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:34.430
to finish marking and then that part of
the process of why I'm here this weekend

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.490
will be done the proper to be marked
we just had an unfortunate situation I

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.020
was over on that side of the property
and I heard a truck come by and a

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.360
gunshot I ran up top of the hill and two
guys were in a pickup truck

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.159
they shot a deer out the window they ran
out of the truck picked the deer up

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.760
threw it in the back of the truck and
took off by the time I got up

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.400
there I was able to record it all so I
just

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.210
I called DNR the police everybody they
just left five minutes ago so we're

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.900
proceeding with this I got the license
plate number and all that stuff I gave

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.300
them the footage so I mean they're
they're caught it's a hundred percent

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.950
they're caught I got it all on video
gave them the the tag number of the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.280
video all the information that I saw
with my own eyes

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.660
gave it to them and they're proceeding
with it so it just it's crazy the first

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.330
day on the property
and I got the witness two guys ocean out

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.950
of a gray truck
it's unfortunate doesn't give me good

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.530
feeling about the place but you know
that's what it is it just it just

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.040
doesn't happen here I'm sure it happens
everywhere you know it's just one of

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.790
them things where I might have to deal
with that you know but we'll stems we'll

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:09.020
go from there and we'll continue with
the day we got signs here and here on

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:18.490
this old logging road I got them down
all through here as well

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:28.340
another one there
here this was an old logging road which

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.120
there's a tree fell down there and that
actually wraps around but I put them

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.480
through here as well no one over there
but if you go through here and go up

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.050
this way you can just see where the
trees and stuff have been pushed up from

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.500
the loggers but then that trail the old
logging road goes that way I know a lot

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.820
of you guys are probably thinking you
know hanging signs is pointless but

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.200
there's many reasons behind it you know
a lot of people you know that have

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.280
property and stuff don't post and you
know things like that but it's not just

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.550
for like I was saying yesterday it's not
just for you know trespassers it's for

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.630
yourself and it's also for you know if
you bring guests or something you can

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.490
say hey
this property's posted this is what type

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.870
of sign that I have you know don't go
beyond this point you need to know where

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.800
you're at all the time so this is why
I'm going it's not just for trespassers

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.349
which it's my main point but I know what
realistically most of them are not going

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:36.960
to listen but it is what it is it's what
I'm doing so I mean this is only my

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.979
second time on this property so I have
to do what I can

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:48.060
because you know I don't live on here
but this is what this is what I'm doing

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.499
so I highly encourage you guys to go
through post you know you can use some I

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.069
think purple paint you can spray paint
them just something on there so we'll

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:59.430
let you know that it's where you're at
at all times you know if you're in a

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:04.860
dark you know and things like that so I
think I want to wrap up this part of it

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:13.710
for the no trespassing signs I hope you
guys enjoyed this little tour the

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.759
property and you know hanging hanging
the signs and you know it's snowing

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:22.259

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.419
