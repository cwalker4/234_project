00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.722
The people in the back,
can you hear me clearly?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.124
OK, good.

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:19.496
Have you ever held a question in mind

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:24.391
for so long that it becomes
part of how you think?

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:28.164
Maybe even part of who you are
as a person?

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.876
Well I've had a question in my mind 
for many, many years

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:37.224
and that is: 
How can you speed up learning?

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.648
Now, this is an interesting question

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:42.359
because if you speed up learning,

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.000
you can spend less time at school.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.099
And if you learn really fast,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.878
you probably 
wouldn't have to go to school at all.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:53.877
Now, when I was young, 
school was sort of OK but...

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:58.289
I found quite often that school 
got in the way of learning

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.785
so I had this question in mind: 
How do you learn faster?

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:05.821
And this began when I was 
very, very young,

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:07.497
when I was 11 years old,

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:11.882
I wrote a letter to researchers in the 
Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia,

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:13.922
this is sleep-learning,

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.892
where you get a tape recorder, 
you put it beside your bed

00:01:16.892 --> 00:01:19.006
and it turns on 
in the middle of the night

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:20.439
when you're sleeping,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.652
and you're supposed to be 
learning from this.

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:25.468
A good idea, 
unfortunately it doesn't work.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.783
But, hypnopaedia did open the doors 
to research in other areas

00:01:29.783 --> 00:01:32.083
and we've had 
incredible discoveries about 

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:34.933
learning that began 
with that first question.

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:39.293
I went on from there to become 
passionate about psychology

00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:43.149
and I have been involved in psychology
in many different ways

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.968
for the rest of my life 
up until this point.

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:49.615
In 1981, I took myself to China

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:56.044
and I decided that I was going to be 
native level in Chinese inside two years.

00:01:56.674 --> 00:02:01.530
Now, you need to understand that 
in 1981, everybody thought

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.012
Chinese was really, really difficult

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:06.494
and that a Westerner 
could study for 10 years or more

00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:08.977
and never really get very good at it.

00:02:08.977 --> 00:02:11.082
And I also went in with a different idea

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:13.633
which was: taking all of the conclusions

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.184
from psychological research 
up to that point

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:18.735
and applying them 
to the learning process.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:24.059
What was really cool was that in six 
months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.021
and it took a little bit longer 
to get up to native.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:33.495
But I looked around and I saw all of 
these people from different countries

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:35.677
struggling terribly with Chinese,

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:40.338
I saw Chinese people struggling terribly 
to learn English and other languages,

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:44.933
and so my question got refined down to:

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.227
How can you help a normal adult

00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:50.701
learn a new language 
quickly, easily and effectively?

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.427
Now this is a really, really important 
question in today's world.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:56.618
We have massive challenges 
with environment,

00:02:56.618 --> 00:02:59.676
we have massive challenges 
with social dislocation,

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:02.075
with wars, all sorts of things going on

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.629
and if we can't communicate,

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.563
we're really going to have difficulty 
solving these problems.

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:10.307
So we need to be able to speak 
each other's languages,

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.248
this is really, really important.

00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.431
The question then is: How do you do that?

00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.889
Well, it's actually really easy.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.776
You look around for people 
who can already do it,

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:24.663
you look for situations 
where it's already working

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:27.512
and then you identify the principles
and apply them.

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:30.576
It's called modelling and I've been 
looking at language learning

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:34.830
and modelling language learning 
for about 15 to 20 years now.

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:38.282
And my conclusion, 
my observation from this is

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:42.572
that any adult can learn a second 
language to fluency inside six months.

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:49.075
Now when I say this, most people 
think I'm crazy, this is not possible.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.807
So let me remind everybody of 
the history of human progress,

00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:56.298
it's all about expanding our limits.

00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:02.920
In 1950, everybody believed that running 
one mile in four minutes was impossible,

00:04:03.628 --> 00:04:06.608
and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:09.018
and from there 
it's got shorter and shorter.

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:12.078
100 years ago everybody believed that 
heavy stuff doesn't fly.

00:04:12.748 --> 00:04:15.297
Except it does and we all know this.

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:18.070
How does heavy stuff fly?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.269
We reorganise the material 
using principles that we have learned

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.387
from observing nature, birds in this case.

00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.096
And today we've gone even further...

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:34.099
We've gone even further, 
so you can fly a car.

00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:37.421
You can buy one of these 
for a couple 100.000 US dollars.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.885
We now have cars in the world that fly.

00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:43.305
And there's a different way to fly 
which we've learned from squirrels.

00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:46.349
So all you need to do is copy 
what a flying squirrel does,

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.040
build a suit called a wing suit and 
off you go, you can fly like a squirrel.

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:54.549
Now most people, a lot of people, 
I wouldn't say everybody

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:56.823
but a lot of people think they can't draw.

00:04:57.377 --> 00:05:01.580
However there are some key principles, 
five principles, that you can apply

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.168
to learning to draw and you can 
actually learn to draw in five days.

00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:10.548
So, if you draw like this, you learn 
these principles for five days

00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:14.612
and apply them and after five days 
you can draw something like this.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.142
Now I know this is true because 
that was my first drawing

00:05:18.142 --> 00:05:22.143
and after five days of applying these 
principles that was what I was able to do.

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:23.930
And I looked at this and I went:

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.571
"Wow, so that's how I look like 
when I'm concentrating so intensely

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:29.691
that my brain is exploding."

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.352
So, anybody can learn to draw in five days

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:37.967
and in the same way, with the same logic,

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:41.848
anybody can learn a second language
in six months.

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:45.693
How? There are five principles
and seven actions.

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:48.892
There may be a few more 
but these are absolutely core.

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.164
And before I get into those 
I just want to talk about two myths,

00:05:53.164 --> 00:05:54.990
I want to dispel two myths.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.967
The first is that you need talent.

00:05:56.967 --> 00:05:58.401
Let me tell you about Zoe.

00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:02.938
Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, 
was trying to learn Dutch,

00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:06.758
struggling extremely, extremely... 
a great deal

00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:09.336
and finally people were saying: 
"You're completely useless,"

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:13.506
"you're not talented," "give up," 
"you're a waste of time"

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.074
and she was very, very depressed.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.376
And then she came across 
these five principles,

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.914
she moved to Brazil and she applied them

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:22.595
and in six months 
she was fluent in Portuguese,

00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:24.240
so talent doesn't matter.

00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:28.722
People also think that immersion in a new 
country is the way to learn a language.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.308
But look around Hong Kong, 
look at all the westerners

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.635
who've been here for 10 years, 
who don't speak a word of Chinese.

00:06:35.587 --> 00:06:39.084
Look at all the Chinese living in 
America, Britain, Australia, Canada

00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:42.965
have been there 10, 20 years 
and they don't speak any English.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.834
Immersion per se does not work.

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:48.672
Why? Because a drowning man 
cannot learn to swim.

00:06:49.873 --> 00:06:52.474
When you don't speak a language, 
you're like a baby.

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:54.459
And if you drop yourself into a context

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.139
which is all adults talking about stuff 
over your head, you won't learn.

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:02.367
So, what are the five principles 
that you need to pay attention to?

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.740
First: the four words,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.750
attention, meaning, relevance and memory,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.676
and these interconnect in very, 
very important ways.

00:07:10.214 --> 00:07:12.464
Especially when you're talking 
about learning.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.933
Come with me on a journey 
through a forest.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.306
You go on a walk through a forest

00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:20.883
and you see something like this... 
Little marks on a tree,

00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:22.957
maybe you pay attention, maybe you don't.

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:26.267
You go another 50 metres 
and you see this...

00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:29.044
You should be paying attention.

00:07:29.684 --> 00:07:33.210
Another 50 metres, if you haven't been 
paying attention, you see this...

00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.575
And at this point,
you're paying attention.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:40.211
And you've just learned that this...
is important,

00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.837
it's relevant 
because it means this,

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:47.491
and anything that is related, 
any information related to your survival

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:50.272
is stuff that you're going to pay
attention to

00:07:50.272 --> 00:07:52.279
and therefore you're going
to remember it.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:54.228
If it's related to your personal goals,

00:07:54.228 --> 00:07:56.270
then you're going to pay attention to it.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.555
If it's relevant, 
you're going to remember it.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.746
So, the first rule, 
first principle for learning a language

00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:04.309
is focus on language content 
that is relevant to you.

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:06.066
Which brings us to tools.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.299
We master tools by using tools 
and we learn tools the fastest

00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:13.915
when they are relevant to us.

00:08:14.484 --> 00:08:15.757
So let me share a story.

00:08:15.757 --> 00:08:17.377
A keyboard is a tool.

00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:21.774
Typing Chinese a certain way, 
there are methods for this. That's a tool.

00:08:21.774 --> 00:08:24.162
I had a colleague many years ago

00:08:24.988 --> 00:08:27.651
who went to night school; 
Tuesday night, Thursday night,

00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:29.975
two hours each time, practicing at home,

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:33.659
she spent nine months, 
and she did not learn to type Chinese.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.398
And one night we had a crisis.

00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:40.230
We had 48 hours to deliver 
a training manual in Chinese.

00:08:40.636 --> 00:08:42.731
And she got the job, 
and I can guarantee you

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.737
in 48 hours, she learned to type Chinese

00:08:44.737 --> 00:08:47.643
because it was relevant,
it was meaningful, it was important,

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.146
she was using a tool to create value.

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:53.547
So the second principle for learning 
a language is to use your language

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:56.811
as a tool to communicate 
right from day one.

00:08:57.688 --> 00:08:59.051
As a kid does.

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:02.964
When I first arrived in China, 
I didn't speak a word of Chinese,

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:07.435
and on my second week, 
I got to take a train ride overnight.

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:10.141
I spent eight hours sitting 
in the dining car

00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:12.144
talking to one of the guards on the train,

00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:14.219
he took an interest in me for some reason,

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:17.063
and we just chatted all night in Chinese

00:09:17.063 --> 00:09:20.079
and he was drawing pictures and 
making movements with his hands

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.786
and facial expressions 
and piece by piece by piece

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:24.534
I understood more and more.

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:27.684
But what was really cool, 
was two weeks later,

00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:30.643
when people were talking Chinese 
around me,

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:32.245
I was understanding some of this

00:09:32.245 --> 00:09:34.804
and I hadn't even made any effort 
to learn that.

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:38.183
What had happened, 
I'd absorbed it that night on the train,

00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:40.357
which brings us to the third principle.

00:09:40.397 --> 00:09:42.950
When you first understand the message,

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:47.509
then you will acquire 
the language unconsciously.

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:51.115
And this is really, 
really well documented now,

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:53.166
it's something called 
comprehensible input.

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:55.234
There's 20 or 30 years 
of research on this,

00:09:55.234 --> 00:09:57.164
Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field,

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:59.844
has published all sorts of 
these different studies

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:01.661
and this is just from one of them.

00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:06.797
The purple bars show the scores 
on different tests for language.

00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:14.365
The purple people were people who had 
learned by grammar and formal study,

00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.424
the green ones are the ones 
who learned by comprehensible input.

00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:20.805
So, comprehension works. 
Comprehension is key

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:27.147
and language learning is not about 
accumulating lots of knowledge.

00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:32.743
In many, many ways 
it's about physiological training.

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:37.394
A woman I know from Taiwan 
did great in English at school,

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.159
she got A grades all the way through,

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:42.025
went through college, A grades, 
went to the US

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.804
and found she couldn't understand 
what people were saying.

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:48.545
And people started asking her: 
"Are you deaf?"

00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:51.831
And she was. English deaf.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:56.106
Because we have filters 
in our brain that filter in

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:58.584
the sounds that we are familiar with

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:01.548
and they filter out the sounds of 
languages that we're not.

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:05.012
And if you can't hear it, 
you won't understand it,

00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:07.720
if you can't understand it, 
you're not going to learn it.

00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:10.260
So you actually have to be 
able to hear these sounds.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.219
And there are ways to do that 
but it's physiological training.

00:11:13.219 --> 00:11:16.835
Speaking takes muscle.

00:11:18.312 --> 00:11:20.752
You've got 43 muscles in your face,

00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:23.708
you have to coordinate those in a way

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:26.501
that you make sounds that 
other people will understand.

00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:30.630
If you've ever done a new sport 
for a couple of days,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.326
and you know how your body feels? Hurts?

00:11:33.802 --> 00:11:36.236
If your face is hurting, 
you're doing it right.

00:11:38.651 --> 00:11:42.759
And the final principle is state. 
Psycho-physiological state.

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:47.066
If you're sad, angry, worried, upset, 
you're not going to learn. Period.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:51.824
If you're happy, relaxed, 
in an Alpha brain state, curious,

00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:53.863
you're going to learn really quickly,

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:57.166
and very specifically you need
to be tolerant of ambiguity.

00:11:57.513 --> 00:12:00.602
If you're one of those people 
who needs to understand 100 percent

00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:03.462
every word you're hearing, 
you will go nuts,

00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:07.100
because you'll be incredibly upset 
all the time, because you're not perfect.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.611
If you're comfortable with getting some, 
not getting some,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.333
just paying attention 
to what you do understand,

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.852
you're going to be fine, relaxed,
and you'll be learning quickly.

00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:20.559
So based on those five principles, 
what are the seven actions that you take?

00:12:21.128 --> 00:12:23.001
Number one: Listen a lot.

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:25.529
I call it brain soaking.

00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:27.681
You put yourself in a context

00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:31.274
where you're hearing tons and tons 
and tons of a language

00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:33.779
and it doesn't matter 
if you understand it or not.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:37.309
You're listening to the rhythms, 
to patterns that repeat,

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:39.362
you're listening to things that stand out.

00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:41.105
(Chinese) Pào nǎozi.

00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:43.599
(English) So, just soak your brain in this.

00:12:43.611 --> 00:12:46.530
The second action is that 
you get the meaning first,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.469
even before you get the words.

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.269
You go: "Well how do I do that? 
I don't know the words!"

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:54.893
Well, you understand what these 
different postures mean.

00:12:55.267 --> 00:13:00.192
Human communication is body language 
in many, many ways, so much body language.

00:13:00.192 --> 00:13:03.401
From body language you can 
understand a lot of communication,

00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:07.693
therefore, you're understanding, you're 
acquiring through comprehensible input.

00:13:07.693 --> 00:13:11.844
And you can also use patterns 
that you already know.

00:13:11.844 --> 00:13:16.044
If you're a Chinese speaker of Mandarin 
and Cantonese and you go to Vietnam,

00:13:16.643 --> 00:13:22.316
you will understand 60 percent of what 
they say to you in daily conversation,

00:13:22.316 --> 00:13:26.810
because Vietnamese is about 30 percent 
Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese.

00:13:28.964 --> 00:13:31.313
The third action: Start mixing.

00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:33.333
You probably have never thought of this

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:36.048
but if you've got 10 verbs, 
10 nouns and 10 adjectives,

00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:38.598
you can say 1000 different things.

00:13:39.996 --> 00:13:42.572
Language is a creative process.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:47.205
What do babies do? OK, 
"me", "bath", "now".

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.245
OK, that's how they communicate.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.851
So start mixing, get creative, 
have fun with it,

00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.264
it doesn't have to be perfect, 
just has to work.

00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:58.212
And when you're doing this, 
you focus on the core.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.827
What does that mean?

00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:02.665
Well, any language is 
high frequency content.

00:14:02.665 --> 00:14:06.370
In English 1000 words covers 85 percent

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.289
of anything you're ever going 
to say in daily communication.

00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:12.015
3000 words gives you 98 percent

00:14:12.015 --> 00:14:14.758
of anything you're going to say
in daily conversation.

00:14:14.758 --> 00:14:17.489
You got 3000 words, 
you're speaking the language.

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:20.220
The rest is icing on the cake.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.951
And when you're just beginning 
with a new language,

00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:25.746
start with your tool box. Week number one,

00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:28.709
in your new language you say things like:

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.824
"How do you say that?"
"I don't understand,"

00:14:30.824 --> 00:14:33.084
"repeat that please," 
"what does that mean?"

00:14:33.084 --> 00:14:34.650
all in your target language.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.966
You're using it as a tool, 
making it useful to you,

00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:41.093
it's relevant to learn other things 
about the language.

00:14:41.093 --> 00:14:43.954
By week two,
you should be saying things like:

00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:47.654
"me," "this," "you," "that," 
"give," you know, "hot,"

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:51.804
simple pronouns, 
simple nouns, simple verbs,

00:14:51.804 --> 00:14:54.324
simple adjectives, 
communicating like a baby.

00:14:54.324 --> 00:14:58.034
And by the third or fourth week, 
you're getting into "glue words."

00:14:59.126 --> 00:15:03.253
"Although," "but," "therefore," 
these are logical transformers

00:15:03.253 --> 00:15:08.108
that tie bits of a language together, 
allowing you to make more complex meaning.

00:15:08.108 --> 00:15:10.299
At that point you're talking.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.396
And when you're doing that, 
you should get yourself a language parent.

00:15:15.703 --> 00:15:18.678
If you look at how 
children and parents interact,

00:15:18.678 --> 00:15:20.423
you'll understand what this means.

00:15:21.113 --> 00:15:24.920
When a child is speaking, it'll be using 
simple words, simple combinations,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.658
sometimes quite strange, 
sometimes very strange pronunciation,

00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:32.044
other people from outside the family 
don't understand it.

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:34.789
But the parents do.

00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:39.201
And so the kid has a safe environment, 
gets confidence.

00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:42.039
The parents talk to the children 
with body language

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:45.120
and with simple language they 
know the child understands.

00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:48.383
So you have a comprehensible input 
environment that's safe,

00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:52.303
we know it works; otherwise none of you 
would speak your mother tongue.

00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:54.699
So you get yourself a language parent,

00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:56.836
who's somebody interested in you 
as a person

00:15:56.836 --> 00:15:59.644
who will communicate with you 
essentially as an equal,

00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:01.961
but pay attention to help you 
understand the message.

00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:06.595
There are four rules of a language parent.

00:16:06.595 --> 00:16:08.734
Spouses are not very good at this, OK?

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:09.894
But the four rules are,

00:16:09.894 --> 00:16:12.826
first of all, they will work hard 
to understand what you mean

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:15.278
even when you're way off beat.

00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:17.971
Secondly, they will never 
correct your mistakes.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.383
Thirdly, they will feed back 
their understanding of what you are saying

00:16:22.383 --> 00:16:26.239
so that you can respond appropriately 
and get that feedback

00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:28.832
and then they will use 
words that you know.

00:16:29.863 --> 00:16:33.188
The sixth thing you have to do, 
is copy the face.

00:16:33.188 --> 00:16:35.270
You got to get the muscles working right,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.597
so you can sound in a way that 
people will understand you.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.885
There's a couple of things you do.

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:44.388
One is that you hear how it feels, 
and feel how it sounds

00:16:44.388 --> 00:16:47.577
which means you have a feedback loop 
operating in your face,

00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:50.654
but ideally if you can look at 
a native speaker

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:52.671
and just observe 
how they use their face,

00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:55.536
let your unconscious mind 
absorb the rules,

00:16:55.536 --> 00:16:57.931
then you're going to be 
able to pick it up.

00:16:57.931 --> 00:17:01.808
And if you can't get a native speaker 
to look at, you can use stuff like this...

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:11.969
(Female voice) Sing, song, 
king, stung, hung.

00:17:12.475 --> 00:17:16.064
(Chris Lonsdale) And the final idea here, 
the final action you need to take

00:17:16.064 --> 00:17:18.204
is something that I call "direct connect".

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:21.369
What does this mean? Well most people 
learning a second language

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.923
sort of take the mother tongue words 
and the target words and go over them

00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:28.710
again and again in their mind to try 
and remember them. Really inefficient.

00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:31.144
What you need to do is realise that

00:17:31.144 --> 00:17:34.400
everything you know is an image 
inside your mind, it's feelings,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.736
if you talk about fire, 
you can smell the smoke,

00:17:36.736 --> 00:17:39.362
you can hear the crackling, 
you can see the flames,

00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:42.849
so what you do, is you go into 
that imagery and all of that memory

00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:47.289
and you come out with another pathway. 
So I call it "same box, different path".

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:50.039
You come out of that pathway 
and you build it over time,

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:53.668
you become more and more skilled 
at just connecting the new sounds

00:17:53.668 --> 00:17:57.983
to those images that you already have, 
into that internal representation.

00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:01.740
And over time you even become naturally 
good at that process,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.542
that becomes unconscious.

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:08.374
So, there are five principles that you 
need to work with, seven actions,

00:18:08.374 --> 00:18:10.937
if you do any of them, 
you're going to improve.

00:18:10.937 --> 00:18:14.021
And remember these are things 
under your control as the learner.

00:18:14.021 --> 00:18:17.963
Do them all and you're going to be 
fluent in a second language in six months.

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.352
Thank you.

00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:20.132
(Applause)
