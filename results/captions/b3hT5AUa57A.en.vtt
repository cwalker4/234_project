00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.560
Ms. Trump:  Mr. President,
Mr. Vice President,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.790
on behalf of my co-chair,
Secretary Ross,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.370
and the entire American
Workforce Policy Advisory Board,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.520
it’s an honor to have here for
today’s inaugural board meeting.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.840
We have spent
the last several hours

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.110
in excellent discussion
with the objective

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.800
of advancing
a national workforce strategy.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
Our collective aim is to ensure
that all Americans

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.720
can benefit from the nation’s
historic economic boom

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.980
and record low
unemployment rates.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.150
This board of industry,
education, government,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.340
and non-profit leaders
are deeply passionate

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.880
about bringing more Americans
off the sidelines

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.980
and into the workforce.
We are seeking to increase

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.410
the country’s workforce
participation rates

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.990
by connecting workers
with good-paying jobs.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.670
We must also focus on helping
those most vulnerable

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.170
to having their jobs displaced

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.080
due to the rapid pace
of technological change,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.220
and work together to assist them
in learning a new skill

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.730
so they can continue
to provide for themselves

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.630
and for their families.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.230
Today, we discussed in detail
the four goals

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.750
that are the mandate
of this specific council.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.280
First is to develop
a robust campaign

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.690
to promote multiple pathways
to good-paying jobs,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.180
dispelling the myth
that there is only one path

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.880
to a successful career.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.160
Second, improving
the availability

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.780
of high-quality, transparent,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.430
and timely data to better
inform students and educators,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.600
as well as match American
workers to American jobs.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.120
Third, modernizing candidate
recruitment

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.360
and training practices to expand
the pool of job applicants

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.060
employers
are looking to hire.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.720
And finally, measuring
and encouraging employer-led

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.680
training and investments.
We are championing

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.820
and seeking to further
private-sector leadership

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.820
and investment
in workforce development.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.180
As we look to the future,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.920
this Board will also influence
our legislative agenda

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.890
to mobilize our
higher education system

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010
and help us
be more responsive

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.320
to today’s students
and job creators.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.470
And this is something
that we’re optimistic

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.170
can be done
in this Congress.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.280
I’d like to thank you,
Mr. President, for being here,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.220
and for your
steadfast commitment

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.480
to a pro-growth
economic agenda

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.210
that is creating tremendous
opportunity for all Americans.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.750
Just this past quarter,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.680
a remarkable 73 percent
of people

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.860
who started out work
had been out of the workforce

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.380
the previous month,
rather than being unemployed.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.860
That’s the highest share
of people

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.740
entering the labor force
from the sidelines

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.650
since we started tracking
this metric decades ago.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.550
With record low unemployment
rates across all demographics,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.330
we will continue to focus
on fostering inclusive growth

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.440
that lifts up
all of our citizens.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.310
We have
an extraordinary opportunity,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.840
and this extraordinary group
around the table —

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.860
titans of industry,
education innovators,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.940
and pillars of our community —
will help us make a difference

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.710
in the lives of millions
of our fellow citizens.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.640
We are taking advantage
of this incredible moment

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.250
to ensure America retains
its leadership role.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.500
And, now, Mr. President,
I turn the floor over to you.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.680
The President:  She’s so formal.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.980
(laughter)

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.620
A special person.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.640
And she’s worked so hard,
as you all know.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.400
And I want to thank you,
Ivanka,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.860
for your devotion to the America
workers — our great workers.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.330
And nobody has workers
like we do.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.170
So I just want to thank you,
honey, because — great job.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.510
Really great job.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.500
(applause)

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.490
She works very hard on this,
I will say.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.030
And she’s created a lot
of happy families.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.560
Because you’re going to be up
to close to 7 million people

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.420
pretty soon that you are
very responsible,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.400
along with many of the people
at this table.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.300
And I’m going to ask,
I think, for you —

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.150
maybe before I even speak —
to go around the table,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.330
because this is such
a distinguished group,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.170
and just introduce yourself.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.280
We have a few of the media back
there, and just a small group.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.600
You know, Tim,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.110
sometimes you have to see
some of these groups.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.750
It’s pretty amazing
what they do.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.520
They break down the walls
and the windows

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.930
and everything else
in order to get in.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.360
But we have great
representative media back.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.040
And I thought you should really
take some of the credit

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.250
for what you’ve done.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.400
And I’d maybe like
to start with Tim Cook

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.510
who has done such
an incredible job at Apple.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.990
He’s become a friend of mine.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.380
And he’s a friend
because he does a great job.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.540
I mean, we want
to get things done.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.620
Employs so many people.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.470
Brought a lot of money
back into our country

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.770
because of the new tax law,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.000
and he’s spending
that money very wisely.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.530
And just done an incredible job.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.870
So, Tim,
maybe you could just start.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.100
Please.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.170
Mr. Cook:  Sure.
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.920
It’s an honor to serve
on this council.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.200
I’ve always thought that America
is so special in so many ways,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.590
but at the heart
of all of it is people.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.840
And that, to me,
is what this group is about.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.850
For — our company, as you know,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.620
was founded
by a college drop-out.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.860
The President:  Right.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.170
Mr. Cook:  So we’ve never really
thought that a college degree

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.450
was the thing
that you had to have to do well.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.060
We’ve always tried
to expand our horizons.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.860
And so that degree — about half
of our U.S. employment last year

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.640
were people that did not have
a four-year degree.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.020
And we’re very proud of that,
but we want to go further.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.070
And so to that end, as we’ve
looked at the — sort of,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.620
the mismatch between the skills
that are coming out of colleges

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.810
and what the skills are that
we believe

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.280
we need in the future,
and many other businesses do,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.120
we’ve identified coding
as a very key one.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.850
And we believe strongly
that it should be a requirement

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.600
in the United States

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.650
for every kid to have coding
before they graduate from K-12,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.500
and become
somewhat proficient at it.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.130
And so we’ve provided a —
we’ve done a curriculum now

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.390
and provided it to all schools
in the United States.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.650
Four thousand have picked it up.
Now, we have a lot further to go

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.080
because there’s a lot more
than 4,000 schools in America,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.650
but that is a start.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.230
We’ve also done that
with 80 community colleges.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.670
And we’re really proud of that,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.370
particularly with the work
that we’re doing in Austin,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.610
and providing
coding education there.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.770
There’s an enormous deficit
in the number of jobs

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.740
versus the number of candidates.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.990
And so we’re —
we are proud to take part

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.440
and to help to get
this alignment much better

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.280
between education
and private sector.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.590
We realize that in something
this large,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.700
it takes government,
private sector,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.880
and education all kind of oaring
in the same direction,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.610
and we’re very proud
to be a part of it.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.150
The President:  Well, thank you,
Tim. Great job you’re doing.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.360
Mr. Cook:  Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.840
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.540
Kim?

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.220
Governor Reynolds:  Well, I too
want to echo my appreciation

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.730
for having the opportunity
to serve on this Board.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.730
I’m excited about what’s
happening across this country.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.940
Iowa has the lowest unemployment
rate the nation at 2.4 percent.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.350
Our economy is growing.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.030
We’ve had four straight quarters
of wage growth in Iowa.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.610
We are no different
than other states.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.600
We have jobs looking for people.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.170
So I’m anxious to work.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.860
And public-private partnership
is the answer.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.290
That is how it’s going to work.
We have an initiative, Future

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.430
Ready Iowa, that has a goal
of having 70 percent of Iowans

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.230
in the workforce
to have education

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.350
or training beyond high school
by the year 2025.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.350
And we’re at about
58 percent right now,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.640
but set the goals high, right? —
The President:  Right.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.900
Governor Reynolds:  —
and work hard to get it.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.540
And we’re doing that
through registered

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.830
apprenticeship programs.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.110
And we just — we’ll be launching
an initiative,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.530
Computer Science is Elementary,

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.410
that will launch six
computer-science elementaries

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.080
in the state that will target
high-poverty, high-needs areas

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.840
so we can help produce
a capable, ready workforce.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.690
Most importantly, though —
and then I’ll pass it

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.650
— is to make sure
that our students and that

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.550
Iowans know that there are
multiple paths to great careers

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.120
and those careers exist in Iowa.
Thank you.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.330
The President:  Well, thank you.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.710
And, Kim,
just had a great victory —

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.940
Governor of Iowa.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.140
She just defeated somebody
who spent unlimited money.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.730
It was unlimited.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.160
And it’s called “talent.”
You’ve done a great job.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.940
Thank you very much, Kim.
Great job.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.160
Mayor Lyles:  Mr. President,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.740
thank you for the opportunity
to be here today.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.950
I’m Vi Lyles,
from the city of Charlotte.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.600
And what I’d like to say
is that we’re a city

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.650
where we want everyone
to have the ability

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.240
to participate
in the economic opportunity.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.650
And we are the second largest
banking center

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.030
now in the country.
That may be good or bad.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.850
But nonetheless,
when we look at that,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.410
we also have to weigh it against
those that haven’t had a chance.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.150
And this opportunity, I think,
will provide us pathways,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.590
innovations, collaborations
to accomplish that,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.910
so that people left out can get
in a great home, a place —

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.500
safe place to live, and a job
that they can be proud of.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.680
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.310
And we have our big convention
in your city, as you know.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.570
Mayor Lyles:  That’s true.
We’re getting ready for it.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.790
The President:  And you
worked very hard.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.520
And a lot of people wanted it
and you got it.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.380
So congratulations,
and I’ll see you soon.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.960
Thank you.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.500
Mr. McGarvey:  Mr. President,
Sean McGarvey

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.030
with North America’s Building
and Trades Unions.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.140
And I too want to thank you
for the opportunity to work

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.010
with terrific co-chairs

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.960
and colleagues
around this table on issues

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.040
that are really important
to the building trades.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.010
And I want to let you know
that we made a commitment

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.160
to you last year
of 250,000 new apprentices

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.930
over the next five years,
and 56,000 of those last year

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.710
were registered with
the Department of Labor.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.490
So we’re following through
on our commitment. Thank you.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.190
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.450
Mr. Box:  Mr. President, Jay Box
from the great state —

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.180
the great commonwealth
of Kentucky,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.100
representing 4.3 million people,
and more particularly,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.600
representing the 16
comprehensive community colleges

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.840
and our 73 campuses
around the state.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.520
And in Kentucky, we are
committed to speeding the time

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.760
to a degree
and a credential

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.490
because we know
the workforce needs us

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.020
to turn out
our workers faster.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.280
And so, we like to say: Instead
of a career pathway,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.230
a career freeway,
with many onramps and exit ramps

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.370
so that students can come
into our institutions

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.120
at any time and exit
once they get a credential

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.860
and right into the workforce.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.880
And later on they can come
right back in

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.580
for further skill training.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.610
The President:  Great job.
Thank you very much.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.850
Mr. Box:  Thank you.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.770
Mr. Donohue:  Mr. President,
nice to see you.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:45.220
I’m very pleased to be here.
This project addresses itself

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.890
to the two
fundamental challenges

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.940
we face in the business
community and in our society.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.430
That is people without jobs

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.580
and massive numbers of jobs
without people.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.840
And I believe the work that will
take place here immediately,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.340
just with people working
with one another,

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.020
will add to the solution
of both of those challenges.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.290
Thank you very much.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.320
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.610
Mr. Sanders:  Thank you
Mr. President.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.840
Scott Sanders,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.320
National Association
of State Workforce Agencies.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.750
It’s been great to be around
this table with employers,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.750
educators, and others.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.270
We’ve already started
talking with Tom

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.960
about how we can help
across all the states —

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.980
help pull those together
that are unemployed,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.180
under-skilled, and they’re
out of the workforce —

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.530
and how do we get them back in

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.770
and help fill
those 7.3 million jobs.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.240
So, honored to be here.
Thank you.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.940
The President:  Thank you
very much. Thank you.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.680
Ms. Utash:  Mr. President,
Sheree Utash,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.330
President of Wichita
State University Applied

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.280
Sciences and Technology
in Wichita, Kansas,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.590
“The Air Capital
of the World.”

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.800
The President:  Right.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.070
Ms. Utash:  And very happy
to be here.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.150
Very honored to be
serving on this.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.330
And wonderful that we have
this issue to deal with

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.210
and to find solutions for.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.880
So thank you for all
your efforts towards that.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.430
You know, we say,
at our college,

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.710
“Hope has a face,”
and it’s face of our students.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.890
And we know from education —
from higher education —

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.410
that we have to be innovative
and disruptive

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.180
in order to be in line

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.360
and aligned with business
and industry.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.670
And so we’re doing a lot of that
and hope to continue to do that.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.940
And I can assure you,
from the two-year sector,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.640
along with Dr. Bumphus,
we’re doing everything we can

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.400
to create the workforce
for the future.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.100
The President:  Thank you
very much. Thank you.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.930
Ms. Wanamaker:  Mr. President,
I’m Marianne Wanamaker.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.890
I’m a labor economist
at the University of Tennessee.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.100
I think, really,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.890
the administration
should be applauded

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.040
for putting a spotlight on our —

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.300
using federal data to solve
some of our biggest challenges.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.350
And this is one of those places
where we really have

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.370
a lot of assets at our disposal.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.219
I’m excited to help the board
think through those issues.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.250
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.580
Dr. Bumphus:  Good afternoon,
Mr. President.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.800
Good to see you again.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.810
It was about a year ago,
I think, when we were here

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.430
with the Expanding
Apprenticeships Task Force.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.620
And I join my colleague here
in saying the administration

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.160
should be applauded
and commended

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.020
for the focus and spotlight

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.050
you put on this very,
very important issue.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.390
And I would be remiss,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.940
as I think all of my colleagues
would agree,

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.610
if we didn’t also commend
Ivanka and Secretary Ross

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.720
for the leadership
they provided too.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.470
I think there’s going to be
some outstanding work

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.680
we’re going to do together.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.740
So again, thank you
for your leadership, sir.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.440
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.380
Governor?

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.590
Governor Holcomb:  Mr.
President,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.260
let me pile on the praise
for your administration’s —

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.960
and the entire administration,
for that matter —

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.800
just a laser focus
on this topic.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.380
It is going to — whether
we like it around this table

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.680
or not, it’s going
to define our nation.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.470
It’s going to define our states,
our organizations,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.330
our companies, and the legacy
that we leave behind us

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.290
when we get this right.
And you are.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.720
So I just want to express
another debt of gratitude

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.590
for trusting us.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.350
Last year, your administration,
the Department of Labor,

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.930
granted us a waiver

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.840
that enabled us to cut
our workforce council

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.970
in the state of Indiana
about in half.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.720
And it allowed us to operate
at the speed of this table

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.750
and the businesses
that are around it.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.540
And that has made
all the difference in the world.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.240
So as you continue to trust us,
the states,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.680
to own it and to prove it,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.950
we will show America
what works and what doesn’t.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.280
And that will take us
to the next level.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.530
Thank you, sir.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.370
The President:  That’s great.
Thank you, Eric. Great.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.670
Ms. Hewson:  Mr. President,
Marillyn Hewson,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:26.920
Lockheed Martin.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.430
I just, again, wanted
to tell you how honored I am

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.650
to serve on this advisory board
but also to commend you

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.590
and your administration
for your focus

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.660
on getting American workers
prepared for the future

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.460
and advanced economy
that we’re in.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.670
It’s not just about
today’s mismatch

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.300
and things we might
work on today,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.600
but it’s getting us prepared
for continued economic growth.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.370
What you’ve done to enable us
with tax reform,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.480
with regulatory reform
has helped us

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.490
to reinvest in our businesses,
to reinvest in our workforce.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.400
And we thank you for that
and commend you for that.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.630
Thank you.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.240
The President:  Thank you,
Marillyn. How is the F-35 doing?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.530
Ms. Hewson:  It’s
doing great, sir.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.730
(laughter)

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.350
The President:  Because I spoke
to some of your competitor

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.720
countries,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.820
and they say, “We have a problem
with it. You can’t see it.”

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.350
I say, “How do you do with your
plane compared to this one?”

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.390
They say, “Well, this one
you can’t see.”

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.600
So I would say they have
a pretty big —

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.800
our pilots have a pretty
big advantage with the F-35.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.180
So that’s great.
Great job you’ve done.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.410
Ms. Hewson:  Thank you.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.650
The President:  And it’s
a great plane.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.290
Everybody loves it.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.500
Wilbur?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.720
Secretary Ross:  Thank you,
Mr. President,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.160
for making
the American workforce

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.120
one of your top priorities
as President.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.590
Thank you also for putting in
place the economic policies

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.150
that are dedicated
to the preposition

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.260
that American workers form
the backbone of our economy.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.340
Thank you, too, to the members

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.630
of the new
Workforce Advisory Board

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.480
for such an insightful
and high-energy discussion.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.380
Now the real work begins.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.980
In the next 12 months,
between now and, actually,

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.120
July of 2020,
this Advisory Board

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.100
will develop recommendations
under the four major points

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.370
that we discussed
this afternoon.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.540
And those recommendations
will go the National Council

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.780
for the American Worker,

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:14.170
which Ivanka and I co-chair
with Secretary Acosta

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.360
and Domestic Policy Council
Director, Joe Grogan.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.480
So we’re looking forward
to the implementation phase,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.360
which, as you know, execution
is the key to everything.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.560
The President:  Thank you,
Wilbur.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.260
Mike? Mike Pence.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.090
The Vice President:  Mr.
President,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.590
I would just — I want to commend
Ivanka and the Secretary

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.290
for implementing
your vision

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.430
of workforce innovation
in this country.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.750
And I want to thank
Governor Reynolds,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.490
Governor Holcomb,
and Tim and Marillyn,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.820
and Ginni and Al.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.430
It’s an extraordinary group
of industry leaders —

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.650
The President:  It’s true.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.880
The Vice President:  — that you
brought together.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.580
And I just want
to assure you —

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.080
one of the very first
conversations the President

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.170
and I had when he was
considering me for this positon,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.540
back in the campaign of 2016,
was about workforce;

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.810
about his passion
for what we call

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.930
“vocational
and technical education.”

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.550
And I just want to assure you,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.620
as you’ll hear firsthand again
from the President today,

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.390
that this is an enormously
high priority

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.220
for this administration.
We’re very grateful to each

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.000
and every one of you
for engaging

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.549
and bringing best practices
and best ideas forward.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.860
The President:  Thanks, Mike.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.850
Mr. Kelly:  Mr. President
and Mr. Vice President,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.410
Ivanka started the meeting today
— actually, twice — (laughter)

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.660
— talking about
the strength of the economy.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.710
And I think that I applaud
any organization —

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.960
in this particular case,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.070
the U.S. government
and your administration —

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.370
for actually planning
for the future

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.990
when things
are actually strong.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.890
And I think that’s a really,
really smart thing

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.360
and very,
very good leadership.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.990
And so we’re excited
about doing everything

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.340
we can to be part of it.
So thank you.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.680
The President:  Thank you
very much, Al.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.430
Great job you’re doing.
Thank you.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.850
Ms. Humpton:  Mr. President,
Barbara Humpton,

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.900
CEO of Siemens USA.
And it’s such an honor

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.250
to be included
with this brilliant group.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.180
Siemens comes to the table
just with open to sharing

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.990
and open to learning
from our colleagues.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.930
And I’ve got a special focus
on this fourth objective:

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.790
the idea that what
gets measured gets done,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.250
and the idea that we can use our
measurements and track progress

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.890
to encourage others to get
engaged in these initiatives.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.120
Thank you.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.840
The President:  Well, thank you.
And really a great job.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.590
In fact, specifically,

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.540
Ivanka wanted me
to point you out and say,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.630
“Dad” — I’ll tell you, she said,
“Dad, she’s done a great job.”

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.350
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Barbara. Great job.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.670
Ms. Humpton:  Thank you so much.
And thank you, Ivanka.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.610
Ms. Trump:  Thank you.
Mr. Clark:  Good.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.600
Jim Clark, the President of Boys
&amp; Girls Clubs of America.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.470
And thank you for hosting
our Youth of the Year —

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.680
five of them —

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.570
this morning at your office,
with the Vice President.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.070
They enjoyed the opportunity
to interact with you.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.500
Thank you for including
Boys &amp; Girls Clubs

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.600
in this important endeavor.
Out-of-school time matters.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.520
Kids spend more time
out of school than in school.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.990
And our focus is
on that pathway to success

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.260
and a great future
instilling essential skills

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.760
as well as critical
job-readiness skills,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.290
like STEM education
and other important factors.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.350
So thank you for including
Boys &amp; Girls Club.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.950
The President:  Thanks, Jim.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.220
Mr. Piwowar:  Mr. President,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.840
Mike Piwowar
from the Milken Institute.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.040
And I know you know the work
of the institute very well.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.910
But for others,
we are a non-partisan,

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.260
non-profit think tank dedicated
to building meaningful lives.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.540
I’m the Executive Director
of the Center

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.940
for Financial Markets,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.080
and our mission is to use
the power of financial markets

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.110
to improve access to capital,
job creation,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.450
and improved health.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.280
I’m so excited to be part
of this effort to —

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.760
what I think of is building
a virtuous cycle

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.750
of investing
in the American Dream

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.390
by investing in each other.
So thank you.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.090
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.560
Ms. Goettl:  Mr. President,
Elizabeth Goettl,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.780
Cristo Rey Network.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.010
Thirty-five private schools
exclusively

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.960
serving low-income students
through a special agreement

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.810
with the United States
Department of Labor.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.900
Every single student works day

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.470
a week in an entry-level
professional job:

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.140
law firms, engineering firms,
the technology industry,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.340
and the like.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.990
And in so doing, developing
these transferable soft skills

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.070
that will take them
into any job in the workforce:

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.630
persistence, communication,
and a strong work ethic.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.180
Thanks for the opportunity
to be here.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.880
The President:  Thank you
very much. Thank you.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.360
Mr. Timmons:  Mr. President,
Jay Timmons

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.460
with the National Association
of Manufacturers.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.210
I had the great fortune
yesterday

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.970
of being able to announce
the results of our first quarter

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:35.110
2019 Survey of Manufacturers
with the Vice President

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.310
present at our Board
of Directors meeting.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.950
And as you know, that survey
has been going on for 20 years.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.590
I was able to announce
that we have had

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.200
nine consecutive quarters
of record optimism —

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.420
The President:  Great.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.170
Mr. Timmons:  —
for manufacturers. 91.8 percent.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.000
And that’s no accident.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.800
That is because of the tools
we’ve been given to invest,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.960
to hire, to raise wages
on benefits through tax reform,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.690
through regulatory certainty.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.550
And that’s created a bit
of a challenge for us

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.080
because now we have 428,000 jobs
open in manufacturing.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.210
Our Manufacturing
Institute predicts

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.520
that that number will increase
to 2.4 million

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.970
in the next 10 years.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.470
So this Board, this Advisory
Board, it’s perfect timing.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.850
Thank you for taking this on.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.090
Thank you to Ivanka
for your passion on this issue.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.580
It really is going to matter
for America’s future.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.740
It’s going to matter for our
success in the global economy.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.980
The President:  Thank you, Jay.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.950
And if you remember
from past years,

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.930
others said that manufacturing
was not going to happen;

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.520
those jobs were
never coming back.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.910
And they are coming back.
We have 600,000 —

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.300
Mr. Timmons:  Well,
they’re coming roaring back.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.500
The President:  Right, they’re
roaring back.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.080
We have 600,000,
and it’ll be a lot higher

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.940
than that when the next report
comes out.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.780
And it’s really been something,
the manufacturing jobs.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.690
We’re going to be up to —
getting close to record numbers.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.210
Nobody thought
they were coming back.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.509
And I said, “How does
that not happen?” Right?

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.210
If manufacturing jobs come back,
does the country come back?

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.160
And we’re doing really well.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.620
And I think you’re also,
in your numbers,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.020
it was the biggest increase
in the history of your chart.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.400
And that’s something
that made me very happy.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.660
Your initial jump.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.210
Not you last jump,
but your initial jump.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.470
Mr. Timmons:  Yeah, it went
from 56 percent,

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.670
I believe, to 93 percent.
The President:  Yeah.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.890
Mr. Timmons:  It was
a huge jump.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.090
The President:  That’s right.
That’s what I had heard.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.810
I had to bring that up
because, to me,

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.440
that was —
that was the initial one.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.760
The last one was a nice jump,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.740
but, you know, we were
competing against ourselves.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.180
But the initial, yeah,
it went from like 56 to 93.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.510
Mr. Timmons:  That’s right.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.720
The President:  So that was
a pretty big jump.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.390
That shows optimism, which is
a big part of what we’re doing.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.800
Thank you very much, Jay.
Great job.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.030
Mr. Timmons:  Thank you
for your leadership.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.490
The President:  Thank you.
Keep it up.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.780
Mr. Liddell:  Mr. President,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.180
thank you
for your focus on this area.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.240
I have the benefit of spending
a lot of time with you,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.690
and I know your passion
for the area.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.400
So thank you for the leadership.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.110
We have an extraordinary group
around the table,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.450
and we’re coming up
with some really practical

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.610
and implemental action.
So, thank you.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.310
The President:  Thanks, Chris.
Thanks. Great job.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.490
Mr. Pulsipher:  Mr. President,
Mr. Vice President,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.710
Scott Pulsipher.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.710
I’m the President of Western
Governors University.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.930
Ivanka, Secretary Ross,
thank you for the honor

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.050
and the opportunity to be here.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.340
WGU was founded very simply
on the premise and the purpose

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.290
to change the lives
of individuals and families.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.490
And we believe education

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.870
is the single biggest
catalyst to do so.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.230
We believe it’s the surest path
to opportunity

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.630
in the form of a great job
and a prominent life.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.320
We surely have a mission
to expand access

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.700
to high-quality education
with great outcomes.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.850
We need more accessible,
more affordable,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.380
more aligned pathways
in education

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.000
that lead to the workforce
of the future.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.220
And so it’s a great opportunity
to be here

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.460
and work together
with these colleagues.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.670
The President:  
Thank you, Scott.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.910
Mr. Pulsipher:  Thank you.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.650
The President:  Very nice.
Thank you.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.800
Ms. Duggan:  Mr. President,
Juanita Duggan, NFIB,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.890
the National Federation
of Independent Business.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.070
And we’ve been representing
hundreds of thousands

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.380
of small businesses
across America for 75 years.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.220
And thanks to you
and the last Congress,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.250
you gave us the largest tax
cut in history

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.090
for America’s small business,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.870
and the small-business economy
has been on fire.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.010
You also broke records
for optimism

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.450
in small business
over the last two years.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.630
And for years,
taxes and regulations

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.650
were the biggest problems
facing small business.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.549
The Vice President
knows this as well.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.610
And now those
are not the problems,

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.340
but finding qualified labor

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.720
is the biggest problem
for small business.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.320
Record numbers of
small-business owners declared

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.740
that they can’t find any
applicants for their open jobs.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.140
So this is becoming a crisis.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.810
And as good as the economy
is for small business,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.110
it’s not sustainable if we can’t
fix this serious labor shortage.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.380
The President:  Right. I agree.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.780
Ms. Duggan:  So thank you
very much.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.620
It’s an honor to serve
on this committee.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.660
And thank you also for the whole
administration’s focus

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.090
on small business
over the last two years.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.080
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.280
Ms. Duggan:  It’s been
extraordinary.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.150
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.370
The President:  And I agree
with what you just said.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.070
Thank you very much, Juanita.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.770
Mr. Menear:  Mr. President,
Mr. Vice President,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.630
Craig Menear
from the Home Depot.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.750
It is a privilege to serve
the American workers here

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.890
with the esteemed colleagues
around this table.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.640
So I thank you
for the opportunity.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.020
We’re passionate at Home Depot

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.590
about helping our associates
grow their careers.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.540
And to run a retailer
the scale of Home Depot,

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.280
you need everything from
engineering, to data science,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.550
to folks who have
outstanding people skills

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.810
and a passion
for customer service.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.460
And we’re privileged to serve
on this committee

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.210
to help drive this forward and
continue to grow this economy.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.480
Thank you.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.700
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.400
Great job you’re doing.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.710
Ms. Rometty:  Mr. President
and Mr. Vice President,

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.820
I, like everyone, am very
honored to be on this committee.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.560
And I have to add just two other
comments to those already made.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.910
So to both Secretary Ross
and Ivanka,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.810
I would add the word
“unwavering” leadership.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.940
Because for as long
as you’ve been in office,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.730
I can remember
this has been a top issue.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.390
And it has been unwavering,
through thick and thin,

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.570
their support on this,
and yours.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.820
And I also am very optimistic
about this in that

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.940
I think we have a chance
to not only say

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.280
this is a very strong economy;
it will be an inclusive economy.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.690
Because I think as a result
of all this work,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.840
we have a chance to employ
so many more people,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.990
and not always
with a college degree.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.150
Less than a four-year degree
will get a very good-paying job

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.380
in the new economy.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.580
And so, to me,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.179
that would be just a really
wonderful contribution —

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.710
both a strong
and an inclusive economy.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.130
So thank you
for the opportunity.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.830
The President:  Thank you
very much, Ginni.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.220
Mr. Taylor:  Mr. President,
Johnny Taylor from the Society

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.019
for Human Resource
Management, SHRM.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.580
Three-hundred thousand members
across the globe.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.280
And I got to tell you,
we share something,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.160
a common passion,
and that’s for workforce.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.820
When I hear the Vice President
say that —

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.580
I know Ivanka is living it —

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.190
it means a lot
to our profession.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.430
You’ve created a different
problem for us, though.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.320
We often — now businesses
are telling us

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.170
they don’t have a problem
accessing financial capital;

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.530
they have a problem
accessing human capital.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.770
That’s a high-class problem.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.170
The human resources profession
is committed to resolving it.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.930
But thank you
for that opportunity.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.150
The President:  Well, thank you
very much, Johnny.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.030
And we’re going to be
opening up the labor forces,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.400
because we have to.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.100
We have so many
companies coming.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.230
People like Tim,
you’re expanding all over

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.520
and doing things

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.490
that I really wanted you
to right from the beginning.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.900
I used to say, “Tim, you got
to start doing it over here.”

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.150
And you really have.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.070
I mean, you’ve really put
a big investment in our country.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.070
We appreciate it very much,
Tim — Apple.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.640
But we’re opening it up.
We have to bring people in.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.360
We want them to be people
based on merit,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.820
and we want them
to come in legally.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.730
You see what’s going on
at the border.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.550
And we’re doing a great job,
whether it’s Border Patrol,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.610
ICE, law enforcement, generally.
We’re all working together.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.220
We have our military sent
to the border.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.500
We have 8,000 military personnel
right now at the border.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.940
We are doing an amazing job

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.980
considering it’s really
an onslaught very much.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.020
I call it “invasion.”

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.230
They always get upset
when I say “an invasion.”

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.279
But it really is somewhat
of an invasion.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.900
And we’re stopping drugs
at a record level,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.950
but a record number of drugs
are pouring up and coming up.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.900
And we’re getting it done.
Human trafficking is a disaster.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.150
Nobody knew too much
about it until recently.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.490
It’s been going on
for a million years, actually.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.740
It’s been going on
for a long time.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.970
But we’ve seen it.
We’ve spotted it.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.490
It’s being slowed down,
but we can’t slow it down

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:10.550
unless we have a very strong
and powerful separation

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.850
between us
and whoever it is it may be.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.730
And in this case,
it happens to be Mexico.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.040
And Mexico has helped us,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.540
but Mexico has a record number
of murders this year —

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.380
a number that’s so large,
it’s actually hard to believe.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.970
And we’re working very hard
on doing —

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.600
actually having one of
the safest we’ve ever been.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.440
We have some of the best numbers
we’ve ever had,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.500
from the standpoint of crime,
murders, killings included.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.700
One of our best years
ever was last year.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.660
And we’re down 6 percent
from last year,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.310
so that’s very important.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.300
But we want to have
a very strong border,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.890
but we’re going to have
a lot of people coming in.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.430
A lot of people
don’t understand that.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.690
They think we’re
shutting it out.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.100
We’re not shutting it out.
We want people to come in,

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.550
but they have to come in
through a process.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.990
So we have a process that’s
really moving along rapidly.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.200
Last year,
we took in a large number

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.140
of highly qualified,
wonderful people.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.560
And they’re — for the most part,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.710
they’re working already
in your companies.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.230
But we also have a lot
of companies coming in.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.180
I was with Prime Minister Abe

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.480
the other day, and he said —
we spoke the other day.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.000
And he said that Japan is going
to be sending about seven —

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.760
at least seven more
big factories into this country.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.790
And it’s got to do more
than that;

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.550
we have too big
a deficit with Japan.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.960
We have for a long time.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.230
But they’re going to —
you saw a couple of openings —

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.930
big openings in Michigan.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.250
Chrysler Fiat just announced
that they’re going to spend

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.290
$4.5 billion in Michigan
around the Detroit area.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.270
We have a tremendous number

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.880
of not only
car companies coming in;

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.620
we have a lot of car companies
coming in.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.950
They’re coming in,
they’re building new,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.980
but they’re also expanding.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.240
And they’re going
to Pennsylvania.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.310
They’re going to Ohio.
Very heavy in Michigan.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.830
South Carolina,
North Carolina — all over.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.430
We have — we have companies

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.220
coming into this country
at a record pace,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.520
and really at a pace
that nobody thought possible

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.590
because nobody thought
you’d ever see these

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.810
particular companies again.
Many of them are coming back.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.670
They want to be
where the action is.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.590
They’re coming back.
They left years ago —

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.560
I used to talk about it
as a civilian.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.840
But they left years ago,
and now they’re coming back,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.970
and they’re coming back
in numbers that nobody believes.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.640
So we’re going to let a lot
of people come in

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.240
because we need workers.
We have to have workers.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:35.760
Unemployment at 3.7, 3.6,
probably. These are low numbers.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.030
And, in one way, I love it.
But, in another way,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.380
I don’t want to make it hard
for you

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.670
to get those companies rolling
with really great people.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.600
Because without the
great people, it doesn’t work.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.930
All of these wonderful things
we talk about are nice,

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.920
but you need the great —
as you discussed, Juanita,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.780
you need the people
and you need really good people.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.100
And we have great people.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.070
And we have the best
in the world, in my opinion.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.470
And we are having other people
come into our country

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.580
that you’re going to be very
proud of and the job they do.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.170
One of the things
that has happened —

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.970
and people don’t talk about it —

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.400
but because of the great
economy,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.280
we have
a prison population that,

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.410
for the first time ever,
is getting a shot at working.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.680
When they got out of prison,
they had a stigma,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.830
and it was a tough stigma.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.750
And, in many cases,
there was not much

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.000
they could do;
they couldn’t get a job.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.080
They couldn’t — no matter what,
they couldn’t get a job.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.520
And now they’re getting jobs
because our economy is so strong

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.640
because you want workers.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.380
And I’ve spoken to at least
six big employers,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.420
and they are loving
what they see.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.290
They cannot even believe how
good some of these people are.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.640
Not in all cases, I guess,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.520
but you can say
that about everybody —

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.500
but how great they have been.
And it’s very nice to hear.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500
First time ever. The first time
that’s ever happened.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.940
And to a large extent,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.060
it’s because we take some credit
because of the economy.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.210
But it’s an incredible thing
what’s happening

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.170
with respect
to the prison population.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.710
They’re getting out,
they’re getting jobs,

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.840
and they’re doing
a fantastic job.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.500
And it’s really beautiful
to see.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.170
I just want to —
and many of you are friends —

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.490
I just want to thank you all
for what you’ve done.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.760
I also want to thank
Doug McMillon,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.070
the CEO of WalMart.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.830
They have been fantastic,
Ivanka, I know that —

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:28.790
because they’ve just hired
tremendous amounts of people.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:35.220
And William McDermott of SAP.
They have really stood out.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.420
And they —
they’re very special people.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.650
And I just want to thank them,

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.140
in addition to the folks
around the table.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.820
And again, thank you all for
being here.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.590
Thanks for the incredible job
you’ve done.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.590
We appreciate it very much.
And, Tim, thank you very much.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.870
Mr. Cook:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.240
The President:  And thank you
very much, everybody.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.970
Thank you. Thank you.
Press, thank you. Appreciate it.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.660
The Press:  Mr. President,
how much more immigration

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.970
would you like to see in this
(inaudible)?

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.250
The President:  Well,
we’re going to have

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.010
a lot of people
coming into the country.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.020
We want a lot of people
coming in.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.410
And we need it.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.020
It’s not a question
of do we want it.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.290
These folks are going
to have to,

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.160
sort of, not expand too much.
And if you tell them —

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.720
these are very ambitious people
around this table.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.710
They don’t like the concept
of not expanding.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.640
Would you say
that’s right, Barbara?

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.370
Barbara is not into
non-expansion.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.760
So we want to have
the companies grow.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.210
And the only way
they’re going to grow

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.820
is if we give them the workers.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.060
And the only way we’re going
to have the workers is to do

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.280
exactly what we’re doing.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.740
Thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.960
Thank you.
Please.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.509
The Press:  Can you comment on
the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, sir?

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.690
The President:  Thank you very
much.
