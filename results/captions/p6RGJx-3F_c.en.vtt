00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Mr. Morton,I will tell you, from this vantage point

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:10.100
it does look like the decision to release detainees was a political determination and not a monetary determination.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.140
It appears to me that the release of detainees was part of a sequester campaign

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.380
that included the fictional firing of teachers, the closing of the White House,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:31.180
for student tours, the displacement of meat inspectors, and now we're going to release aggravated felons, some aggravated felons on to the street

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.360
Now I've counted six times you have said that you didn't want to rob Peter to pay Paul.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.860
I don't want Peter or Paul to rob one of our fellow citizens because you guessed wrong on who to release.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.140
So, what is a level one violator?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.040
A level one offender, .... first I obviously disagree with your characterization about these being political

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.860
Well, that's fine. You can use your time to disagree with my characterization, don't use mine.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.960
What is a level one violator?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.760
With regard to level one offenders, they are aggravated felons

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.400
And how many were released?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.840
There are four presently

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.020
How many were released? Eight were released.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.520
We have four presently

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.140
And, what went wrong with the other four?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.500
What's that?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.520
Why were there eight released and only four currently?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.220
So, two were, uh, released when the computer records

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.160
were not correct, and we went back and looked at them, and we brought them back in.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.860
One, um, was a mistake, and then ...

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.940
What kind of mistake?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.540
Just where the instructions to the field were not carried out correctly

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:56.140
Alright, so, if it is $122 a day to house four level one aggravated felons,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.560
Then releasing them saves you, what? About $600 a day?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.140
Each day, that is right.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.300
You can't find $600 anywhere else in your budget?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.280
We make determinations on a case by case basis

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.420
Can you find $600 somewhere else in your budget?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.600
The question is whether that $600 is well spent on

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.560
those people or someone else

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.380
And when it comes to somebody that has been a 44 year, lawful permanent...

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
I'm not talking about the 44 .... Was he a level one? Was he a level one?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.100
Was he a level one? He is a level one offender

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.480
He was one of the four that you released?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.440
No that . . . he is released, that's right.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.300
Who made the decision to release detainees as part of your effort to comply with sequestration?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.900
The determination was made by Mr. Meade,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.480
the executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.160
in consultation with the chief financial officer

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.500
Who is John Sandweg?

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.660
Mr. Sandweg works for the Secretary

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.460
Where there any conversations with him?

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.380
Not that I am aware of

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.040
Where there any conversations with the Secretary?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.260
Not that I am aware of. I think that the Secretary has noted that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.800
She was surprised in regard to the timing of the notification and I agree with that

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.300
If the release of aggravated felons does not rise to the level of something that the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.060
should know about, what does rise to the level?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.740
Uh, listen. We release people every day

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.320
and the idea that we are going to review

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.360
every single person that is released . . .

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.400
You release thousands of people every day?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.620
We release thousands of people every month

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.900
we operate in a system, we had four hundred and...

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.560
But you don't blame it on sequestration, do you, Director Morton?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.060
What's that?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.860
You don't blame it on sequestration when you release the others

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.500
It's not part of this strategy to get the public fired up, that

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.200
mayhem is upon us. That we are closing the White House

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.040
for tours, that we're firing teachers in West Virginia

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.160
that we're going to have to release level one aggravated felons

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.700
because of sequestration

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.240
First of all, that was never said

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.580
And, the system allows for the release

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.900
on supervision, of people going through immigration proceedings

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.240
We are not detaining people for penal reasons

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.400
solely for the purposes of removal

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.660
As I've said, the vast majority of people in proceedings

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.880
by statutory design are not mandatory detention.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.060
Who are level two violators?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.740
They are either multiple misdemeanors

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.300
or felons that congress has defined as something

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.480
other than an aggravated felon.
A DUI would be a misdemeanor, right?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.220
First offence? How about second offence?
Depends on state law.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.540
How about the states where you release people?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.280
Did you release any recidivist drunk drivers?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.340
Uh, yes

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.180
How many?

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.860
I don't have the exact number

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.980
But we have released . . . many individuals

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.660
who have had DUI offences

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.620
Repeat offender DUI?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.980
Repeat offender DUIs. Most of them were

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.620
single offenders, but some would be DUIs

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.060
I would note, for the record,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.720
Mr. Gowdy, congress has not provided that a DUI

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.520
is a ground of removal.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.180
In fact, most misdemeanors are not a ground of removal

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.740
It is the agency, by agency policy

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.580
that factors that in

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.620
I can't order you removed for having committed a DUI

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.400
No you can't, Director

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.000
but you certainly can request a programmatic

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.280
rescheduling so that you can move money around

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.120
And this notion that you don't want to

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.320
rob Peter to pay Paul. You could have easily

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.420
done that. You could have found $600.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.500
to keep these level one violators from being released

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.420
and don't act like you could not have.
