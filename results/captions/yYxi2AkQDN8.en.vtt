00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.754
CHRIS.

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:05.122
&gt;&gt; Chris: MIKE, THANK YOU.

00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:07.925
JOINING US NOW,

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:08.492
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOP

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:09.159
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.693
LARRY KUDLOW.

00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:10.527
WELCOME BACK TO

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.028
"FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.663
&gt;&gt; Larry: THANK YOU.

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:13.364
&gt;&gt; Chris: THE PRESIDENT SENDS

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.099
A NEW BUDGET TO CONGRESS

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.767
TOMORROW THAT WILL REPORTEDLY

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:19.570
CALL FOR STIFF DOMESTIC SPENDING

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.839
CUTS IN ENVIRONMENT OF PROGRAMS,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.840
TRANSPORTATION, ANTIPOVERTY

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:24.908
PROGRAMS AT THE SAME TIME IT IS

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.443
CALLING BIG INCREASE IN DEFENSE

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:27.478
SPENDING AND YOU'VE STILL GOT

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:28.345
THOSE TAX CUTS.

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:30.114
WHY DO THAT ON THE DOMESTIC

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:30.414
SIDE?

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:31.315
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY NOT?

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:33.617
IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH BUDGET

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:35.252
DEFICITS YOU'VE GOT RAPID

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:36.186
GROWTH, WHICH MEANS KEEP THE TAX

00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:37.287
CUTS IN PLACE.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:40.591
WE BELIEVE THE 3% GROWTH RATE OF

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:43.160
2018 WILL CONTINUE IN 2019 AND

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.263
BEYOND 2020 SO I THINK THE OTHER

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:48.165
ELEMENT IS ALWAYS TO LIMIT

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.769
SPENDING AND THE PRESIDENT IS

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.570
PROPOSING ROUGHLY A 5%

00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:54.271
ACROSS-THE-BOARD REDUCTION IN

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.639
DOMESTIC SPENDING ACCOUNTS.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.175
IT WILL BE A TOUGH BUDGET.

00:00:58.176 --> 00:00:58.909
WE ARE DOING OUR OWN CAPS THIS

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.813
YEAR AND I THINK IT'S LONG

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:03.147
OVERDUE.

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:03.847
SOME OF THESE RECENT BUDGETS

00:01:03.848 --> 00:01:04.648
HAVE NOT BEEN FAVORABLE TOWARD

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:05.983
SPENDING SO I THINK IT'S EXACTLY

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:06.850
THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION.

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:07.885
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT HERMES

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.054
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A 5%

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:10.654
DOMESTIC SPENDING CUTS.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.222
ON THE OTHER HAND, REPORTEDLY

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:17.861
ARE GOING TO ASK FOR ANOTHER

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:19.063
$8.6 BILLION FROM DHS, HOMELAND

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:19.930
SECURITY AND THE PENTAGON TO

00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:21.065
BUILD A WALL SO THERE'S GOING TO

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.367
BE ANOTHER BUDGET FIGHT OVER THE

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:24.068
WALL?

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.203
&gt;&gt; Larry: I SUPPOSE THERE WILL

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:26.470
BE.

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:27.538
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE WHOLE

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.207
ISSUE OF THE WALL AND BORDER

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:30.941
SECURITY IS OF PARAMOUNT

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:31.341
IMPORTANCE.

00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:32.643
WE HAVE A CRISIS DOWN THERE.

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:33.844
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:35.279
THAT CASE VERY EFFECTIVELY.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.016
IT'S A CRISIS OF ECONOMICS.

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:41.251
IT'S A CRISIS OF CRIME AND

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:41.552
DRUGS.

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:43.887
IT'S A CRISIS OF HUMANITY.

00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:45.689
WE HAVE TO BE MUCH TOUGHER AND

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.924
HAVE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:47.991
IMMIGRATION POLICY, WHICH WE

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:49.460
WILL BE DEVELOPING OVER A PERIOD

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:50.027
OF TIME.

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.261
SO YES, HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:52.162
US WHILE AND HE'S GOING TO STAY

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.465
WITH THE BORDER SECURITY AND I

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.032
THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:56.066
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY.

00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:58.202
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS.

00:01:58.203 --> 00:01:59.203
YOU TALK ABOUT BALANCING THE

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:00.104
BUDGET AND THE WAY YOU'RE GOING

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:03.273
TO DO IT IS BY CUTTING 5% IN ALL

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:04.908
DOMESTIC SPENDING BUT YOU KNOW

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.609
THAT IF YOU TAKE ENTITLEMENTS

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.145
OFF THE TABLE THAT YOU JUST

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:10.714
CAN'T GET ENOUGH FROM DOMESTIC

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.883
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING TO CUT

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:13.617
THE BUDGET AND YOUR NEW BUDGET

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:16.320
IS A CASE IN POINT.

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.387
TRADITIONALLY REPUBLICAN

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:19.256
PRESIDENTS HAVE SAID WE ARE

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:20.691
GOING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET AND

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:21.391
THE BUDGET THEY PROJECTED OUT

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:22.126
THAT IT'S GOING TO BALANCE THE

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.393
BUDGET IN TEN YEARS.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.929
YOUR NEW BUDGET DOESN'T BALANCE

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.032
THE BUDGET UNTIL 15 YEARS, UNTIL

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.835
THE 2030'S AND THE QUESTION I

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:33.103
HAVE IS YOU AND I HAVE KNOWN

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:33.871
EACH OTHER A LONG TIME.

00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:34.705
WHEN I COVER DURING THE THE

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:37.908
REAGAN YEARS YOU CARED AND YOU

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.042
THOUGHT THAT DEFICITS AND DEBT

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:39.376
MATTER.

00:02:39.377 --> 00:02:41.078
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.446
&gt;&gt; Larry: NOT OVERWHELMINGLY

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:44.014
SO, BY THE WAY, DURING THE

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:45.082
REAGAN YEARS.

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.351
LOOK, I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T

00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:49.920
THINK GOOD GROWTH POLICIES HAVE

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.089
TO OBSESS NECESSARILY.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.258
ABOUT THE BUDGET DEFICITS AND SO

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.825
FORTH.

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:55.792
LOOK, CHRIS, MY VIEW AND I

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:56.927
BELIEVE THE VIEW OF THE

00:02:56.928 --> 00:03:01.165
ADMINISTRATION, WE ARE GOING TO

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:02.232
POINT A STUDY GUIDE PATH TOWARDS

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:05.602
LOWER FEDERAL SPENDING AND

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.771
FEDERAL BORROWING AS A SHARE OF

00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:09.339
THE ECONOMY, AS A SHARE OF GDP.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.341
THAT LOWERS THE BURDEN --

00:03:11.342 --> 00:03:12.776
&gt;&gt; Chris: DEFICIT INCREASED BY

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:13.510
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT IN THE FIRST

00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.246
FEW MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR,

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:16.680
I THINK 70%.

00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:17.814
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE ARE GOING TO RUN

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:23.287
I THINK ABOUT 4.5-5% OF GDP,

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:24.021
THAT'S A VERY MODERATE NUMBER.

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:25.222
&gt;&gt; Chris: IT COULD BE CLOSE TO

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:25.956
A TRILLION DOLLARS.

00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:27.090
&gt;&gt; Larry: PERHAPS SO BUT THE

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:30.227
ECONOMY IS $20 TRILLION AND NET

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:32.896
WORTH TODAY, HOUSEHOLD NET WORTH

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:33.897
IS ABOUT $100 TRILLION SO I

00:03:33.898 --> 00:03:34.898
DON'T THINK THAT'S A BURDEN ON

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:35.566
THE ECONOMY.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:36.934
AND I THINK ALL THE INCOMING

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:37.267
DATA.

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:40.003
HEAR SOMETHING, LET'S GO TO THE

00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:40.604
FINANCIAL MARKETS.

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:42.339
YOU HAVE A 10-YEAR TREASURY BOND

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.810
RIGHT NOW THAT'S ABOUT 2.60%,

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.879
.263 I THINK AT THE CLOSE ON

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.246
FRIDAY.

00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:50.647
IF THE MARKETS WERE

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:51.481
OVERWHELMINGLY WORRIED ABOUT OUR

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:52.216
BUDGETS AND ARE SPENDING AND ARE

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:54.918
DEFICITS YOU WOULD SEE THAT

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.420
INTEREST RATE RISE AND BE A

00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:56.887
GREATER PENALTY.

00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:58.355
I DON'T SEE IT RIGHT NOW.

00:03:58.356 --> 00:03:59.856
AND AGAIN COME A LONG ONE, WE DO

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:02.726
WANT TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:03.527
SPENDING AND BORROWING,

00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:03.994
ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:06.263
BUT ALWAYS AS A SHARE OF GDP.

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:09.299
THAT'S THE SAME POLICIES, THAT'S

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.667
THE SAME APPROACH WE HAD DURING

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:11.168
THE REAGAN YEARS.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.003
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, LET'S TALK

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:13.804
ABOUT SOMETHING THE MARKETS WERE

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:14.571
WORRIED ABOUT A FRIEND AND

00:04:14.572 --> 00:04:15.272
THAT'S THE FACT THAT YOU GOT A

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:16.673
BAD JOBS REPORT.

00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:20.377
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:21.078
ONLY 20,000 JOBS ADDED IN

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.445
FEBRUARY.

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:24.648
THE PROJECTION HAD BEEN 180,000

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:25.282
JOBS.

00:04:25.283 --> 00:04:27.851
GOOD NEWS, WAGES ROSE 3.4%,

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:30.120
WHICH WAS THE FASTEST IN ALMOST

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:30.487
TEN YEARS.

00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:33.790
QUESTION, ARE WE REACHING --

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:34.558
REACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT WEATHER

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.294
JUST AREN'T GOING TO BE THAT

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:39.496
MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT JOBS

00:04:39.497 --> 00:04:40.197
BECAUSE THEY ARTY HAVE JOBS?

00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:40.864
&gt;&gt; Larry: LET ME SAY ON THAT

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:44.134
NUMBER ON FRIDAY, THE PAYROLL

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:45.435
NUMBERS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:49.539
SURVEY WAS ONLY 20,000 -- A VERY

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.973
FLUKY NUMBER.

00:04:49.974 --> 00:04:51.475
IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:52.242
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND THE TIME

00:04:52.243 --> 00:04:52.909
OF JOBS.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.311
&gt;&gt; Chris: YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT

00:04:54.312 --> 00:04:56.813
WHEN HER 330 JOBS THE MONTH

00:04:56.814 --> 00:04:57.147
BEFORE.

00:04:57.148 --> 00:04:58.915
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:04:58.916 --> 00:04:59.583
SHUTDOWN ISSUE OF THE MONTH

00:04:59.584 --> 00:04:59.916
BEFORE.

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.184
&gt;&gt; Chris: MY POINT IS NUMBER

00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:02.953
WAS THE NUMBER.

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:03.620
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND THE HOUSEHOLD

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.322
SURVEY FROM WHICH UNEMPLOYMENT

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:08.892
IS DERIVED, 255,000, SO THAT'S A

00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:09.326
BIG HOME RUN.

00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:13.263
THE ON EMPLOYMENT RATE FELL FROM

00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:14.865
4% TO 3.8.

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:16.500
NOTED CORRECTLY WAGES ARE A

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:16.800
3.4%.

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.102
THAT'S A TERRIFIC SIGN AND

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:21.004
WHAT'S HAPPENING AS WAGES HAVE

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:24.241
BEEN RISING, PEOPLE ARE COMING

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:25.709
OUT, MOVING BACK INTO THE LABOR

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.443
FORCE.

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:28.879
THEY ARE ONLY COMING OFF

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.846
UNEMPLOYMENT TO WORK AT THE

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:31.448
HIGHER WAGE RATES BUT THEY'RE

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.716
ACTUALLY SORT OF COMING OUT OF

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:33.550
THE WOODWORK.

00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.384
PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT PART OF THE

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.787
LABOR FORCE ARE NOW COMING BACK.

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:38.555
AND I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:39.356
PARTICIPATION RATES ARE VERY

00:05:39.357 --> 00:05:42.592
HIGH AND THAT'S A SIGNAL THAT WE

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:43.226
STILL HAVE LOTS OF LABOR

00:05:43.227 --> 00:05:44.594
RESOURCES.

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.163
BY THE WAY, THE BIGGEST CATEGORY

00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:49.166
OF IMPROVEMENT, PEOPLE COMING

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:50.967
BACK TO WORK AND SUPPLYING THE

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.270
LABOR, WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD

00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:54.671
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY --

00:05:54.672 --> 00:05:55.972
&gt;&gt; Chris: THAT WAS A GREAT

00:05:55.973 --> 00:05:56.640
NUMBER THIS MONTH.

00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:00.911
THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT AFTER

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:02.946
TEN YEARS OF GROWTH, IS THE

00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:03.513
ECONOMY SLOWING DOWN?

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:06.283
I WANT TO PUT UP SOME NUMBERS ON

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:07.317
THIS.

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:09.686
GROWTH IN 2018 WENT FROM 4.2% IN

00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:10.887
THE SECOND QUARTER, YOU CAN SEE

00:06:10.888 --> 00:06:11.588
DOWN IN HIS THIRD QUARTER AND

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.424
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 2.6% IN THE

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:17.127
FOURTH QUARTER AND WITH THE

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:20.230
ECONOMIES IN EUROPE AND CHINA

00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:22.099
SLOWING, THERE IS A GLOWING    G

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.132
SLOWING, THERE IS A GLOWING    O

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:22.165
SLOWING, THERE IS A GLOWING    I

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:22.399
SLOWING, THERE IS A GLOWING    G

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.166
CONSENSUS AMONG EXPERTS WHO ARE

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:24.000
NOT GOING TO MAKE 2% FOR THE

00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:25.802
FIRST QUARTER THIS YEAR, DO YOU

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.571
AGREE WITH THAT, THAT YOU WILL

00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:29.172
BE IN THE ONES FOR THE FIRST

00:06:29.173 --> 00:06:29.806
QUARTER OF 2019?

00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:31.174
&gt;&gt; Larry: ARE NOT GOING TO

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.075
SCORE IT JUST YET.

00:06:32.076 --> 00:06:34.811
I WILL TAKE THE OVER ON THAT

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:35.345
FORECAST.

00:06:35.346 --> 00:06:37.447
AS I GENERALLY DO, BY THE WAY.

00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:39.716
&gt;&gt; Chris: I WAS GOING TO SAY.

00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:40.851
&gt;&gt; Larry: I WOULD SAY AS LONG

00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:43.053
AS WE KEEP OUR POLICIES INTACT,

00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:44.888
LOW TAX RATES FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.691
AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE BOARD,

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:49.259
DEREGULATION, LIGHT AND THE

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.994
PAPERWORK BURDEN, LET SMALL

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:53.096
BUSINESSES BREED AND GET A GOOD

00:06:53.097 --> 00:06:53.597
RATE OF RETURN.

00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:54.498
THE PRESIDENT HAS ENDED THE WAR

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:55.866
ON BUSINESS.

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:57.667
THE PRESIDENT HAS PROVIDED

00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.302
INCENTIVES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:06:59.303 --> 00:07:00.771
WE'VE OPENED UP THE ENERGY

00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:01.104
SECTOR.

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:01.805
OUR POLICIES ARE STRONG AND I

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:04.674
THINK THE GROWTH RATES THIS

00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:06.743
COMING YEAR WILL EXCEED THESE

00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:09.045
ESTIMATES JUST AS THEY HAD LAST

00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:10.914
YEAR.

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:12.015
&gt;&gt; Chris: 2.3% THIS YEAR BRING

00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:14.050
YOU WON THE PRESIDENCY 3% GROWTH

00:07:14.051 --> 00:07:17.187
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE IN THE

00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:17.621
FEDS HAS 2.3%.

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:20.390
&gt;&gt; Larry: WE WILL SEE.

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.093
WE HAD THIS CONFLICT LAST YEAR

00:07:23.094 --> 00:07:23.860
AND THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT.

00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:26.797
THE FED WAS WRONG.

00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:31.568
MY COLLEAGUE IS STRONGLY

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:32.436
ENDORSING HIS FORECAST --

00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:33.069
&gt;&gt; Chris: THE COUNCIL OF

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.838
ECONOMIC ADVISORS.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:35.472
&gt;&gt; Larry: A GOOD FRIEND OF

00:07:35.473 --> 00:07:38.909
MINE AND I'M IN KEVIN'S CAMP AND

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.377
AGAIN, THE INVESTMENT INCENTIVES

00:07:40.378 --> 00:07:42.212
ARE SO STRONG THAT I THINK

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:43.480
YOU'RE BEING UNDERRATED.

00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:45.015
CAN I JUST GET ONE NUMBER IN?

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.983
&gt;&gt; Chris: THEN I WANT TO MOVE

00:07:46.984 --> 00:07:47.484
TO TRADE DEFICIT.

00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:49.519
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES, SIR.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.054
PRODUCTIVITY OUTPUT PER HOUR, IN

00:07:51.055 --> 00:07:53.223
A GOOD MARKET CAPITALIST

00:07:53.224 --> 00:07:53.924
ECONOMY, DEMOCRATS TAKE NOTE,

00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:55.058
PRODUCTIVITY IS THE CENTER OF

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:57.294
IT.

00:07:57.295 --> 00:07:58.562
OKAY?

00:07:58.563 --> 00:07:59.663
1.8% INCREASE IN PRODUCT, I

00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:00.730
COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:03.166
1.8% INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY,

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.501
THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER IN

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:04.901
MANY YEARS.

00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:07.070
WE'VE GONE FROM 0 TO NEARLY 2%.

00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:09.072
I'M GOING TO ARGUE GROWTH AND

00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:10.273
JOBS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND.

00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:12.108
&gt;&gt; Chris: YOU ALSO GOT SOME

00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:14.444
BAD NEWS THIS WEEK ON THE TRADE

00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:15.545
DEFICIT.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:16.313
HERE'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:21.051
LAST JUNE.

00:08:21.052 --> 00:08:21.651
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE MASSIVE TRADE

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:24.821
DEFICITS WITH ALMOST EVERY

00:08:24.822 --> 00:08:25.222
COUNTRY.

00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:26.223
WE WILL STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT.

00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:27.991
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:28.391
WHAT I DO.

00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.861
IT WON'T EVEN BE HARD.

00:08:30.862 --> 00:08:31.528
&gt;&gt; Chris: HE SETS IT WON'T

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:33.797
EVEN BE HARD BUT DESPITE HIS

00:08:33.798 --> 00:08:35.832
TOUGH POLICIES AND TARIFFS, THE

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:36.566
TRADE DEFICIT IN GOODS WORLDWIDE

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:39.402
YET LAST YEAR WAS $891 BILLION,

00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:43.006
THAT'S THE BIGGEST TRADE DEFICIT

00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:43.874
WORLDWIDE IN U.S. HISTORY AND

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:46.176
DESPITE OUR TRADE WAR WITH

00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:48.211
CHINA, THE DEFICIT AND GOODS

00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:52.115
THERE HIT A RECORD $419 BILLION.

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:53.583
SOME EXPERTS SAY THE PROBLEM IS

00:08:53.584 --> 00:08:55.352
IF YOU JUST TERRIFY AWAY

00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:58.889
DEFICITS, THAT THE REAL ISSUE IS

00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.990
MACRO ECONOMICS AND TO A DEGREE

00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:01.458
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU

00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:02.959
ARE A VICTIM OF YOUR OWN

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.361
SUCCESS, THE TAX CUTS GAVE

00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:05.362
PEOPLE MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME,

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:06.062
THEY SPENT THAT BUYING MORE

00:09:06.063 --> 00:09:08.999
FOREIGN GOODS.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.766
RISING INTEREST RATES STRENGTHEN

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.369
THE DOLLAR.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.036
THAT MADE U.S. EXPORTS MORE

00:09:13.037 --> 00:09:18.842
EXPENSIVE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES,

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:20.343
FOREIGN STOMACH IMPORTS CHEAPER.

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:21.278
BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.712
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS IT

00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:23.547
BACKWARDS, TRADE DEFICITS AND OF

00:09:23.548 --> 00:09:25.215
THE SON OF A WEAK ECONOMY, THE

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.117
PART OF THE BYPRODUCT OF A

00:09:27.118 --> 00:09:28.051
STRONG ECONOMY.

00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:28.685
&gt;&gt; Larry: A COUPLE THINGS:

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:29.586
FIRST OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS

00:09:29.587 --> 00:09:31.821
TRADE FORMER POLICIES WHICH IN

00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:32.522
MY JUDGMENT ARE SUCCEEDING

00:09:32.523 --> 00:09:35.492
BETTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT, HE'S

00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:37.160
REALLY TALKING ABOUT FREE, FAIR

00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:38.528
AND RECIPROCAL TRADE AMONG

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:38.862
NATIONS.

00:09:38.863 --> 00:09:42.032
AND WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE U.S.,

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:45.335
MCA, THE SO-CALLED NAFTA

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:46.670
TWO-POINT OH, CLOSER TO MAKE A

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:49.072
LOT OF HEADWAY A MONTH TRYING

00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:50.240
PERHAPS WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN

00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:50.774
ANOTHER MINUTE.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:51.508
WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH EUROPE

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:53.443
AND NEGOTIATING WITH JAPAN.

00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:56.212
I THINK HIS TRADE POLICIES ARE

00:09:56.213 --> 00:09:56.613
SUCCEEDING.

00:09:56.614 --> 00:09:57.380
HE'S BEEN TOUGH AND SOMETIMES HE

00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.317
WILL USE TARIFFS, SOMETHING I'VE

00:10:00.318 --> 00:10:01.251
LEARNED THAT WILL BRING PEOPLE

00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:01.985
TO THE TABLE.

00:10:01.986 --> 00:10:05.689
SECOND POINT, I'M A TRADE

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.523
DEFICIT, I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:10:06.524 --> 00:10:07.290
EITHER GOOD OR BAD.

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.259
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.028
YOU HAVE INCENTIVES FOR

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:12.896
INVESTMENTS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:10:12.897 --> 00:10:14.064
THE U.S. IS BOUND TO HAVE A

00:10:14.065 --> 00:10:15.765
TRADE DEFICIT IN GOODS WITH THE

00:10:15.766 --> 00:10:18.435
REST OF THE WORLD BECAUSE WE ARE

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:20.170
GROWING MUCH FASTER THAN THEY

00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:20.937
ARE GROWING AND SO WE ARE BUYING

00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:23.440
MORE OF THEIR GOODS.

00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:24.608
WITH RESPECT TO EUROPE FOR

00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:26.409
EXAMPLE, ALMOST FLAT ON ITS BACK

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.547
NEAR RECESSION, WE ARE THE ONLY

00:10:30.548 --> 00:10:31.081
DEMAND -- THEY HAVE.

00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:31.881
SO YES.

00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:33.149
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TRADE

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.886
SURPLUS ON SERVICES AND WE HAVE

00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:37.887
A SURPLUS ON NET INVESTMENT

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:39.589
INCOME COMING IN FROM THE USA.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.357
I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO HUNG UP

00:10:40.358 --> 00:10:43.259
ON THAT.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.127
IT'S NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD, IT

00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:45.962
JUST IS, BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE

00:10:45.963 --> 00:10:49.299
TOUGH RECIPROCAL TRADING

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.335
POLICIES WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:52.802
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY.

00:10:52.803 --> 00:10:53.269
FINALLY, CHINA.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.604
AS YOU PREDICTED.

00:10:54.605 --> 00:10:58.441
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT ABOUT IN

00:10:58.442 --> 00:11:00.343
JANUARY ABOUT A TRADE DEAL WITH

00:11:00.344 --> 00:11:02.278
CHINA AND A MUCH LESS OPTIMISTIC

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:04.314
ASSESSMENT THIS WEEK, TAKE A

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:05.882
LOOK.

00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:06.783
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT

00:11:06.784 --> 00:11:07.751
TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA IF IT ALL

00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:09.252
WORKS OUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:10.553
APPEARING IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT

00:11:10.554 --> 00:11:15.925
FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.

00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:16.693
&gt;&gt; I'M CONFIDENT BUT IF WE DON'T

00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:17.427
MAKE A VERY GOOD DEAL FOR OUR

00:11:17.428 --> 00:11:18.461
COUNTRY I WOULDN'T MAKE A DEAL.

00:11:18.462 --> 00:11:19.162
IF THIS ISN'T A GREAT DEAL I

00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:20.930
WON'T MAKE A DEAL.

00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:21.831
&gt;&gt; Chris: SO LET'S LOOK.

00:11:21.832 --> 00:11:24.334
IF THE REPORTEDLY REMOVED A TRIP

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.903
TO MAR-A-LAGO FOR ASSIGNING

00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:29.305
CEREMONY IN MARCH.

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:31.041
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, YOU CAN'T CANCEL

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:33.343
COME DON'T LIKE SOMETHING THAT

00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:34.310
WASN'T SCHEDULED.

00:11:34.311 --> 00:11:35.211
&gt;&gt; Chris: SUPPOSEDLY ACCORDING

00:11:35.212 --> 00:11:36.646
TO THE REPORT THAT WAS ON THE

00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:39.115
SCHEDULE AND IT'S NOW BEEN TAKEN

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:39.382
OFF.

00:11:39.383 --> 00:11:40.083
NUMBER ONE.

00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:41.818
NUMBER TWO, THE KEY ENFORCEMENT

00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.320
ISSUE, ENFORCING WHAT THE DASH

00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:47.057
IT HAS NOT BEEN HAMMERED OUT.

00:11:47.058 --> 00:11:47.691
THE CHINESE ARE REPORTEDLY

00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:48.491
CONCERNED THAT IF THERE IS A

00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:49.292
CONSUMMATE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF

00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:50.493
LIKE THE DEAL HE WILL WALK AWAY

00:11:50.494 --> 00:11:53.163
LIKE HE DID WITH KIM IN VIETNAM.

00:11:53.164 --> 00:11:54.330
CIVIL QUESTION, HOW MUCH TROUBLE

00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:56.833
IS A TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA IN?

00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.868
&gt;&gt; Larry: I THINK WERE MAKING

00:11:58.869 --> 00:11:59.335
GREAT PROGRESS.

00:11:59.336 --> 00:12:00.737
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, ACROSS

00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:02.105
THE BOARD THE DEAL HAS TO BE

00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:03.506
GOOD FOR THE UNITED STATES AND

00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:05.275
FOR OUR WORKERS AND OUR FARMERS

00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:05.875
AND OUR MANUFACTURERS.

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:07.377
IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD.

00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:08.111
IT'S GOT TO BE FAIR AND

00:12:08.112 --> 00:12:09.979
RECIPROCAL AND IT HAS TO BE

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.380
ENFORCEABLE.

00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:14.651
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:15.485
SECONDLY, WE MADE GREAT HEADWAY

00:12:15.486 --> 00:12:17.153
WHEN THE CHINESE WERE HERE TWO

00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:18.054
WEEKS AGO.

00:12:18.055 --> 00:12:19.255
IN THE PAST WEEK WE SPENT IN

00:12:19.256 --> 00:12:21.057
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM EVERY

00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:23.126
DAY BY TELECONFERENCING AND SO

00:12:23.127 --> 00:12:23.927
FORTH WORKING OUT SOME OF THE

00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:27.063
DIFFICULT FINAL POINTS.

00:12:27.064 --> 00:12:27.831
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN

00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:29.232
THE SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS.

00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:31.534
I DON'T WANT TO PREDICT, IT'S UP

00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:32.235
TO THE PRESIDENT AND NOT TO ME

00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:35.672
BUT I THINK THE HEADWAY HAS BEEN

00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:36.139
GOOD.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.873
THIS MORNING HEADLINE CHINA HAS

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:40.210
ACCEPTED OUR CURRENCY PROPOSALS

00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:40.910
TO HAVE STABLE CURRENCIES AND

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:43.079
TRANSPARENT INTERVENTIONS SO

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080
THAT THEY WON'T DEVALUE --

00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:45.048
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'M RUNNING OUT OF

00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:45.348
TIME.

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.617
A SIMPLE QUESTION, WILL THERE BE

00:12:47.618 --> 00:12:49.152
A SIGNING CEREMONY BETWEEN THE

00:12:49.153 --> 00:12:51.187
TWO LEADERS EITHER IN MARCH OR

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:51.888
APRIL?

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:52.856
&gt;&gt; Larry: I WILL PLAY THAT

00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:53.723
FROM THE OPTIMISTIC SIDE.

00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:58.094
I WILL TAKE THE OVER ON THAT.

00:12:58.095 --> 00:12:59.095
&gt;&gt; Chris: OVER MEANING?

00:12:59.096 --> 00:13:01.197
&gt;&gt; Larry: OVER MEANING GOOD,

00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:02.065
YES, POSITIVE.

00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:02.799
&gt;&gt; Chris: SOMETIME EITHER THIS

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.838
MONTH OR NEXT.
