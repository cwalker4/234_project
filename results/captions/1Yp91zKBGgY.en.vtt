lies lies lies lies lies. this maid is telling lies.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870
He said no Adrian. You're excellent

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.289
Loyalty to me means a lot you can be with me forever

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.619
The first time I cleaned his bedroom

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.339
Uh, I didn't even know where to start

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.889
He was the sort of classic rock star was he just sort of dropped everything behind him and lets you pick it up

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.350
Yeah, he was like that

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.959
Home Videos from the time captured the singer relaxing at Neverland

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.100
It was a place to live out his fantasies and he shared the fun with the children. He surrounded himself with

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.389
What was the first thing for you what made you first suspect

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.310
That Michael Jackson had an unhealthy interest in children. I

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.410
Noticed that there were a lot of little boys. That's all that would hang around there

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.569
You wouldn't see like little girls and I knew the little boys were there

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.019
When they would arrive they would put their clothes in the suitcase in a suitcase in his room. I

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.520
started

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.520
realizing thinking and wondering

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.639
When he was taking baths with him, they were sleeping in his bed, but they're sleeping in their sleeping

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.609
Yeah, yeah you were talking about

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.459
the worst kind of sleeping with children

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.169
Yes, I know the truth. I was there and

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.900
When I would go in the next day there were little boys underwears either on the floor with Michaels or they were in the jacuzzi

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.970
So you were suspicious as soon as you saw that? Yeah, I got suspicious

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.439
And then I would find underwears also in his bed. I

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.030
I did find

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.030
underwears that were

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.270
mints

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.410
briefs

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.410
in the walk-in closet and

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.690
they were

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.080
Right and I I don't like to say this they were like crunchy hard with yellow stains all over him

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.110
I didn't know who they belonged to

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.650
Because the little boys started wearing Michael's briefs

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.589
And they would leave their underwears inside his drawer

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.970
The more Adrian saw the more convinced. She was that Michael Jackson was a predator

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.478
A feeling she says was shared by other staff at Neverland

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:05.989
There was a lot of Vaseline at Neverland

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.479
Sometimes it was found in the golf carts when mr. Jack's want to take off with the

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.529
with the boys

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.439
Vessel a yeah Vaseline and there was a lot of Vaseline in Michaels bedroom

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:23.659
It was actually all over the ranch. Is there possibly an innocent explanation for that? I?

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:26.629
Don't think so

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:36.049
What disturbed Adrienne the most was the way the popstar would be physical with the kids who were entrusted to his care

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.280
They were sitting on his laps the kids. I just saw a lot of

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400
maybe fondling

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.519
Him maybe rubbing his hands and kids hair

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.389
Kissing him when you say fondling hugging kind of petting

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.489
Petting the kids petting the kids. We're kind of by the rear end. I

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.840
Don't think it was appropriate because they're not his children. You know, I

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.479
Just didn't think it was right. Did you ever talk to anybody about it?

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.989
you know, I signed a confidentiality agreement and

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.660
I was already conditioned and

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:22.970
Programmed you don't question it and we were told to stay away from the family. You just made you do your job

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.210
Every time we were together

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.990
It happened

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.899
There was no night that went by that I was with him that he didn't sexually abuse me

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:39.949
Adrian is not. The only one to be speaking out on the 10th anniversary of Michael Jackson's death. I

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.300
Was seven years old

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.010
Michael asked do you and the family when I come to Neverland?

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.720
Hello wait

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.720
Today is your birthday

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.260
Self. Congratulations. I love you. Goodbye

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:02.959
Australian choreographer Wade Robson has claimed he was molested by the singer when he was a boy

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.189
Told me if they ever found out what we were doing

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.500
He and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:20.619
Now he and former child actor James safe Chuck have gone much further

00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:24.879
Accusing Jackson of the most despicable depravity

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.849
In a controversial documentary leaving Neverland that was recently unveiled at the Sundance Film Festival

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.039
Don't believe your story or perhaps don't want to believe it

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:46.979
Is there anything that you feel that you can't say to them in a way not that long ago? I

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:49.649
was in the same position they were

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:55.169
Even though it happened to me. I still couldn't believe it. I still couldn't believe that

00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:57.959
What Michael did was a bad thing?

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:07.529
Would you have thought 14 years later all this would be regurgitated I would never have imagined such a thing happening

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:11.729
I just still have trouble comprehending it for loya Tom Mesereau

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.719
The latest allegations are the claims of opportunists out to make a buck. I can't get over it

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.259
I mean, I just don't put any credibility in any of this. I just don't

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:27.519
In

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:32.578
2005 he helped clear jackson of child molestation charges and

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:40.169
Defends the singer to this day. I am 100% convinced Michael never abused a child never harmed a child

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:44.188
Certainly, never molested a child. I think this is hogwash

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:50.758
Are you on any sort of retainer at all from the Jackson estate? No, I'm not on any retainer at all

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:55.048
So no one's paying you any money to say nice things about Michael Jackson. No, no

00:10:55.689 --> 00:11:00.629
I will always say was a nice person he was he was one of the nicest people I ever met

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.049
But you of all people know the smoke and fire argument

00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:08.428
Is there any fire? There's no fire here whatsoever

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:15.989
Coming up. I used his fame and power in very loving and also very childish

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:24.819
Mede ways inside the playground of evil. Did you at any time see Michael Jackson? Molest Jordan Chandler it was

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.360
Terrible desperate bribes

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:33.759
$300 that was for covering for him dead frets if they could hire a hitman to take me out

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:40.149
Slice my hair and Michael Jackson's darkest secrets. We just want to show you this I

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:47.139
Remember that I was working there when that day when that ad was taping that that's next on 60 minutes

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:11.669
He was enormous it shouldn't have been King of Pop should have been gotta pop Emperor

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:28.699
Charisma isn't even the word for the spell he had on people

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.220
So I was caught up in it, too

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.589
Everything around him was a fantasy

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.470
Genie wolf is an old-school

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:41.569
Entertainment reporter who followed Michael Jackson's career right from the start

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.529
Enjoy the latest video from the hit album dangers. She

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:56.449
Regarded Jackson as the ultimate creative genius but also saw a dark side I

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.639
Couldn't help but observe what a

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.979
Spoiled King of Pop he was how he used

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:14.029
his fame and power in very loving and also very childish and

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.060
mean ways

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:22.279
Genie remembers how at the height of Jackson's fame

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:29.749
It was easy for starstruck families and their kids to be drawn into the singer's magical world

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.019
Surrounding himself as he did with children, didn't you ever find that unusual?

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:40.068
We didn't think much was unusual. He tried to be the Pied Piper

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.309
When I was around him, they were hidden in groups

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:50.869
I mean all these little kids some costumes some just regular kids following him and it just seemed like a

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:57.379
Comfort for him and his explanation was he didn't have a childhood? Yes. Did it seem strange?

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:04.068
Did it seem eccentric? Yes, but that eccentricity allowed him to get away with a lot because it's Michael

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:15.229
In the 1990s bus loads of children would be invited to Neverland to enjoy the theme park and a zoo

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.659
Down this way, you're gonna see a the game room is right there

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.880
But Jackson's made

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:30.229
Adrian McManus says there was always a lucky few who seemed to receive special attention

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.910
Young boys like home alone actor Macaulay Culkin who she claims she saw being touched inappropriately

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.519
by the singer

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:51.170
You're on record you're on public record court record is talking about Macaulay Culkin

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.410
Do you stand by that story? I?

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.849
Stand by what I said during my deposition, you know, I think it's best just leave it at that

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:11.209
Because Macaulay Culkin says, it's preposterous doesn't he? Yeah, he denies it to this day. He does

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.659
But you say you did heven I say I saw what I saw

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:28.549
Macaulay Culkin has always supported Michael Jackson and denies the singer ever molested him

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.490
But back in 1993

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.779
Another of Jackson's young male friends turned against him

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:43.730
13 year-old jordan chandler accused jackson of sexually abusing him during sleepovers at Neverland

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.399
Did you at any time see Michael Jackson molest Jordan Chandler

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.450
I saw some stuff that I didn't think was appropriate with. Mr. Jackson Jordan

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.520
What sort of things did you say with with Jordan Chandler Michael kissing on him?

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.989
Michaels has kind of very close to Georgie's crotch

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.770
It was

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:11.959
Terrible to see

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.249
Police launched an investigation into the abuse allegations and

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.379
Jordan Chandler's family announced they were preparing a civil case

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.679
But despite her strong suspicions to the contrary in a sworn deposition

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.310
Adrienne McManus said she had never witnessed Jackson molest children. I

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.049
Was scared to say anything bad about Michael. Mr. Jackson and

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:49.619
Then after that after I did the deposition probably 30 days maybe after Michael called me at my home

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:57.899
She claims Jackson demanded to know what his personal maid had told investigators about his behavior

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.190
Adrienne found herself in an unenviable position. I

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:09.479
Didn't think I was supposed to be doing that. I was kind of worried about that, but then I thought well you better do it

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.560
you know, so I did it and then

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.139
When one day and afternoon, he came up to me and he said Adrienne

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:25.319
This is for you and he had to me a little index card. That was like stapled on the sides

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.490
and it said

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.490
Thanks for everything

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.389
I opened it and it was $300

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:42.580
So that was for covering for him. He paid me $300. He was born no solids for $300. Yeah

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:52.388
Michael Jackson fired back at his accusers in a live televised announcement from Neverland

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:55.809
There have been many disgusting

00:17:56.509 --> 00:18:01.389
Statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:07.809
These statements about me are totally false. Don't treat me like a criminal because I am innocent I

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.860
Remember that I was working there when that day when that media was taping that

00:18:12.649 --> 00:18:15.789
1993. Mm-hmm. Don't treat me like a criminal because I'm innocent

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:20.619
Does that bring back strong memories? Uh, it takes me back to that day and

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.450
It makes me mad that I had to be involved in something like that

00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:27.679
Why me?

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:30.788
So you don't believe those protestations one tiny bit

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.460
They don't

00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:44.559
Jackson was never charged with molesting Jordan Chandler, but the young boy and his family

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.439
Received a 20 million dollar settlement from the singer it led to intense criticism

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.340
Jackson was buying the silence of his victims

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.869
Did you ever

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.080
Sexually engage

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.049
Fondle have sexual contact with this child or any other child never ever

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:14.949
I could never harm a child or anyone. It's not in my heart. It's not who I am and it's not what I meant

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:17.159
I'm not even interested in

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:27.619
This is joy Robson, you've known Michael Jackson you describe how would you describe your relationship with Michael?

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.049
Michaels like family to us. He's been very supportive

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.889
Personally and he waits career

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:45.380
At the time many came to Jackson's defense including Wade Robson and his family

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:53.239
Wade was the 10 year old Australian boy who developed an extremely tight bond with the singer and

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.690
Was still having sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.400
Weird how would you describe your relationship with Michael? It's a real close relationship

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.269
It's both sides friendly and business

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.690
We love each other both very Julie, we're just real good friends

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:23.300
How did you feel when you heard that a boy was alleging that Michael had abused him Oh shot too

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.789
And I think it's sick cuz I know Michael well enough that you wouldn't do anything like that. I know that for a fact

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.549
After Jackson paid millions to settle the case against jordan chandler

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.689
Things changed for the worst for the workers at Neverland

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:52.219
Adrian McManus claims she and other staff were victimized by michael jackson's security guards

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.530
Because they knew too much

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.980
It was threatened. His bodyguards told me that

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.470
If I ever came up and on TV that they could hire a hitman take me out

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080
Sliced my neck would never find my body

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.040
And you believed them

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.060
Yeah, I did. I lived in fear for many many years

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:21.110
Adrian lived with the fear and Michael Jackson lived with the rumors. Come on. Just get on show. Come on. Just show me

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.910
Just show me but in 2003 he made a monumental mistake

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:38.209
By inviting journalists Martin Bashir to show his life at Neverland. Do you come out here on your own? Yeah

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.910
Just come out on your own. Yes. What then go on a ride. Yep

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.880
You see the carousel. I'll play music

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.520
I look I don't play classical music on the carousel the documentary living with Michael Jackson

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.349
Gave an insight into the madness that engulfed the singers every move

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:09.339
Michael Jackson had just dangled his new baby out of the window of a Berlin hotel

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.550
Please buddies like it my kid blended

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:32.649
Michael Jackson hoped the documentary would turn his reputation around instead. It destroyed it

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.220
Have you been hearing about what people have been saying

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:43.330
That's totally ignorant. I would never do that to my children or any any child trying to kill them gone stupid

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:47.199
And why would I put a scarf over the baby's face if I was trying to throw him off the balcony?

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:54.069
I think the Martin Bashir documentary was a disaster for Michael Jackson. I think he never should have trusted. Mr

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.080
Bashir to do an objective

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.660
professional documentary

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.590
Jackson's lawyer Tom Izzo believes it was a turning point

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:11.020
Why do you think that you think the result was slanted Dean I think mr. Bashir turned it all against him

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.439
Tried to create a sensationalist documentary

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.889
for personal gain, that's my opinion and

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:25.149
It was spliced together and put together in a way which in my opinion was designed to make Michael look bad

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.160
What looked particularly bad was this

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:39.200
Twelve-year-old Gavin Arvizo had been recovering from cancer when Jackson met and befriended him

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.779
In the documentary Martin Bashir asked the young boy about the sleeping arrangements at Neverland

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.329
And then he finally said ok

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:57.349
If you love me to see one of it I was like, ah, man and so I finally sat on the bed

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.660
but Michael, you know, you're a

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.820
44 year old man now

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.760
What what do you get out of this? What do you get out of this? What can't you share your bed?

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.170
But the most loving thing to do is to share your bed with someone

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.140
You know your anything that yeah

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:25.070
After the broadcast Michael Jackson accused Bashir of betraying his trust and manipulating the interview

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.559
But the fuse was lit police raided Neverland Ranch

00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:43.628
Approximately 70 sheriff's rated, Neverland

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:51.008
scoured every building every room for computers for documentary evidence anything they could find

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:59.649
They were relentless in their efforts to find evidence to convict Michael Jackson with and in a write of that sighs

00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:02.059
What did they find?

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:04.148
Nothing in my opinion

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:10.479
Michael Jackson was arrested and charged

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:17.799
It was a humiliating downfall. That would see Jackson's dirty laundry aired before the world

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.289
Coming up the jacksons bike back so you think it's all

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.289
Tied into money. Yes money and fame and publicity the made under pressure

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:36.519
How do we know you're telling the truth now, but always defiant. I know the truth. I can sleep very good at night

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.830
That's rich on 60 minutes

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:54.129
Adrian McManus claims she has been left penniless by her four years working at Neverland as

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320
Michael Jackson's house made

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.680
When she left in 1994

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.410
She and four other employees

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.120
Sued the singer for wrongful termination and lost

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.779
Do you still owe the Jackson estate money? I

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.270
Probably do but

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.150
Michaels dead now, you know

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:26.529
Yeah, you must know the amount. Well, you know, I know that um, I can't remember it. It might have been Oh,

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.059
God it was a lot of money you were ordered to pay legal fees

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:37.900
Initially, yeah for breach of contract for suing mr. Jackson, which was what 1.6 million it was father. Yeah, just to refresh your memory

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.230
Okay. Yeah, the sheriff hasn't come knocking at the door yet. No

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.970
And your hope they don't

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.970
Well, they do they do

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:53.208
In a countersuit Jackson's estate

00:26:53.849 --> 00:26:59.688
Accused her of stealing belongings from Neverland to sell to the media. There was a

00:27:01.169 --> 00:27:02.309
sketch

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:04.309
That I found in the trash you

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:07.429
Then unsold that sketch

00:27:07.949 --> 00:27:14.329
The sketch of Elvis that you supposedly found in the trash. I figured well, I found in the trash. It didn't mean anything to me

00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:22.549
Which I shouldn't did that, you know, but I did and the jury said that you then owed Michael Jackson

00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:30.558
$34,000. Yeah from that from now after yeah, so did you pay the thirty four thousand back? No, I did it. No

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:33.529
You haven't paid any of that back either. No

00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:45.138
The credibility of Adrian McManus has again been questioned because of her changing account of what she saw at, Neverland

00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:48.109
sworn evidence she gave in

00:27:48.719 --> 00:27:54.799
1993 that she never saw any inappropriate behavior by Jackson towards any child

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:57.619
at Michael Jackson's trial

00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:00.289
You were found to have lied under oath

00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:05.478
Okay. Now I'm gonna explain that. Um when Michael threatened me I

00:28:06.869 --> 00:28:10.218
was scared what was gonna happen to me and my family and my son you

00:28:11.249 --> 00:28:14.269
Admit to not telling the truth. Yeah, because he threatened me

00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:17.059
How do we know you're telling the truth now?

00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:22.338
Well, let's put it this way. I know the truth. I can sleep very good at night

00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:29.868
I'm happy I did what I did by standing up and trying to do the right thing

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.529
You've got to look very carefully at people's motives and you've got to look very carefully at the facts

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.519
You've got the most famous person in the world one of the wealthiest people in the world

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.810
Perceived as very vulnerable

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.489
Okay, and people constantly try to exploit him throughout his lifetime

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:56.310
The lawyer Tom Mesereau so much of what was aimed at Michael Jackson was about cold hard cash

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.489
People wanted to make so much money on

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.749
Watching the great Michael Jackson rise high and then splatter

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.160
They wanted the story to have a miserable ending for him

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.930
They hoped they would see him in the courtroom in Chains and jail clothes

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.430
Without makeup without his hair fixed up without the clothing

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:25.289
He liked to wear they were looking forward to seeing the final chapter where Michael Jackson gets destroyed and it was very disheartening

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.200
to observe so you think it's all

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.729
Tied into money. Yes money and fame and publicity

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.849
Including what he views as the latest trumped-up charges of child abuse

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.870
some of these

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.359
Accusers have not just changed their story slightly. They've done a 180

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.330
Is there a possible explanation in the me2 movement where people now feel more comfortable?

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.690
Saying publicly. Look I was abused

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.270
Can we now please do something about it?

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.799
Right. Now if you are accused of this type of thing you were almost judged guilty before you can defend yourself

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:11.880
I think right now we're going a little too far and a lot of people who are not honest who are trying to capitalize

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.400
on this particular movement are

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.780
raising

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.639
Accusations that need to be challenged you don't think the freedom of the May 2 movement

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.340
could be explained for

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.359
These latest accusers coming up and saying that Michael Jackson molested them

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.550
I think the freedom of the me2 movement has allowed false accusations to be made as well as

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:40.380
Real accusations and we've got to be very careful to make sure we sift out what's real and what's false

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.890
Coming up

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:50.209
King of Pop in core I think it's worth to be charged with something like this than Thomason disputed testimony. I saw a good

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:57.049
Bunch of people who I felt very deeply were lying and an extraordinary result

00:30:57.049 --> 00:31:00.559
Were you surprised by the outcome celebrities can do no wrong in?

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.220
Today's world that's next on 60 minutes

00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:13.429
Why can't you share your bed

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:21.469
The most loving thing they do is to share your bed with someone by agreeing to participate in Martin Bashir's documentary

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:27.410
Michael Jackson with the innocent assistance of his 12 year old friend Gavin Arvizo

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.879
Had given police all the reason they needed to investigate

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.870
America indeed the world had never seen anything like it

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.299
In 2005 Jackson's case came to court

00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:47.220
and

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.649
So the stage was set for what would be one of the biggest trials of the century

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.740
it was a showdown more than a decade in the making and

00:31:54.929 --> 00:31:59.359
Covered by twice as many media as turned up for the OJ Simpson trial

00:31:59.879 --> 00:32:03.259
Jackson faced 14 counts from child molestation

00:32:03.809 --> 00:32:10.248
To conspiring to imprison the accuser and his family at the Neverland Ranch if found guilty

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:13.339
He faced at least 20 years in jail

00:32:14.129 --> 00:32:18.649
These are horrific charges. These are ugly nasty charges

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:23.569
I think it's worse to be charged with something like this than homicide. I really do

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.279
The 14 week trial was a circus I

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:35.089
Think you have just seen that it takes about 20 minutes to make it a hundred yards when you're in mr. Jackson's company

00:32:38.129 --> 00:32:41.359
Everyday crowds would gather to see the King of Pop

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.310
This case is about one thing only

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.640
It's about the dignity

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.780
the integrity the decency the honor

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.280
the charity

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.269
The innocence and the complete vindication of a wonderful human being named. Michael. Jackson

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.189
Hollywood journalist, Janie wolf saw things very differently. I

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:23.800
Saw people who were out to get Michael Jackson. I saw people who were angry at Michael Jackson

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:28.270
I also saw people who adored him and then I saw a good

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.709
Bunch of people who I felt very deeply were lying. We're getting paid were getting

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.579
Influenced and and I found the whole thing

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.810
Frightening on which side do you think people?

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.040
Were lying in favor of Michael Jackson in his defense in his defense saying that nothing ever happened

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.329
Adrian McManus took the stand to give evidence

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:02.379
Against her former employer. Well, it's pretty crazy. I wasn't shocked that it was that it was happening again

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640
Because I knew it was gonna happen again

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:09.860
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:15.399
You always thought a trial sooner or later was going to come along did you? Yeah, I did. Yes, I did

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.370
Sad to say but yeah

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:25.149
Wade Robson is now accusing Michael Jackson of abusing him throughout his childhood

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.119
Was the star witness for the defense?

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:34.659
He was very very strong in his defense of Michael Jackson. He told me in no uncertain terms

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:41.800
He had not been molested. He had not been abused and that these claims were ridiculous. I mean this man was so strongly

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.780
supportive of Michael Jackson

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.519
So powerful in his defense of Michael Jackson that it just shocks me that he's changed his story in recent years

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.520
I just can't get over it

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.570
as

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:59.870
the trial reached a conclusion the strain of Michael Jackson was starting to show I

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.700
watched him deteriorate

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:09.950
Physically and emotionally during the trial he lost weight his cheeks became more sunken in by verdict day

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.380
He just looked like a shell of his old self to me

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.600
After eight days of deliberation the jury reached its verdict

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.810
we the jury find the defendant not guilty of attempting to commit a lewd act upon a minor child a

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.110
Unanimous decision of not guilty on all charges

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.400
That moment in the courtroom

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:42.039
When they said not guilty

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:45.278
How many times 14 14 times?

00:35:46.099 --> 00:35:48.999
What was that? Like that was one of the most unique?

00:35:49.819 --> 00:35:51.140
powerful

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.140
unusual experiences of my lifetime

00:35:55.309 --> 00:36:00.699
What would Michael Jackson say to you he said thank you thank you. Thank you, never forget

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.719
For Michael Jackson, it was vindication

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.269
But the damage was done and life at Neverland would never be the same again

00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:13.839
Were you surprised by the outcome

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.510
No, I wasn't surprised because I

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.680
think in today's world a lot of jurors

00:36:24.529 --> 00:36:26.529
They don't like to

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:30.999
Say that a celebrity is is guilty

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.220
Why not

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:40.539
Because they think they're above everybody else. They just they look up to them and they right away think everybody wants money

00:36:40.539 --> 00:36:42.758
That's why you know celebrities can do no wrong

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.670
in today's world

00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:48.579
That's what I think

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.639
Coming up the biggest headline of all

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.809
Very eerie to even be around you. I've never visited this place before the stories. That won't go away

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.650
talk about

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.180
Their abuse make these new accusations. Do you believe them?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:17.590
It would be very hard not to believe them and returning to Neverland one last time, yeah, I can't believe I'm coming back here

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.390
very mixed emotions

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.390
That's next on 60 minutes

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:38.740
Michael Jackson might have been found not guilty of child sexual abuse in 2005

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:44.980
But the trial and the lurid headlines have created irreparably damaged his career

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:51.399
Never again. Would he hit the highs of the musical stardom? He had once known

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:01.380
These will be my final show

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.160
Performances in London

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:12.059
This will be it this is it when I say this is it it really means this is it because

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.690
In 2009 though at fifty years of age he announced one last shot

00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:42.798
Jackson called his farewell tour. This is it and sold out 50 concerts at London's o2 arena

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.039
But less than three weeks from the start of the tour

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:11.119
Michael Jackson made his biggest headline ever when he overdosed on prescription drugs and died

00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:21.949
The day Michael died, where were you I came home and

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.230
Their father called me and he said can't you have to come down to the hospital?

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:32.598
Like the rest of the world news of Jackson's death was met with disbelief

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:37.639
By his family as his mum Katherine told Liz haze in

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.420
2013

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.700
Nobody would say anything and I said well, where's Michael I want to go to his room

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.700
I want to go and visit him, you know

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.059
Nobody said anything

00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:53.899
And then find me in about ten or fifteen minutes later. They took me to a room and nobody would say anything

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:59.359
So finally I said well did he make it and I was screaming like did he make it?

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:02.599
and

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:07.879
Frank finally said slowly. No, he didn't make it

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:17.289
I don't know what happened after that. I guess I must have blacked out or screamed or something but

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:19.289
That's what happened

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.960
Stay

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:35.870
More than 1 billion people watched a funeral service that was broadcast live around the world

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.889
The curtain closing on one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.420
This is where Michael spent his last few hours, it's very eerie to even be around you

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.720
I've never visited this place before I've never even wanted to

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:03.230
Returning to the mansion where Michael Jackson died is a reminder for Jeanne Wolff of what has been lost

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:08.810
Once blinded by his star power. She now views him differently

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.659
Do you think Jeanne that these latest?

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:19.280
Accusations have affected the Michael Jackson legacy. I definitely do I don't think people will look at him in the same way

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.929
I don't think his music will die. It's just too great. I think his music is

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.740
Beyond him, but the myth the myth is gone

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.309
But for Tom Mesereau the lawyer who defended him, it's Michael Jackson

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.890
Who is the victim not the boys who ended up in his bed in Neverland?

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.450
You're one person that knows in life. There's a lot of gray

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.390
Not a lot of black and white

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.170
but you're

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:59.039
Adamant, aren't you you don't think Michael Jackson has molested one single person. Michael was a creative spirit

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.390
He danced to his own drummer. He saw things. We don't see he heard things

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:08.760
We don't hear he was a creative genius. He was eccentric he was different and he was an artist

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:15.270
I don't believe he was a molester for five seconds if we look at the history of this though the number of accusers

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.710
Chandler

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.710
Gavin Arvizo

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.809
Wade Robson now Jimmy's safe Chuck. I mean are they all making it up?

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.890
Let's look at them individually

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.870
Safe Chuck swore under penalty of perjury that he wasn't abused

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.340
Robson swore under penalty of perjury that he wasn't abused

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.640
Her visa wasn't believed by the jury

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:48.149
Two other people were paid off to end the litigation to end the lawsuit so we could get on with his career

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:53.850
So, where do you where do you when you look at everyone under a microscope? What do you really come up with? Not much

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:00.959
Well a lot more than most mere mortals face in their lifetime but he's the biggest target on the planet

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:07.589
He was the most famous person on the planet. He was immensely wealthy. He was perceived as immensely vulnerable

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.799
This made him a target throughout his life

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.250
Any and he's being attacked even in death

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.190
by people who want money

00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:21.940
The days

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.650
were filled with

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.160
magical childhood adventure

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.359
experiences

00:43:28.359 --> 00:43:31.798
playing tag watching movies eating junk food

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.950
Anything you could ever want as a child

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.799
Out of a storybook right? I'm a fairy tale

00:43:41.049 --> 00:43:49.018
Michael Jackson gave the world his music but to his accusers he took away so much

00:43:52.269 --> 00:43:56.639
More than most Genie wolf has listened to what they've said and

00:43:57.609 --> 00:44:02.098
Believes their accounts of what happened at Neverland are convincing

00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:04.690
Jeanie

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:10.740
You've seen and heard Wade Robson and Jimmy's safe Chuck. Yes. I talked about

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.880
Their abuse make these new accusations. Do you believe them?

00:44:17.319 --> 00:44:22.558
It would be very hard not to believe them, how do you explain their complete reversal of

00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:30.239
Their stories they were both in love as only a kid could be with Michael Jackson

00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:36.989
Both of them have repeatedly said that Michael Jackson told them over and over again

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:44.008
We can never tell anyone because if we do I'll go to jail for life and you'll go to jail for life. So

00:44:44.769 --> 00:44:46.690
embedded in their mind

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.279
Was the imperative that we never tell this secret

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.140
I

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.140
Can't believe I'm coming back here

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:02.769
Very mixed emotions, Adrian McManus insists. She's also telling the truth about

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.969
Michael Jackson and what went on in Neverland a

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.610
Place she would rather forget

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.150
When you see these gates again

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.210
What's the abiding memory

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Anxiety

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:22.910
Misery I

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:29.259
Would never go through those gates again ever. That's how you think about all those years here. Is it misery misery a

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.870
bad choice bad choice that I made

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.910
If Michael Jackson was still

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.580
Alive today, do you think you would be?

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:49.399
Speaking out like this if he was alive, I would say it I would say it to his face. I

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.710
really would

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:59.270
You know, I was 28 when I started working for him these boys were young if it was hard for me at that age

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.480
Can you imagine how?

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:09.320
How it was for them. It was another side to him and I saw it. Mmm, I

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:14.300
Don't feel sorry for that. I just don't I feel sorry for the children

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.999
