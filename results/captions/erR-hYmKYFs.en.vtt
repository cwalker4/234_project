00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.210
In 
chaos theory, one small event in the universe

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.360
can trigger a series of events that changed
history forever.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.870
This is also called “the butterfly effect.”

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.320
As you’ll in this list, one single event
truly can change the course of humanity.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.340
These 10 “what if” questions will leave
you pondering alternate histories that very

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.500
nearly became a reality.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.960
10.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.590
What if The Axis Powers Won World War II?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.030
The Man in the High Castle is a TV series
based on the novel by Philip K. Dick.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.690
It plays out this what-if scenario of what
the United States would look like if it lost

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.690
the war.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.979
Japan controls the West Coast, with the Nazi
party is in the East.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:59.780
There are a few key events in real life that
lead to the Allied victory at the end of World

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.420
War II, like Russia’s victory at the Battle
of Stalingrad, the Battle of the Bulge on

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.350
the Western Front, and America dropping nuclear
bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.000
However, the single event that Philip K. Dick
attributes to this alternate reality was the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.090
assassination attempt on Franklin Roosevelt’s
life on February 15, 1933 in Miami, Florida.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.909
In his alternate universe, FDR actually dies,
and that is what sets off the chain of events.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.870
He believes that without Roosevelt’s strong
leadership to bring America out of the Great

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.700
Depression, they never would have been as
powerful as they are today, and they would

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.549
have been little help to the Allied effort.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.549
9.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.979
What if the Vikings Colonized America?

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.979
In the United States, there is a misconception
that Christopher Columbus discovered North

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.979
America.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.520
In reality, the Vikings – namely, Leif Erikson
– discovered Canada in the 10th century.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.979
The Vikings called this land “Vinland,”
or “Wine Land” in English.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.469
According to stories, Erikson and his men
brought back a second boat that was overflowing

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.479
with grapes.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.150
Since the Vikings loved drinking and pillaging,
it only made sense that they began a colony

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.179
in Vinland.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.670
In reality, the colony of Vinland didn’t
last.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.540
Despite the fact that they knew of Vinland’s
existence, Vikings didn’t have the technology

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.209
to navigate on the open sea.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
Today, the colony is all but a distant memory.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.950
Modern-day archeologists are still finding
artifacts from the Vikings in Canada.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.099
Keep in mind this was all happening hundreds
of years before Columbus was even born.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.090
So if the original settlers had somehow managed
to survive in Vinland, there would have been

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.430
trade happening between the Norse colonies
and Canada.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.831
The Danes would have had most of the control
over North America, and the world’s most

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.380
powerful countries would look very different
today.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.430
8.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.180
What if the United States Won the War of 1812?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.540
In 1812, American President James Madison
decided to invade Canada, in order to assert

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.630
his dominance against Great Britain, and get
revenge for the sailors who had been commandeered

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.220
for the Royal Navy in their war with France.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.830
He assumed that Canadians would also want
to rid themselves of the crown’s stronghold

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.180
over their nation, as well.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.099
So, he thought that if he invaded, Canada
would accept America with open arms, and they

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.879
would join together against Great Britain.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.660
This is known as the War of 1812, or Mr. Madison’s
War.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.060
There were a few different battles that took
place on the Great Lakes, where the United

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.510
States actually won.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.659
However, British troops fighting out of Canada
would ultimately burn down the White House

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.770
in 1814.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.190
Eventually, the two sides decided to stop
the fighting, and the United States signed

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.019
a peace treaty with Great Britain.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.220
So the true “winner” is debatable.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.580
But what would have happened if the US actually
flat-out won that war?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.439
Canada would have been annexed by the United
States, and opportunities for trade, farming,

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.940
and commerce would have exploded.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.430
Considering that Canada and Great Britain
abolished slavery long before the United States,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.271
it has been theorized that if the two nations
combined, the American Civil War may have

00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:04.340
never happened.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.360
7.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.050
What if the South won the American Civil War?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.890
In the 1800s, Southern states formed the Confederacy,
and seceded from the United States in an attempt

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.870
to form their own country.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.431
In reality, the Confederacy had the upper
hand with their military leadership, and one

00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:27.430
of the major reasons why they lost the war
was due to the mistake of just one lowly messenger.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.620
In September 1862, Confederate Robert E. Lee
sent Order Number 191 with his step-by-step

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.620
plans.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.180
It was intercepted by Union soldiers, who
were able to use it against him.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.860
This was such a close call that many historians
can’t help but wonder if the war would have

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.590
turned out differently if it wasn’t for
the lost order.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.720
An alternate history author named Harry Turtledove
has written several novels with his own alternate

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.840
universe of what North America would look
like if the Confederacy had won.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.139
He believes that they would have purchased
Cuba, since that was on the list of what they

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.520
actually had planned.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.830
The United States would never have been able
to afford annexing Hawaii and Alaska, and

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.889
the two sides would be far weaker as separate
nations.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.789
Turtledove writes that there would have most
likely been a second war between the two American

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.360
nations, because the tension would never have
gone away.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
6.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.860
What if Abraham Lincoln was Assassinated Before
He Became President?

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.110
If you were paying attention in history class,
you probably already knew that Abraham Lincoln

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.139
was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth while
attending a play in 1865.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.660
You may not know that during his lifetime,
Lincoln received thousands of death threats.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.289
In 1861, when he had just been elected into
office, Lincoln’s bodyguards let him know

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.460
about a group of assassins waiting for him
in Baltimore who planned to kill him on his

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.259
way to his inaugural address at the White
House.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.340
In order to avoid this plot, Lincoln snuck
through the city the night before, and arrived

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.479
safely to his new home.

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.979
Some historians say that Lincoln was so unpopular
with the Southern states that if he had been

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.259
killed, they may have never felt the need
to secede from the Union, and there would

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.380
never have been a Civil War.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.289
On the other hand, many credit Lincoln for
abolishing slavery in the United States, which

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.819
happened at the end of the war.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.190
If he was killed before becoming president,
the US would most likely be a very different

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.190
place.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.190
5.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.190
What if the Asteroid Hit the Earth in 2017?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.300
On July 23, 2017 an asteroid was spotted in
a telescope that was coming dangerously close

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.780
to colliding with Earth.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.940
The most frightening part of the discovery
was that it had already passed its closest

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.009
point to the Earth three days earlier… meaning
that if a deadly asteroid was about to hit

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.390
our planet, we probably wouldn’t have any
warning whatsoever.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:46.870
The asteroid, which has been given the nickname
“2017 001” was just 123,031 kilometers

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.190
away from the Earth.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.830
That sounds like it’s very far away, but
it was actually closer to the planet than

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.009
the Moon, which is 384,400 kilometers away.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.560
So… what would have happened if Asteroid
2017 001 actually hit the Earth?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.349
To give you some perspective, The Huffington
Post compared it to the size of a meteorite

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.690
called Chelyabinsk, which hit in 2013.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.259
It fell into a frozen lake in Russia, and
still managed to kill 1,100 people.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.450
Asteroid 2017 001 was about three times the
size of Chelyabinsk.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.410
It wouldn’t have exactly been Armageddon,
but it would have potentially killed thousands

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.740
of people, especially if it hit a major city.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.740
4.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.099
What if Dinosaurs Never Became Extinct?

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:35.330
The extinction of the dinosaurs happened very
quickly, and without warning.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.400
There is evidence of a 9-mile wide asteroid
hitting the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.720
It was big enough to wipe 75% of life off
of the face of the Earth.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.010
This gave smaller creatures, like mammals
and flying dinosaurs, a chance to survive

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.199
and evolve into modern-day birds and other
animals.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:58.159
According to the BBC, if the asteroid had
hit mere seconds sooner or later, it may have

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.650
landed in the ocean, which would have absorbed
some of the damage.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:07.080
Or, it could have had a near-miss, like the
“2017 001” asteroid that we just mentioned.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.840
What if dinosaurs never died?

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.690
Most likely, human beings would never have
had the chance to evolve at all.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.479
Others say that dinosaurs would have died
anyway, since the Ice Age was coming.

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:22.330
A paleontologist from Stockton University
named Matt Bonnan believes that if dinosaurs

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.030
had survived, it would be more likely that
smaller herbivore dinosaurs could have survived,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.930
along with other mammals who could eat fruit
and vegetation.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.930
3.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.570
What if JFK Was Never Assassinated?

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:40.010
The JFK assassination has more conspiracy
theories than nearly any other event in US

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.010
history.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.450
Before he died, John F. Kennedy had plans
to do so many things with his presidency,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:50.110
but the single most important difference he
would have made was with the Vietnam War.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.530
Historians claim that Kennedy did not always
take the advice of his military advisors,

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.040
and leaned towards peaceful negotiations.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.380
He had even planned to remove American troops
from Vietnam, before the conflict escalated

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380
any further.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.510
His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, was the
one who chose to go to war.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.450
If America had never gone to war, it would
have spared thousands of lives that were lost

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:17.180
in what many felt was a completely unnecessary
war, and a stain on America’s history.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.790
The hippie movement and the distrust in the
American government may have never been as

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.570
strong as it was, either.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.570
2.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.000
What if the Soviet Union Invaded Japan?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.870
After World War II, the United States occupied
Japan and forced the Emperor Hirohito out

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.870
of power.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.700
After that, Japan eventually regained its
independence from America, but they were clearly

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.090
influenced by Western culture.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.780
On Christmas in Japan (where only a small
percentage of the population is even Christian),

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.930
it’s tradition to eat KFC’s fried chicken.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:49.190
So you can only imagine how different Japan
would be if the Soviet Union had occupied

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.190
them, instead.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.920
Believe it or not, this almost happened.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.900
After World War II was over, the Soviet Union
declared war on Japan again in 1945, and invaded

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.080
the Japanese territory of Manchuria with over
a million soldiers.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.220
If the Soviet Union had also invaded mainland
Japan, there is no telling what would have

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.220
happened.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.730
Some speculate that Communism would have spread
throughout the country, or at the very least

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.970
divided it, just like it did with Korea in
1945.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:18.590
If all – or even half – of Japan had become
a Communist country, anime (which truly emerged

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:25.900
as we know it in the 1960s) may have never
been perfected, and that would be a true tragedy.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.900
1.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.440
What if the Ancient Britons Survived?.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.820
Stonehenge is one of the great mysteries of
the United Kingdom.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.670
Through carbon dating, we now know that it
was built by ancient people as far back as

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.620
4200 BC.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.170
There are still many questions about how they
could move heavy rocks weighing several tons

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.500
using stone-aged technology.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.730
One of the many reasons why no one has passed
down this knowledge is because 4,500 years

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.120
ago, 90% of the native population in England
was wiped off the face of the Earth.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.060
Historians theorize that the reason why these
original people disappeared was due to a generally

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.450
declining population from colder climates.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.490
There is a possibility that many were wiped
out from a plague.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.860
The Beaker people replaced this native population,
and whoever was left from the remaining 10%

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.140
of survivors was absorbed by the Beakers through
marriage and general integration.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.560
So… how would the world be different if
the ancient native people had lived?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.470
Most likely, these original people might have
had advanced technology compared to the Beakers.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.120
Besides Stonehenge, the pre-Beaker people
were responsible for more ancient wonders,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.990
like the man-made Silbury Hill, and the ancient
ruins in Scotland.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.800
The one thing all three of these ancient landmarks
have in common is that modern-day researchers

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:56.590
still cannot figure out why they were made,
but we do know that their ancient technology

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.860
is, unfortunately, lost forever.
