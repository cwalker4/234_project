00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.980
Starbucks has coffee shops all over the world

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.320
There are more than 28,000 locations and 76 markets

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.160
From Shanghai to Guantanamo Bay

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.660
And in China, a new Starbucks location opens up every 15 hours

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.820
But there is one continent that seems uninterested in the hype over the Seattle based coffee chain

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.460
And that continent is Australia

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.860
It's proven to be one of the toughest markets in the world to break into

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.220
So tough in fact, that Starbucks closed more than two-thirds of its stores on the continent back in 2008

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.840
So what went so wrong with Starbucks and Australia

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.980
To answer that let's go back to July of 2000

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.080
When Starbucks opened its first Australian shop in Sydney

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.720
From there it expanded fast

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.120
By 2008 Starbucks had 87 stores across the continent

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.460
I think one of the problems with Starbucks

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.140
and its true for a lot of businesses that have been successful in one country

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.500
is that they thought that their business model could just roll out

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.140
to a different environment and there was no need for them to adjust

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.440
But that was the problem

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.200
They tried to grow the Empire too fast

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.900
Starbucks rapidly opened up multiple locations

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.580
instead of slowly integrating them into the Australian market

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.460
When they launched they launched too rapidly and didn't give the Australian consumer

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.960
an opportunity to really develop an appetite for the Starbucks brand

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.320
They also moved into regional areas into outer suburbs of major cities

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.180
And so for the Australian consumer it was almost like it was too available for them

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.380
And so there wasn't this point of difference, this want, this need for Starbucks

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.100
And it wasn't an organic growth which is what we very much saw in the US

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.360
In its first 7 years in Australia, Starbucks accumulated $105 million in losses

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.620
By 2007, Starbucks Australia was hanging on by a thread

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.040
taking big loans from the US, totaling up to $54 million

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.340
And in 2008, Starbucks announced it was shutting down 61 stores

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.460
But of course 2008 was a difficult time for businesses due to the financial crisis

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.020
Along with Australia closures, Starbucks also closed 600 underperforming American stores

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.800
But even still such a retreat in Australia was embarrassing for the brand

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.020
When you're shutting down 75 stores

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.240
For the Australian consumer when they, when they did leave the market

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.240
or at least a large number of bestowals were shut down they didn't really care

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.720
It's partly because Australians are spoiled for choice when it comes to coffee

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.560
Australia's coffee market is one of the biggest in the world

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.660
the industry is expected to hit more than $6 billion in total revenue in 2018

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.700
They've been immersed in nuances of cafe culture since the mid 1900s

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.000
when Italian and Greek immigrants began traveling to the country

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.840
The immigrants introduced Australians to espresso

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.020
By the 1980s, Australians were fully engulfed in cafe culture

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.820
They've also grown accustomed to specialty menu items like a flat white or an Australian macchiato

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.940
So cafes in Australia were born out of
like the Italian culture

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.160
of, you know, meeting of friends and knowing your local barista

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.520
and it being kind of like a local meeting place where everyone knew each other

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.560
and that coffee was just a part of that

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.000
and then Starbucks came in with what is more of an American style

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.140
like coffee culture which is essentially just like coffee is a product, coffee is a commodity

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.620
Coffee is like, like perk me up in the morning it's caffeination

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.520
Starbucks had a basic menu and offered more sugary drinks which most Australians didn't like

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.580
in Australia where, you know, local tastes are different

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.880
So we don't really want a coffee that's, you know, hundreds of ounces with lots of sugar in it

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.200
We want something a little more sophisticated

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.020
Plus Starbucks charge more than local cafes

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.560
So Australians instead opted to pay less for coffee they liked from a local barista they trusted

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.940
And so when you come in with this big like hey, we're going to open all these cafes

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.400
And they're all gonna be to go focus

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.580
It just was the complete wrong market for what, what the Australian was used to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.220
But there is one American coffee company that's thriving in Australia

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.740
Founded in Chicago and now based in Australia

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.720
Gloria Jean's got the traction in Australia that Starbucks couldn't

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.600
Gloria Jean's has more than 400 Australian locations

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.940
And serves more than 35 million consumers in Australia each year

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.920
So what is Gloria Jean's doing in
Australia that Starbucks isn't

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.620
Well the company attributed to success to two Australians who franchised the business in their home country

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.540
Shops started to show up in Australia in 1996

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.900
Fast forward to today, the company has a presence in every Australian state

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.760
The reason? Its menu

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.380
The chain offers a wide variety of espresso drinks and specialty coffee

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.200
Failing to adapt its menu to Australians coffee culture proved to be a mistake for Starbucks

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.820
And the company faces another challenge later this year

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.460
Italy

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.060
Starbucks is opening its first store in Milan in late 2018

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.180
home of the espresso, Italy is rich in cafe culture

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.080
But according to Starbucks it's not
going to make the same mistakes that it did in Australia

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.440
The company said that it would develop in Italy with humility and respect for its coffee culture

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.060
It announced it would be opening a roastery which is not your average cafe

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.560
It gives customers a chance to see coffee beans roasted and processed before their eyes

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.540
So there's a chance that it won't struggle like it did in Australia

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.120
But Starbucks isn't admitting defeat in Australia either

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.360
Starbucks is staging a comeback on the continent

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.340
In 2014, Starbucks locations in Australia were purchased by the Mount Waverley base withers group

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.140
Starbucks told CNBC that since its sale to the withers group the company learned a lot

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.780
So this time it's taking a different approach to putting Starbucks on the continent

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.280
So if you just think about Australia as a big tourist destination

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.160
There's a lot of U.S. and Chinese tourists

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.140
Starbucks has been very successful in China

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.340
and it makes a lot of sense for
them to build out because

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.380
there are people looking for something that's familiar to them

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.100
Now with 39 locations in Brisbane, Melbourne, the Gold Coast, and Sydney areas

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.320
this time it's not looking to appeal to Australians

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.120
but instead the coffee giant hopes to be a familiar face for tourists visiting popular vacation destinations in Australia

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.320
free Australia has always been a high-volume tourist market

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.780
The same thing in terms of international students at our universities are potential opportunities for them

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.940
And we're starting to see Starbucks
enter into some large shopping malls

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.620
here in Australia as well

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.640
Australia welcomed 9 million tourists from 2017 and 2018

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.620
And those international visitors spent more than $30 billion in 2017 alone

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.900
So tourists could possibly be the key to keeping the company afloat and preventing another downfall

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.220
