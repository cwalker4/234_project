00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.720
Sid: This man travels supernaturally from
one place to the other.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.260
I mean, it's not by plane or car, or even
bicycle, but through the invisible world.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.860
Next on this edition of “It's Supernatural!”
[music]

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.460
Centuries have come and gone offering wisdom
and understanding throughout the ages.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.500
Today there should be nothing beyond one's
power to discover.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.480
And yet the strange, unusual and mysterious
world of the supernatural defies understanding.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.540
Stay tuned for a unique and powerful investigation
into a curious undiscovered universe only

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.880
on “It's Supernatural!”

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.240
[music]

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.000
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter. Angry!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.300
And he had reason to be angry.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.219
My guest, Mike Schwartz, was angry.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.480
His father left before he was born.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.240
I mean, you almost were raised “angry at
the world”.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.020
Mike: I really can't remember a time when
I wasn't angry, and I didn't want to be.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.300
You know, it was - I wouldn't say it was funny,
but I didn't want to be angry.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.570
But it was there - maybe the rejection - and
I couldn't understand it.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.050
It didn't seem like I was able to do good.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.070
And when I was younger, you know, everybody
thought I was the kid that most was likely

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.820
to die a horrible death at 18.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.480
Sid: Did people say that in your presence?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.980
Mike: Yes.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.560
Sid: Not that specifically, but just “You'll
never amount to anything.”

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.380
Mike: Yes. My family did that. It was curses.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.800
Many times it was I - they had a cuss word
for me that I won't repeat.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.680
But it was - that was what they called me,
and it was hard.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.000
It takes its toll.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.540
Sid: Did it bother that you didn't have a
father when you were growing up?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.560
Mike: Now I'm realizing that it did.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.080
Back then, you know, when you're going through
it you don't know that this is not normal,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.600
because it's normal for you.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.690
Yeah, it bothered me.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.580
Sid: Did you get into crime? Drugs?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.770
Mike: I was into everything.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.840
I was continually in trouble.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.530
I probably had 50 arrests; spent a couple
of years in jails.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.680
I was into every kind of drug there is except
- I don't know why I never got into heroin,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.280
because I thought it was a dead man's drug.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.430
But everything else was, too.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.470
Sid: Well you thought, “Right”.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.470
Mike: Yeah.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.490
I was into drugs you could do, and I was into
every sort of perversion with men and women.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.760
It didn't matter.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.000
Sid: I have noticed that a lot of people that
have bad fathers or no fathers, somehow

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.920
they fall into the trap of homosexuality;
there seems to be a pattern.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.480
Mike: Yeah.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.840
I don't know about that, but I know where
I was, and it just seems like that when things

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.240
open up, there's nothing holy about anything
anymore.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.000
And I had - I had no hope.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.530
But there was something inside me, since I
was kid, that I would lay at night and cry.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.570
When I'd hear about this person named Jesus,
I would cry, and I didn't understand it.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.310
I was raised Catholic, but nobody told me
about salvation, you know.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.960
Nobody explained to me any of that stuff for
years.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.900
And I'd lay at night and cry, you know.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.209
I'd hear a whistle blow, and every night this
train would go by, and the whistle would blow,

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.400
and I'd cry and I'd say, “God, I want to
be good.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.580
Why can't I be good?”

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.520
This is - was since I was eight, nine-years
old.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.300
Sid: Why did you join the military service?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.140
Mike: It was either join the military or go
to jail.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.640
Sid: Really?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.680
Mike: Yes, sir.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.959
Back in the Vietnam days they needed all the
help they could get.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.450
So I lived in Chicago, and I was just involved
in some more trouble.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.680
And they gave us a choice back then to go
in the Army or go to jail.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.660
And back then, John Wayne was popular, and
you didn't think bullets could kill you.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.490
You know? it was like this glorious thing to
kill, and it’s was not that way.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.460
Sid: Vietnam was not fun.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.700
Mike: Vietnam was a horror, a horrible
nightmare.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.820
There's nothing glorious about it.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.700
Sid: You had some pretty close calls.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.280
Mike: There is nothing glorious about killing
anybody.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.080
That's the devil.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.240
We got overrun on June 6, 1966, and I was
trying to find this other personnel carrier

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.200
that got blown up, and it was on fire.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.560
So somebody had to go over there.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.240
I'm not a hero, but sometimes you just do
heroic things.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.160
And on the way there I ran into three North
Vietnamese.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.380
I was crawling on my hands and knees with
a 45 in my belt, and I hit them with my head

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.860
on their knees.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.280
And I looked up and I remember saying, “Oh
God, I'm dead.”

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.730
And when that happened, they looked down at
me, and they pointed their finger at me and

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.210
started laughing.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.480
And I felt this strange presence.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.220
They just walked off.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.780
They shot the machine gun in the air and walked
off.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.380
Sid: That doesn't make any sense to me, Mike.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.980
How could that happen?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.740
Mike: I don't know.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.320
I mean, I know why it happened now; I didn't
know then.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.140
Sid: What did you think when it happened,
“You're lucky?”

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.160
Mike: Yeah.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.660
Yeah.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.160
Really.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.040
And then there was a voice said to me that
tormented me later.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.810
This voice said to me, "You're not even good
enough to go to Hell”, and that hurt me

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.500
worse.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.220
That really - it was like the rejection stronghold
that was in me, and the self-pity; it just

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.460
ate that up.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.240
Sid: You think you're rejected.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.720
You think the world has treated you badly.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.660
Well you're looking at a man that never knew
anything but rejection.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.040
And I'm going to tell you something.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.160
It was supernatural: Three men ready to shoot
you and -

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.229
Mike: They were killing everybody.

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.180
There was already a hundred wounded and 20
dead on the ground, and we were overrun.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.710
There was a hundred, 120 of us, and there
was, oh, 1,500, 2,000 of them.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.400
And they ambushed us in the swamps, and they
killed; they were killing everybody.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.480
Just about everybody was wounded or hurt,
and we're pinned down, and we couldn't get

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.220
any help.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.400
And I was miraculously saved.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.560
Sid: So you survive Vietnam.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.060
Mike: Yes.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.980
Sid: You come back.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.140
And tell me about that day you went to the
gym.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.820
Mike: Well years later, I went to the gym,
and this guy was messing with me.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.100
He had this "I Love Jesus" t-shirt on, and
he kept bugging me and bugging me.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.871
Sid: But you liked Jesus, so why would that
bother you?

00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:58.020
Mike: Well because I was full of demonic stuff.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.401
I wasn't - when you're not living for the
King, then you're going to, you know, you're

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:06.980
going to reject anybody that's acting like
they love Him.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.080
And they were - this man was presenting something
to me that was real.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.139
I mean, I was 33 or 34-years old and never
had been presented with the Gospel, in America.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.180
Never been told about Jesus was Lord, and
He could take away your sins and remove them

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.600
- any of that; nothing.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.720
Nobody has ever confronted me.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.080
Sid: So he was confronting you.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.910
Mike: He was confronting me, and I was running.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.190
But there was something that kept bringing
us together.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.460
And he was speaking things into my life.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.700
Sid: But I'm talking about the time that you
hurt your back.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.600
Mike: Well this was right after that.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.490
Well this guy was a power lifter.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.600
He was a Christian.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.880
So I decided, “Well I'm going to be a power
lifter”, so I put my soul into it, and I

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.960
crushed - I was doing deep squats, and I crushed
- I never came out of them.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.070
I went down and never came out.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.420
I just crushed my spine.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.530
Sid: Oh my goodness.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.650
Can you picture that?

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.260
He's almost like an accordion.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.440
He crushes his spine with those heavy weights
in the gym.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.740
We'll pick up right here.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.280
Don't go away.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:27.380

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.120
Hello YouTube mishpochah!

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.540
Mishpochah is a Hebrew word; it means family.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.900
This is Sid Roth.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.160

[music]

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.180
Sid: Hello. I'm Sid Roth your investigative
reporter here with Mike Schwartz.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.720
And I'm going to tell you, I wish you could
have heard what we were talking about during

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.680
the commercial break.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:10.379
But we left off when Mike is in the gym, and
he's going to be a power lifter, because he

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:13.149
likes the way people look that are power lifters.

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:17.580
And all of a sudden, he's lifting weight,
and what happened with your spine?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.959
Mike: I had two or three discs collapse, and
I couldn't walk right; I couldn't do anything.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.280
I was in horrible pain all the time.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.240
And I went to the chiropractors and I went
to the doctors, and they said, “You'll have

00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.241
to quit work.

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:34.241
You can't work any more.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:38.300
You'll never work again”, this and that,
and all this gloom and doom, you know.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.490
I was working a construction job making great
money, $1,500 a week; back then and that was

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.910
a lot of money.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:51.189
And I was just “macho”, and sport car,
you know, just winging it, having a good time,

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:54.460
and like, finally, I'm not “Mr. Rejection”
anymore.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.280
“I’m worth something because I've got
some money”, you know.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.480
Sid: You also got some muscles.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.380
Mike: Yeah.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.300
I started to look better after awhile, you
know.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.760
And I wasn't - finally I was doing something
I wasn't failing at.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.800
I felt like a failure all my life.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.380
And now this came up, and I was just angry
again.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:18.140
So this Christian took me over to his house
one day and this man, his cousin, came in

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.480
from New Orleans.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.800
And I was in his house, whining, “Oh, you
know, the doctors are saying ‘You'll never

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.170
work again’”, and this and that, and I
was in pain, you know.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.209
And this guy walks up to me and he just looks
at me.

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:36.519
He said, "Would you like Jesus to heal you?"

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:40.970
And I looked at him and I said, "I'd like
anybody to heal me."

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.820
But I says, "If Jesus can heal me, I'd like
that."

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.040
It was selfish reasons.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.200
It wasn't - I wanted to know.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.320
Yeah, I wanted to be healed.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.740
I was hurting.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.180
Sid: What happened?

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.220
Mike: He says "Well you kneel down here with
me and we'll pray for you."

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.480
And I said, "I can't kneel down."

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.660
So one guy on each arm and they set me down.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.040
And he walked up and put his hand on my back,
and he says, "Jesus, heal him."

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.240
And instantly some heat went through my back.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.380
The pain quit.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.300
I looked at both of these guys and said, "This
is real."

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.460
I got off the floor and I says, "Take me to
the gym."

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.320
I went to the gym and I put a hundred more
pounds on than I had ever lifted, and I was

00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:24.550
picking stuff up.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.040
It was like when the Holy Ghost is on you,
you're a different person.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.280
And I was throwing weights all over the place,
and I'm on fire.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.540
And I kept - started thanking Jesus.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.320
“Thank you, Jesus.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.560
Thank you, Jesus”, you know.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.500
And they started taking me to church, all
through Kansas City and stuff, and I started

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.180
witnessing.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.060
I wasn't saved.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.500
I wasn't nothing.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.200
I just know that God touched me, and I was
telling the church that Jesus heals.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.400
Sid: Jesus really does heal.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.720
Mike: Yeah. And I went to - oh, oh, I know it.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.140
Nobody can - you can tell me a lot of things
you may not think He does,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.939
but I know He heals, because he healed
me, and it's real, and it's never gone away.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.580
This has been 20 years almost.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.480
Sid: Okay.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.720
Tell me about the time you heard an audible
voice from God.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.620
Mike: The first time I heard an audible voice
was when I was doing cocaine in a crack house.

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:20.740
In Kansas City there's this black brother,
and I used to go there.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.360
I was the only white man that could ever go
in the neighborhoods and be left alone.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.279
They never bothered me.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:32.860
And I was free-basing coke, and this voice
said, "Michael".

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.520
And I looked up and it said, "Michael, I'm
not going to let you get high any more."

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.980
And I knew it was God.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.780
I knew it was God.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.400
I says, "Garbage!"

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.040
And I went and bought a hundred dollars' worth
of coke and free-based it.

00:12:49.049 --> 00:12:50.589
I couldn't get high.

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:56.260
And I ran in the guy's front room, and I threw
a temper-tantrum on the guy's floor.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.220
Sid: Really?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.720
Mike: Yeah.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.780
This drug dealer is looking at me and I'm
throwing - and he says, "What's your problem?"

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.020
I says, "God won't let me get high no more."

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:10.220
And I was throwing a fit, so he run me off.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:17.960
And the time that was really impressive to
me, though, was when I decided I wanted to

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.000
become a Christian, but I wanted to do it
on my terms. And uh –

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.260
Sid: Well God has been pretty gracious to
you up until then.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.040
Mike: Oh, more than that.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.589
But you know, He picked me.

00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:35.959
I'm thankful for that because He wasn't going
to quit on me, and He knew everything that

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:39.889
He allowed me to go through until the day
that He knew I was going to say yes.

00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.720
I know He knew that.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.160
Sid: So what happened on that day?

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.869
Mike: I had been going to church and trying
to be a Christian.

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:52.239
I saw some very honorable things, especially
what I saw in my wife.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.860
My wife is a woman of God.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.080
Boy, she's a jewel.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.639
And I wanted to be a Christian, but I didn't
trust God.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:02.790
I didn't trust anybody.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.790
I was afraid.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.790
“Is this real?”, you know?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.529
I didn't trust anything.

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:10.740
So I tried to do it, and I tried to go through
the motions, but all this stuff was drawing

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.600
me to other women.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.149
I wasn't married then.

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:18.799
And it was drawing me back to this; it was
drawing me back to that; but God was still

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.960
speaking to me and just - you could feel Him
tugging.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.980
So I didn't know what to do.

00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:33.369
I mean, you know, and then I was coming home
in the rush hour in Kansas City, and I had

00:14:33.369 --> 00:14:38.749
this beat-up Pinto station wagon with the
doors wired shut and the muffler is hanging

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:39.840
off.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.000
And then the Lord spoke to me in an audible
voice.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.500
He says, "Michael, today I want you to give
me your heart."

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.380
And I says, “No.”

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.360
He says, "Today, give me your heart, or I
will lift my spirit off you and you'll go

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.840
to Hell."

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.200
Sid: Those are strong words.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.660
Hold that thought.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.200
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:14.360
But what if God said to you, "Today, you must
give Me your heart, or you will go to Hell”?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:23.220
Do you realize that today could be the last
moment of your life?

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.760
We'll be back in just a moment and find out
what happened to Michael.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:44.920
[music]

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.760
Sid: Hello. Sid Roth your investigative
reporter here with Mike Schwartz.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.819
And oh, we're having so much fun in between
during the break.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.240
We're going to go to Janie in the control
room.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.880
Janie, Mike has just told me that he has gotten
drunk in the spirit.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.699
The Spirit of God is falling on him so much
and he said before this is over, I'm going

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.340
to get drunk and who's on for next week, before
I get drunk?

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.740
Janie: I think that's about to happen to me.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.760
Well you'll be interviewing a man, another
man who was full of rage.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.840
But this man had detailed plans of murdering
masses of white people.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.820
He related to black Muslims and Malcom X.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.020
But something happened in his car.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:36.040
He heard something and it made this man full
of hate love all people.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.240
Sid: It sounds to me like it's the same type
of thing that's just happened to Mike Schwartz.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:49.360
Mike, God says that you, today, you must accept
Him or it will be too late.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.700
What were His exact words?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:57.040
Mike: His exact words is, "Michael," he says,
"I want you to give Me your heart, or I will

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.600
lift My spirit off you and you will go to
Hell."

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:09.120
And I'm at the rush hour in Kansas City traffic
on a Friday, and people - and I'm beating

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:17.000
the dashboard out of this car, just - and
just - and He said that to me three times.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.720
And I said, “No”, the third time, and
I started to say it the fourth time; I was

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.040
going to go now, and I said -
Sid: Wait.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.540
Why would you say “No” to God?

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.800
God, who saved your life?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.280
God, the only one that really loved you?

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.760
Why would you say “No” to Him?

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.620
Mike: Well I guess all anger and bitterness,
and resentment stems back, and it goes back

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.870
to the one that can control everything is
God, if you know it or not.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.420
Now I know I was bitter and angry at Him,
and I didn't trust Him.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.360
Why should I?

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.000
I felt like I had been dealt a bad set of
cards, and you know, this is the way you feel.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.020
This is not the truth.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.060
Sid: The truth is you did have a tough life.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.920
Mike: Oh yeah.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.660
But I have a testimony, too, and Jesus rescued
me.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.240
Sid: Tell me what happened.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.980
Mike: Well the fourth time I said “Yes”.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.920
And I broke, and I cried, and I beat the dash
up.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.460
And I said to Him, “Okay”, and He said,
"Repeat after Me."

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.180
Sid: He said that?

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.520
Mike: He said, "Repeat after Me."

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.560
Sid: Wait. I usually say that.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.300
God said that to him, "Repeat after me."

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.300
What did He tell you to repeat?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:30.070
Mike: He said, "I want you to give Me your
heart, your mind, your body, your life, your

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.970
future, and let Me do what I want to do with
it."

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.160
I didn't even think I had that.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.880
I didn't know that was available as a human
being.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.790
I just was looking for the pit.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.200
And I said, "Yes, God."

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.360
And He said a couple of other things that
I can't remember now that were anti-selfishness.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.660
And then He said to me - and I thought I was
done.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.900
And He said to me - this is the God I know
- "P.S."

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.040
I says, "What?"

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.060
He said, "Michael, no conditions."

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.440
He says, "You have to drop every one of your
conditions."

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:14.120
And I said, "Jesus, I'll go anywhere, do anything,
no matter what it is, what it means.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.920
Your will be done."

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.980
And my life instantly changed in that car.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.100
No more drugs, no more drinking, no more women.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.820
Instantly.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.460
Sid: Instantly?

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.660
No withdrawals from anything.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.820
Sid: No, but physiologically, that's not
possible. [Laughs]

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.700
Mike: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.900
And I went home.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.660
I went back, and I went back and my wife,
who is my wife now, looked at me and

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.640
she says, "What happened to you?"

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.020
Sid: She could see.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.020
Mike: Oh yeah.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.000
I was a different "coot"; I was a different
"coot".

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.160
There was even a measure of some peace for
the first time.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.380
I was “wired for sound”.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.300
And yeah, I had a conversion experience.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.720
When the King of Glory comes in your heart,
things have to change.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.730
I mean, you just can't go on the way you were.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.720
There has to be something different.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.020
Sid: God is so good.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:09.680
Mike: Amen.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.800
Sid: God is so good. I mean, He didn't give
up on you.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.030
You gave up on the world.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.030
You gave up on God.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.520
Mike: Yeah.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.440
Sid: But He didn't give up you.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:15.940
Mike: No.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.820
Sid: And He didn't give up on you.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.080
He did not give up on you.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.280
Why do you think you're watching this right
now?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.100
Now they're going to be very upset with me,
Mike, if you don't tell me about supernatural

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.500
transportation.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.280
Mike: Well I figured this was normal transportation
for Christians.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.120
It's in the scriptures.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.620
Sid: It is.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.400
Mike: It is.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.360
And you don't hear a lot of it, and it's not
my fault.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.011
And what I want to say is I had nothing to
do with this transportation problem, and I

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.560
didn't -
Sid: Describe one time.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.940
Mike: Jesus told us to go to England.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.940
I told a friend, and the Lord told him to
go.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.500
We went to England, and we got in this car
with these English people - this van - and

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.420
we're going down the motorway, and the van
fills up with smoke, or looked like smoke.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.460
Well we were - we weren't alive, it didn't
feel like.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:17.240
And we're listening to worship, and then time
quit.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.620
And the next thing I knew, we like come to,
and we're a hundred kilometers down the motorway.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.620
Sid: Instantly?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.720
Mike: Well I don't know.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.090
When I went out and when I -
Sid: Were you driving the car?

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.090
Mike: No. I was watching the guy driving it.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.180
It didn't look like he could drive either.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.480
He kind of was just distorted.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.440
He just - I asked him later what happened.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.080
He said, "I don't know how I drove.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.360
The car just filled up."

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.820
Sid: Filled up with smoke.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:50.940
Mike: Yeah, smoke or a cloud, or something;
something white.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.500
We were just worshiping, and all of a sudden
we were a hundred miles down the motorway.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.040
Sid: Has this happened more than once?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040
Mike: Three or four times.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.930
It just happened a month ago when I was hunting.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.400
Well it happened on the way from Texas to
Oklahoma.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.320
I was looking at a road sign at 7:00 in the
morning, and I had an appointment at eight,

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.700
so I figured if I drive so many miles an hour
I could make it.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:18.800
And the roadside said 62 miles an hour, and
had - it was exactly seven.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.560
I was wide awake and I had my family in the
car.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:31.400
And all of a sudden I felt this strange, like,
wind blow through me, and I heard somebody

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.960
laugh.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.060
And I kind of - and it's like I knew it was
Jesus.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.180
I says, “What's the deal?”

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:45.180
And I looked over at the road sign; it said
20 miles to Wichita.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.240
I looked at my watch and I says, "Uh-oh, 16
minutes.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.010
You can't do it.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.750
You can’t; it's impossible."

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.880
And it's just like he was laughing.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.230
And I says, "Why did you do that?"

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.800
And He says, "I felt like it."

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.240
And then He told me, He says in the End-Times
this is going to be the mode of transportation

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.160
for his church.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.800
He says when you think you can't go somewhere
because of what's coming up trouble," He says,

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.340
"I don't need airplane tickets.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.820
I don't need money."

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.300
He says, "I'll just send whoever I want to
send wherever I want to send them."

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.680
He says, "This is my mode of transportation."

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.300
And then a month ago I was in the mountains
hunting with two friends, and there's this

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.680
winding road that I hated.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.200
It's just washboard, and I hate it.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.780
It's the end of the day, and we didn't kill
our buck, and I just [grunt].

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.420
All of a sudden, I'm on the bottom of the
road, and I feel this thing go through me

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.140
again.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.480
By now I recognize it; it's about the third
or fourth time.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.420
I look over to my friends and I says, "How
did we miss all the bumps?"

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.020
And he looked at me and he says, "We didn't,"
he says, “We didn't go through all that

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.030
stuff, did we?"

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.030
I says, “No.”

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.250
I says, "Did we drive by all the stuff?"

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.680
He says, “No.”

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.180
And I knew the Lord, you know - it was three
miles down the hill.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.000
Sid: And you just instantly?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Mike: I was just there.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.180
Sid: How about that?

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.200
(SHWOOP) Just there.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.700
But that doesn't mean a thing.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.440
I'm going to tell you what means something.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.880
Knowing God for yourself, knowing He loves
you, knowing that you could not have gotten

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.680
to this point without Him protecting you.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:29.920
Maybe it's not as obvious as Mike, but he
has supernaturally protected you for right

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.740
now.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.760
Repent of your sins.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:43.640
Ask Jesus to forgive you, and in the name
of Jesus, ask God to be your Father.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.300
You need a father.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:50.200
You need a father that loves you; not for
what you do, but who you are.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.540
He loves you.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.260
God really loves you.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.400
He's your Father.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.420
He really is.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:02.800
