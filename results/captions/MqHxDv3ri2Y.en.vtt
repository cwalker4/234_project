00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.260
The world is full of “what ifs?”

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.870
What if JFK hadn’t decided to go cruising
through Dallas in an open-top car?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.799
What if Gandhi had never got teed-off with
the British Empire?

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.050
What if we’d been wearing pants that time
the cops pulled us over?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.750
That’s the nature of things: we can never
truly know.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.730
But we sure as heck can speculate.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.880
And, thankfully, Earth’s long, long history
has given us plenty to speculate about.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.509
The following are all turning points in our
planet’s story where things could’ve easily

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.970
gone the other way.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.280
Some are pretty big, and some are kinda small.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.600
But they all have one thing in common.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.340
Had things turned out differently, they would’ve
all led to a world very different to the one

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
we live in today.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.970
And, for once, we don’t just mean one where
our nickname at the station isn’t “the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.970
pantless DUI guy.”

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.460
Ready to go delving into the murky world of
alternative history?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.120
You’ve come to the right place.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.649
10.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.050
The Nazis Finish Their V3 Supergun

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.359
“Nazi superweapon” is such an overused
phrase that it’s practically a collocation

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.350
(two or more words that are frequently used
together as a single unit.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.610
You’re welcome).

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.100
Part of this fascination may be to do with
the fact that none of them actually worked.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
The V1 flying bombs were supposed to kill
100,000 Londoners a month, but instead killed

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.890
less than 10,000 total.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.300
The V2 rockets were terrifying, but killed
more people in their construction than they

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.209
did landing on Britain and Belgium.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.660
The V3 could have changed all that.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.700
A top secret Nazi supergun, it was only discovered
when the Allies overran its bunker on the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.740
north French coast.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.750
The gun wasn’t yet finished, but let’s
rewind history and imagine it had been.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.130
Imagine the Allies – for whatever reason
– didn’t take northern France for a few

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.220
months longer.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.100
What would the outcome be in this alternative
reality?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.100
Simple.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.670
There would be no such thing as London.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.740
The V3 could’ve rained one shell a minute
onto the British capital, 24 hours a day,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
7 days a week.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.140
It wasn’t designed to turn the war in Hitler’s
favor so much as ensure the Allies’ only

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.420
reachable capital went down with him.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.840
The Allies would likely still have won, but
at the cost of the entirety of southern England,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
and hundreds of thousands of UK civilian deaths.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.509
Postwar Britain would’ve been an economic
ruin.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.849
Such poverty could’ve changed anything from
how the Marshall Plan was allocated, to whether

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.050
Britain ever gave up India, to whether the
UK today had representation on the UN Permanent

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.070
Security Council.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.070
9.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.840
Franz Ferdinand Isn’t Assassinated (or survives)

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.450
The most-successful terrorist action of all
time, Gavrilo Princip’s assassination of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.170
Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June
1914 sparked off WWI, collapsed the Ottoman

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.010
and Austro-Hungarian Empires, created Yugoslavia
which, in turn, created the Yugoslav wars

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.160
of the 1990s and everything from our understanding
of “ethnic cleansing” to the modern states

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.330
of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia (among others).

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.010
But Princip’s role in shaping the world
was down to sheer fluke.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.210
The original attempt on Franz Ferdinand failed,
and it’s totally conceivable the Archduke

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.650
could’ve fled Sarajevo, rather than waiting
around awkwardly for Princip to assassinate

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.650
him.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.260
If things had gone down that way, the world
right now would be utterly unrecognizable.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.960
In 2014, political scientist Richard Ned Lebow
published a book with this exact premise.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.920
His conclusions make jaw-dropping reading.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.930
Without Sarajevo, you have no WWI.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.850
Which means no Germany ready to elect Hitler,
which means no WWII.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.900
That means no Holocaust, which means no state
of Israel or modern Middle East.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.220
And that’s just one tiny part of Lebow’s
book.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.660
He also suggests the centuries-old Austro-Hungarian
Empire would’ve not only continued, it would’ve

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.300
become a beacon of tolerance due to its multicultural
population.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.940
Without WWI, the Russian Revolution may not
have succeeded, which means no Stalin, no

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.819
Eastern bloc, and no gulags.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.130
It also means the European powers retain global
dominance, rather than letting America rise

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.310
to the top.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.310
8.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.620
Carlos II Manages to Sire an Heir

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.720
The Spanish War of Succession is likely the
reason you’re reading this in English.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.980
At the time it all kicked off (1701), Spain
and France were the big superpowers in Western

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.450
Europe, and Britain was relegated merely to
“rising star.”

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.000
The subsequent 13 years of bitter fighting
changed all that.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.459
It completely knocked Spain out the running,
damaged France’s standing, and – most

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.990
important of all – left Britain as queen
bee.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.830
This had all sorts of crazy implications,
from the fate of Spanish and British colonies

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.989
in the New World, to the reach of the Holy
Roman Empire.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.880
The reason it all happened?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.240
Carlos II just couldn’t make his junk work
well enough to sire an heir.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.600
At the time, the only acceptable way to become
king or queen was to be born to a ruler and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.910
inherit the title on their death.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.120
You couldn’t just hold a free vote on your
next leader or anything dangerously-insane

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.150
like that.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.820
This was a massive problem, as Carlos II was
impotent.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.290
Years of inbreeding in his family had left
him a genetic basket-case.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.200
But what if he’d managed to sire, say, a
single son who was normal enough to survive

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.590
into adulthood and rule as a king?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.560
Well, you’d be looking at a completely redrawn
map of Europe for starters, plus a much more

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.700
Spanish-influenced New World.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.950
Britain likely wouldn’t have conquered half
the world, with the result that English would

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.780
today be a much less dominant language.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.780
7.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.919
Bill Clinton’s Defense Secretary Tells the
Truth About Bombing North Korea

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.110
World changing “what ifs?”

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.940
don’t all have to take place in the distant
past.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.350
Some can be much, much closer to home.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.500
Such was the case in 1994, when Bill Clinton
summoned Secretary of Defense William Perry

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.690
to brief him on the situation in North Korea.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.630
At the time, there were worries about the
North’s nuclear program (some things never

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.050
change, huh?) and the possibility of an attack
on South Korea.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.840
Clinton wanted to know if the US could successfully
take out the North’s reactor at Yongbyon

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.900
without causing contamination.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.639
Perry believed it could.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.290
He also believed telling the President that
would lead to Clinton authorizing a strike

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.160
which, in turn, would lead to total war on
the Korean peninsula.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.699
So he kept shtum.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.390
Yongbyon wasn’t bombed.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.610
And modern East Asia was created.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.630
A war on the Korean peninsula was later war
gamed by the Pentagon to end in a minimum

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.730
of a million casualties.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.520
300,000 North Korean shells would’ve levelled
South Korea’s capital, Seoul, in a single

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520
hour.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.840
Nearly as many US servicemen would’ve died
as during the Vietnam War.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.120
Given the way Vietnam shook up US culture
and politics, it’s hard to imagine Korea

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.590
II doing otherwise.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.170
But the biggest effect would’ve been on
Asia.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.750
South Korea today is a regional economic powerhouse,
not a bombed-out wasteland.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.110
China would’ve had to deal with a US force
right on its border, possibly leading to conflict.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.490
On the other hand, there’d also be no Kim
Jong-Un today developing a scary nuclear program.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.490
6.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.669
The Romans Win the Battle of Teutoburg Forest

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.240
They say a butterfly beating its wings in
Ohio can cause a tornado in China (in which

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240
case, we’d hate to see what our old frat-buddy’s
farts could do.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.240
Yeesh).

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.630
Well, wait till you hear what a battle you’ve
never heard of going the other way in 9 AD

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.100
could’ve done to the modern world.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.919
Had the Romans won the Battle of Teutoburg
Forest, the world as you know it simply wouldn’t

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:39.919
exist.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.240
For one thing, the English language would’ve
never evolved.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.850
The Battle of Teutoburg Forest was a hugely
significant moment for Rome.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.330
After Germanic tribes unexpectedly whupped
three of Rome’s mightiest legions, wiping

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.669
out 10 percent of the entire Roman army, the
Empire gave up on conquering Northern Europe.

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.979
The Empire’s boundaries were set, creating
a divide in Europe you can still see today.

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.040
All that stuff about how southern Europeans
(Spanish, Italians, French) have one attitude

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.180
to life, money and religion, while northern
Europeans (Germans, Swedes, Danes) have another?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.540
Yeah, that’s Teutoburg talking, right there.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.620
We can’t stress enough how big the implications
are.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.259
If Rome beat those tribes and went on to conquer
much of modern Germany, Germanic languages

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.770
would cease to exist, which means you’d
be reading this in a Romance language.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.090
It also means the social divides wouldn’t
be there for Martin Luther to get all worked

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.990
up about in 1517 and turbo-charge the schism
between Catholicism and Protestantism.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.830
So there’s no 30 Years’ War.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.710
The whole Western world would remain Roman
Catholic, affecting culture, art and science

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.240
in unimaginable ways.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.860
All because some guys got jumped in a forest
over 2,000 years ago.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.860
5.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.290
Japan Doesn’t Bomb Pearl Harbor

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.889
Let’s get the big, obvious bit out of the
way.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.840
Yes, an America that doesn’t suffer the
trauma of Pearl Harbor still enters WWII.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.039
The Japanese were desperately in need of resources
when they bombed Hawaii, that was their whole

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.830
rationale for going toe-to-toe with a much
bigger country.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.870
The problem was that most of those resources
could only be found in US-administered places.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.169
Had Pearl Harbor not happened, the US would’ve
still gone to war in the Pacific after expansionist

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:06.580
Japan eventually invaded the Philippines or
Guam or wherever.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.520
The key word here is “eventually.”

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.980
Prior to Pearl Harbor, the US public didn’t
want war.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.039
Without the Japanese attack, the tide of opinion
wouldn’t have changed.

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:19.000
That means no American support for Britain
and the USSR against Hitler.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.539
And that means trouble.

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:25.430
Sure, by December 1941, the Brits were reasonably
sure Germany wouldn’t invade.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.340
Sure, Hitler had already made his major mistake
of invading Russia by then.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.970
In short, the Third Reich was already doomed.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.690
But it could’ve gone down in a completely
different way.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.700
In this scenario, the Brits are no more than
support for the Russian bear as it slowly,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.209
inexorably dismantles the Nazi state in a
brutal battle of attrition that kills even

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:45.040
more than died in the real world.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.899
Care to guess what Stalin would do after liberating
Europe?

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:51.850
Yep, he’d likely take almost the whole lot
for himself, creating a scenario where possibly

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.860
everywhere but Britain eventually falls behind
the Iron Curtain.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.310
The US, meanwhile, is isolated and no longer
seen as the 20th Century’s moral leader.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.310
4.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.929
Napoleon Doesn’t Invade Russia

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:06.869
Sticking with megalomaniacs and foolish plans
to invade Russia, let’s look at the 19th

00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:09.170
Century’s most-foolish megalomaniac of all.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.079
Napoleon was the most-feared military commander
of his time.

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:16.369
By 1812, he’d single-handedly demolished
the millennia-old Holy Roman Empire, brought

00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:21.449
the Austrian Hapsburgs to their knees, completely
isolated Britain from all continental trade,

00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:25.279
and even forced the Russians to do exactly
what he wanted them to do.

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.610
He seemed unstoppable.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.869
And then, in 1812, he made one of the dumbest
mistakes a military commander has ever made.

00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:37.420
After Alexander I broke the trade embargo
against Britain, the French general decided

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.680
to teach him a lesson.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.629
He invaded Russia, setting into motion a chain
of events that would see his army decimated

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:48.589
and humiliated, hundreds of thousands of French
soldiers killed, a new European alliance rise

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:52.250
up against France, and Napoleon’s ultimate
defeat and exile.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.500
Yeah, despite what you hear, it wasn’t the
British at Waterloo that took down Napoleon.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.839
It was the insane losses the dictator suffered
while attacking Russia, a tactic Hitler would

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:04.800
revisit over a century later, with similar
results.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.649
So, no invasion of Russia, and you have an
invincible Napoleon who unites the whole of

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:12.319
Europe and molds it in his image.

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:13.519
The craziest part?

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:15.600
This could have easily happened.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.629
The decision to invade Russia made no strategic
sense, and was only taken to punish Alexander

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:21.629
I.

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:25.850
Had Napoleon let it slide, or chosen to, say,
simply sack a single city in retaliation,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.459
the world would be completely different.

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:29.459
3.

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:31.429
Rommel Isn’t Absent During D-Day

00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:36.220
Erwin Rommel was many things: a good strategist,
a highly-decorated commander, and one of the

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.230
most influential people in the Third Reich
who wasn’t also a complete scumbag.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.209
He should probably also be remembered for
taking the worst-timed holiday in history.

00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:49.829
In 1944, Rommel took time off from his position
in occupied France to celebrate his wife’s

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:50.829
birthday.

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:53.509
The more popular name for that auspicious
date today?

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:54.509
D-Day.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:55.620
That’s right.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.629
On June 5, 1944, Rommel dashed off to Germany
for a quick liaison with his darling wife.

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:04.600
Twenty-four hours later, the Allies stormed
the beaches, marking the beginning of the

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.100
end for Nazi domination of Europe.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.209
While we can’t know for certain how things
would’ve gone if Rommel was there, we do

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:14.059
know that the remaining commanders were panicked
and confused and completely screwed up the

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:15.119
German response.

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:19.410
A commander of one of the Panzer divisions
later bitterly wrote: “If Rommel had been

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.740
with us instead of in Germany, he would have
disregarded all orders and taken action – of

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.589
that we are convinced.”

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:29.050
In the spirit of this article, let’s imagine
Rommel had been there.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.420
Now let’s imagine he mounts a successful
defense, and the Allies find themselves experiencing

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.490
another Dunkirk.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.080
What happens next?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.629
Well, either Nazi dominance of Europe is ensured
for even longer (maybe even giving the Germans

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:45.740
time to complete their V3 gun and bomb London
flat), or maybe, just maybe, Rommel becomes

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.630
enough of a German hero to mount a successful
coup against Hitler – something he had vaguely

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.379
discussed before with other officers.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.240
So that’s a good ending and a bad ending.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240
Hmm.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240
Which do you find more convincing?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240
2.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.399
Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI Escape the
French Revolution

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:04.759
The French Revolution of 1789-99 put a powder
keg beneath old Europe and exploded it with

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:07.160
the force of a thousand atomic bombs.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.389
Old certainties shattered.

00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:13.170
Conditions fell into place that would see
ancient empires swept away.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.759
The way we look at the world was fundamentally
changed.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:19.990
While it would take some big changes to put
the revolution back in its box, it could still

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.439
have had a completely different outcome.

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:25.939
One in which Louis XVI doesn’t go to the
guillotine, but instead escapes France to

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:28.610
inspire the monarchist forces from abroad.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.379
In June 1791, Louis XVI was on the cusp of
fleeing.

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:36.089
It had already been arranged for the king
to be spirited away from Paris in a light

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:40.269
carriage, smuggled across the Belgian border,
and delivered into the hands of a royalist

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:41.269
alliance.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:42.679
The only reason this didn’t happen?

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.600
Marie Antoinette insisted on going with him
at the last minute.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.239
This meant using a slower carriage, which
meant they missed an important rendezvous

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:53.800
with loyal guards, which led to them being
recognized and caught a mere 25 miles from

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800
the border.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.660
The rest, as they say, is history.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.929
Say they had escaped.

00:12:57.929 --> 00:13:02.709
It’s not too hard to imagine an exiled king
giving the royalist forces a rallying point.

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:06.429
At the very least, it’s easy to see Louis
sowing discord from exile, putting the ultimate

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:09.259
outcome of this turbulent time in doubt.

00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:10.259
1.

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:11.259
9/11 is Foiled

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:15.540
9/11 is the most significant event to happen
to the USA since Pearl Harbor.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.589
The collapse of the Twin Towers and the murder
of nearly 3,000 people in NYC, Washington

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:24.339
and Pennsylvania effected everyone who was
alive to witness it on some deep, fundamental

00:13:24.339 --> 00:13:25.339
level.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:28.500
The intelligence failings that led to the
attack’s success are manifold, and perhaps

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.360
halting it simply wasn’t possible.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.929
But some, like former Clinton and Bush White
House staffer Richard Clarke think there was

00:13:33.929 --> 00:13:37.259
a chance in 2001 of 9/11 being averted.

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:41.069
Had that chance been taken, 2017 would look
very, very different.

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:44.889
For one thing, Islamist terrorism wouldn’t
be nearly the issue it is today.

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:50.399
9/11 not only demonstrated the terrible capabilities
of jihadists, it also inspired countless others

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:53.630
to set off bombs from Madrid, to London, to
Paris.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.769
Nor would the biggest Islamist terror group
of all be around today: ISIS.

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:02.639
ISIS rose out of the invasion of Iraq, an
invasion that was in part sparked by the traumas

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:03.990
of 9/11.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.230
Without it, Saddam isn’t toppled, the Iraqi
government doesn’t collapse, and the revolutionaries

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.609
don’t ultimately morph into the most reviled
terror group in history.

00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:15.929
Mass surveillance, its powers boosted in the
post-9/11 era, also doesn’t become such

00:14:15.929 --> 00:14:21.129
a huge thing, meaning no Edward Snowden revelations,
and no NSA nosing through your every email.

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:23.989
And that’s before we even get into the effect
on culture.

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:28.949
A world without 9/11 is one where the USA
still feels sure of itself, invincible.

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:33.279
That would be reflected in all the TV, movies
and games surrounding us.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:48.429
In short, it would be a very different place.
