THE APARTMENT.

00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:59.571
AFTER THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND
MURDER, HE USED THE TOWELS IN

THE BATHROOM TO CLEAN UP BEFORE
SETTING THE FIRE.

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:16.855
IN THE FOLDED TOWEL, ONE HAIR

THE INTENSE HEAT, SMOKE, AND
FLAMES -- A TINY HAIR FOUND WITH

00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:28.867 align:start position:0%
THE HELP OF AN ANGRY GIRLFRIEND
INTENT ON GETTING REVENGE.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.137

AND BURNED A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.406 align:start position:0%
WASN'T LIKE IT WAS BURNED UP
COMPLETELY.

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:37.342 size:88% position:44%
AND SO THE HAIRS THAT WERE
INSIDE THIS TOWEL WERE NEVER

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.244
EXPOSED TO THE HIGH, HIGH HEAT.

&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS THINK
THE MOTIVE FOR PARKER'S CRIMES

00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:47.018 align:start position:0%
WAS, IN PART, HIS ANGER AND
RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIS

00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:49.921 size:81% position:41%
GIRLFRIEND, PRINCESS GRAY.

00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.657 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT ROBERT HAD
BEEN HOME WITH PRINCESS AND THAT

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.528
THERE HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF AN
ARGUMENT WHERE HE LEFT PRINCESS,

00:19:56.561 --> 00:19:59.064 align:start position:0%
AND LEFT ANGRILY.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:02.867 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE HE HAD
A LOT OF PENT-UP ANGER TO

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.671
PRINCESS, WHO WAS DOMINANT,
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PERSON TO

00:20:06.704 --> 00:20:11.977
DEAL WITH, AND I SUSPECTED THAT
CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELEASE OF

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.814 align:start position:0%
THIS SEXUAL DEVIANCY THAT WE SEE
IN THE MURDERS.
