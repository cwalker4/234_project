00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.201
Male Speaker: Let us pray.

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:06.740
Almighty god we come
before you on this very

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.775
special occasion from
different backgrounds and

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.678
cultures and expressions
of faith towards you, but

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.814
we all come as Americans
and those who love her.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.584
Those who have sacrificed
for her, who have bled for

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.487
her, and who have
died for her.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:24.224
Today as we gather in our
nation's most sacred home,

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.626
we have the privilege to
witness, to celebrate, and

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:30.563
to honor an extraordinary
naval career and a life

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.632
that has been set apart
in call to service and

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.202
devotion to this nation
and those in it.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.371
Today we are among the
most privileged to watch

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.474
as our nation's highest
honor of special trust,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.744
achievement, and fidelity
has both given and received.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.714
From our nation's
commander in chief, to a

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.050
leader of naval warriors
who opinion was sought,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.520
whose sacrifices were
selfless, and whose

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.889
dedication to duty is
unparalleled by any standard.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.426
Today, we lift up an honor
our very own Master Chief

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.462
Britt Slablinski as our
nation's Medal of Honor is

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.230
bestowed upon him.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.433
May he also take with him
the absolute certainty in

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.435
knowing that his days
given to this great

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.171
nation, to our beloved
navy, and to the warriors

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.340
of navel special warfare
were valued beyond measure.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.544
We as his fellow
Americans, brothers and

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.013
sister warriors, friends
and family alike,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.782
collectively ask for your
blessing upon our great

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.186
president, this great
naval warrior, these great

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.922
military families, and all
they do, have done, and

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.491
will continue to do
from this day forward.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.993
On this most solemn
occasion, on this sacred

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.330
ground, we as his
teammates say well done.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.599
And finally, whether
swimming the depths,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.601
climbing the highest of
mountains, or soaring

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.103
through the heavens, as we
walk that lonely road of

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.307
faith, may you
always go with us.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:51.010
In your holy name
we pray, amen.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.116
The President: Thank you
very much, Chaplain.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.285
That's beautiful.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.890
And thank you to Deputy
Secretary of Defense

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.891
Patrick Shanahan.

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.259
Thank you, Patrick.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.363
Undersecretary of the Navy
Thomas Modly -- thank you.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.364
Thank you, Thomas.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:15.401
VA Secretary nominee --
will do a fantastic job

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.504
for us -- Robert Wilkie.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:23.309
And Congressmen Scott
Taylor and Brian Mast.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.844
Thank you,
fellas, very much.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.646
Thank you.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.715
Members of the Armed
Forces and distinguished

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.251
guests, please sit down.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.459
That actually worked
out very nicely.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.127
(Laughter)

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:44.364
And join me
in officially welcoming

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.535
Master Chief Britt
Slabinski to the White House.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.803
A special man.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:54.807
A truly brave person.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.911
Today, we pay tribute to
Britt's heroic service,

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:03.216
and we proudly present him
with our nation's highest

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.686
military honor -- and I
would go so far to say our

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.756
nation's highest honor.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:14.327
Joining Britt today is his
son Bryce -- Bryce, thank

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:19.799
you very much -- a rising
senior at a wonderful

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.303
school known to the
world as Ohio State.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.238
Great place.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.606
That's a great school.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:31.377
Along with Britt's
sisters, Brenda and Teka,

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.814
and Brenda's husband, Tom.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.816
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.786
Here as well are Britt's
significant other,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:44.624
Christina, and her two
children John and Meghan,

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.794
who we just met in
the Oval Office.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.463
That's a special
place, too.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.666
Thank you all for joining
us for this really special

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.602
day and special ceremony.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:56.603
Thank you very much.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.606
Finally, we're honored
to be joined by several

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:03.509
previous Congressional
Medal of Honor recipients.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.744
Would you please stand.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.446
Would you please stand.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:07.947
Thank you, fellas.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:24.263
(Applause)

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.966
Very,
very special people.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.836
Your names and your
immortal acts of valor are

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:33.906
forever engraved in the
memory of our nation.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:38.211
Our nation will always be
grateful to you, and you

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.812
know that.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:43.950
Today, we induct a new
name into the world's most

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.052
exclusive gathering
of heroes.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.620
And that's exactly
what it is.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.657
Britt was raised
in Northampton,

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.125
Massachusetts.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.129
He became an Eagle
Scout by the age of 14.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.366
His father was a veteran,
who served as a frogman in

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.871
the underwater demolitions
group of the U.S. Navy.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.706
Those are tough people.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.643
While Britt was in junior
high, his dad brought him

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.178
to their reunion.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:15.281
Britt was inspired by
their bond of friendship,

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:19.619
their stories of service,
and their boundless love

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.287
of country.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:25.992
As soon as he graduated
from high school in 1988,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:30.163
Britt enlisted in the
Navy to become a SEAL.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.299
That means he is a
physically very strong

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.936
person, and that also
means he is a mentally

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.137
very strong person.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.605
That's tough.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.075
Throughout the grueling
months of training, Britt

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:46.012
proved himself every
single step of the way.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.782
In 1990, he graduated the
legendary BUDS training

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:54.287
course and he earned that
special badge worn only by

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:59.125
the bravest few:
the SEAL Trident.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:03.996
In 2002, Britt was called
to support Operation

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:08.000
Enduring Freedom
in Afghanistan.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.505
In the late evening hours
of March 3rd that year, he

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.441
led an elite team on
a combat mission to

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.378
establish a secure
position on the peak of a

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:24.984
10,000-foot mountain
known as Takur Gahr.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:28.488
Britt and his teammates
were preparing to exit the

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:31.390
helicopter onto the
mountain when their

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.928
aircraft was struck by a
machine gun and machine

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.565
gun fire like they've
never seen before, and a

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.136
rocket-propelled grenade
from al Qaeda

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.905
terrorists down below.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.607
Not a good feeling.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:51.244
As the helicopter lurched
away from the assault,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.748
Petty Officer First Class
Neil Roberts was flung out

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:59.986
of the aircraft --
tremendous, tremendous,

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:03.289
horrible thing to witness
-- and onto the side of

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.958
the mountain before the
helicopter crashed into

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.361
the valley below.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:12.965
After surviving, barely,
the violent crash, Britt

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:18.704
and his team were retrieved 
by a second helicopter;

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:23.309
also, by the way, piloted 
by very brave people.

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.113
At this point, Britt
received information

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:32.051
suggesting their comrade,
Neil Roberts, the man

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:35.755
thrown out of the
helicopter, was probably

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.457
still alive.

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:43.763
The team faced a choice:
to wait for reinforcements

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:48.234
and pretty much safety, or
to return immediately to

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:52.305
the enemy stronghold in
the hope of saving Neil's life.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.441
They would be outmanned,
outgunned, and fighting

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.643
uphill on a steep,
icy mountain.

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.646
And every solider knows
you don't want to fight uphill.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:04.050
They learned that at
Gettysburg -- you don't

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.352
fight uphill.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:09.555
But they would face
freezing temperatures, and

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:13.659
bitter winds, at the
highest altitude of battle

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.830
in the history of the
American military.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.667
This was the highest point
where we ever fought.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.103
The odds were not good.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.305
They were not
in their favor.

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:30.676
But Britt and his team
didn't even hesitate

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:31.744
for a moment.

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.846
They made their decision.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.748
For them it was
an easy one.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:38.084
They went back
to that mountain.

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:41.988
When their helicopter
reached the mountain peak,

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.591
they jumped out into a
furious onslaught of

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:50.329
machine gunfire like none
of them had ever seen before.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:55.868
Britt and his teammate
Sergeant John Chapman

00:08:55.868 --> 00:09:00.706
charged uphill toward the
enemy, where John was shot

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:03.976
after clearing a bunker.

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:07.480
Britt continued to engage
the enemy, repeatedly

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.518
exposing himself to
horrendous fire.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:16.322
Two of his other
teammates, Stephen "Turbo"

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:22.028
Toboz and Brett Morganti,
both suffered very, very

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.997
serious leg injuries.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:27.333
Britt helped them to
safety and called in

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:31.837
airstrikes as continuous
fire drove them

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.573
ever-further down the face
of the mountain -- got

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:37.944
worse and worse, more
and more dangerous.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:41.447
He kept going.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:44.617
In a treacherous descent,
Britt and his men carried

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.752
Turbo through the snow.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.789
At one point, they
fashioned a makeshift

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:53.960
harness out of their gun
straps to hoist Turbo down

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.966
a 13-foot cliff, in itself
treacherous, because if

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:04.337
you miss that little area,
they go down the mountain.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.605
No stopping them.

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:09.408
When they could go no
further, Britt tended to

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:12.445
the wounded and
coordinated their escape

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:17.416
until his team was finally
evacuated from enemy territory.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:23.622
Seven of the brave men who
fought with Britt are here

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:26.392
with us today, and maybe
they'll stand up

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.361
as I call their name.

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:35.468
Petty Officer Second
Class Brett Morganti.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.636
Pretty dangerous
place, huh?

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.338
Way to go, Brett.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:43.709
Chief Warrant Officer
Kyle Soderberg.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.111
Thank you, Kyle.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:50.016
Petty Officer Second
Class Stephen Toboz.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.751
Thanks, Stephen.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:56.222
Chief Warrant
Officer Al Mack.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.223
Thank you.

00:10:57.223 --> 00:11:00.993
Sergeant Christopher
Cunningham.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:05.631
Master Sergeant Eric
Stebner -- a Master Chief

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:10.970
Petty Officer still on
active duty is quietly not

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.806
with us today.

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.107
I just want to
thank you all.

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.109
Unbelievable
acts of bravery.

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:18.010
Thank you very much.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:37.463
(Applause)

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:38.564
Thank
you, folks.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.532
Thank you very much.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.499
Incredible.

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:43.402
Today, we also remember
the brave soldiers who

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:46.972
gave their lives on that
mountain: Technical

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:52.678
Sergeant John Chapman,
Corporal Matthew Commons,

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:58.217
Specialist Marc Anderson,
Sergeant Bradley Crose,

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:02.054
Senior Airman Jason
Cunningham, Technical

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:05.491
Sergeant Philip Svitak,
and of course, Petty

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:09.628
Officer First Class Neil
Roberts -- who met a

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:14.967
horrible death -- for whom
these events are now known --

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:18.137
it's called the Battle
of Robert's Ridge.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.406
Incredible event.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:23.275
To the Gold Star family
members of those heroes

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.277
who are here today,
please stand up.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:28.347
Please, stand up.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:30.716
(Applause)

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.953
Please.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:56.976
It's an honor to have
you accept our nation's

00:12:56.976 --> 00:13:02.081
profound sorrow and a deep love 
and everlasting gratitude.

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:06.085
These were incredible,
incredible men, and you

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.087
can be proud that they
were in your family.

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.089
And they are looking down
right now, and they are

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:11.223
very, very proud of you.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:12.224
Thank you very much.

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.325
Thank you for being here.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.161
Thank you.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:19.365
To Britt, and to all of
the men of Robert's Ridge:

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:23.102
You waged a fierce fight
against the enemies.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:26.705
And these really have
become the enemies of

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:32.278
America and the enemies
of all civilization.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:34.680
Through your actions, you
demonstrated that there is

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:40.019
no love more pure, and no
courage more great, than

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.556
the love and courage that
burns in the hearts of

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.658
American patriots.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.427
We are free because
warriors like you are

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:52.464
willing to give their
sweat, their blood, and,

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:58.671
if have to, their lives
for our great nation.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:02.808
Britt, you went on to
serve many more years

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.610
in the U.S. Navy

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.048
before finally
retiring in 2014.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.884
Today, he continues
his life of serving by

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.888
volunteering with the Navy
SEAL Foundation, and on

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:19.925
behalf of Gold
Star families.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:24.296
Special, special,
incredible families.

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:27.233
And as one of his fellow
service members testifies,

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:30.903
he is an amazing father to
Bryce, who, like his dad,

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:34.039
is now an Eagle Scout.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:37.476
Britt wants the country
to know that for him, the

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:40.212
recognition he is about to
receive is an honor that

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:45.017
falls on the whole team --
he wants you folks to know

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:48.821
that -- on the whole team,
on every American warrior

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:53.125
who fought the forces
of terror on that snowy

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.094
Afghan ridge.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:59.331
Each of them has entered
the eternal chronicle of

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:03.068
American valor and
American bravery.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:06.805
Britt, we salute
you, we thank you.

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:13.512
We thank God for making
you a United States SEAL.

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.914
We love our Navy SEALs.

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:19.718
They've very special,
very incredible people.

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:23.689
It's now my tremendous
privilege to present to

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:27.893
you the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:33.065
And I'd like the military
aide to come forward and

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.100
please read the citation.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.101
Thank you.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:41.106
Military Aide: The
President of the United

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:56.789
States, in the name of the
Congress, takes pleasure

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:00.926
in presenting the Medal
of Honor to Senior Chief

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:05.464
Special Warfare Operator
Sea, Air, and Land, Britt K.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:09.935
Slabinski, United States
Navy, for service as set

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.405
forth in the following:
For conspicuous gallantry

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.275
and intrepidity at the
risk of his life above and

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.044
beyond the call of duty
while assigned to a joint

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:21.947
task force in support
of Operation Enduring Freedom.

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:25.984
In the early morning of
March 4, 2002, Senior

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:29.388
Chief Special Warfare
Operator Slabinski led a

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:32.291
reconnaissance team to
its assigned area atop a

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:35.961
10,000-foot,
snow-covered mountain.

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.997
Their insertion helicopter
was suddenly riddled with

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:42.167
rocket-propelled grenades
and small-arms fire from

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:45.804
previously undetected
enemy positions.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.806
The crippled helicopter
lurched violently and

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:50.743
ejected one teammate onto
the mountain before the

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.212
pilots were forced to
crash land

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.280
in the valley far below.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.950
Senior Chief Slabinski
boldly rallied his five

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.552
remaining team members,
and marshaled supporting

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:03.689
assets for an assault to
rescue their stranded teammate.

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:07.793
During reinsertion, the
team came under fire from

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:11.063
three directions, and one
teammate started moving

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:14.500
uphill toward an
enemy strongpoint.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.102
Without regard for his
own safety, Senior Chief

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:20.606
Slabinski charged directly
toward enemy fire to join

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.074
his teammate.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.277
Together, they fearlessly
assaulted and cleared the

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.846
first bunker they
encountered.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:30.549
The enemy then unleashed
a hail of machinegun fire

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.819
from a second hardened
position only 20 meters away.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:38.323
Senior Chief Slabinski
repeatedly exposed himself

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.759
to deadly fire to
personally engage the

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:44.329
second enemy bunker and
orient his team's fires in

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:48.167
the furious,
close-quarters firefight.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.669
Proximity made air
support impossible.

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.671
And after several
teammates became

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:56.208
casualties, the situation
became untenable.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.710
Senior Chief Slabinski
maneuvered his team to a

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.014
more defensible position,
directed airstrikes in

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:05.050
very close proximity to
his team's position, and

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.820
requested reinforcements.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.522
As daylight approached,
accurate enemy mortar fire

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.524
forced the team
further down the sheer

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.193
mountainside.

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.329
Senior Chief Slabinski
carried a seriously

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:20.332
wounded teammate through
deep snow, and led a

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:23.402
difficult trek across
precipitous terrain while

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.271
calling in fire on the
enemy, which was engaging

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.508
the team from the
surrounding ridges.

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.777
Throughout the next 14
hours, Senior Chief

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.580
Slabinski stabilized
casualties and continued

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.715
the fight against the
enemy until the hill was

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:40.285
secured and his
team was extracted.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.955
By his undaunted courage,
bold initiative,

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.924
leadership, and devotion
to duty, Senior Chief

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:49.528
Slabinski reflected great
credit upon himself and

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.663
upheld the highest
traditions of the United

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:53.832
States Naval Service.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:13.752
(The Medal of Honor 
is presented)

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:57.329
(Applause)

00:20:01.033 --> 00:21:45.704
(A prayer is given)
