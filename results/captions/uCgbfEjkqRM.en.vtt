00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.690
WELCOME BACK.
LAST WEEK, OUR NATIONAL NIGHTMARE OF A CLOSED

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.500
GOVERNMENT ENDED,&nbsp;
RETURNING US TO OUR NATIONAL NIGHTMARE OF

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.339
AN OPEN GOVERNMENT.
BUT IF OUR NATION WERE TO TAKE ONE LESSON

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.759
FROM THE SHUTDOWN — WHICH, OF COURSE, WE
WON'T — MAYBE WE'D THINK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.080
THE THINGS WE ARE AND AREN'T WILLING TO SPEND
MONEY ON.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.330
THIS YEAR, WE'VE ALLOTTED MORE THAN
SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFENSE SPENDING.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.429
THAT'S MORE THAN THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS ON
EDUCATION, TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY, AGRICULTURE,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.949
SPACE, JUSTICE, THE ENVIRONMENT, VETERANS,
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, COMMERCE, HOMELAND

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.780
SECURITY, HOUSING, THE INTERIOR, LABOR, THE
TREASURY AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT&nbsp;COMBINED.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
THAT IS SUCH A HUGE NUMBER THAT IF YOU&nbsp;
TYPED IT INTO A CALCULATOR AND TURNED IT UPSIDE

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.420
DOWN, IT WOULD SAY&nbsp;
"USE THIS MONEY TO HELP PAY FOR UNIVERSAL

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.350
HEALTHCARE, YOU BOOBS."
OUR&nbsp;GIGANTIC&nbsp;MILITARY BUDGET WOULD BE A

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.461
LOT EASIER TO FORGIVE IF IT WERE ACTUALLY
MAKING US SAFER.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:02.610
BUT A LOT OF IT IS NOT.
WE REGULARLY THROW UNIMAGINABLE SUMS OF MONEY

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.350
AT MILITARY PROJECTS THAT SHOW NO SIGNS OF
EVER BEING USEFUL.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.640
LIKE&nbsp;FLYING OVER&nbsp;FOOTBALL GAMES&nbsp;OR,&nbsp;YOU
KNOW,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.010
INVADING IRAQ.
A MORE RECENT EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE IS THE&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.780
OF&nbsp;
THE F-35 AIRCRAFT, WHICH HAS GONE VASTLY OVER

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.110
ITS ALREADY ENORMOUS BUDGET.
THE F-35 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CROWN JEWEL

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.480
IN THE MILITARY AIR FLEET.
ACTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER TO MAKE

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:48.420
IT OUT OF ACTUAL CROWN JEWELS.
WE'VE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO BRING THAT DOWN

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.450
TO AROUND&nbsp;
89 MILLION DOLLARS PER PLANE, MOSTLY BY NOT

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.010
ORDERING
THE CLEANING KIT AND STURDY LEATHERETTE CARRYING

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.909
CASE, BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY DARN PRICY.
THAT WOULD BE A CRAZY AMOUNT OF MONEY EVEN

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.580
FOR A PLANE THAT WORKED, WHICH THE F-35 DOES
NOT.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.640
AT A MOCK DEPLOYMENT IN 2016,&nbsp;
ONLY ONE OUT OF SIX F-35'S COULD ACTUALLY

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.340
TAKE OFF DURING TESTING.&nbsp;
ALTHOUGH THAT COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE, SINCE

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.889
THE ENEMY WILL NEVER EXPECT TO SEE FIGHTER
JETS

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.849
"DRIVING" TOWARD THEM.&nbsp;
SURPRISE!

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:26.840
THE F-35 ALSO SUFFERED FROM A RADAR GLITCH
THAT COULD ONLY BE RESOLVED BY HAVING THE

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.120
PILOT TURN&nbsp;THE RADAR&nbsp;OFF AND ON AGAIN.
LIKE A WIRELESS ROUTER.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.029
IT'S OKAY, THEY'RE HIGHLY TRAINED FIGHTER
PILOTS SO THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE VERIZON

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:40.870
TECH SUPPORT MENU&nbsp;AT 50,000 FEET.
OTHER F-35 "OOPSIES" INCLUDE THE JET'S SOFTWARE,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.319
WHICH WAS SO HOPELESSLY SCREWED UP, TECHNICIANS
HAD TO

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.060
GO OFF BASE TO USE COMMERCIAL WIFI ACCESS,
DOWNLOAD THE NECESSARY FILES AND BURN THEM

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.349
TO CD'S.
SO WE'LL BE FINE AS LONG AS WE ONLY INVADE

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.010
PLACES THAT ARE NEAR&nbsp;
A STARBUCKS WITH FREE WIFI.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.150
OH, AND THE F-35 ALSO HAD ONE OTHER "TEENY"
PROBLEM.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:18.260
A 
BLOWTORCH SURROUNDED BY FUEL?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.609
THESE THINGS ARE 89 MILLION DOLLARS.
HEY AIR FORCE, GIVE ME HALF THAT MONEY AND

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.849
I WILL SELL YOU A&nbsp;
MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE EXPLODING PLANE.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.309
THE ENGINE IS A FORK IN A MICROWAVE.
DON'T SAY NO OR YOU'RE AGAINST THE TROOPS.

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.769
SO HOW DOES A&nbsp;
COUNTRY THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO OFFER ITS CITIZENS

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.590
HEALTH CARE DROP&nbsp;ALMOST HALF-A-TRILLION DOLLARS
ON A BUNCH OF PLANES THAT DON'T WORK?

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.280
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A SLOPPY CIRCLE JERK
BETWEEN THREE POWERFUL GROUPS.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.290
THE PENTAGON NEEDS SOMEONE TO BUILD BLAMMO
MACHINES THAT WILL VAPORIZE PEOPLE WE HATE.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.739
SO THEY GIVE ASS-LOADS OF MONEY TO&nbsp;
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WHO SPREAD EACH PROJECT

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.589
AROUND AS MANY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS&nbsp; AS
POSSIBLE,

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.930
PROMISING LOTS OF FAT, JUICY JOBS THAT LEGISLATORS
WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.519
AND WHEN THEY ALL SHARE A SPECIAL HUG,&nbsp;
A CRAZY-ASS PLANE THAT WE DON'T NEED IS BORN.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.790
THIS&nbsp;HAPPY&nbsp;THROUPLE IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS&nbsp;
"POLITICAL ENGINEERING."

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.900
AND FOR PROJECTS LIKE THE F-35, IT'S THE ONLY
KIND OF ENGINEERING THAT WORKS.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.489
EVEN&nbsp;
BERNIE SANDERS, ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.551
CRITICS OF EXCESS MILITARY SPENDING,&nbsp;
FELT COMPELLED TO BRING SOME OF THE PORK HOME

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:48.280
TO HIS STATE.
WHO KNEW VERMONT WAS SUCH A MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.509
POWERHOUSE?
THAT EXPLAINS BEN &amp; JERRY'S&nbsp;NEW FLAVOR

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:59.080
DEATH BY CHOCOLATE AND DRONES.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MAN BEST EQUIPPED TO STOP

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.289
THIS NONSENSE IS DONALD TRUMP, AND HE IS ALL
IN.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:21.000
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS DUMB, BUT HE DOESN'T MEAN
YOU "LITERALLY" CAN'T SEE IT.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.540
OKAY, BUT HE MEANS YOU LITERALLY CAN'T SEE
IT ON RADAR, NOT LIKE YOU LITERALLY CAN'T

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:39.979
SEE IT IF IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
THEN TRUMP'S AIDES HAD TO GET HIM TO ANOTHER

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.830
EVENT SO THEY PRETENDED TO THROW A TENNIS
BALL THE OTHER WAY.&nbsp;GO ON, GO GET IT!

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.220
LIKE MOST THINGS PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDORSES,
THE F-35 HAS BEEN A COLOSSAL WASTE OF MONEY.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.900
BUT IT'S HARD TO STOP.
IF YOU TRY TO ACTUALLY SCRUTINIZE OUR MILITARY

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.330
BUDGET THE WAY YOU'D SCRUTINIZE ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENT EXPENSE, PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE AGAINST

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.240
THE TROOPS.&nbsp;
WHICH I AM NOT!

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.020
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MY FAVORITE PARTS OF&nbsp;
MALE STRIP SHOWS ARE THE&nbsp;MILITARY-THEMED

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.250
PARTS.
BUT IF YOU DON'T TRUST MY PEACENIK OPINION,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.360
MAYBE YOU'LL TRUST&nbsp;
THAT OF

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.759
THE LATE JOHN MCCAIN, WHO CALLED THE F-35
PROGRAM

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.509
"A SCANDAL," "A TRAGEDY" AND "DISGRACEFUL."&nbsp;
YES,&nbsp;NATIONAL DEFENSE IS IMPORTANT, AND THAT

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.639
COSTS MONEY.
BUT IT'S NOT "SUPPORTING THE TROOPS" TO STICK

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.409
THEM INTO BILLION-DOLLAR&nbsp;
FORD PINTOS.

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.520
THEY DESERVE BETTER, AND SO&nbsp;DO THE REST&nbsp;OF
US.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.039
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
