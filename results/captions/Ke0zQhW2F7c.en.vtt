00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.134
WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.670
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.576
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AS WE BROADCAST TONIGHT'S SHOW,

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.445
HURRICANE FLORENCE IS GRINDING
IT'S WAY INTO THE EAST COAST.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.749
I HOPE EVERYONE'S STAYING SAFE.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.649
WE'RE THINKING OF YOU.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.085 size:88% position:44%
THIS THING IS SCARY.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:23.390
ALMOST AS SCARY AS THE WEATHER
CHANNEL'S GRAPHICS.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.691
&gt;&gt; ONCE THAT WATER COMES UP TO
THREE FEET, YOU CAN SEE IT WOULD

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.694 align:start size:88% position:13%
BE COMING UP MY SHINS, UP
TOWARDS MY WAIST.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.529
THIS COULD BE ENOUGH TO KNOCK
YOU OFF YOUR FEET.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.365
IT COULD EVEN FLOAT SOME CARS,
THERE COULD BE CARS ON THE SIDE

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
OF THE ROADWAY.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.403
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, BUT
ONCE WE GET UP INTO THAT

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:40.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
SIX-FOOT RANGE-- LOOK AT HOW
HIGH THIS WATER GOES.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.576
WINDS PICK EVERYTHING UP, CARS
WILL BE FLOATING AT THIS POINT.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.345
THIS WATER'S OVER MY HEAD.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.181
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.084
SO, IF YOU FIND YOURSELF HERE,
PLEASE GET OUT.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:56.790
IF YOU'RE TOLD TO GO, YOU NEED
TO GO.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.627
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, GET OUT.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
OR GET YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.930
MAGIC GRAY CIRCLES THAT WATER
CAN'T TOUCH.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.965 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.369
WELL, WE WILL NOT BE OUTDONE BY
THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S GRAPHICS.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.970
LET'S CHECK IN ON THE STORM WITH
OUR CHIEF METEOROLOGIST, SUNNY

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.606 align:start size:88% position:13%
THUNDERS.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:22.582
&gt;&gt; BEHOLD HIS MIGHTY HAND!

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.250
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, GREAT WORK.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.051 align:start size:88% position:13%
GREAT WORK.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.486 align:start size:88% position:13%
GREAT WORK.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
THANKS, SUNNY.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.058 size:88% position:44%
STAY SAFE OUT THERE.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.861
( LAUGHTER )
IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, WE DID

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.531
THE PRESIDENT ABOUT BEING A
TERRIBLE PERSON, BUT IN REALITY

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:47.941
IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN WE COULD
HAVE IMAGINED BECAUSE

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.576
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
LASER-FOCUSED ON HURRICANE

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.345 align:end position:100%
RESPONSE THIS WEEK, NOT THIS
ONE, THE ONE A YEAR AGO BECAUSE

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:56.549
HE'S BEEN TWEETING A LOT ABOUT
WHAT A GREAT JOB HE DID

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.120
RESPONDING TO HURRICANE MARIA
THAT DECIMATED PUERTO RICO LAST

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.359
YEAR RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF
ALMOST 3,000 AMERICAN CITIZENS.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.663
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING
MORE HORRIBLE THAN THAT, OTHER

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:16.870 size:75% position:38%
THAN THIS TWEET.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.404
"3,000 PEOPLE DID NOT DIE IN THE
TWO HURRICANES THAT HIT PUERTO

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
RICO.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.274
WHEN I LEFT THE ISLAND, AFTER
THE STORM HAD HIT, THEY HAD

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:26.246
ANYWHERE FROM 6-18 DEATHS.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:27.847
AS TIME WENT BY, IT DID NOT GO
UP BY MUCH.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:29.716
THEN, A LONG TIME LATER, THEY
STARTED TO REPORT REALLY LARGE

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.351 size:88% position:44%
NUMBERS, LIKE 3,000.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:39.526 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOT-DOT-DOT...

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.194
DOT-DOT-DOT-DOT-DOT
THIS WAS DONE BY THE DEMOCRATS

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:45.865
IN ORDER TO MAKE ME LOOK AS BAD
AS POSSIBLE, WHEN I WAS

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.100
SUCCESSFULLY RAISING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TO HELP REBUILD PUERTO

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.001 align:start size:88% position:13%
RICO.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.402
IF A PERSON DIED FOR ANY REASON,
LIKE OLD AGE, JUST ADD THEM ONTO

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:49.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE LIST.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
BAD POLITICS.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:58.344 size:88% position:44%
I LOVE PUERTO RICO!"
( AUDIENCE BOOING )

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.646
"THEY'RE MY FAVORITE BUNCH OF
LYING, UNGRATEFUL, FAKE DEAD

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.747 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE!

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:04.584
I LIKE PUERTO RICANS WHO DON'T
DIE."

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:10.890
( LAUGHTER )
I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT THIS

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.698
IS NOT ONLY A SICKENING TWEET,
IT IS IS NO WAY TRUE.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.300
AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST
RESEARCHERS AT GEORGE WASHINGTON

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.268
UNIVERSITY'S MILKEN INSTITUTE
SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH DID A

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.239
STUDY AND ESTIMATED THAT 2,975
PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.177
DISASTER AND ITS EFFECTS, WHICH
UNFOLDED OVER MONTHS.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:34.581
AND IT HAD BEEN PUSHED OUT OF
THE FRONT PAGES BECAUSE OF ALL

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.483
THE OTHER BAD NEWS ABOUT DONALD
TRUMP.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.219 size:88% position:56%
THEN HE BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.755
IT'S KIND OF LIKE HE WAS ON
TRIAL FOR LITTERING AND SAID ON

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:48.094
THE STAND "I ONLY THREW THAT CUP
OUT OF MY WINDOW BECAUSE I WAS

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.097
DISTRACTED BY THE HOMELESS MAN I
RAN OVER.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:56.669
PRETTY SURE HE DIED OF OLD AGE.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.170 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.106
DEMOCRATS PUSHED HIM IN FRONT OF
MY CAR ."

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:09.082
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND TRUMP'S LASHING OUT ALL OVER

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:09.882 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE PLACE.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.752
REPUBLICANS REPORTEDLY BELIEVE
THAT TRUMP WILL SOON FIRE

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.154
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND CABBAGE
PATCH AMERICAN, JEFF SESSIONS.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:18.091 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
THIS IS NO SURPRISE.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.160 align:end position:100%
TRUMP HAS HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.463
MAINLY, THE JUSTICE PART.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:26.332
( LAUGHTER )
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THEY DON'T

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:31.738
THINK ANYONE CAN GET CONFIRMED
IF SESSIONS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:36.042
AND, ON TOP OF THAT, NO ONE IN
THE G.O.P. WANTS THE JOB.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.410
WHEN ASKED, SENATOR JOHN CORNYN
SAID, "WE ALREADY HAVE AN

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.578 size:78% position:39%
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:40.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
I LOVE MY JOB."

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.849
( LAUGHTER )
LINDSEY GRAHAM RESPONDED, "NO.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.117
I LIKE BEING A SENATOR.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.552
THERE ARE PLENTY OF MORE
QUALIFIED PEOPLE THAN ME.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:51.958 size:88% position:56%
BUNCHES OF THEM, THOUSANDS."

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.827
( LAUGHTER )
AND RAND PAUL REPLIED "WAS IST

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:55.495
DAS ATTORNEY GENERAL?

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:59.499
I AM HANS, A HUMBLE GERMAN
TOURIST MIT NO OPINIONS."

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
I LIKE THAT HANS GUY.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:10.009
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TRUMP IS ALSO APPARENTLY

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.412 size:88% position:56%
CONSIDERING FIRING DEFENSE
SECRETARY AND MAN WHOSE EYES

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:19.686
COUNT AS CARRY-ON BAGS, JAMES
MATTIS.

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.853 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HE LOOKS TIRED.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
A TOUGH JOB.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:22.689 size:75% position:38%
HE'S VERY TIRED.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.323 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.091
&gt;&gt; Stephen: VERY TIRED.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.094 align:end position:100%
SECRETARY MATTIS IS FAMOUSLY
NICKNAMED "MAD DOG MATTIS," THE

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.897
COOLEST MILITARY NICKNAME SINCE
GENERAL WILLIAM

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:34.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
"CLINICALLY-DEPRESSED HORSE"
WILKINS.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.670
( LAUGHTER )
BUT OVER TIME, TRUMP HAS COME TO

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.908
REALIZE THAT MATTIS'S POLICIES
AREN'T AS WILD AS HIS NICKNAME

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:47.213
SUGGESTS, AND TRUMP PRIVATELY
CALLS MATTIS "MODERATE DOG".

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.248 size:84% position:42%
"HEY, MODERATE DOG!

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.217 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAHA, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
INSANE!

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:55.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
SUCKS TO BE YOU!"
( LAUGHTER )

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.291
AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT
TRUMP'S MISMANAGEMENT STYLE

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.360 align:end position:100%
THANKS TO A NEW OP-ED BY THE
FORMER V.P. OF CONSTRUCTION FOR

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.329
THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, BARBARA
REZ.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.732
SHE WROTE THAT DURING THE
CONSTRUCTION OF TRUMP TOWER, HE

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.501
WAS INSPECTING THE ELEVATORS AND
TRUMP LOOKED AT THE PANELS WHERE

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.938
THE BUTTONS YOU PUSH TO REACH A
FLOOR WERE LOCATED.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:16.109
HE NOTICED THAT NEXT TO EACH
NUMBER WERE SOME LITTLE DOTS.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.945
"WHAT'S THIS?" TRUMP ASKED.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.814 align:start size:88% position:13%
"BRAILLE," THE ARCHITECT
REPLIED.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.950 size:88% position:56%
YOU'D THINK TRUMP WOULD LOVE
BRAILLE-- IT'S LIKE READING

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.787 size:75% position:38%
THROUGH GROPING!

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:35.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:40.199
"OH, OH, OH, YEAH -- I LIKE, I
LIKE."

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.768
( LAUGHTER )
BUT HE TOLD THE ARCHITECT TO GET

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.136 align:start size:88% position:13%
RID OF IT.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.138
"WE CAN'T," THE ARCHITECT SAID,
"IT'S THE LAW."

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:48.708
TO WHICH TRUMP YELLED, "GET RID
OF THE --EXPLETIVE-- BRAILLE.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:54.046 align:start size:88% position:13%
NO BLIND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LIVE IN TRUMP TOWER!"

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
MAYBE.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:57.984 align:end position:100%
BUT IF YOU'VE SEEN TRUMP TOWER,
I'M PRETTY SURE BLIND PEOPLE

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.786 align:start size:88% position:13%
DECORATED IT.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:02.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:13.299
( PIANO RIFF )
I LOVE THE CHEERING, BUT I WAS

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:18.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
BEING THE BLIND DECORATOR
HEARING THE DECOR.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.972 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
ACCORDING TO REZ, TRUMP KNEW

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.707
THAT THE ARCHITECT COULDN'T
ACTUALLY TAKE THE BRAILLE

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.476
OFF, BUT ORDERING AN UNDERLING
TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.945
IMPOSSIBLE GAVE TRUMP THE
OPPORTUNITY TO YELL AT THEM AND

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.915 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALSO BLAME THEM FOR ANYTHING
THAT WENT WRONG LATER.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.485
SHE CALLED IT, "A TRUMP-STYLE
WIN-WIN."

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.987
AS OPPOSED TO A TRUMP STYLE
LOSE-WIN, WHICH IS HOW HE BECAME

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:40.393 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRESIDENT.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:44.730 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH, SOME ELECTORAL COLLEGE

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
FANS.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.569
NOT ONLY THAT, TRUMP ASKED HIS
WORKERS TO LIE IN ORDER TO SELL

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.805 align:end position:100%
MORE APARTMENTS, LIKE SAYING
THAT THE MARBLE IN THE BATHROOM

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.908
WAS LUXURIOUS, WHEN THEY KNEW IT
WAS MADE WITH CRUSHED MARBLE AND

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:59.011 align:start size:88% position:13%
GLUE.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.614 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
(AS TRUMP)

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.315
"YOU SEE THIS HAMBURGER?

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.485
GO TO THE LIVESTOCK AUCTION AND
CONVINCE PEOPLE IT'S A COW.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.921
SQUEEZE IT AND MOO BEHIND YOUR
HAND.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:09.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
MOO."
