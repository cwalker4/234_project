MARK: HELLO, AMERICA.

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:07.889
I'M MARK LEVIN.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.324
THIS IS "LIFE, LIBERTY &amp;

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:10.025
LEVIN."

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:10.358
WELCOME.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:10.926
&gt;&gt; NICE TO SEE YOU.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.994
&gt;&gt; IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO SEE

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:15.430
YOU, PATRICK MICHAELS.

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:15.764
DOCTOR.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.599
EXPERT ON ALL THINGS CLIMATE

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.767
AND ENVIRONMENT AS FAR AS I'M

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:19.134
CONCERNED.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:22.037
LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BACKGROUND.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:22.938
DIRECTOR OF THE STUDY OF

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.606
SCIENCE AT THE CATO INSTITUTE.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:29.177
YOU HOLD AN AB IN SM, YOU HOLD

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:31.279
THOSE DEGREES IN BIOLOGY,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.514
SCIENCES AND PLANT ECOLOGY FROM

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:33.782
THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.751
PRETTY GOOD SCHOOL.

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:38.186
Ph.D. IN ECOLOGICAL CLIMATOLOGY

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:39.254
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:43.625
WISCONSIN IN MADISON, 1979.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.027
PRESIDENT OF THE STATE

00:00:46.028 --> 00:00:46.661
CLIMATOLOGISTS, PROGRAM

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:48.463
CHAIRMAN FOR THE CITY OF

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:53.068
APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY OF THE

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:54.970
AMERICAN METEORLOGICAL SOCIETY.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.706
SAY THAT FAST FIVE TIMES.

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:58.840
RESEARCH PROFESSOR AT THE

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.242
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FOR 30

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.944
YEARS, AND GIVING EXPANSIVE

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.279
BACKGROUND THAT YOU HAVE,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.780
GIVING THAT TO THE PUBLIC SO

00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.983
THEY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:08.750
TALKING ABOUT.

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.386
YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING AUTHOR

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:18.860
AND REVIEWER OF THE UNITED

00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.161
NATIONS INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL

00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:23.398
PANEL OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:24.132
WE'VE HEARD IT ALL.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.834
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.335
&gt;&gt; WELL, SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.471
THE PLANET IS WARMER THAN IT

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:36.211
WAS 100 YEARS AGO ABOUT.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.381
9/10th OF A DEGREE CELSIUS.

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:41.683
MARK: 9/10th DEGREE OF CELSIUS

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.351
IS THAT A LOT?

00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:43.785
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:45.754
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:49.257
HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVEN'T PUT

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:51.326
ENOUGH CO2 IN THE AIR, AND ONE

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:52.994
IN THE LATER PART OF THE 20th

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:56.564
CENTURY THAT SLOWS DOWN OR

00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:59.501
DEPENDS WHOSE DATA YOU USE ONLY

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:04.606
TO RESUME WITH THE BIG EL NINO

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:06.107
THAT COVERED THE NEWS THE LAST

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:07.142
COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:10.245
THAT MEANS THAT PROBABLY HALF,

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.247
MAYBE HALF OF THAT NINE-TENTHS

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:15.216
OF THE DEGREE MIGHT BE CAUSED

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:16.284
BY GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:17.719
WHEN THE PLANET WARMED

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.188
BEGINNING 1976, THE TEMPERATURE

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.691
OF THE STRATOSPHERE STARTED TO

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:23.792
STOP, THAT'S THE PREDICTION OF

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.228
GREENHOUSE THEORY THAT'S NOT

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.595
INTUITIVE.

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:28.730
THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER OF

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.565
SCIENCE CARL POPPER SAID IF YOU

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:31.666
CAN MEET A DIFFICULT PREDICTION

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:33.468
WITH YOUR THEORY, YOU CAN

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.569
CONTINUE TO ENTERTAIN YOUR

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.903
THEORY.

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.005
SO THE THEORY IS RIGHT, BUT THE

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:38.506
APPLICATION OF IT IS WRONG.

00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:40.275
IT IS NOWHERE NEAR AS WARM AS

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.377
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.013
THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE MAKING

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.482
SYSTEMATIC, DRAMATIC ERRORS

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.819
OVER THE ENTIRE TROPICS WHICH

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.854
IS 40% OF THE EARTH, AND IT'S

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:54.789
WHERE ALL OUR MOISTURE COMES

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.090
FROM.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.157
ALMOST ALL OF IT.

00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:59.227
MARK: LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

00:02:59.228 --> 00:02:59.961
WHO DOES THESE COMPUTER MODELS?

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:00.695
&gt;&gt; GOVERNMENTS.

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:02.564
THERE ARE 32 FAMILIES OF

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.433
COMPUTER MODELS THAT ARE USED

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:08.103
BY THE UNITED NATIONS.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.206
EACH GOVERNMENT SPONSORED.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.441
AND ALL OF THEM ARE PREDICTING

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:15.577
FAR, FAR TOO MUCH WARMING.

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.011
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT'S

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:18.780
BEEN PREDICTED TO HAPPEN, WHICH

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.149
LOOKS LIKE SDMSHGS WHAT IS

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.951
HAPPENING CONTINUES TO GROW.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.919
MARK: WE KNOW THAT FOR A FACT?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.222
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU COULD JUST LOOK AT

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:28.523
THE WEATHER BALLOON

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:28.990
TEMPERATURES.

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.792
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SATELLITE

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:31.259
TEMPERATURES.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.627
YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:34.696
CALLED THE REANALYSIS DATA.

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:35.864
THEY BEHAVE IN CONCERT.

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.432
THEY'RE SHOWING THE SAME THING,

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:38.733
AND THE SAME THING IS A LOT

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:39.968
DIFFERENT THAN THIS THING.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.037
HOWEVER, WE NEED TO CALL THE

00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:43.505
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:44.239
MARK: SPECIAL COUNSEL?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.074
&gt;&gt; YES, BECAUSE ONE MODEL

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:46.374
WORKS.

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:47.675
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:48.943
IT'S THE RUSSIAN MODEL.

00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:50.612
MARK: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:51.780
SO ALL THE GOVERNMENT MODELS

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:53.114
ARE LIKE THIS?

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:53.615
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:55.350
MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL LIKE

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:55.683
THIS.

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:56.351
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:58.520
THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE LEAST

00:03:58.521 --> 00:03:59.220
WARMING IN IT.

00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:00.889
MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.390
LEAST WARMING AND PRETTY MUCH

00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:02.891
FOLLOWS REALITY.

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.393
WHAT'S BEEN TESTED OVER A FEW

00:04:05.394 --> 00:04:05.760
DECADES.

00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:06.427
&gt;&gt; YEAH, CORRECT.

00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:08.396
IF WE WERE RATIONAL ABOUT THIS,

00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:10.098
THINK ABOUT THE DAILY WEATHER

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.465
FORECAST.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.467
YOU WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL,

00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:13.768
THEY GO THIS MODEL SAYS THAT,

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.303
THAT MODEL SAYS THAT, WE THINK

00:04:15.304 --> 00:04:18.239
THIS ONE IS WORKING THE BEST,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.109
WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.043
WELL, FOR CLIMATE FORECAST

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:23.578
SHOULD BE USING THE RUSSIAN

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.413
MODEL BUT WE'RE NOT.

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:27.148
WE USE THIS BIG SPATE OF ALL

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.117
THE OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE THE

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:30.819
WARMING THAT'S NOT OCCURRING.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.421
MARK: WHY ARE THE OTHER MODELS,

00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:35.290
31 OF THEM, WRONG.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.393
AND WHY DO THEY ALL GO THE SAME

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:39.027
DIRECTION, UP?

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:40.695
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE, THEY WHAT ARE IS

00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:43.965
CALLED PARAMETERIZED.

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:46.267
THEY'RE ALL PARAMETERIZED, CAN

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:49.204
I TRANSLATE PARAMETERIZED IN

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:49.704
ENGLISH?

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:50.171
FUDGE.

00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:52.106
THEY DON'T GET THE RIGHT

00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:53.508
ANSWER, DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.510
ANSWER FOR CERTAIN PHENOMENA,

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.812
SO WE ESSENTIALLY PUT IN CODE

00:04:57.813 --> 00:05:00.448
STEPS THAT GIVE US WHAT WE

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.683
THINK IT SHOULD BE.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.319
AND SYSTEMATIC ERROR THAT WAS

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.621
MADE WAS THE MODELS WERE TUNED,

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:09.390
AS IT SAID.

00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:09.691
TUNED.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:11.226
TUNED TO SIMULATE THE WARMING

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.128
OF THE EARLY 20th CENTURY.

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.132
BEGAN IN 1910, ENDED IN 1945,

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.368
ABOUT .45 DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:23.037
MARK, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:24.105
CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE.

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:25.673
MARK: BECAUSE THERE WASN'T

00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:26.007
ENOUGH.

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:28.509
&gt;&gt; WE HAD TO PUT ENOUGH IN THAT

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.410
THE BACKGROUND CARBON DIOXIDE

00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:31.112
CONCENTRATION IS 280 MILLION

00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:32.747
PARTS PER MILLION.

00:05:32.748 --> 00:05:36.451
WHEN THE FIRST WARMING STARTED,

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.152
208 PARTS PER MILLION.

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:41.489
IF IT IS THAT SENSITIVE TO

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.391
18PPM CHANGE IN CO2 WE WOULDN'T

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.159
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.594
AND WE'D BE SWEATING BULLETS.

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.998
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS MAN

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.666
MADE CARBON DIOXIDE THE LAST

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.568
CENTURY COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:53.801
--

00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:55.703
&gt;&gt; EARLY 20th CENTURY.

00:05:55.704 --> 00:05:57.038
MARK: COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:57.906
THIS HEAT.

00:05:57.907 --> 00:05:59.474
SO WHAT DID?

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:00.275
DO WE KNOW?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:00.975
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:03.645
AND THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.247
IN LIFE MAY NOT BE I LOVE YOU.

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:07.949
IT MAY BE I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.850
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY

00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:10.618
KNOWS WHAT KICKED OFF THAT

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:11.219
WARMING.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.487
THERE'S LOTS OF THEORIES.

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:15.223
ONE IS THAT IT WAS THE FINAL

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:17.992
ESCAPE FROM A GOLD PERIOD,

00:06:17.993 --> 00:06:19.294
MULTICENTURY PERIOD KNOWN AS

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.862
THE LITTLE ICE AGE.

00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:22.063
THAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY, WHY

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:23.665
DID IT HAPPEN THEN.

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:26.334
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:26.935
EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:29.804
BECAUSE WE FORCED THE COMPUTER

00:06:29.805 --> 00:06:32.573
MODELS TO SAY, HUMAN INFLUENCE,

00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:33.241
CO2 AND OTHER STUFF.

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:36.277
WE MADE THE MODELS TOO

00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:37.378
SENSITIVE, AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.347
WHEN YOU GET TO THE LATE 20th

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:41.549
CENTURY, ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.151
THEY'RE WARMING UP LIKE CRAZY

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.620
AND THE REALITY IS DOWN HERE.

00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.589
IT WAS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.758
THIS WAS REVEALED IN SCIENCE

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.893
MAGAZINE IN LATE 2016, AND

00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:53.795
THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED BY

00:06:53.796 --> 00:06:56.397
A FRENCH CLIMATE MODELER CALLED

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:57.865
THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CLIMATE

00:06:57.866 --> 00:06:59.801
MODEL TUNING.

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.470
AND IN IT, HE SPEAKS OF

00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:03.004
PARAMETERIZING.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.840
WE COULD SAY FUDGING, THE

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.344
MODELS TO GIVE, HIS WORDS, AN

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.380
ANTICIPATED ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:12.747
RESULTS.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.050
SO IT'S THE SCIENTIST, NOT THE

00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:18.252
SCIENCE THAT'S DETERMINING HOW

00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:19.787
MUCH IT'S GOING TO WARM.

00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:20.788
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS,

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.758
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE, AND

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.027
YOU KNOW, WE COULD SPECULATE AS

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:29.163
TO WHY THAT PAPER WAS PUBLISHED

00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:31.966
RIGHT BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION?

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.736
I WOULDN'T WANT TO IMPUTE

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:35.570
CAUSATION, BUT GEE --

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.804
MARK: BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU

00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:38.006
ABOUT CAUSATION.

00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:38.973
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:40.908
MARK: HAVE YOU 31 GOVERNMENTS.

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.144
&gt;&gt; THE 31 DIFFERENT MODELS.

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:45.680
&gt;&gt; 31 DIFFERENT MODELS.

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:46.280
MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS.

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:46.647
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:49.017
MARK: FUDGING THE NUMBERS?

00:07:49.018 --> 00:07:50.985
&gt;&gt; NOT FUDGING THEM

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:51.452
PARAMETERIZING.

00:07:51.453 --> 00:07:54.522
MARK: YOU USED THE WORD

00:07:54.523 --> 00:07:54.889
FUDGING.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.924
DOES OUR EPA DO THAT?

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:57.959
DOES NASA DO THAT?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.360
WHO DOES THAT FOR US?

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:03.131
&gt;&gt; GOOD QUESTION, MARK, BECAUSE

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:05.233
THE EPA WAS TOLD BY THE SUPREME

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:07.902
COURT IN 2007 THAT IF IT FOUND

00:08:07.903 --> 00:08:09.971
THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENDANGERED

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:10.938
HUMAN HEALTH AND WELFARE, THAT

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:12.940
IT HAD THE POWER TO REGULATE IT

00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:14.809
UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.411
MARK: THIS IS THE

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:16.844
MASSACHUSETTS.

00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:18.446
&gt;&gt; THE EPA.

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:19.847
WELL, THEY PRODUCED AN

00:08:19.848 --> 00:08:22.183
ENDANGERMENT FINDING, 2009, AND

00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:26.120
THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR

00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:27.955
PROSPECTIVE CLIMATE IS 100%, I

00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:29.257
DIDN'T SAY 90%.

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:32.660
I SAID 100% BASED ON THOSE

00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:33.061
MODELS.

00:08:33.062 --> 00:08:35.229
SO IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.964
THOSE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY ARE

00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:40.368
NOT WORKING, YOU CAN TAKE DOWN

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:43.271
THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING, AND

00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:45.506
THAT WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR ALL

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:47.241
THOSE POLICIES THAT CAME OUT OF

00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:47.942
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:49.310
MARK: WHICH WOULD MEAN YOU

00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:52.747
DON'T GET TO REGULATE --

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:53.214
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:53.915
MARK: -- CARBON DIOXIDE.

00:08:53.916 --> 00:08:56.184
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, THE ENDANGERMENT

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:58.352
FINDING IS THE HEART OF THE

00:08:58.353 --> 00:08:58.719
MATTER.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.854
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW GUNG HO

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:01.155
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS ON

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:03.191
THIS ISSUE.

00:09:03.192 --> 00:09:04.859
IF YOU LISTEN TO HIS FIRST

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.862
INAUGURAL SPEECH, JANUARY 20,

00:09:07.863 --> 00:09:09.630
2009, IT'S SECOND SUBSTANTIVE

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.166
PARAGRAPH OF THE SPEECH IS

00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:13.301
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, AFTER

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:14.702
HEALTH CARE.

00:09:14.703 --> 00:09:16.204
90 DAYS AFTER HE FINISHED THAT

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:18.606
SPEECH, HIS EPA PRODUCED A

00:09:18.607 --> 00:09:20.708
PRELIMINARY FINDING OF

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:21.542
ENDANGERMENT FROM CARBON

00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:21.943
DIOXIDE.

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:24.445
THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS

00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:27.648
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT,

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:29.317
BUREAUCRATS CAN'T WORK THAT

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.486
FAST, AND THEN THE FINAL

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.122
FINDING WAS MADE IN DECEMBER

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:36.357
FOR THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:38.025
COPENHAGEN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:38.826
PRODUCE ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING.

00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:42.797
MARK: SO YOU'RE TELLING US THAT

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:45.500
WE HAVE A MASSIVE BIT OF PUBLIC

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.469
POLICY THAT HAS ENORMOUS EFFECT

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.071
ON SOCIETY THAT'S BUILT ON --

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:52.240
I'LL USE MY WORDS, PHONY

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:52.607
MODELS.

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:55.476
&gt;&gt; BUILT ON A HOUSE OF CARDS.

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:57.245
MODELS REALLY DON'T WORK.

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:00.181
IF I COULD REALLY BE ARCANE, I

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.049
COULD EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM AS

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.718
TO WHY THEY DON'T WORK.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:04.585
MARK: AS LONG AS I UNDERSTAND

00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:04.852
IT.

00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:06.454
&gt;&gt; THE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:07.989
PREDICT THAT AS YOU GO UP IN

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.091
THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE TROPICS

00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:11.959
WHICH ARE 40% OF THE EARTH THAT

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.528
THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD RISE

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:15.029
DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO FURTHER

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.364
UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.566
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE LEVEL OF

00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:21.602
THE JET STREAM, THE COMPUTER

00:10:21.603 --> 00:10:24.138
MODELS ARE PREDICTING SEVEN

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:24.438
TIMES.

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:27.608
I DIDN'T SAY SEVEN-TENTHS OF A

00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:29.177
DEGREE, I SAID SEVEN TIMES MORE

00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:32.480
WARMING THAN BEING OBSERVED.

00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:35.216
WHY AM I BORING YOU WITH THAT?

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.718
THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF

00:10:37.719 --> 00:10:39.020
TEMPERATURE DETERMINES

00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:40.521
PRECIPITATION, AND GUESS WHAT?

00:10:40.522 --> 00:10:42.757
ALMOST ALL THE ATMOSPHERIC

00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:45.459
MOISTURE THAT WE HAVE AROUND US

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.327
TODAY IN THE HUMID WASHINGTON,

00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:48.296
D.C., THAT COMES FROM THE

00:10:48.297 --> 00:10:48.763
TROPICS.

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:49.997
SO IF YOU GET THAT VERTICAL

00:10:49.998 --> 00:10:53.034
MOTION WRONG, DOWN THERE, YOU

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:54.335
GET ALL THE SUBSEQUENT

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:55.236
VARIABLES WRONG.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.338
IT'S A FANTASTIC SYSTEMATIC

00:10:57.339 --> 00:10:58.839
ERROR, AND AGAIN, THAT ALONG

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.375
WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.511
SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE RATHER

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:07.215
THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:09.183
TEMPERATURES THAN WHAT'S BEING

00:11:09.184 --> 00:11:09.984
OBSERVED, THAT'S SUFFICIENT TO

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:11.519
THE CHEMICAL FINDING.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.486
MARK: TO THE AVERAGE PEDESTRIAN

00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:14.922
LIKE ME, IF YOU GET THAT WRONG,

00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:16.557
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:11:16.558 --> 00:11:18.960
YOU GET THE WEATHER MODELS

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:19.260
WRONG?

00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:19.927
&gt;&gt; THE SUBSEQUENT WEATHER

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:20.228
WRONG.

00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:21.929
THAT'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.967
THESE FAMILIES OF MODELS, THEY

00:11:25.968 --> 00:11:27.235
PREDICT RADICALLY DIFFERENT

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.069
CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION FROM

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.637
MODEL TO MODEL.

00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:33.274
WELL, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:33.808
THE PRECIPITATION

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:36.644
INITIALIZATION OUT OF TROPICS

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:36.944
WRONG.

00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:38.145
PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT.

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:42.250
I OFFER YOU WILMINGTON, NORTH

00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:43.818
CAROLINA, IF AN EXAMPLE

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:44.518
PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.053
COMING FROM THE TROPICS, GET

00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:47.255
THAT WRONG AND YOU GET THAT

00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:47.555
THING.

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:51.058
&gt;&gt; IS WEATHER GETTING WORSE?

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:52.293
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:53.294
I LOVE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.330
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK

00:11:56.331 --> 00:11:58.799
AT.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.668
ROGER PILKE, JR., AT THE

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:02.069
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DOES.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.671
THIS YES, THERE'S MORE DAMAGE

00:12:03.672 --> 00:12:04.872
FROM WEATHER BECAUSE THERE'S

00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:06.073
MORE STUFF AND PEOPLE AND

00:12:06.074 --> 00:12:07.975
PROPERTY IN THE WAY OF WEATHER.

00:12:07.976 --> 00:12:09.543
SO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK

00:12:09.544 --> 00:12:12.046
AT ARE WEATHER DAMAGES AS A

00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:13.614
PERCENT OF GDP.

00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:17.118
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY,

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:18.185
THERE'S NOTHING WHATSOEVER.

00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:20.121
I'M SURE HURRICANES ARE GETTING

00:12:20.122 --> 00:12:20.421
WORSE.

00:12:20.422 --> 00:12:24.892
I HEARD THAT ON EVERY LEGACY

00:12:24.893 --> 00:12:26.460
NETWORK DURING FLORENCE AND

00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:28.396
HARVEY AND ALL THAT STUFF.

00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:30.264
WELL, FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:32.600
THERE'S A GUY BY THE NAME OF

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:37.238
RYAN MAUI, A HOT SHOT YOUNG

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:39.340
TROPICAL METEOROLOGIST, AND A

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.609
SCHOLAR AT THE CATO INSTITUTE.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.744
HE TRACKS THE ENERGY IN THE

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:45.479
TROPICAL CYCLONES.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.814
SINCE WE GOT GLOBAL RECORDS

00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:50.651
THAT BEGAN IN 1970, AND YOU

00:12:50.652 --> 00:12:52.153
WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME

00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:54.588
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:55.556
INTEGRATED ENERGY AND GLOBAL

00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:59.760
WARMING AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY

00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:00.094
LOGICAL.

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:00.861
VICE PRESIDENT GORE SAYS THAT

00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:03.931
MUST BE THE CASE.

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:05.399
IT'S NOT.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.701
THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:09.470
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE

00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:10.671
ACCUMULATED CYCLONE ENERGY AND

00:13:10.672 --> 00:13:12.273
THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:12.707
EARTH.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:14.175
IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:16.644
NOW, WHAT -- WAIT A MINUTE, J

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:19.213
DOES OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THIS?

00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:22.450
THEY SAID IT IN THEIR LAST

00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:23.217
REPORT CALLED GLOBAL CLIMATE

00:13:23.218 --> 00:13:24.385
CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:24.719
STATES.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.954
THEY SAID, OH, THERE'S BEEN A

00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:29.223
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

00:13:29.224 --> 00:13:31.058
HURRICANE POWER IN THE ATLANTIC

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.828
OCEAN FROM 1970 TO 2009 OR

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.396
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.465
1980 TO 2009.

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:37.932
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:13:37.933 --> 00:13:40.167
WHY DID YOU STOP IN 2009.

00:13:40.168 --> 00:13:41.869
IT'S 2014 REPORT.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.872
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE DATA

00:13:44.873 --> 00:13:47.007
AFTER 2009, THE INCREASE GOES

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:48.376
BACK TO WHERE IT WAS.

00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:50.544
WHY DID YOU START IN THE MID

00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:52.413
1970s, BECAUSE WE HAVE RECORDS

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:53.781
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD BACK TO

00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:54.248
1920.

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:56.650
IF YOU LOOK AT 1920 TO 1950,

00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:58.352
YOU SEE AN INCREASE THAT IS

00:13:58.353 --> 00:14:00.588
EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:01.822
THAT OCCURS.

00:14:01.823 --> 00:14:03.023
MARK: SO THE INFORMATION

00:14:03.024 --> 00:14:04.725

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:06.560
&gt;&gt; IS SKEWED.

00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:07.061
IT'S SKEWED.

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:09.663
THEY'RE CHERRY PICKING.

00:14:09.664 --> 00:14:12.867
MARK: HERE WE RELY ON THE

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:14.301
CLIMATOLOGISTS AND THEY ARE

00:14:14.302 --> 00:14:14.769
HYPERPOLITICAL.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.104
TONIGHT GET BACK TO THAT AS

00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:17.872
