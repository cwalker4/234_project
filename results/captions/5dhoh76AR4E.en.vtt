00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.470
From shackled skulls to books that are literally
wrapped in human skin, there have been things

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.690
found by archaeologists that will chill you
to the bone!

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.380
Here are 12 of the most terrifying archaeological
discoveries ever.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.680
12.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.040
Headless Gladiators
Let's start off with a combat one.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.710
In York, England, a large set of skeletal
remains were found buried.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
This isn't too bad on their own, however,
when the remains were fully uncovered, they

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.850
found that every single person that was buried
there was missing their head.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.470
What's more, they were buried with their heads
alongside them, which made it even more odd,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.830
and scary.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.690
After some research and study, scientists
dated the bodies back to around the second

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.399
and fourth centuries, A.D. which lead to speculation
that these might have been gladiators.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.250
This theory was supported when when the bones
of the victims were shown to have clear battle

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.250
wounds.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.610
Other people believe that they could have
been soldiers, but it's impossible to tell

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.980
either way.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.369
No matter what they did for a living, this
raises a very disturbing question.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.040
Regardless of whether they were soldiers or
gladiators, why were they decapitated then

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.180
buried with their heads?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.810
It's clear that they weren't thrown in, the
heads I mean, they were placed in specific

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.120
spots from body to body.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.750
Which says that they were buried there with
care and detail, but to what end?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.500
The archaeologists are just as confused as
we are.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.700
11.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.050
Screaming Mummies
Sticking with the past in a big way, let's

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.600
talk about mummies.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.040
They're a well-documented part of archaeology,
and some of the biggest discoveries in history

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.820
have been finding mummies and their crypts
and tombs and discovering who they were and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.820
what they did.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.710
The process to examine these former rulers,
like Tutankhamun is extensive, as doing it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.619
the wrong way will cause the body to disintegrate...The
mummy's, not the archaeologist although there

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.540
are some curses around that they should watch
out for!

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.990
However, a trend was discovered back in 1886
in regards to improper mummification that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.259
surely scared the crap out of the archaeologist
at the time.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.969
For he discovered...a screaming mummy.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.269
Of course it wasn’t alive and screaming,
but rather, the pose and posture of the mummy

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.099
made it look like it was screaming.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.970
Can you imagine brushing the dirt off of its
face and its mouth close up while it’s frozen

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.439
in a scream?

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.829
This naturally lead to much speculation as
to how this mummy ended up this way!

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.999
Was he buried alive?

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:28.999
In pain?

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.029
Well, apparently, it's all about following
procedure.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.749
When we die, our body gets rigid, the process
called Rigor Mortis.

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.189
However, after a while our body relaxes, and
allows itself to rest.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.309
This is no different with mummies, and because
of that, if the jaw isn't fastened shut, (which

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.950
is a practice in proper mummification), it
will go slack, and fall open.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.549
And without skin or muscles to give context,
it looks like a screaming mummy.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.279
Despite being explained by science, it would
still be creepy as heck if you turned around

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.549
and saw one staring at you!!

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.339
And now for number 10, but first if you are
a returning subscriber, welcome back!!!

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.589
Glad to see you again!!

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.250
Can any of you identify this noise??

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:18.939
Put your guess in the comments below!

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.540
The answer is coming up!!!

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.670
10.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.099
Shackled Corpses
History is written by the victors, and because

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.519
of that, the "dirty little secrets" of societies
and their rulers have to be dug up and found.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.729
One such secret of the ancient Greeks was
found in 2016 in Athens.

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.620
They were trying to dig up ground to make
some new buildings.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.819
Nothing wrong with that, right?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.749
Well, as they were doing so, they found an
ancient Necropolis, or a massive cemetery.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.629
This always happens in Athens and in Rome
so for them, it’s not really that big of

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.890
a deal.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.919
A lot of them are just frustrated because
of all the delays!

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.079
The archaeologists were called in and they
started exploring.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.299
Eventually, someone stumbled onto a hidden
part of the Necropolis, a room that held over

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.889
80 skeletons in it that were long-dead, and
each one of them was shackled.

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.010
In fact, some of the corpses were shackled
twice.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.559
Adding to the intrigue was that scientists
determined that these people, whoever they

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.749
were, were very young when they were bound
and killed.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.230
How did they die?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.049
That's unclear, but there is historical text
that says this could have been a band of rebels

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.919
trying to overthrow the leadership of Athens,
but again, it's been so long it's very hard

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.030
to say for sure.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.120
However, there's a lot of mysteries to go
along with this.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.550
Why were they shackled AFTER their death?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.560
Why were they put in this hidden room?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.540
These questions will likely never be answered.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.610
9.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.350
Pit Of Death
Speaking of unanswered questions, this pit

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.750
raises plenty more of them.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.820
In France, another construction project led
to the discovery of something heinous and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.820
foul.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.960
A literal pit that was over six feet deep
and five feet wide.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.870
But it’s not called the pit of death for
nothing.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.039
Inside the pit were numerous bodies.

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.830
As sad as it sounds, it gets worse.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.370
There were bodies of all kinds of people:
men, women, children, infants all within the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.370
pit.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.630
Add to that, some of the bones didn't have
a proper host, suggesting there were even

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.130
more within it.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.130
Still not enough?

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.310
Some of the bodies were amputated, or dismembered.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.970
The really sad thing though, aside from the
mass death, was that these bodies had been

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.490
in the ground for over 5300 years, and only
got discovered in 2012.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.830
That's a long time to be stuck in a pit like
that.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.919
If the last few entries have proven anything,
it's that history isn't always pretty.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.430
It can be downright gruesome.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.710
8.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.139
Vampire Burials
Fear is a powerful thing.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.729
It can lead people to do things they would
never do of their own rational mind.

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.229
And it can cause them to fear things that
are truly irrational.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.530
The fear of vampires were a real thing for
a long time in the ancient world, and the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.719
thought that the dead could rise again and
come for blood made many take "precautions"

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.800
in order to protect themselves.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.710
The Polish for example decided to take their
precautions to rather unsettling levels.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.689
If a person died, and people thought they
would come back as a vampire, they would be

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.010
buried with the proper "precautions" to ensure
they couldn't rise again, or cause trouble

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.010
if they did.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.449
For example, some people were buried with
sickles around their necks, likely to chop

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.699
off the head should they try to get up.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.330
Others had massive stones wedged between their
jaws so that if they rose they couldn’t

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.039
suck out people's blood.

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.629
People do strange things when they fear what
goes bump in the night.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:27.629
7.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.300
The Moa Under The Mountain
Exploration is key in finding archaeological

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.889
artifacts, but sometimes even the most hardened
of archaeologists can't predict everything

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:37.980
they would find.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.320
And this particular one is one for the history
books.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.030
New Zealand, 1986, a group went to Mount Owen
to examine and observe the underground complex

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.479
of tunnels that lied beneath the mountain.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.849
As they were exploring though, they found
a large pile of bones.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.600
Nothing out of the ordinary in context, but,
they found something very fresh next to it.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.909
A massive claw that didn't look like anything
living today.

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:06.360
Turns out, the freshly decayed claw belonged
to an ancient bird call the Upland Moa.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.400
This bird was flightless, but given the size
of its claw, was clearly a threat to many.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.550
The questions remain though, how did this
claw get under the mountain?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.199
Why was it so perfectly preserved despite
other bones not getting the same treatment?

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.409
And can you imagine if they had found a fully
alive Moa in that mountain?

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.169
Pretty exciting stuff!!

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.330
6.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.849
Altamura Man
While certain finds can be scary, they can

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:35.249
also be fascinating in the historical sense,
and one such grand case is the Altamura Man.

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:40.289
A cave scientist (yeah, that's a thing, I
looked it up) was in Altamura, Italy doing

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.969
some work, and while examining a particular
structure, he turned to find a skeleton looking

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:46.169
at him through the rock.

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:51.680
A very human-looking skeleton in fact, and
it's literally fused into the rock around

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680
it.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.770
This is the Altamura Man, but he's not exactly
human, he's a Neanderthal, and in fact, he's

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.680
the oldest Neanderthal ever found!!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.849
Now, if you're waiting for the feeling of
terror to come back, here it is.

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:07.620
The "rock" he was in...wasn't always a rock.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.500
It was actually once a sinkhole, one that
Mr. Neanderthal fell into when he was having

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.889
a bad day, and he was never able to get out.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:20.300
Because of that, he was literally consumed
by it, to the extent that he because fused

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.069
with the calcium deposits within the sinkhole,
thus creating the sight that scientists found

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:27.710
tens of thousands of years later.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.590
What a way to go, am I right?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.590
5.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.350
Tortured Skulls
No, that’s right, "Not tortured souls",

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.539
"tortured skulls".

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:41.010
In Sweden, in 2009, some archaeologists were
excavating a dried up lake bed.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.310
Near the bottom of the lake they found a sealed
structure, that's already pretty terrifying,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.420
but trust me, it gets worse.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.232
Within that stone structure were a set of
11 skulls.

00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:50.830
No, that's not the scary part just yet.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.940
What's odd is what happened to these skulls.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.810
Many of them were impaled, some of them were
burnt to a crisp, and one of them was literally

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.790
shoved inside another skull.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.199
Yeah, say what now?

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:08.199
And it should be noted that these skulls were
all by themselves, no bodies attached to them.

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:14.940
So, how and why did the people who killed
these people do this to their skulls?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.560
No one really knows, but it's definitely creepy
to think about.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.560
4.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.640
The Sewer Of Babies
The ancient world did a lot of great and wondrous

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640
things.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.300
But, it also did a lot of terrible things,
including facilitating the death of many young

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.300
babies.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.029
Yet, one of the most disturbing finds ever
might just be a sewer full of their corpses.

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:39.610
In Ashkelon, Israel, a group of archaeologists
were examining a bathhouse that was built

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.740
by the Romans.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.990
Eventually, they made their way to the sewers
underneath it.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.899
If you think sewers are a weird place to look
for artifacts, you'd be surprised by how many

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:50.199
incredible things are found down there!!

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:54.060
Anyway, they started to notice as they explored
that there were bones in it.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.330
But they were tiny.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.040
Upon finding tiny human skulls to go with
them they realized, they were in a literal

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.560
baby sewer.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.019
It's not known why the babies were thrown
into this particular sewer, or why there were

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:08.000
over 100 of them put into it.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.810
But it's safe to say that whoever did it did
not do this by accident, and that's what makes

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.770
it so terrifying.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.770
3.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.449
Family Betrayal
Sometimes the truly terrifying things we find

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:22.920
aren't the remains of people, but the stories
they leave behind.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.110
Yan Shiwei was a prominent member of Chinese
society during his time and he loyally served

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.320
the first female Emperor in Chinese history.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.550
As a military man he fought by her side through
high times and rebellions, even breaking his

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.959
own arm so that he couldn't rebel against
his ruler.

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:43.889
But then, his brother betrayed the family
and the Emperor.

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:48.079
As a punishment, the entire family was branded
as "traitors" and killed.

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:54.170
This story was revealed in a text found in
the tomb of Yan Shiwei 1300 years later.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:59.430
Emperor Wu Zetian helped unify China but was
only in power for 15 years.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.640
Mass executions were the norm and she got
rid of supporters and her own family members

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.400
if she had to.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.440
2.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.389
Neanderthal Cannibalism
Cannibalism is the act of a humanoid eating

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:11.740
another humanoid.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.300
It was once widely felt to be a tribal act,
rooted in specific groups of people.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.709
Yet, Archaeology has taught us differently.

00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:21.410
This act goes all the way back to the Neanderthals.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.360
In fact, one find depicted a rather large
family being eaten by another Neanderthal

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360
family.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.649
Caves in Goyet Belgium reveal human bones
of adults and children showing signs of cuttin

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.110
and fracturing to extract the marrow.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.230
This is kind of new information that Neanderthals
ate each other, and it is not the first case

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.230
of this happening.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.530
It could have been just for food or it could
have had symbolic meaning but it’s hard

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.199
to piece it together.

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:47.259
1.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:50.699
Death Whistles
If you recognized this sound earlier, then

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:54.399
you know it comes from an Aztec Death Whistle!!

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:59.329
This was discovered when digging up an Aztec
grave, where the deceased sacrificed man,

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:01.149
was holding onto the Death Whistle!

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:07.149
Now, if you're wondering what it sounds like,
it's blood curdling, and it took years for

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:12.310
any of the scientists to even know what it
was, let alone blow on it.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.430
Speculation is that this whistle was used
during human sacrifices to the gods.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.640
Or to terrify their enemies since it sounded
like hundreds of people screaming their heads

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.660
off.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:32.740
Thanks for watching!
