 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A PLACE,

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:43.737
FAR BEYOND THE SPRAWL
  OF SUBURBAN AMERICA,

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.573
WHERE SUCCESS AND FAILURE
  COLLIDE,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.875
AND WHERE UTOPIA
  AND THE APOCALYPSE

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.012
MEET TO DANCE A DIRTY TANGO.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.081
IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE,

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.750
A BIT CLOSER
 THAN YOU MIGHT THINK,

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.686
THAT DRAWS A UNIQUE GROUP
 OF OUTSIDERS,

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.322
LOOKING FOR
  AN AWFULLY BEAUTIFUL LIFE,

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.093
ON THE EDGE OF
 A BEAUTIFULLY AWFUL PARADISE.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.528
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.265
THERE'S VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT
 KNOW ABOUT THE SALTON SEA...

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.934
VERY FEW.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.102
Les Marty:
  IF THEY DON'T KNOW
 WHERE IT'S AT,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:18.105
YOU TELL 'EM 50 MILES
SOUTH OF PALM SPRINGS--

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.806
WHICH I USE
 AS A REFERENCE POINT.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:27.414
CALIFORNIA'S VERSION
OF THE FRENCH RIVIERA,

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.650
WITH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER,

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.551
WATER AVAILABLE FOR BOATING,

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.621
AND AS A PLACE FOR RECREATION
 AND FISHING AND SO ON.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.627
THE FISHING IN THE SUMMER
 IS GREAT...GREAT!

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:43.864
THE HOTTER THE WATER,
  THE BETTER THE FISHING.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.465
THAT'S NOT EDIBLE FISH.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.235
IF THEY ARE EATING THOSE FISH,
AND THEY EAT VERY MUCH OF 'EM,

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.537
THEY'LL GET
  BOTULISM POISONING.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.773
THAT SEA IS FILTHY.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.309
DEAD FISH, DEAD BIRDS,
 DEAD EVERYTHING OVER THERE.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.678
WE HAVE THE ODOR PROBLEM,

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.780
WE HAVE
  THE INSECT PROBLEM--

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.349
NAMELY THE COMMON HOUSEFLY.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.450
IT GETS HOT HERE
IN THE SUMMER.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:04.885
IT'S 120 DEGREES HERE,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.721
100 DEGREES AT MIDNIGHT;
 YOU KNOW, IT'S WARM.

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.090
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE GOT
 AIR CONDITIONING FOR.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.994
WE DO EVEN GO SWIMMING
 IN THE WATER.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:16.630
IT'S MORE SALTIER
THAN THE OCEAN.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.765
AND IT HEALS YOUR SKIN.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:22.836
IF YOU HAVE A SKIN PROBLEM,
  IT HEALS YOUR SKIN.

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:26.540
WHY CLEAN UP
 A MOST USEFUL SEWER?

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.809
IT'S THE GREATEST SEWER
  THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.910
LEAVE IT THAT WAY.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.279
IT'S PERFECT FOR THAT PURPOSE.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.347
IF IT HAD BEEN
 HANDLED CORRECTLY,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.018
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER
PALM SPRINGS RIGHT NOW.

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.089
THE SMELL.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.327
IT'S THE SMELL--A LOT.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.197
AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE
 DON'T HAVE ANYTHING HERE.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.998
IT IS RATHER BLEAK.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.634
BLEAK IS THE WORD.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.837

 YOU CAN GO FISHING,

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.173
YOU CAN GO JET SKIING.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.109

 ROCK FORMATIONS.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.376

 IN THE SUMMERTIME,

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.347
YOU CAN SEE SNOWCAPS
 ON THE MOUNTAINS.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.015
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.318
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THAT
 YOU CAN FIND NOWHERE ELSE.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.587
THERE'S NO FAST FOODS HERE.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.589
THERE'S NO RECREATION

YOU CAN'T GET NOTHING--
 THE STORES CLOSE AT 6:00!

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:26.266
SO YOU CAN'T BUY BOOZE
 AFTER 6:00.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.069

 OR NOTHIN' OUT HERE.

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:23.523
SITS THE WONDERFULLY
  BIZARRE SALTON SEA.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.193
IT WAS ONCE HAILED AS THE
  FISHING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.462

 "ECOLOGICAL DISASTER."

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:53.253
BUT DISASTER IS WELL KNOWN TO
 THE PEOPLE OF IMPERIAL VALLEY.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.226
IN FACT, THE SALTON SEA ITSELF
  IS JUST ONE BIG MISTAKE.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.597

DEVELOPERS WITH A DREAM
  TO TRANSFORM THE DESERT,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.802
DIVERTED WATER
  FROM THE COLORADO RIVER

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.807
TO A DRIED LAKE BED
 NAMED THE SALTON SINK.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.676
AS AN ANCIENT OVERFLOW
  FOR THE COLORADO RIVER,

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.645
THE SOIL WAS NUTRIENT-RICH

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.180
AND THE WARM CLIMATE

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:23.617
MADE IT POSSIBLE
  TO GROW CROPS YEAR-ROUND.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:27.354
RENAMED THE IMPERIAL VALLEY,
 LAND WAS SOLD,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.224
AND FARMING FLOURISHED
 IN THE DESERT.

  SILT EVENTUALLY BLOCKED

THE ENTRANCE TO THE CANAL,

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:39.065
AND WATER DELIVERY WAS
 ALL BUT CUT OFF TO THE FARMERS.

  AND 16 MONTHS OF FLOODING,

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.124

  TO TURN BACK THE RIVER.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.762

FROM FARMERS
  IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY,

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.671
SUSTAINED THE NEWLY-FORMED SEA,

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.742
AND INCREASED ITS SALINITY
 TO NEAR OCEAN LEVELS.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:59.779

  HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO A SEA

35 MILES LONG
  AND 15 MILES WIDE

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.020

  AND THEY THOUGHT

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:30.143
THAT THE SALTON SEA
WOULD BE GOOD FOR FISH,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.712
IF THEY COULD GET THE RIGHT
KIND OF FISH TO GROW IN THERE.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:35.915
SO THEY WENT DOWN TO SAN FELIPE
  AND SEEN--

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.918
FISH OUT OF THE SURF THERE.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.454
BUT THEY TRIED TO KEEP ALL
 OF THE SHARKS OUT OF THERE,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.523
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
 ANY SHARKS IN HERE.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.858
AND THEY BROUGHT THE FISH UP--

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:47.127
I MEET THEM AT SALT CREEK
 UP HERE--

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.763
AND THEY PUT THE FISH IN
  RIGHT THERE AT SALT CREEK.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.466
THAT WAS 1951, IN JUNE.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.770
FINALLY IN 1957, WE STARTED
CATCHING A FEW CORVINA

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.071
AT SALT CREEK.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.339
WE CAUGHT
  THE FIRST TWO LIMITS OF FISH

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.141
THAT WERE EVER CAUGHT
  IN THE SALTON SEA.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.609
WE CAUGHT 12 FISH THERE,

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.311
AVERAGED
  BETWEEN 8 AND 10 POUNDS.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.847
AND THAT STARTED
THE FISHING DOWN HERE.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:11.618
BY 1960 THERE WERE EIGHT
 BOAT LANDINGS AROUND THE SEA,

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.654
LAUNCHING 50 TO 100 BOATS
 A DAY.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.359
THEY WERE HERE BY THE HUNDREDS,
 ALL UP AND DOWN THIS HIGHWAY,

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:22.662
AND WE FED
 100 FISHERMAN A DAY HERE

SO FAR THEY'VE BEEN
  CAUGHT UP TO 33 POUNDS.

THERE ARE CORVINA, TORTUAVA
  AND MULLET IN ABUNDANCE.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:26.059
THE WATER WAS BRACKISH THEN,
 IT ISN'T LIKE TODAY.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:30.630
IT WAS LESS SALTY
 THAN THE OCEAN AT THAT TIME.

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:32.899
WE USED TO HAVE FISH FRIES.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.001
SO ANYBODY THAT CAUGHT ANY
 BROUGHT 'EM UP

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:40.273
AND THE CORVINA--
 AND, OH GOD, THEY WERE SO GOOD!

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.076
THEY COOKED 'EM
 IN A BEER BATTER.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.044

  WATER MEANS FUN,

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.415
AND SALTON SEA WATER IS IDEAL
 FOR THE AMATEUR SKIER,

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.884
SUPERB FOR THE SKILLFUL.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.418
THE REASON?

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.187
THE LOW ALTITUDE
  AND THE ACCOMPANYING DENSITY

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:56.523
MAKES SALTON SEA ONE OF
  THE FASTEST BODIES OF WATER

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.524
ON EARTH.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.425
IN THE '50s AND '60s,

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.860
THE SEA TOOK IN MORE--

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:04.898
HAD MORE TOURISTS
 THAN YOSEMITE PARK.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:07.200
DOWN HERE WE HAD BOAT RACES.

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.469
WE HAD EVERYTHING.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.138
WE HAD ALL KINDS OF CELEBRITIES
 AT THE SALTON SEA

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:13.940
AND BIG EVENTS.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.911
WE HAD SONNY BONO.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.245
WE HAD THE MARX BROTHERS,

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:21.714
AND THE BEACH BOYS
 USED TO COME OUT HERE.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.352
THE YACHT CLUBS ON ALL SIDES
  WERE DEVELOPING AND BOOMING

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.421
AND BOATS WERE
  IN AND OUT OF THE WATER.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.157
EVENTUALLY THIS AREA

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:35.828
WAS LAID OUT
  AS A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:40.066
THEY BASICALLY LAID THIS OUT,
  PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE,

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.669
AND THEN STARTED SELLING IT.

  OUT OF THE LABOR
  AND MIND OF MAN,

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.306

OUT OF THE MANY MONTHS
  OF ENDEAVOR

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.576
AND DARING IMAGINATION,

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:50.977
A CITY IS BORN.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.213
AND BUSINESS SEES A FUTURE
 IN SALTON CITY

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.882
AND BECOMES PART OF
  THE GREAT SCHEME OF THINGS.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.784
A MAJOR OIL COMPANY
  BECOMES A PART,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.786
A MODERN RESTAURANT.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.421
PEOPLE CAME ON BUSES--

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.889
BUSLOADS OF PEOPLE--

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:06.492
TO SPEND THE DAY
  AND BUY THE LOTS.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.361
FREE LITTLE TOURS
  OF THE PLACE

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:13.766
AND THEY HAD LITTLE BUSES
  AND GOLF CARTS.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.702
GAVE THEM A LITTLE SPIEL
  ON THE BUS

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.604
AND THEN TOOK THEM
  TO THE YACHT CLUB--

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.372
AND HAD A MARINA THERE--

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:23.476
AND HAD A NICE LUNCH
 AT THE YACHT CLUB.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.982
THE YACHT CLUB
WAS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE,

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.550
HAD GOOD FOOD,

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:34.721
HAD, MOST OF THE TIME,
 A VERY COMPETENT BARTENDER.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.623
HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE DRINKS,

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.158
INSTEAD OF JUST
 SPLASHING THEM IN, YOU KNOW.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:42.095

Brian Napier:
  THE RISING SEA CAME
  PRIMARILY FROM ACCUSATIONS

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.520
OF EXCESSIVE AGRICULTURAL
 RUNOFFS TO THE SOUTH.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.222
WHEN THE FARMERS ORDERED WATER,

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:45.858
THEY WOULD ORDER ENOUGH
  TO BE SURE THEY HAD ENOUGH,

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.128
AND THEY'D CLOSE THEIR GATES
 TO THEIR FARM

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.463
WHEN THEY HAD ALL THEY WANTED,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.432
AND LET THE REST RUN OUT.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.567
AND IT CAME INTO THE SEA.

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:59.972
WELL, THERE'S
 CONFLICTING STORIES

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.974
ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED,

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:06.346
WHETHER IT WAS DELIBERATE
 OR NOT DELIBERATE OR WHAT.

00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:08.548
WHAT HAPPENED, I DON'T KNOW,
 BUT THE WATER ROSE.

00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:14.954
AND WE WERE SMACKED
 BY A PAIR OF TROPICAL STORMS,

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.523
ONE IN '76, ONE IN '77,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.893
THAT DROPPED UNBELIEVABLE
 AMOUNTS OF RAINWATER

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.196
ON THE IMPERIAL VALLEY.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.367
IT REALLY FLOODED THE SEA,

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.837
SO WE STARTED SANDBAGGING,

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.906
AND THAT WASN'T DOING
  MUCH GOOD EITHER.

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:36.242
WE'D BE OUT--
 IT MIGHT BE MIDNIGHT.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.678
CREWS OF US WOULD BE
 OUT HERE SANDBAGGING,

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:41.247
BECAUSE WATER
  WAS COMING OVER.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.383
WE HAD A FRIEND

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:47.754
THAT LIVED BELOW 4th STREET
 IN A MOBILE HOME

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.056
AND THE WATER WAS
  COMING IN HER FRONT DOOR,

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:52.825
SO SHE BROUGHT HER DOG,
 AND HER CIGARETTES,

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.360
AND HER BOTTLE OF BOOZE,

00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:58.164
AND CAME UP
AND WE SWEATED IT OUT.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:02.068

  AND RAN AWAY OR ANYTHING.

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:04.337

 BY THE YACHT CLUB.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.816
JUST WASHED IT OUT TO SEA
  PRACTICALLY.

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.785
WE PICKED UP PIECES OF IT.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:21.120
WHEN SOMETHING MAJOR
  LIKE THAT WENT OUT,

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:24.123
THEY WEREN'T ABOUT
  THE REPLACE IT.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:30.062

 OF THE GOOD TIMES DOWN HERE.

John Waters:
 AS AN UNNATURAL BODY OF WATER,

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.046
THE SEA IS LIKE
 A GIANT PUDDLE

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.615
AT THE BOTTOM OF
  A DRAINED SWIMMING POOL.

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:52.852
WITH NO OUTLET, THE WATER LEVEL
  CAN CHANGE SUDDENLY,

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:56.522
AND ANYTHING THE WATER
  BRINGS IN, STAYS THERE.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.492
THE ONLY REASON
  THIS PUDDLE DOESN'T DRY UP,

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:01.994
IS BECAUSE OF
  SALTY IRRIGATION RUNOFF

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.030
FROM SURROUNDING FARMS.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.432
BUT WITH 6 FEET
 OF EVAPORATION A YEAR,

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:08.134
THIS LIFE-SUSTAINING RUNOFF,

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:11.537
IS CONCENTRATED
  INTO A SALTY SOUP.

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:12.772

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:15.641

150 FEET OUT FROM MY DOCK

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.087
AND ABOUT
 A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.330
DURING THE SUMMER,

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:40.399
THE WATER IN THE SALTON SEA
 IS SO WARM AND SO SALTY,

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:43.569
THAT OXYGEN WILL HAVE
  A DIFFICULT TIME DISSOLVING.

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:46.439
SO WE HAVE THESE
 LARGE DIE-OFFS OF TILAPIA

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.807
JUST FOR THE SIMPLE REASON

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.909
THAT THERE'S NO OXYGEN
  FOR THEM TO BREATHE.

  THEY ARE FERTILIZER.

 TOO MANY FISH HERE.

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:24.143

 100 MILLION TILAPIA IN IT,

THAT THEY SOLD IT
  TO PEOPLE WHO WERE GREEDY

IT'S A LEGEND.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.595
IT'S A LEGEND OF FAILURE, OF
 HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:05.598

 AND I SAW EVERYTHING.

I SAW THE VIEW,
I SAW THE SEA,

 THAT WAS HAPPENING,

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:11.537

A HUMONGOUS OPPORTUNITY

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:10.549

AND SHE IS PRETTY, TOO.

 BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, GREEN.

HE LOVES 'EM ALL!

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.712
THERE'S A LOT OF HUNGARIANS
 IN BOMBAY,

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:15.914
THEY SEEM TO LIKE THE--

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:18.317
WELL, ALL HUNGARIANS
 LIKE TO PARTY, I MUST SAY.

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:19.851
SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM
 HUNGARIANS,

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.553
BUT YA PAY ATTENTION
 TO THEIR LANGUAGE

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.455

 THEY'RE SPEAKIN' RUSSIAN.

00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:25.090

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:37.269

00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:41.306
THERE WAS ONE OVER,
 ACROSS THE STREET THERE.

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:45.377

 LANKA AND ANIKO AND--

00:30:45.444 --> 00:30:46.778

ROSE SPONTANEOUSLY

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:02.194
AND MADE A SHAMBLES
  OF THE MIGHTY RUSSIAN TANKS.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.097
FOR 10 DAYS THEY SENT
 THE RED MIGHT REELING.

  BUT RETRIBUTION WAS SWIFT
 AND CRUSHING.

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:23.148
TWENTY NEW DIVISIONS OF TANKS
  MOVED IN.

00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:24.483

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.851
SHAKEN KREMLIN LEADERS

 A FREEDOM FIGHTER.

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.484
I NEVER SAW ANY PICTURES
 OF HIM IN UNIFORM,

 I KNOW HE WAS IN THE WAR,

BUT I NEVER SAW
ANY PICTURES OF HIM IN UNIFORM.

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:05.690
SO I GUESS

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.893
THAT HE SAVED PEOPLE'S LIVES
 UNDERGROUND OR WHATEVER,

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.761
AND THEN HE CAME TO AMERICA

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:13.265
AND HE LOVED THIS...

 THERE WASN'T ANY BUSINESS.

 IF THEY'D DO THE SALTON SEA,

EVERYTHING'LL BE
SO MUCH BETTER.

AND PROPERTY TAXES WILL GO UP.

00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:06.885
AND THERE'S JUST--

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:08.386

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DESERT,

WITH THIS HUGE BODY OF WATER
THAT WE CAN'T EVEN USE!

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:15.494
IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS;
 IT MAKES ME SICK.

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:20.565
EVERYTHING'S BUILT UP
 IN BIG CITIES NOW.

00:33:20.632 --> 00:33:22.067
IT HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE.

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.869

 A NICE LITTLE TOWN.

 TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT,

 ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO

00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:05.911

EVER SINCE, EVERY DAY.

  I JUST BELIEVE THAT GOD
  REALLY BUILT THIS MOUNTAIN,

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:44.749
I DIDN'T.

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:48.720
I'M NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF--
  ESPECIALLY BEING AN ARTIST--

00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:50.855
I'M JUST NOT CAPABLE
 OF DOING ANYTHING,

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.258
BUT GOD ALMIGHTY
 CAN DO ANYTHING.

00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:56.494
AND IF I'VE TALKED
 TO GOD A LOT,

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:58.530
AND I KEEP SAYING
 ALMOST EVERY MORNING,

00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:00.966
"GOD, USE ME IF YOU CAN.

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:02.500
I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU, GOD."

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.635

00:35:03.702 --> 00:35:05.470
IT'S GOING BETTER THAN
  10 CHURCHES

00:35:05.537 --> 00:35:08.740

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:10.375
YOU KNOW,
  WHEN IT COMES TO PAINT--

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:13.612
I JUST LOVE PAINT--OLD PAINT,
  NEW PAINT, PRETTY PAINT.

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.280
AND I LIKE LATEX AT FIRST.

00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:18.116
IF I GET A PRETTY COLOR
 OF OIL HIGH-GLOSS PAINT,

00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:20.619
I KEEP IT FOR THE FLOWERS.

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:25.223
SO, NO MATTER WHAT COMES IN,
 I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT. HA!

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.392
PEOPLE JUST BRING ME
  THEIR PAINT.

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:29.094
AND I LIKE TO GIVE POSTCARDS
  TO PEOPLE,

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.829
SO IT'S A "GIVE ME" MOUNTAIN.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.368
NO EDUCATION FROM MAN
  WHATSOEVER.

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:38.570
SO, IF THERE IS ANY PART
  OF THIS MOUNTAIN,

00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:40.372
IT'S NOT--I DIDN'T READ IT
  IN A BOOK,

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:43.708
OR I DIDN'T PUSH
  AN INTERNET PUSH BUTTON.

00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:47.345
AND NOW PEOPLE REALLY THINK
I'M AN ARTIST.

00:35:47.412 --> 00:35:50.148
I HOPE I AM NOT A COUNTERFEIT.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.853
YOU LEARN BY MISTAKES MAINLY.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.423
YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,
AND YOU KINDA HAVE FUN DOING IT,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.457
BUT THEN YOU LOOK BACK
 AND SAY,

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:02.694
"HEY, THERE MUST BE
A BETTER WAY."

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:05.030
I MADE ONE MISTAKE
  THAT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS--

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:07.165
AND THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN
 FELL ON ME.

00:36:07.232 --> 00:36:10.101
SO I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
 MISTAKES THAT BIG ANYMORE.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:12.170
AT FIRST
 I DIDN'T BUILD IT RIGHT.

00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:14.472
AND I WENT TO THE DUMP,

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.375
AND THEN I'D GET
  A REFRIGERATOR, TRUCK TIRES,

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:19.144
AND I'D FILL 'EM WITH SAND

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.147
AND PUT 'EM IN HERE
 AND PUT SOME CEMENT WITH IT.

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:25.984
AND IN 1991,
 THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN FELL DOWN.

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:29.554
I PROBABLY HAD 200 OR 300 TONS
  OF ADOBE UP HERE.

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:33.758
AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME,
I LOOKED UP AND I SAYS,

00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:38.063
"GOD, YOU BUILD THE MOUNTAIN,
JUST DON'T LET LEONARD BUILD IT.

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:39.297
GOD, YOU DO IT."

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:41.700
AND, BOY, EVER SINCE THEN--

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.968
I JUST STARTED DIGGING
 IN THIS MOUNTAIN,

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.471
AND I'VE BEEN TOTALLY HAPPY
 EVER SINCE.

00:36:49.908 --> 00:36:55.747
THE SALTON SEA
  NEEDS TOURISM AND MONEY.

00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:59.017
WE NEED PEOPLE TO COME IN
  AND FILL UP THE RESTAURANTS

00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:01.352
AND PUT THEIR WAITRESSES
  TO WORK.

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:04.155
AND I HOPE THAT,
 IN YEARS TO COME,

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:06.825
THIS THING WILL TURN
 INTO A TOURIST ATTRACTION,

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:10.028

AND THEY GET BOTULISM AND DIE.

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:09.614
BOTULISM SPREADS
 THROUGH CONTAMINATION

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:11.216
OF OTHER BIRDS.

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.051
WHEN A DEAD BIRD
  THAT HAS BOTULISM

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.419
BEGINS TO DECOMPOSE,

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.588
OF COURSE,
  IT FILLS UP WITH MAGGOTS.

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:19.224
THE MAGGOTS PICK UP
  THE BOTULISM TOXIN,

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.092
AND IT DOES NOT AFFECT THEM.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:24.062
SO EACH MAGGOT
 THAT CRAWLS AROUND,

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:28.433
PRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY
 OF ANOTHER DEAD OR SICK BIRD.

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:29.968
IT SPREADS QUITE FAST

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:33.304
IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
 TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:34.606
CLEANING UP THE AREA

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:38.576
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO.

00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:41.613
YEAR-ROUND WE WILL GO OUT,
 ONCE A WEEK OR SO,

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:44.382
AND COVER ONE PARTICULAR AREA
OF THE SEA OR ANOTHER,

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:46.985
AND ONCE WE START
 PICKING UP PELICANS,

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.586
USUALLY OUT OF
 THE SOUTH END HERE

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:50.822
AROUND THE ALAMO RIVER
 OR THE NEW RIVER,

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:54.092
THEN WE'LL STEP UP PATROLS,

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:58.563
TO EVENTUALLY
  TO 7 DAYS A WEEK.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.098
SO WE'LL GO OUT THERE,

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.432
WE'LL PICK UP THE BIRDS
  OFF OF THE SHORE

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.867
THAT ARE DEAD.

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:05.904
WE'LL ALSO PICK UP
 AS MANY LIVE BIRDS AS WE CAN,

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.974
TREATING THEM ON-SITE
 AT OUR REHAB HOSPITAL.

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:11.042
IT WAS KIND OF DIFFICULT
  AT FIRST,

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:12.610
PICKING UP ALL THOSE PELICANS,

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:15.546
AND KNOWING THAT THEY'RE SICK
  AND POSSIBLY COULD DIE,

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:19.183
BUT NOW KNOWING
 THAT 7 OUT OF EVERY 10

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.486
ARE GOING TO MAKE IT,

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.288
YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF GIVES YOU
  A GOOD FEELING.

00:40:26.024 --> 00:40:28.459
THERE IS JUST
 A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BIRDS

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.628
THAT COME THROUGH THIS AREA,

00:40:30.695 --> 00:40:33.631
SIMPLY BECAUSE
  OF ITS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION,

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:36.034
PLUS THE MILD WINTERS.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.405
AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER
  THAT MOST OF THE--

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:42.340
CALIFORNIA'S WETLANDS
 HAVE BEEN LOST

00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:43.908
FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:48.012
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW
 REMAINING WETLANDS THERE ARE.

00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.984
WE STILL HAVE DISEASE PROBLEMS
 IN THE SUMMERTIME,

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:55.853
WE HAVE HAD
EVERY SUMMER SINCE '96.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.057
I MEAN, IT'S, AGAIN,
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:02.293
BUT BECAUSE OF OUR EXPERIENCE

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.563
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE
  THAT WE NOW HAVE,

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.265
THESE PROBLEMS
  AREN'T REALLY BAD.

00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:09.434
WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH IT,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.269
AND ACTUALLY
  STAY AHEAD OF THE GAME.

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.245
(* Acoustic Guitar )

00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:26.250
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PLANS

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.353
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS
 WITH THE SALTON SEA.

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.788
AND THERE ARE DOZENS
 AND DOZENS OF PLANS

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.223
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS
 WITH THE SALTON SEA,

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.926
AND PERHAPS
 THAT'S A PROBLEM IN ITSELF.

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:37.395
IN MY MIND IT'S A CANAL,
  OR IT'S A PIPELINE,

00:41:37.462 --> 00:41:38.763
A WATER MOVEMENT:

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.865
TAKE WATER OUT,
  PUT WATER BACK IN.

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:42.300
THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:43.735
TO LOOK AT PONDING PORTIONS
  OF THE SALTON SEA;

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:45.069
TO DRAW THE SALT OUT;

00:41:45.136 --> 00:41:47.238
TO USE ENHANCED
  EVAPORATIVE SYSTEMS

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:48.272
CURRENTLY
  USED IN ISRAEL.

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.408
IT'S AN AGE-OLD PROBLEM,

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:53.244
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 30 YEARS.

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:54.712
BUT IT'S COME TO THE POINT

00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:57.248
WHERE I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER 30 YEARS.

00:41:57.315 --> 00:41:58.683
WE NEED TO SOLVE IT NOW.

00:42:00.785 --> 00:42:03.054
John Waters:
  SCIENTISTS KNEW
  HOW TO SAVE THE SEA,

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:04.956
BUT THEY LACKED
  THE ATTENTION AND FUNDS

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:06.357
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:08.326
WHAT THEY NEEDED WAS A HERO,

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.995
WHAT THEY GOT,
  WAS A ROCK STAR!

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:16.167
* WITHOUT LOVE,
 WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW? *

00:42:16.234 --> 00:42:18.169
* NOW, NOW, NOW...

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:21.839
John Waters:
  SONNY BONO--
  MUSICIAN, RESTAURATEUR,

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:24.876
PALM SPRINGS MAYOR,
  AND EX-HUSBAND OF CHER--

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.744
WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS,

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:30.515
AND THE SALTON SEA
  FOUND ITS CHAMPION.

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:34.218
I MAY HAVE TO WEAR
 THAT "SONNY AND CHER" THING

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:35.820
FOR A WHILE,

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:38.156
BUT I'LL OVERCOME THAT.

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:41.726
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO PEOPLE
AND I'LL OVERCOME THAT.

00:42:41.793 --> 00:42:44.328
SONNY BONO WAS ABLE
TO DEVELOP AND GENERATE

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:45.830
A LOT OF INTEREST
 IN THE SALTON SEA

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:47.432
WITH HIS PEERS IN CONGRESS

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:49.367
AND I THINK HE'S THE ONE
 THAT REALLY BROUGHT ATTENTION

00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:50.735
TO THE PROBLEMS
  OF THE SALTON SEA

00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:53.037
TO CONGRESS,
  TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.074
Sonny Bono:
  IT'S THE FIRST TIME
 I'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF ENERGY

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.644
GO INTO A PROJECT
 THAT IS DEARLY NEEDED

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.481
TO PREVENT
 AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.

00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:06.851
Clark Bloom:
  SONNY WAS A REBORN
  ENVIRONMENTALIST.

00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:09.520
HE DID HAVE QUITE AN INTEREST
  IN WILDLIFE,

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:12.356
AND WANTED TO SEE
SOMETHING DONE.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:16.060
YOU COULD NOT ONLY AVOID
THIS DISASTER,

00:43:16.127 --> 00:43:20.098
BUT YOU COULD ALSO CREATE
 A RECREATIONAL MECCA.

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.867
I THINK SONNY WAS GOOD
 FOR THE SEA.

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:24.869
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE WENT SKIING.

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.845
HE HAD INTRODUCED
SOME LEGISLATION INTO CONGRESS

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.213
JUST BEFORE HE DIED.

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.815
AND, UNFORTUNATELY--

00:43:37.882 --> 00:43:40.618
I MEAN, THAT IS A TERRIBLE WAY
TO HAVE TO GET SOMETHING PASSED

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:42.887
IS TO HAVE SOMEBODY GET KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT,

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:46.124
BUT I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY
 THE SPARK

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.558
THAT GOT CONGRESS TO GO AHEAD

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:51.095
AND COME FORWARD
  WITH SOME FUNDING.

00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:53.264
AS SONNY SAID,
 "THE BEAT GOES ON,"

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:56.934
AND ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
 IN CONGRESS

00:43:57.001 --> 00:44:01.239
HAVE PICKED UP THE BALL
 THAT HE WAS CARRYING

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.741
AND I THINK WE'LL TAKE IT
 ACROSS THE GOAL LINE.

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:05.143
Female Newscaster:
  REFERENCES WERE MADE ALL DAY

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.979
TO KEEPING
  SONNY BONO'S LEGACY ALIVE,

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:10.181
AS FEDERAL, STATE
  AND LOCAL LEADERS

00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:13.217
DISCUSSED WAYS TO SAVE
  THE AILING SEA.

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:15.786
THIS IS A GREAT NATURAL RESOURCE

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.922
TO BE MANAGED AND NURTURED
AND RECLAIMED,

00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:23.794
AND WE WILL BE INTRODUCING,
WITH MARY'S PERMISSION,

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:25.463
ON SONNY'S BIRTHDAY,

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:29.167

SALTON SEA RESTORATION PROJECT.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.602
( Applause )

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:33.504
WE WANT TO KEEP THE AREA
FOR THE THINGS

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:34.972
LIKE SONNY BONO WANTED,

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:39.243
LIKE BOATING AND FISHING
 AND WATER-SKIING.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.012
AND WE WANT TO HELP
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.313
THE SPORTS FISHERY;

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.781
AND THEN THE FINAL ONE IS

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:46.050
WE WANT TO HELP
  THE MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT.

00:44:46.117 --> 00:44:48.386
WE HAVE A LOT OF GROUPS
  THAT ARE WORKING WITH US,

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.054
THAT ARE INTERESTED
  IN SAVING THE SEA.

00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:52.156
WE HAVE ALL THE WAY FROM
 IRRIGATORS AND DEVELOPERS

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:54.158
AND CITIES, ALL THE WAY
 TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS.

00:44:54.225 --> 00:44:56.594
SO WE'VE GOT A NICE GROUP
 OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:57.962
AND THAT'S NICE,
THAT'S FUN TO DO THAT,

00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:00.665
BECAUSE MAYBE WE CAN
 ALL COME UP WITH AN ANSWER.

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:02.533
THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE.
 THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE.

John Waters:
  WITH THE CREATION

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:15.813
OF THE SALTON SEA
  RESTORATION ACT IN 1998,

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.382
THE PEOPLE AROUND THE SEA
  WERE ALL DOLLED UP

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:21.385
AND READY FOR THE POOL PARTY
  TO BEGIN.

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.555
BUT WITH THE PASSING YEARS
 AND CONTINUED DELAYS,

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:27.525
THEIR VISIONS
  OF A HAPPY, BRIGHT FUTURE

00:45:27.592 --> 00:45:29.327
HAD BEGUN TO FADE.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.196
IT NOW SEEMS
  EVEN THE BONO BOOM

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:34.165
HAS GONE BUST.

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:43.708
(* Electric Guitar )

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:52.383
EVERYONE WAS GOING TO SAVE
THE SALTON SEA.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:56.954
WHEN THE HYPE ENDED,
SONNY'S BURIED,

00:45:57.021 --> 00:46:03.861
A PARK--A RESERVE
 WAS NAMED AFTER HIM,

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:07.098
HALF A FREEWAY SOMEWHERE,

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:10.001
ALL THOSE PEOPLE LEFT.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.336
WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE
 BASICALLY.

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:13.771
JUST A LITTLE MORE IMPULSE,

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:17.008
BUT WE'RE BASICALLY
 BACK TO THE SAME PROBLEM.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.478
WE ALL FELT LIKE,

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:22.480
ONCE THE SALTON SEA AUTHORITY
 WAS CREATED,

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:27.451
THIS WOULD THE BEST,
PROBABLY FINAL EFFORT,

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:29.220
AND THEY'VE DONE
 A BEAUTIFUL JOB.

00:46:29.287 --> 00:46:31.822
I DON'T KNOCK
THE SALTON SEA AUTHORITY AT ALL.

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.858
THEY'VE JUST BEEN GIVEN
THEIR CRITERIA

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.126
AND THEIR PARAMETERS

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:37.862
AND BEEN TOLD WHAT TO DO
 BY CONGRESS,

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:42.099
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE
 POLITICAL PRESSURE AGAINST IT.

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:45.736
WHATEVER THEY TRY TO DO,
 IT'S JUST UP A ONE-WAY STREET.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.363
I THINK IT BETTER CHANGE,

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.231
OTHERWISE THERE AIN'T GONNA BE
 NO FUTURE,

00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:49.400
AT LEAST NOT HERE.

00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:52.203
THIS PLACE HERE IS GOING.

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:55.039
THE WATER'S RECEDING
RATHER RAPIDLY.

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:57.274
LAST YEAR,
 THOSE ROCKS RIGHT THERE,

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.443
WERE UNDERWATER.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.612
THE FISHING
  IS NOT WHAT IS USED TO BE.

00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:04.548
THE PARTYING
  IS NOT WHAT IS USED TO BE.

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.283
AND PEOPLE ARE,
 YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.552
THEY SELL OUT
 AND GET OUT.

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.221
THEY DON'T COME BACK.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:12.556
THIS IS DARN-NEAR
 A GHOST TOWN.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:16.260
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE,
 WHO LIKE ME,

00:48:16.327 --> 00:48:17.328
CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE

00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:18.596
IN THE SENSE THAT,

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.498
"WHAT I COULD GET
 OUT OF THIS HOUSE,

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:23.734
WOULDN'T BUY
  ANYTHING ANYPLACE ELSE."

00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:26.804
SO, PEOPLE HAVE SETTLED IN,

00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:34.211
AND A LOT OF THEM
HAVE COME HERE TO DIE.

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:40.484
THE WATER THAT COMES
 INTO THE SALTON SEA,

00:48:40.551 --> 00:48:43.154
IN GREAT PART,
COMES FROM AGRICULTURE.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.156
SO THIS WATER COMES
  FROM THE COLORADO RIVER,

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.624
IS USED ON OUR CROPS,

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.926
AND EVENTUALLY FINDS ITS WAY
  INTO THE SALTON SEA.

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:50.895
THAT WATER IS ATTRACTIVE.

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.263
MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING,

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:54.131
"WELL, LET'S RECYCLE THAT WATER
THAT GOES INTO THE SALTON SEA,

00:48:54.198 --> 00:48:55.866
AND USE IT
 FOR SOMETHING ELSE."

00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.401
SOME PEOPLE
IN THE WATER DISTRICTS

00:48:57.468 --> 00:48:59.770
HAVE FLAT OUT SAID--
 IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER--

00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:00.805
SAY THAT IT'S A WASTE OF WATER

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.339
TO LET IT FLOW
 INTO THE SALTON SEA."

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.974
SAN DIEGO
AND THE IMPERIAL VALLEY

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:06.677
ARE WORKING
ON A WATER TRANSFER AGREEMENT.

00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:10.548
IF APPROVED, SAN DIEGO COUNTY
WOULD BUY COLORADO RIVER WATER

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.850
FROM THE IMPERIAL
 IRRIGATION DISTRICT.

00:49:12.917 --> 00:49:14.118
THE COUNTY WILL RECEIVE

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:16.587
UP TO 200,000 ACRE FEET
 OF WATER EVERY YEAR,

00:49:16.654 --> 00:49:18.789
FOR AT LEAST
  THE NEXT 40 YEARS.

00:49:18.856 --> 00:49:20.424
WE'RE IN THE BEST
 POSSIBLE POSITION

00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:23.861
IN TERMS OF THIS BEING
 A GOOD DEAL FOR SAN DIEGO

00:49:23.928 --> 00:49:25.162
NOT ONLY TODAY,

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:27.798
BUT 10 AND 20 AND 30 YEARS
 FROM NOW.

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:31.035
I'M GETTING CYNICAL
 AND I'M GETTING VOCAL

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:33.737
AND I'M TELLING PEOPLE,
 "THEY'RE STEALING IT!

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:37.775
LIKE WAKE UP! WAKE UP!"

00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:41.779
THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY CUT OFF
 EVERY SOURCE OF WATER

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:43.681
THAT WILL MAINTAIN THIS.

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:45.983
WE'RE DOWN
  TO ANNUAL RAINFALL.

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:51.856
IT IS AN IDEAL, PERFECT SEWER.

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:54.425
PUT IT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE,
  USE IT THAT WAY,

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:56.961
AND THEN,
  THE WHOLE WORLD IS HAPPY.

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.196
GO IN THERE,
 KILL ALL THE CRUMMY FISH OFF,

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:01.499
TELL PEOPLE TO QUIT SWIMMING
 IN IT.

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:05.202
IF YOU KILL ALL THE FISH OFF,
THE BIRDS WILL GO AWAY.

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:07.271
WELL, THEN THE BIRDS
 AREN'T DYING ANYMORE,

00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:10.241
SO THE BIRD LOVERS
 ARE HAPPY.

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.776
THE BIRDS--THEY'LL JUST GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.345
THE PROBLEM IS,

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.548
IS THAT WE HAVE,
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:19.950
CONSUMED 90% OF OUR WETLANDS

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.685
IN THE TIME THAT
  THE SALTON SEA HAS EXISTED,

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:22.853
SO THE SALTON SEA
 HAS COME TO BE

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.189
A REPLACEMENT
  FOR THE WETLANDS

00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:26.457
FOR THESE BIRDS.

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:29.860
SO NOW,
 AS THE SEA BECOMES SALTIER,

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:32.763
AND THE FISH WILL NO LONGER
  BE ABLE TO SURVIVE,

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.665
THE FISH-EATING BIRDS
  THAT COME HERE,

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:36.166
WELL, THEY'LL HAVE TO GO
  SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.568
THE QUESTION IS,
  WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO?

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:39.169
THEY CAN'T GO TO L.A.,
  BECAUSE WE'RE THERE.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.005
THEY CAN'T GO TO ORANGE COUNTY
  BECAUSE WE'RE THERE.

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.172
SAN DIEGO, WE'RE THERE.

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:44.875
THE COLORADO RIVER,
  WE'RE THERE.

00:50:48.112 --> 00:50:49.446
Norm Niver:
  PEOPLE SAY,

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:52.016
"WHY SHOULD WE CARE
  IF THE SALTON SEA'S SAVED?"

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:53.651
AND I SAY, "WELL,
 YOU'RE REALLY GONNA CARE

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:58.722
"WHEN ABOUT 7 MILES
  OF THE NORTH END IS EXPOSED

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.291
"AND THERE'S A LOT
  OF DRY BOTTOM THERE,

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:04.028
"AND YOU GET A DOGGONE ALKALINE
  DUST STORM COME DOWN

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.330
"AND SHUT THE WHOLE VALLEY
  DOWN

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.400
IN A CLOUD OF ALKALINE DUST."

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:12.636
WE'VE WARNED THEM AND STUFF.

00:51:12.703 --> 00:51:16.440
NO ONE CARES.

00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:18.709
THE STORMS
THAT RUN THROUGH HERE--

00:51:18.776 --> 00:51:23.113
WE'VE HAD AS HIGH AS 75 MILE
 AN HOUR WINDS NOTED HERE--

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.282
RAISE DUST LIKE THEY DO
 UP IN THE OWENS LAKE,

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:27.484
NORTH OF LOS ANGELES,

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:31.989
WHICH THE METROPOLITAN
 DISTRICT OF LOS ANGELES CREATED

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:34.024
BY THEIR BANKRUPTING
  THE OWENS LAKE FOR WATER.

00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:37.995
THE SAME WILL HAPPEN
  TO THE SEA IF IT DRIES UP.

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:43.834
SAN DIEGO ONLY GIVE US
 $9 MILLION TOWARD MITIGATION

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:47.204
TO FIX ALL THAT?

00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.939
I DON'T KNOW.

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:51.875
NOW THESE PEOPLE
 THAT HAVE THE NICE HOMES

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:57.815
IN INDIAN WELLS
 AND PALM SPRINGS AND--

00:51:57.881 --> 00:52:00.918
WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL GOLF COURSES
  IN PALM SPRINGS,

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:02.419
YOU DON'T HEAR ANYBODY SAYING,

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.355
"LET'S PUT SOME OF THE WATER
IN THE PALM SPRINGS GOLF COURSES

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.756
INTO THE SALTON SEA."

00:52:05.823 --> 00:52:08.592
YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE A REBELLION!

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:10.060
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT
 FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND,

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.428
THAT SMELL
THAT YOU DO SMELL OCCASIONALLY

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.830
FROM THE SALTON SEA,

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.965
AS IT GETS WORSE,
THAT SMELL WILL GET WORSE, TOO.

00:52:15.032 --> 00:52:18.402
PALM SPRINGS WILL HAVE NOTHING
  BUT THAT SMELL,

00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:19.403
WHERE SOME
 OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:22.206
IN THE UNITED STATES LIVE.

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:23.507
WILL THEY KEEP

00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:25.509
THEIR MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
  WINTER HOUSE

00:52:25.576 --> 00:52:26.877
AND GO GOLFING

00:52:26.944 --> 00:52:29.246
WITH GREEN FEES AT HUNDREDS
 OF DOLLARS EVERY DAY?

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.450
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN
 WITH THE SALTON SEA

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.586
UNTIL PEOPLE REALIZE
 THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.321
OR IT'S GOING TO HURT THEM
 IN THEIR POCKETBOOKS.

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:39.890
THE FOLKS UP NORTH OF US
  HAVEN'T REALIZED

00:52:39.957 --> 00:52:42.493
THAT PALM SPRINGS
 WON'T BE PALM SPRINGS

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.094
IF THE SALTON SEA FAILS.

00:52:57.775 --> 00:53:00.711
(* Music )

00:53:03.247 --> 00:53:06.550
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN HERE NOW
 FOR 27 YEARS.

00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:08.619
IT'S A GOOD PLACE.
 YEAH.

00:53:08.686 --> 00:53:11.455
WE'VE DONE
  A LOT OF BUSINESS HERE.

00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.123
BUT WE'RE GETTING READY
 TO SELL IT.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.725
I THINK WE'RE--

00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:17.628
I'M JUST ABOUT GETTING TOO OLD
 TO RUN A RESTAURANT.

00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:19.063
I DID A LOT OF FISHING,

00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:20.364
A LOT OF HUNTING
  ON THE SALTON SEA.

00:53:20.431 --> 00:53:23.434
IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL
  RECREATION AREA,

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.303
AND WE HOPE IT WILL BE
  THAT WAY AGAIN.

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:28.772
Eva Worthy:
  CATHY!

00:53:28.839 --> 00:53:30.007
Cathy:
 YEAH.

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:35.512
I NEED TWO CHEESE OMELETS,
A SHORT STACK...

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:37.147
I'M GOING TO BE
 IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.850
HERE SHORTLY.

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:42.486
GOD, I'VE WORKED
 HERE FOUR YEARS.

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:44.822
FOUR YEARS;
I'M SURE GONNA MISS IT.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.523
THERE'S PEOPLE
 THAT HAVE BEEN COMING HERE

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.025
FOR 20 YEARS,

00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:50.027
JUST TO COME IN AND HAVE A CUP
 OF COFFEE IN THE MORNING,

00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:51.795
EVEN IF IT'S FOR FIVE MINUTES
 AND LEAVE.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:53.530
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT
 FOR 20 YEARS.

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:55.432
AND SO IT'S GONNA BE
 A CHANGE FOR 'EM.

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:58.902
LIKE LEONARD, HE COMES IN,
  HE FILLS UP MY ICE THING,

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.137
BEFORE I EVEN GET THERE,

00:54:00.204 --> 00:54:03.774
AND HE'S GONE
 BEFORE THE PLACE EVEN OPENS UP.

00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:06.910
THEY'VE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS
 AND GOOD COMPANY,

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:10.080
AND I'M GONNA MISS 'EM.

00:54:11.782 --> 00:54:13.083
WELL, I'M GLAD THEY'RE CLOSING,

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.852
AND THEY CAN'T CLOSE
 SOON ENOUGH,

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:20.457
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN USED TO
 'EM NOT BEING THERE ALREADY.

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:22.626
THEY'RE THE HIGHEST-PRICED
PLACE IN TOWN.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.862
...SAYS YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
 THE TAPE OFF AND BURN IT.

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.931
NO, I SAID
TAKE THE TAPE OFF.

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:28.966
DO YOU'RE THING!

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.668
OH, SHUT UP.
 ( Laughing )

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:32.736
( Smack )

00:54:32.803 --> 00:54:34.104
SO I CAN
TAKE THE TAPE OFF!

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:36.073
I SAID I'M DONE.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.309
HE'S GONNA MISS IT;
 HE LOVES IT.

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:41.512
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
  YOU'RE 91 YEARS OLD

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:43.380
AND YOU'RE STILL WORKING
  FOUR DAYS A WEEK,

00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:46.183
YOU HAVE TO LIKE IT A LITTLE,
  YOU KNOW?

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.887
IT'S KIND OF SAD BECAUSE
 IT'S BEEN HERE FOR SO LONG.

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:53.056
BUT AT LEAST
 I WILL GET A DAY OFF.
 ( Laughs )

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:58.662
NO, IT'S SAD BECAUSE...

00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:00.597
I DON'T KNOW,

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:04.468
