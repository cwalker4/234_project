00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.530
Sometimes you watch
a poker hand and you

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.440
don't know what to think.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.390
You're not convinced
it was good.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.330
You're not sure if it was bad.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.280
How did that, like--

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180
Ultimately, you find
yourself asking--

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.270
What the [BEEP].

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.580
From the PokerStars' vaults,
here are our top 5 WTF moments.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.411
Is this real life?

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.050
At number five, we have
this curious collision

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.660
between Theo Jorgensen
and Richard Toth

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:43.630
in Copenhagen in 2007.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.380
Theo is deciding if he goes
all-in, will he get called.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.760
He thinks he will.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.690
Not be ElkY.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.380
Not by ElkY.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.106
Theo, I think I have to
trust in my instincts.

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:12.120
And it says you've
got nothing on this.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.862
He's making the call.

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:15.820
And he's going to see
his instincts were wrong.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.460
Theo Jorgensen has the aces.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.350
He has queen-nine.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.040
His instincts were very wrong.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.610
He's a 4 to 1
underdog behind Theo.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.080
Listen to the crowd applaud.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.917
The Danes want to see
the homeboy win this pot.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:29.417
Theo--

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.500
Wrong instincts this month,
but it happens to me.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.790
Yep, sometimes you just can't
guess what your opponent's got.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.618
And this is one of
those occasions.

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:46.330
10, 4, 7.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.390
That's just about all
Theo at this point.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.310
Theo in great position
to double up here.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.390
Oh my goodness.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.067
That is the best card that
Toth could have hoped for.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.650
The fourth card is
the jack of hearts.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
Now, suddenly, it's
only a 2 to 1 race.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.870
He's got a straight
draw and a flush draw.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.400
Looking for a heart.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.050
Or an eight or a king.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.009
It's a 10 of hearts.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.020
And there's the 10 of hearts.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.290
And that means on the
river, Theo Jorgensen

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.290
has been defeated.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.820
Richard Toth has made a
flush, and has actually

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.800
knocked Theo Jorgensen
out of the tournament.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.090
This is absolutely amazing.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.300
And in fact, Theo had said
pair the board, and it did.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.060
But he didn't think
about pairing and making

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.380
a heart simultaneously.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.070
What an awful, awful
river card for him.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.550
A bad read, but at least
it worked out for him.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.420
The same cannot be said for the
heavy breathing amateur Gilles

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.496
Bernies, who went heads up
against Dzmitry Urbanovich

00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:50.372
at the 2016 Dublin Main Event.

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:51.850
Sorry.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.122
Well, Joe, it's time for you to
step inside Urbanovich's brain.

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:58.080
We're going to sweat with
Dzmitry on this hand.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.100
Looking forward to it.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.876
This kid can do anything, except
have a legal drink in America.

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.295
Well, he's raised with
eight-five of spades.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.860
Gilles is counting out a raise.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.190
He makes it 575,000.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.530
Urbanovich is not folding.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.490
He's polish.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.026
He's no fish, and
he's in posish.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:30.050
He could make it
work for suited.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.445
That's a call.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.630
So 1.17 million in
the pot already.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.100
The flop is king, jack,
eight, with two spades.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.850
Bottom pair and a flush
draw for a Urbanovich.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.620
I mean, you really can't ask
for a better flop than that.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.270
I think he almost smiled even.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.760
Bernies continues.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.767
625,000.

00:03:58.767 --> 00:03:59.266
How much?

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:01.859
625.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.150
I would probably just call
here in case Bernies is just

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.250
messing around.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.750
If you do anything more than
that, you can get away from it.

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:14.380
Well, that's a
raise 1.475 million.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.440
Now, is this a raise with
the intention of folding

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.579
if Bernies shoves?

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.096
I doubt it.

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.470
I think if he does
have it, we're

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.594
going to see it go in here.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.730
And if that happens,
we are probably behind.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.731
What do you think, Sven?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.390
All-in.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.170
There's the shove.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.670
All-in.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.815
And a call.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.110
Not much.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.630
But--

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.210
Well, yeah, I'll
say it's better.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.975
We are not behind.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.240
Listen.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.360
Bernies has four-deuce.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
Well, I was wrong, but this
time it's in a good way.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.230
You know, I don't
get it either guys.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.910
You better tell your
boy to Gilles out.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.940
The turn is a seven.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.560
That means Bernies
is drawing dead.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.060
Nice hand.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.060
Thank you.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.550
Urbanovich doubles up and
reclaims the chip lead.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.850
I think Bernies' lack of
experience is starting to show.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.700
That's my [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.130
Go on, four-deuce.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.130
Love the attitude there.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.960
You're going to be
rich either way.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.276
At least everybody knows
now that I'm fish, you know?

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:22.200
Don't worry, dude.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.700
Dzmitry's a 20-year-old
millionaire.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.430
He thinks everybody's a fish.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.330
Well, that blew up in his face.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.920
And talking of blow
ups, at number three

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.180
we have Vanessa Selbst showing
no fear against Prahlad

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.325
Friedman on The Big Game.

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.700
Some of the greatest
poker minds.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.850
I know.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.070
I like watching this stuff
and not being in the hand.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.170
Spirit and Vanessa battles.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.410
Antonio may be driving the
action a bit with his mouth.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.150
Vanessa knows her
own reputation,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.190
so she knows Prahlad
could be three-betting

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.029
her light, thinking she's
raising light, which she is.

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.570
And if that's the
case, she could get

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.800
into some real trouble here.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.010
Four-bet to 13,200
with a jack high.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.640
So typically, a
Vanessa Selbst four-bet

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640
is going to start to get
some credibility, which

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.806
means if Prahlad thinks
she's got some kind of hand,

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:08.270
he'll easily put in a fifth bet.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.890
Another thing to
consider, if Prahlad

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.530
wants to continue to have
Vanessa think he's bluffing,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.790
he's more likely to raise
again than he is to just call.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.630
It is five-bet to 35,000.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.590
It's 30, 35.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.090
Pew-pew-pew.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.590
All right.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.870
Well, this looks like a
pretty easy fold for Vanessa.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.140
But she hasn't
dumped her cards yet.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.473
Joe, what in the world could
she be thinking about here?

00:06:38.473 --> 00:06:40.900
Well, she might be a little
steamy from that last hand

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.390
still, and is probably
leveling herself with thoughts

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.949
that Prahlad is just
messing with her.

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.490
Now it looks like she wants to
see how many chips Prahlad has

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.020
left.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.800
If she levels
herself into thinking

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.640
Prahlad is messing with her,
this is going to be a disaster.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.990
She should be folding
any second now.

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:09.380
Pot.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.870
She puts in six
bets with jack high.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.710
Oh, boy.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.690
106,200.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.000
$106,200 is now the bet.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.200
This is an absolute punt.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.820
Let's count the hang time.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.320
All right.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.212
I'm all-in.

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:22.510
[BEEP]

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.685
Prahlad is all-in.

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:24.860
It isn't a stay.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.540
I call.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.200
Vanessa calls.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.160
Aces for Prahlad.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.740
No, no, no.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.629
He's got aces.

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:29.170
Yeah, I know.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.810
I know.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.120
I'll bet you he's got aces.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.078
How many do you run it?

00:07:31.078 --> 00:07:31.600
He has aces.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.110
It's like 100%.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.985
How many do you want?

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.810
Of course.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.900
She has ace-king or kings.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.400
Nope.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.110
I have nothing.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.560
Twice?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.591
Whatever you want.

00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:44.781
Let's do three times.

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.280
Sure.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.200
She has live cards.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.770
Oh, boy.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.106
How much do you have?

00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:52.970
Uh, I've got--

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.220
He's got you covered, I think.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.310
--160, 170, something like that.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.234
So they're going to
run it three times.

00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:00.150
Almost booked the win.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.274
Couldn't do it.

00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:04.440
How many times did you guys
say you were running it?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.940
Three.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.610
Three times.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.730
Nice hand.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.340
I'm going to leave if I don't.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.410
I think I speak for
Vanessa when I say ugh.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.110
Even worse, some of Vanessa's
outs have been folded,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.720
so she's a bigger
dog than she thinks.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.100
First the three runs coming up.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.950
Winner will get a
third of the pot.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.970
King, four, five.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.790
That's not good.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.240
She'll need runner, runner.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.268
Six of diamonds.

00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:26.934
Six of diamonds.

00:08:26.934 --> 00:08:28.398
Don't waste it.

00:08:28.398 --> 00:08:30.820
Six of diamonds would be--
would that be the best card?

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.450
Six of diamonds would give
her straight and flush draws.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.682
God.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.090
To the turn, nine of hearts.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.049
All right.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.030
Put a deuce of clubs.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.820
Oh, ace of clubs is good.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.374
I think Prahlad knows the
time for speeches is over.

00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.290
River, 10 of hearts, and
Prahlad has locked up

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.620
a third of the pot,
worth over $113,000.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.820
I'm such a [BEEP].

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.980
Why do I do this to
myself every time?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.850
Not every time.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.780
I usually don't do
this to myself anymore.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.970
What are you laughing at?

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:04.810
I'm not laughing.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.170
I'm just-- you know--

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.530
Pretty sure he was laughing.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.902
Here comes the
second of three runs.

00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:12.340
Eight, king, five, two diamonds,
flush draw for Vanessa.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.881
There's already a
diamond over there.

00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:14.905
There it is.

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:15.655
That's the spirit.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.055
Show the other diamond
how hard it is.

00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:19.388
The six of diamonds would
definitely be more useful here

00:09:19.388 --> 00:09:21.070
than it was in the last one.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.570
Vanessa only needs
one more diamond.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.360
The turn, five of hearts.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.880
Wow, Prahlad is strong.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.370
How did he dodge it there?

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.280
Missing the flush draw
would be devastating.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.570
She's not likely to
flop this good again.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.790
To the river.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.310
No diamond, three of clubs.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.630
Or a brick.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.900
Brick ball.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.160
Super brick.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.330
Bricktactic.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.670
So Prahlad is 2/3 of the
way to scooping the biggest

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.040
pot ever won on The Big Game.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.825
What an absolute
gift from Vanessa.

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.660
No jacks and sevens.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.740
Run number three.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.460
Four, six, king,
three more bricks.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.250
This is getting hard to watch.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.410
Not even a sweat.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.950
Vanessa's down to two
pair, trips, or a straight.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.510
All of them runner, runner.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.490
Or else Prahlad's going
to need a wheelbarrow

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.050
to bring all his money home.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.126
To the turn, deuce of spades.

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:11.960
Nice hand.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.511
And Prahlad's going to win
a pot worth over $340,000.

00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.010
Wow.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:16.634
Prahlad did it.

00:10:16.634 --> 00:10:17.391
That's sick.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.160
All right.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.462
I'm out of here.

00:10:22.462 --> 00:10:23.950
Nice playing with you, Vanessa.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.455
Nice playing with you.

00:10:25.455 --> 00:10:26.746
Good playing with you, Vanessa.

00:10:26.746 --> 00:10:28.234
Ugh.

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:29.405
How'd I not win one of them?

00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:30.780
Vanessa is going
to hit the rail,

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.160
and with that, Prahlad
Friedman has the biggest scoop

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.031
in the history of The Big Game.

00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:35.530
Enjoy.

00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:40.400
Good playing with you Vanessa.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.250
Why'd I do this?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.774
You understand what I
did, why I did this?

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.440
Honestly, I don't
know why you did that.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.870
I mean--

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.130
Of course, the reason Vanessa
has been so successful at poker

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.060
is because she isn't
afraid to get her chips in.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.930
But what would she have done
at the final table of the 2014

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.926
Canada Cup?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.340
Oh, kings for Notkin
under the gun.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.120
Cowboys.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.050
Hang on a second.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.250
There we go.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.410
So Notkin raises.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.645
Miller moves all-in.

00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:18.520
What's Miller's hand?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.210
King-queen.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.310
Jacques with a decision
in the small blind.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.740
He's got ace-10.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.340
Hi ya!

00:11:31.098 --> 00:11:33.490
And he reshoves.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.960
Oh, boy.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.980
What is happening?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.012
What does Rivers have?

00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:39.470
How is he even
thinking about this?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.690
He's got two eights.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.330
OMG.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.450
Notkin's got more
chips than anyone else.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.570
Notkin's got them all covered,
and he's got the best hand.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.930
This would be
absolutely [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.820
You're waiting for one
player to go broke.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.430
You might see three
players go broke here.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.385
This would be the weirdest
end of a tournament ever.

00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:03.955
It would somehow
feel appropriate.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.200
I'm pretty sure that
Rivers is folding.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.330
It's not a simple case
of just Miller shoving.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.030
It's the fact that Jacques has
shoved over the top of him,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.574
and Notkin is
sitting there knowing

00:12:16.574 --> 00:12:18.990
that he's going to snap when
the action comes back to him.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.860
Oh, boy.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.319
How do you even
stay in your chair?

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:23.401
And you better, because
they might kill your hand.

00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:24.080
He's in!

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.590
He's all-in.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.590
Holy--

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.640
A four-way all-in.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.920
--schnikes.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.420
And Notkin calls, putting the
other three players at risk.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.110
I have never seen
a four-way all-in

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.290
at a final table where the guy
with the other three players

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.000
has got them covered.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.800
This is crazy town.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.960
If kings hold here, we go from
four players to a champion.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.170
And Robert Notkin,
the online qualifier

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.270
who got his seat for just
$30 has won the Canada Cup.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:09.298
Notkin could be knocking all
three players out in one hand.

00:13:09.298 --> 00:13:11.130
I guess I could say I'm all-in.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.910
What a ridiculous hand.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.020
So just to clarify, Notkin
ahead with kings, Miller all-in

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.840
with king-queen, Jacques
all-in with ace-10,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.384
Rivers all-in with eights,
five cards to come.

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:26.310
I had to go all-in.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.500
He's got half the
equity four ways.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.330
Good luck to the dealer
trying to work out side pots.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.770
Did anyone fold an ace?

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.760
Jack, seven, three.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.870
Kings holding.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.230
Kings way holding.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.200
Notkin now a 75% favorite
to eliminate the other three

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.300
players and win the Canada Cup.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.080
Way bigger favorite now.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.690
88% favorite.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.400
The river card.

00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:03.857
And the man once
said, it's a brick.

00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:07.246
And Robert Notkin has
won the Canada Cup!

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:11.404
Notkin knocks out everyone.

00:14:11.404 --> 00:14:14.386
What a way to win
the tournament.

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:17.865
Can you hear me knocking?

00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:21.140
His friends and family came
all the way from Toronto

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.490
to see this tournament, and
what a hand for them to witness.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.950
As Rod King says,
the strangest hand

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.820
ever streamed online
a four-way all-in,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.670
which sees Robert Notkin
claim the title, the trophy,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.730
and $366,000.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.060
And we're keeping it
Canadian for the number one

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.850
hand in our countdown as
Team Canada find themselves

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.550
on the receiving end
of the biggest WTF

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:57.460
moment of all time at the
2010 World Cup of Poker.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.220
Oh, dear.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.010
Suharto has got kings
in the small blind.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.400
It's a beautifully timed
move from Luca Pagano here.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.390
I'm all-in.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.330
Suharto shoves.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.760
Team Canada are all-in.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.880
Action folded back
around to Luca,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.360
who made a move with nothing
and will fold his six-deuce.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.331
And Cornils will
surely instacall.

00:15:36.696 --> 00:15:38.140
He will not instacall.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.070
I mean, he's got to consider
the possibility that, you know,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.680
what if he calls so
quickly that it dislodges

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.870
one of the TV lights,
and it falls on the table

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.400
and mucks the hand?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.420
Well, the Germans have
decided to call a timeout,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.040
a poor old Suharto probably
thinks, I must be way in front.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.540
We'll probably still make the
wrong decision against Canada,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.980
though.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.590
Very difficult to make
a wrong decision here.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:02.840
We're feeling good.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.000
Our guy's the man.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.070
We're Feeling good.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.900
You shouldn't be.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.250
We have this German
very, very confused now.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.064
They need five of them to
beat just one guy from Canada.

00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:13.030
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.110
They're going to be
very angry in a minute.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.909
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.300
You've got to assume that this
kid is just a bit inexperienced

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.040
and is nervous about going
all-in with five cards to come.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.280
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.440
I mean, famously, there
was a sportsman once

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.510
in a TV show who folded
aces before the flop

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.700
because he thought it
was just a pair of ones.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.540
I call.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.750
Oh, funny that.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.220
We have kings for Canada.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.760
Suharto is not
going to be happy.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.520
Wow.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.960
No way.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.656
This is a really,
really weird hand.

00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:00.530
I have no idea why you
even called a timeout.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.529
Such a slow roll.

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:03.447
A slow roll.

00:17:03.447 --> 00:17:06.490
The ace of hearts.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.190
Sorry, guy.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.648
You've got to flip
around the aces.

00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:12.180
That's embarrassing.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.680
Oh, that's really embarrassing.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.414
Was it your call?

00:17:14.414 --> 00:17:14.955
I didn't know

00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:16.670
I'm not going to lie.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.240
Oh, dear.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.599
It's all kicked off.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.240
Jan Heitmann trying to extend
the international olive

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.745
branch of peace.

00:17:22.745 --> 00:17:24.450
The flop is three, eight, nine.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.829
As it stands, Germany are
the team at risk here,

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.012
but are massively in front.

00:17:29.012 --> 00:17:29.970
Eliminates [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.440
It's kind of hard not to
[INAUDIBLE] for a king,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.940
isn't it?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.255
I can't believe that the
Canadian captain is still

00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:39.755
smiling.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.620
King on the river.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.030
King on the river.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.990
River card.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.760
Give us one time.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.629
One time.

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:52.170
Is there such a
thing as poker karma?

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.390
No, there isn't.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.940
The aces hold up, and
the Germans double up

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.795
through the Canadians.

00:17:57.795 --> 00:17:58.920
That's really embarrassing.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.670
Were you the call?

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.410
I didn't know.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.476
He doesn't snap, and he looks
at me, and he goes like this.

00:18:02.476 --> 00:18:04.100
Of course, I'm going
to take a timeout.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.380
I'm sorry for that.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.310
You told me [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.600
Oh, it's turned into a United
Nations Security Council

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.210
meeting.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.980
To be fair, the Germans
later apologized with beer.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.670
You can catch more top
fives and adopt them

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.910
