Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey it’s
Marie Forleo and you are watching MarieTV,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.480
the place to be to create a business and life
you love.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.720
I’ve got a question for you.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.780
Do you ever feel like you self sabotage around
money?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.840
Ever wonder if you have some limiting beliefs
from childhood that are holding you?

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.910
Whether you’ve got mountains of debt or
you just can't seem to get ahead?

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.210
Most of us have a next financial level that
we would love to get to.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.690
If that sounds like you, you are in for a
treat today because you're going to learn

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.010
about four money beliefs that may be holding
you back and how to fix them.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.830
Miss Kate Northrup, thank you so much for
being on MarieTV.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.640
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much
for having me.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.900
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
just got to say once again.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.970
Money: A Love Story, amazing book by Kate.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.320
If you don’t have it, go out and get it
ASAP.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.200
Lets talk money because we’ve been friends
for years and I love talking about money.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.140
I think it’s an amazing topic, it’s an
integral part of our lives and I'm really

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.920
passionate about it.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.200
So many people, especially this time in the
world, so many people are struggling financially

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.700
and a lot of people aren’t, so there's really
a possibility for us all to get to that next

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.700
level.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.700
I'm curious.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.009
Why are you so passionate about this topic?

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.579
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really see money
as a tool for people to be able to show up

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.700
in a bigger way.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.270
Money is neither negative nor positive; it
just is a tool for us to make change.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.939
If we've got a lot of financial chaos going
on, we’re worried about how am I going to

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.869
put food on the table, how am I going to pay
the rent, where's the mortgage going to come

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.869
from.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.860
That takes up a lot of bandwidth, a lot of
our creative bandwidth, a lot of our power

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.989
bandwidth and we’re not able to show up
in the same way as if our financial lives

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.209
were in order and taken care so that we could
then come over here and do the things that

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.650
are higher leveraged that are really of service.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.680
Getting it together financially is really
just a vehicle for being able to show up more

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.909
fully in your purpose.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.669
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
agree with that 100%.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:32.840
You know my story where I started off thousands
and thousands and thousands of dollars in

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.689
debt and it sucked; it was really hard to
think about how to create everything when

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.930
I was “am I going to have enough to pay
rent or to eat” or anything like that.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.419
I know for you, you’ve come a very far way
in a short couple of years, personally financially.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.279
Can you tell us a little bit about your story
and how big of a change you’ve made in these

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.459
past couple of years?

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.459
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.970
I moved to New York when I was 22 and I promptly
got myself into about $20,000 worth of credit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.489
card debt, probably a little bit more at some
points, and I didn’t even know that that

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.089
was the number until several years in because
I had my head dipped so deeply in the sand

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.730
avoiding looking at it.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.930
I was just like “I’ll just spend and spend”
and they were on things that were business

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.829
stuff and courses; it’s not like I had a
closet full of Jimmy Choos, but it was still

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.589
way beyond my means.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:32.169
I noticed I was so unconscious about money
and I was so avoidant and I was so scared

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.379
to look at the whole truth.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.150
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have a question for you.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.120
Would you get bills that they would come in
and you just wouldn’t open them and you'd

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.120
stick them in a drawer?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.120
Did you pay minimums?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.019
I knew what my minimum was on every card and
I had a lot of them, so it was like this shell

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.230
game where I would just pay a little more
than the minimum which made me feel like I'm

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.729
making a little progress, but I really wasn’t
and I was just in this quagmire and I felt

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:02.599
really unauthentic because I was out running
a business, I was teaching women about different

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.939
streams of income and thinking in new ways
about cash flows, but behind the scenes, I

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.809
had all this financial chaos and I knew I
wasn’t taking responsibility for it.

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:18.630
For the whole thing, it felt really awful
and it was that way around the time that you

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.320
and I met and I was hiding it.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.669
That’s so interesting.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.770
You were hiding it from most of the world
publically and so how long did it take for

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.720
you to reach that breaking point where you
were like, “I've had enough, I got to handle

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.710
this, I can't do this anymore, it just hurts
too much”?

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.879
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about four
years.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:46.840
I always was a good earner so it was never
like I couldn’t eat or anything.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.710
I could always just keep me little nose above
the surface so I could still breathe and it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.570
was about four years that I finally sat myself
down and said “You know what?

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.919
Enough is enough,” and I realized that I
was holding myself back from being able to

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.590
be in my full ability to make change in the
world by being in financial chaos.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.860
I knew that was a way I was keeping myself
small and so I just finally decided to do

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.940
something about it.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.780
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s
fast forward.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.810
What are the numbers?

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.539
How much debt did you get yourself out of
and how fast did you do it?

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.819
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I really made
some significant changes in my life, I was

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:32.210
in about $20,000 and six months later, I had
paid it all off basically in one fell swoop

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.430
and doubled my income and doubled my savings
and it was amazing what happened when I just

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.050
got my rear in gear and made some critical
mindset shifts which we’re going to talk

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.110
about today and it all worked out.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.460
It’s kind of shocking.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.189
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t
it amazing when that happens and when you

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.090
actually tell the truth and stop lying?

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.090
It is so huge.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.719
I know it can feel so scary.

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.770
It’s not about money but back in my early
20s when I was engaged to be married to someone

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.419
that I knew I wasn’t going to married, but
I was terrified of breaking it off because

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.150
our finances were co-mingled and I was just
so scared.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.320
I only lasted about six months in a lie but
living that lie, I think we've all experienced

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.500
that on some level where you know something
is not right, you're hiding something big

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.629
but you don’t have the courage quite yet
to break through.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.710
I love this topic because we’re going to
dive into these money beliefs; they're almost

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.009
like money lies that we’re telling ourselves,
and if you could just tell yourself the truth,

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.599
there's this incredible opening that can happen
and literally your whole life really can change

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.160
just by changing something on the inside.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.530
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fast.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.969
It doesn’t have to take a long time.

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.539
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've
had some stories from clients, from friends

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.939
and people that we've had some tough money
conversations, not tough between us personally,

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.759
but just being there and supporting them through
it and watching how quickly things can turn

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.800
around.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.389
I've had some people that have been in $100,000
or $200,000 in debt, even if that number doesn’t

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:07.550
go away as quickly as yours did, it goes down
really fast but more importantly who they

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.009
are in the world changes significantly.

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.650
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s the whole
point; it’s not about the money.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.250
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s
not about the money and it is about the money.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.749
Let’s get into it.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:24.720
You say we’re going to focus on four beliefs
today and the first one that hold us back

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.870
is someone else should or will do this for
me.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.689
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We take our financial
power and we just give it to somebody else.

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:37.910
It’s so much easier to just say “will
you just do this for me” or “hey boss,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.099
can you just do this for me” or “hey prince
charming, future husband who hasn’t showed

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:45.970
up yet, he’ll probably take care of it for
me,” so I’ll just bide my time and keep

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.639
being irresponsible until that point.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.710
For me it was that I hoped that my mom would
just take care of it for me someday.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.330
It’s so embarrassing to even just say that
right now but it’s true; I wrote about it

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.189
in my book so it’s out there.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:06.349
That is symptomatic of us really feeling like
we’re not enough to do it and it’s just

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:11.939
saying “this is too scary, I don’t have
what it takes, I'm not smart enough,” and

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:17.650
so we wait and we never turn on our full potential
because we’re hoping somebody else will

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.510
swoop in at some point and save us.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.090
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s
a big one.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.539
There's certainly been areas in my life where
I was thinking that someone else was going

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:29.749
to handle it for me and I'm pretty sure money
was it back in the day and now it almost feels

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:37.000
like a different human being that used to
think that way, but it is a big one.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.020
Belief number two: I'm not good with money.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.040
This is a big one.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.130
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a really
big one.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.949
Have you ever seen a baby be born and be able
to talk and walk?

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:48.970
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.490
On YouTube sometimes.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.040
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that pretty much
never happens.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.720
We've all learned the skills we have and so
to think like you're just not good with money

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.240
is holding you back.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.240
Our beliefs become our actions, we act in
accordance with what our beliefs are and then

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.170
our actions obviously create our results.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.649
That’s just kind of a basic equation for
life and when we think I'm not good with money,

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:19.620
we’re setting ourselves up for failure and
we actually avoid taking financial steps because

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.820
we have that thought.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.459
Instead you can take really small actions
to start to build your confidence, and the

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:30.690
one that I did, again I was really pretty
remedial with this, so when I started off,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.630
I was like “I just am going to check my
bank account balance everyday,” and when

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.260
I do that, I'm going to give some gratitude
for the ways my life is abundant.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.910
I knew if I could just check in with money
daily and start being in that relationship

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.959
and paying attention to it, it would be powerful.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:49.290
When I started doing that every day I set
a little Google calendar alarm, 8:30 am, ‘check

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.230
your bank account balance.’

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.860
My income increased and I stopped spending
more than I made.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.779
It was just like paying attention pays off
and I started to be better and better with

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:02.170
money because I was paying attention to it.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.430
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
love that.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:09.110
Also, the things that we tell ourselves, we
joke around a lot about it here on MarieTV.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.250
There are some times where we’re shooting
an episode and literally I'm flubbing this

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.480
line that I really want to get across again
and again and we’re all joking and every

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.180
explicative comes out, and I say “I got
this.”

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.500
I tell myself “I got this,” and wouldn’t
you know nine times out of ten, I'm like “bam”

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.420
and I get it and I deliver that line.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.800
It’s the same thing with “I'm not good
with money.”

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.259
If you tell yourself you're not good with
money, you're never going to take the steps

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:39.730
to do anything about it and it’s almost
like you just got blinders on and you're never

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.009
going to take them off.

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:47.509
I love that simple step of just checking in
daily and the other thing I like about it

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:49.590
is it can remove the fear.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.759
I know for me there was a time when opening
my checkbook was really scary and it actually

00:10:54.759 --> 00:11:02.180
produced physical sensations of wanting to
throw up because there wasn’t enough in

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.960
there, at least that’s the story I told
myself.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.570
There was actually enough in there because
here I am, I didn’t disintegrate and I wasn’t

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.160
getting taken off to jail or something, but
that was the feeling.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.060
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can train ourselves
like Pavlov’s dog to spend that time with

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.250
our bank account and look at it and then automatically
say, “I'm going to name three things in

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.300
my life that I'm grateful for that feel abundant.”

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.899
You're training and rewiring your brain so
that you're associating looking at your money

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:33.899
with feeling good.

00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:36.170
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
love that.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:41.720
Money belief number three: people with money
are greedy or it’s not spiritual to have

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720
money.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.329
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that this
is one you actually covered with Marianne

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:49.950
Williams in your audio, which was so fantastic.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:56.870
When we have a judgment against somebody for
having something and it’s very common with

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.620
money, there's this whole lack mentality of
rich people are greedy, they’ve stepped

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.750
on other people to get there or something.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.110
First of all that’s assumption.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.579
We never know really how people got where
they're at and chances are pretty good that

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:13.730
they worked hard to get there and they deserve
it because of the time they’ve put in.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:19.709
When we judge them, automatically our subconscious
mind will never allow us to have the abundance

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.850
or prosperity that we want if we’re judging
other people for having it.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:30.209
Why would it let us be the evil person that
we’re saying they're bad because they have

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:36.209
money or they're selfish or they're dishonest?

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:43.209
Anytime that comes up, and also, anytime it
comes up “it’s not spiritual to be rich

00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:48.529
or to have money,” money is a stand in for
what we value.

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:53.740
If somebody wants something that you offer,
like B-School for example, and they value

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.649
it according to the amount that it costs,
that’s a service.

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:01.949
That’s an exchange of value for value that’s
tremendous and the value they're receiving

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:05.850
in their life is huge and then you get to
receive that in exchange.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.170
That’s all that money is; just trading value
for value.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:15.190
When we add value to somebody else’s life,
to me that’s a spiritual act to say, “I

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:20.420
see that you have a need and I have something
I can help you with” then to receive an

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.509
exchange for that is how it should be.

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:28.579
That is the flow, so if we start to see money
as a means of value exchange and as a means

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:33.680
of how can I look at the world and say where
can I add value, where can I help somebody,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.850
then the whole thing begins to be rewired
and we realize, “I will become more prosperous

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.070
to the degree that I am able to add value
to somebody’s life.”

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.370
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
love that.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:50.089
That’s beautiful and I get really up in
arms about that whole judging people not spiritual

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:53.980
to have money.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.940
Money belief number four: I'm not ___ enough.”

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:04.680
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not ____ enough;
it could be “I'm not smart enough, I'm not

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.209
talented enough, I didn’t come from the
right background.”

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:11.240
Whatever it is, it’s immediately taking
you out of the game.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.760
Anytime we don’t value ourselves, what ends
up happening is when we’re out in the world,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.259
even if we’re providing really good value,
if we’re not seeing our worth, we’re not

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.480
going to get the value and exchange for that.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.440
No one will value you more than you value
yourself.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.079
We need to learn to value ourselves and you
can really practically, the whole self love

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.699
thing, when I hear about it-

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:34.741
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
you roll your eyes?

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:39.980
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do and I teach
it at the same time because it’s really

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.750
important and pretty much I think the solution
to anything is loving yourself more but “how

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.930
do I do that and what does that even mean.”

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:52.350
Really practically what you can do is get
out a journal and every night for at least

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.260
21 days because that’s what studies show
it takes to form a new habit, write in there

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.839
three things you value about yourself or three
ways that you added value to somebody’s

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.769
life that day.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:15.300
You could be like “I was so funny today
on MarieTV” or I could say “I did a Skype

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.889
interview today and I know I added value to
whoever’s going to watch that one.”

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:23.959
Whatever it is, what we’re doing is we’re
building that muscle and training ourselves

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:30.029
to notice things that we value about ourselves
and things that are valuable about us, and

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:33.810
ways that we've added value to somebody else’s
life which will tune our radar in so that

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.589
during the day, we’re seeing more opportunities
and we saying “I could add a little value

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:41.279
over there, there's an opportunity there,”
and it makes us better business people and

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.530
it makes us better humans.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.330
That’s a great way to train yourself and
write those three things down every day and

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.230
it'll make you feel the next day “I did
something.”

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.949
It’s a fabulous way to celebrate yourself
and to increase your value.

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:56.950
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have to say I love this one.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:03.699
Not so long ago, we did an episode about valuing
your worth and we were aiming that at artists

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:11.390
and creatives, and it was shocking and beautiful
to me and heartbreaking at the same time to

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.759
see how many of us struggling with that.

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.319
It doesn’t matter what level you're at.

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:22.610
You could feel like you're just starting out
on your financial journey or your career journey,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:28.939
or you can be further along and there's times
for me where the little fear comes up.

00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:34.880
I love that suggestion also because adding
value to someone’s life could mean smiling.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.040
It could be an act of kindness.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.060
It can be taking a pause and making a phone
call and letting someone know that you love

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.060
them.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:53.529
It doesn’t have to necessarily be a business
transaction; it can actually be really a beautiful

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:58.520
act of kindness and love and compassion that
you put out into the world.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.490
Kate: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the value we
receive back, the abundance we receive back

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.750
might be financial and it might be something
else.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.050
You and I both know that abundance is a lot
of different things; it’s our health, it's

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.210
our relationships, it's our peace of mind.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.850
A life that’s rich and wealthy is a lot
of different things beyond your bank account.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.510
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate,
this was awesome.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.640
Thank you so much for coming.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.262
What a rich discussion and hopefully we’ll
keep talking about this and we’re going

00:17:22.262 --> 00:17:25.020
to keep talking about this in the comments
right now.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.430
Now Kate and I have a challenge for you.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.050
What is one money belief that’s been holding
you back?

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.280
It doesn’t matter where you're at on your
financial journey; we've all got one.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.930
What we want to hear about also besides the
money belief that’s holding you back, what's

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:43.700
one action you could take that demonstrates
you are ready for a new level of abundance

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.790
in your life?

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.980
