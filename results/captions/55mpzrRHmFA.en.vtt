00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.700
If you go to a Shakira concert, you may see
her do this.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.940
It's this part of her show where the drummer
starts soloing and she's kind of freestyle

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.950
dancing.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
And during this section, she's dancing to
a variation of the exact same beat.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.640
In its most basic form, it sounds like this.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.360
"Cumbia de Colombia!"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.740
Did you catch that?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.020
"Cumbia de Colombia".

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.140
The music is called cumbia.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.900
You can even hear it in electronic dance tracks.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.480
And it has its own category in the Latin Grammys.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.680
And it all started here, up near the Caribbean
coast of Colombia.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.400
I traveled to the villages where cumbia comes
from.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.340
And I learned that this specific place, here
along the Magdalena River, was fertile soil

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.440
from which this music could grow.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.520
But cumbia is in fact a blend of several strong
musical traditions.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.360
Mainly African and indigenous, but also European,
mixing together to make something new.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.320
Something totally unique to the time and place
from which it came.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.160
Okay now just watch what these two drummers
are playing.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.260
We can also look at this another way.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.140
This beat is the backbone of cumbia.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.289
And I wanted to find out where it came from,
so I flew to the beautiful Caribbean city

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.140
of Cartagena and drove south to a village
that was founded hundreds of years ago.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.820
In the early 1500s, the Spanish came to Colombia
as part of their Latin American conquest.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.990
And with them they brought more than 100,00
captive Africans.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.030
But some of these slaves managed to escape
and build their own communities.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030
And that's how this village was formed.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.700
This place is the first known settlement of
slaves who rebelled and started their own

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.960
community back in the 17th century.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.640
And so because of that, they were able to
maintain a great deal of their African culture.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.920
The residents of this village preserve their
history with music, which is based on the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.740
rhythms their ancestors brought over from
the homeland.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.280
These songs are a living, breathing part of
the town's culture and history.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.420
And with time, these beats started to spread
in the region, influencing different styles

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.380
of music.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.260
Does this sound familiar?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.240
This is the beating heart of cumbia and no
matter how many instruments are incorporated,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.180
or in what country it's played, the beat always
stays the same.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.310
The drumbeat brought over from Africa is the
main ingredient of cumbia, but eventually

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.400
the rhythm started blending with instruments
from a totally different musical culture:

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.460
that of the indigenous people of Colombia.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.120
I came to visit the Gaiteros de San Jacinto,
a musical group that has been playing cumbia

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.660
since the 1950's.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.400
In 2007 they won a Latin Grammy for their
folk album and they're able to continue by

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.380
training up new generations, who keep these
old traditions alive.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.560
We're in the backyard of one of the drummers,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.160
who's showing me how they make their own instruments

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.440
using the same methods their ancestors did,
like these maracas.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.260
And this flute, called the Gaita, which is
a quintessential indigenous instrument.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.580
So this is what the cultural fusion of the
root of cumbia looks like: you have the Gaita,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.500
a key element in indigenous music, and then
you have the drum section playing rhythms

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.120
directly influenced by the African village
just an hour from here.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.620
Together they create this unique cumbia sound.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.069
In addition to the African rhythm and the
indigenous wind instruments, there's one more

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:25.220
ingredient to this fusion: the European influence.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.539
The cumbia is always evolving and there's one

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.449
more European influence that is more recent.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.660
It's this instrument that Yeison is holding:
the accordion.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.800
And in fact, it was his grandfather, dubbed
the "King of cumbia," who traded his Gaita

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.120
flute for an accordion, thus changing cumbia
forever.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.980
But once formed in this region, it didn't
stay put.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.150
In the past century, cumbia has spread throughout
all of Latin America, further evolving in

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.140
the process.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.160
While I was in Colombia, I shot an extra bonus episode for

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.159
our friends over at Eater.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.969
It's about this amazing fruit market in Bogota
that I visited and it was really fun.

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:30.970
I think you'll love it.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.669
It's gonna be published on Eater's YouTube
channel, so head over there to subscribe and

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:36.600
I hope you like the episode.
