00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.351
(tense music)

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.092
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.996
(slow orchestral music)

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:08.256
(loud explosions)

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:16.033
(airplane engine screams)

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.158
- [Narrator] When the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor,

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.741
they did so intending to
smash in one single blow

00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:26.510
America's resolution and
its inability to retaliate.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.593
They failed miserably on both counts.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.887
The Japanese sank or badly damaged

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:36.555
seven antiquated American battleships,

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.692
but since they were lost in harbor

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:40.676
many of their crews were saved.

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:44.303
And all but two of the
ships were salvaged.

00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:46.650
The raid also left most of Pearl Harbor's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.900
shore installations intact.

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:52.074
Most important of all,

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:54.828
the violation of United States territory

00:03:54.828 --> 00:03:59.019
united the nation behind the
declaration of war on Japan.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.424
Moreover, the loss of the battleships

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:04.587
forced the United States Navy
to use its aircraft carriers

00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:08.168
as the core of a more
up-to-date Pacific fleet.

00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:09.168
- Yesterday,

00:04:10.606 --> 00:04:12.023
December 7, 1941,

00:04:16.897 --> 00:04:19.647
a date which will live in infamy.

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:26.846
- [Narrator] The 1927 vintage
Lexington and Saratoga

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:29.034
and the much more modern Enterprise

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:30.933
were out of port during the raid,

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:33.674
and were therefore untouched.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:37.460
By 1942, they were joined by
the Enterprise's sister ship,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.272
Yorktown, and the newly completed Hornet.

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:44.317
These carriers were well-fitted
to take the offensive,

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.044
for they carried a large number

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:49.294
of effective fighters and dive bombers.

00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:56.091
The Commander in Chief of the
Central Pacific Fleet in 1942

00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:59.643
was Admiral Chester William Nimitz.

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:01.545
Within weeks of his appointment

00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:04.573
this great leader transformed
the moral of his men,

00:05:04.573 --> 00:05:06.937
infecting them all with his own confidence

00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:09.354
in a final Allied victory.

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:12.954
(airplane engine putters)

00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:15.809
Following his appointment,
Nimitz decided to mount

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:20.498
a series of raids on Japanese-held
islands in the Pacific.

00:05:20.498 --> 00:05:22.353
The main reason for these raids,

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:24.483
apart from harassing the Japanese,

00:05:24.483 --> 00:05:26.881
was to maintain the morale of his crews

00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:31.105
and give them valuable
operational experience.

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:34.096
On separate occasions, his
fleet attacked Japanese bases

00:05:34.096 --> 00:05:36.481
in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:38.593
Then in March he took his fleet

00:05:38.593 --> 00:05:42.130
to attack Wake and Marcus Islands.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.694
These strikes were by no means small,

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:46.640
and the damage inflicted on old targets

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.026
throughout the first few months
of 1942 was considerable.

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:54.526
(aircraft engine putters)

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:01.777
One nightmare of prewar
Japanese military strategists

00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:04.465
had been the possibility
of an attack by aircraft

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:09.202
from United States carriers
on Japan's own islands.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.825
Their worst fears were fulfilled when,

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:14.096
on the 18th of April 1942

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:18.263
16 United States Army B-25
Mitchells struck Tokyo.

00:06:21.518 --> 00:06:25.685
They were led by Lieutenant
Colonel James Doolittle.

00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:33.161
(aircraft engine putters)

00:06:35.933 --> 00:06:37.356
What was even more surprising

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.820
was the fact that these 12-ton aircraft,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.444
normally land-based,
took off from the decks

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:45.444
of the United States carrier Hornet.

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:49.902
(aircraft engine putters)

00:06:49.902 --> 00:06:52.460
The very heart of Tokyo was bombed.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.381
And although the damage was slight,

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.932
the effect on the Japanese
nation was enormous.

00:06:57.932 --> 00:07:00.599
(ominous music)

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.044
The horror of the Japanese people

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.318
led to the commander
of the Japanese fleet,

00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:13.006
Admiral Yamamoto, being granted permission

00:07:13.006 --> 00:07:14.589
for his grand plan.

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:18.463
A final showdown between the United States

00:07:18.463 --> 00:07:20.490
and Japanese fleets.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.206
What Yamamoto did not include
in his grand plan, however,

00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:25.631
was the fact that these plans

00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:28.656
would soon be known by his enemies.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:32.223
By the end of April, American
intelligence were able

00:07:32.223 --> 00:07:35.556
to decrypt 85% of Japanese signals.

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:38.722
This alone would give the Americans

00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:42.109
an incalculable advantage in the Pacific.

00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:43.551
Intelligence had been coming in

00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:46.350
indicating a major
offensive was being planned

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.433
in the Southwest Pacific.

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:53.168
The United States decoders
confirmed that Port Moresby

00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:55.234
was the target along
with the secondary target

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:57.951
on the Solomon Islands.

00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.407
From these two strongholds,
the Japanese could dominate,

00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:04.990
if not actually invade,
Northern Australia.

00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:09.075
The Japanese plan was to isolate Australia

00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:11.106
from the United States of America,

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:13.520
first by seizing Port Moresby

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.654
and establishing a seaplane
base at the tiny island

00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:18.904
of Tulaghi in the Solomons.

00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:22.480
Then they would take key
points in New Caledonia,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.730
the New Hebrides, and Fiji.

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:30.626
To mount this offensive,

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:33.424
the Japanese had assembled
an invasion force

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:35.682
which included a formidable striking force

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.180
of six modern destroyers,
two heavy cruisers,

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.263
and the large fleet carriers
Shokaku and Zuikaku.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.118
(waves crashing)

00:08:47.118 --> 00:08:49.868
These carriers held 133 aircraft.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.472
The main Port Moresby invasion force

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.502
was to depart from Rabaul,

00:09:01.502 --> 00:09:03.394
but the striking force was to come from

00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:05.599
Truk in the Caroline Islands,

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:09.432
about 1600 kilometers
northeast of New Guinea.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.746
The Americans acted quickly
and the hunt was on.

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:18.382
Admiral Nimitz added a
three-part naval force

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:20.080
to the Coral Sea.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.902
In tactical command of the whole force

00:09:21.902 --> 00:09:26.378
was Rear Admiral Frank J.
Fletcher on the carrier Yorktown,

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:29.343
which was to lead Task Force 17.

00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:32.010
(ominous music)

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:38.159
On the 1st of May, this force
linked up with Task Force 11

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.888
commanded by Rear Admiral
Fitch on the carrier Lexington

00:09:41.888 --> 00:09:44.995
just south of the Solomon Islands.

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:48.269
The two carriers, carrying 141 aircraft

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:52.352
were escorted by five
cruisers and 11 destroyers.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.819
This force was joined later in the day

00:09:55.819 --> 00:09:59.405
by an Australian-American force
of cruisers and destroyers

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:01.905
under Rear Admiral John Crace.

00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:07.514
(ominous music)

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:12.783
On the 3rd of May the Japanese
seized the tiny island

00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:16.283
of Tulaghi without meeting any opposition.

00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:21.302
The next day they were struck
by aircraft from the Yorktown.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.193
(aircraft engines roar)

00:10:43.482 --> 00:10:46.149
(rapid gunfire)

00:11:05.357 --> 00:11:07.516
This American strike sunk a destroyer

00:11:07.516 --> 00:11:09.722
and several minor Japanese ships

00:11:09.722 --> 00:11:13.889
that cost the Americans
the advantage of surprise.

00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:17.082
The Japanese now knew that at least

00:11:17.082 --> 00:11:20.915
one United States carrier
was in the vicinity.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:25.180
Throughout the 5th and 6th of May,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.339
the Japanese and American spotter planes

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:30.223
sought each other out, but in vain.

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:33.437
(ominous music)

00:11:33.437 --> 00:11:35.647
It was on the 7th of
May that the two enemies

00:11:35.647 --> 00:11:39.257
eventually made contact, but
both sides suffered equally

00:11:39.257 --> 00:11:41.424
from errors and accidents.

00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:46.399
Just after 0700 hours, a
Japanese search plane spotted

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.113
what he took to be an
enemy carrier and a cruiser

00:11:49.113 --> 00:11:51.196
southwest of Guadalcanal.

00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:54.620
Rear Admiral Hara, in immediate command

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.525
of the Japanese carriers
Shokaku and Zuikaku,

00:11:58.525 --> 00:12:01.439
launched a full-scale attack.

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:04.783
51 dive bombers escorted
by 18 Zero fighters

00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:07.033
took off for the offensive.

00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:10.480
The two ships spotted, however,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.983
were in fact the tanker USS Neosho

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.304
and an escorting destroyer.

00:12:16.304 --> 00:12:18.221
They were easy targets.

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:22.239
However, whilst this attack was underway,

00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:24.752
news reached Rear Admiral Hara

00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:26.702
that the real United States force

00:12:26.702 --> 00:12:29.215
had been spotted farther
away to the northwest.

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:31.037
All he could do was wait anxiously

00:12:31.037 --> 00:12:33.287
for his aircraft to return.

00:12:34.427 --> 00:12:38.211
But it wasn't only the
Japanese that made a mistake.

00:12:38.211 --> 00:12:42.297
At 0815 hours, a United
States reconnaissance plane

00:12:42.297 --> 00:12:44.750
reported seeing two Japanese carriers

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.908
and four large cruisers
just north of Misima Island

00:12:48.908 --> 00:12:51.679
near the tip of New Guinea.

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.616
Admiral Fletcher on the Yorktown,

00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:56.560
convinced that he had found
the main Japanese force,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.143
launched his full-scale attack.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.267
93 aircraft took off from the carriers

00:13:02.267 --> 00:13:04.184
Yorktown and Lexington.

00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:08.669
In fact, the reconnaissance
pilot had only spotted one

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:10.588
of the Japanese support groups,

00:13:10.588 --> 00:13:13.674
two cruisers and two destroyers.

00:13:13.674 --> 00:13:15.406
The day was saved by the sharp eyes

00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:17.552
of Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton,

00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:21.719
Commander of the Lexington's
dive bomber squadron.

00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:25.262
While on the way to
attack the support group,

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:29.294
Hamilton drifted off course to the east.

00:13:29.294 --> 00:13:33.311
He spotted a much more important force:

00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:36.176
A covering force for the
Port Moresby invasion,

00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:39.641
commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Goto

00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:41.558
from the carrier Shoho.

00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:45.136
The American planes were redirected.

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:47.359
(gunfire pops)

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.919
At first, the highly-maneuverable
Japanese carrier

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:52.381
managed to dodge the American attacks.

00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:55.935
The Shoho was eventually
overwhelmed and sunk.

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:58.512
(aircraft engine roars)

00:13:58.512 --> 00:14:01.179
(rapid gunfire)

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:04.348
Meanwhile, Fletcher had directed

00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:07.915
the Australian-American force
under Rear Admiral Crace

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:10.748
against the Port Moresby invasion.

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.719
Crace's force was attacked

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:16.811
by land-based Japanese
aircraft from Rabaul

00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:20.523
and later by United States
B-26's from Australia,

00:14:20.523 --> 00:14:22.856
mistaking them for Japanese.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.400
Luckily, neither attack was successful.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.076
Another amazing mistake on
the part of the Japanese

00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:32.764
took place on the 7th of May.

00:14:32.764 --> 00:14:34.586
27 Japanese aircraft

00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:38.753
out looking for the United
states fleet spotted Yorktown.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.715
They mistook it for a Japanese carrier

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.078
and attempted to land.

00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:46.966
10 were shot down.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:49.838
(aircraft engine roars)

00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:53.505
(loud splash and explosion)

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.670
(aircraft squeals)

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.837
(aircraft engine roars)
(rapid gunfire)

00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:06.919
(waves crashing)

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:09.078
News of the loss of Shoho and the presence

00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:12.707
of the United States Australian
force off Port Moresby

00:15:12.707 --> 00:15:15.640
persuaded the commander
of the invasion force,

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.807
Vice Admiral Inoue, to delay
the attack on Port Moresby.

00:15:21.366 --> 00:15:25.623
First he would deal with the
United States carrier fleet.

00:15:25.623 --> 00:15:27.352
(waves crashing)

00:15:27.352 --> 00:15:30.019
(ominous music)

00:15:32.547 --> 00:15:34.386
Early on the morning of the 8th,

00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:38.610
the two carrier forces
finally located each other.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.274
After the loss of Shoho,

00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:43.557
both sides now had two carriers each,

00:15:43.557 --> 00:15:46.996
but the Japanese only had
95 operational aircraft

00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:49.246
against the Americans' 118.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.942
Shortly after 0900 hours,

00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:56.285
both sides aircraft were launched

00:15:56.285 --> 00:15:59.267
and the Battle of the Coral Sea commenced.

00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:02.684
(eerie electronic music)

00:17:18.468 --> 00:17:21.801
(aircraft engine roars)

00:17:27.406 --> 00:17:30.414
The Japanese attack
inflicted significant damage

00:17:30.414 --> 00:17:33.775
on both the Yorktown and Lexington.

00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:36.305
Yorktown managed with clever maneuvering

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.861
to avoid the Japanese torpedoes,

00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:41.154
but bombs exploding in the water nearby

00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:44.942
badly damaged her below the water line.

00:17:44.942 --> 00:17:47.441
Another bomb went down through four decks,

00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:49.858
where, consequently, it exploded,

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:53.275
killing 37 of their crew and wounding 33.

00:17:54.402 --> 00:17:55.714
(aircraft engine roars)

00:17:55.714 --> 00:17:57.540
(loud gunfire)

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.305
The Lexington, bigger
and less maneuverable

00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:03.298
than the Yorktown, was
hit by two torpedoes,

00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:05.026
as well as several bombs

00:18:05.026 --> 00:18:08.276
and was listing badly on the port side.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:12.685
Meanwhile, United States pilots
were launching an assault

00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:16.909
on the Japanese carriers
Shokaku and Zuikaku.

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:17.933
(aircraft engine roars)

00:18:17.933 --> 00:18:21.534
Zuikaku, the flagship,
was hidden by a rainstorm,

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:23.586
so the full weight of the American attack

00:18:23.586 --> 00:18:26.876
fell on her sister ship, Shokaku.

00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:29.154
The few defending Zeroes
were able to force

00:18:29.154 --> 00:18:31.697
the first wave of American devastators

00:18:31.697 --> 00:18:34.176
to launch their torpedoes too far away

00:18:34.176 --> 00:18:36.322
to make any hits.

00:18:36.322 --> 00:18:38.959
But the second wave of
dauntless dive bombers

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:42.877
that followed, were much more successful.

00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:45.858
One dauntless pilot,
Lieutenant John Powers

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:49.441
had vowed to sink an
enemy carrier unaided.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.282
During the attack on Shokaku he swooped

00:18:53.282 --> 00:18:55.889
in a daring low level attack releasing his

00:18:55.889 --> 00:19:00.130
bomb a mere 19 meters
above the carriers deck.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.865
In the resulting explosion, Powers crashed

00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:05.681
to his death in the sea.

00:19:05.681 --> 00:19:07.298
But the damage to the flight deck,

00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:10.528
caused as a result of
his bomb was so severe

00:19:10.528 --> 00:19:12.627
that the carriers aircraft were no longer

00:19:12.627 --> 00:19:14.710
able to take off or land.

00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:19.966
Further bombs completed the job.

00:19:19.966 --> 00:19:23.362
Shokaku had to withdraw from the battle.

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:26.882
No longer with air cover
Inoue had to call off the

00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:30.882
whole operation and
withdraw his invasion force.

00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:34.259
The Battle of the Coral Sea was thus

00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:37.139
a strategic success for the Americans.

00:19:37.139 --> 00:19:41.444
But it was marred by a serious
and unexpected incident.

00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:44.927
Two hours after the last plane
had retired from the battle,

00:19:44.927 --> 00:19:49.087
the Lexington erupted in a huge explosion.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:50.067
(loud explosion)

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:52.883
Ironically this was nothing
to do with the attack.

00:19:52.883 --> 00:19:56.191
But was caused by a mere
spark from a generator

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:58.814
which had accidentally been left running.

00:19:58.814 --> 00:20:01.186
The fires were fed by petrol fuel

00:20:01.186 --> 00:20:03.601
and vapor from the ruptured tanks.

00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:06.323
It took until the next
day to put the fire out.

00:20:06.323 --> 00:20:08.866
But by then the damage was so severe that

00:20:08.866 --> 00:20:11.251
she had to be abandoned.

00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.084
2,735 crew were saved.

00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:17.875
But 216 had died in the fire.

00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:23.111
She was sunk by a torpedo fired
from an American destroyer.

00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:31.087
The Americans had lost
one carrier, a tanker,

00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:32.573
and a destroyer.

00:20:32.573 --> 00:20:36.127
While the Japanese lost one
carrier, and one destroyer.

00:20:36.127 --> 00:20:39.727
But only 564 United States sailors

00:20:39.727 --> 00:20:42.219
and airmen had been killed compared to

00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:44.636
Japanese losses of 1,074 men.

00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:51.428
Japan also lost 77 aircraft
compared to America's 66.

00:20:54.511 --> 00:20:57.600
The battle turned back the
Japanese threat to Port Moresby

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.100
and consequently to Australia.

00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:05.054
The Coral Sea had been
the first sea battle ever

00:21:05.054 --> 00:21:07.823
where two fleets had
engaged on the high seas

00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:10.063
without being in sight of one another

00:21:10.063 --> 00:21:14.230
and relying entirely on
aircraft to strike the enemy.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:17.548
The Americans were quick to master this

00:21:17.548 --> 00:21:20.926
new type of Naval warfare and
were ready to use it again

00:21:20.926 --> 00:21:22.259
at a later date.

00:21:23.597 --> 00:21:25.847
That date was not far away.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.888
Japan's admirals were already
planning another battle

00:21:33.888 --> 00:21:35.757
where they hoped to
cripple the United States

00:21:35.757 --> 00:21:38.340
Pacific fleet once and for all.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.406
By attacking Midway Atoll,

00:21:41.406 --> 00:21:44.559
at the far western end of the
Hawaiian chain of islands,

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.796
the Japanese hoped to
lure the United States

00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:50.713
Pacific fleet into the
open sea and destroy it.

00:21:52.606 --> 00:21:55.273
(ominous music)

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:01.176
On the 20th of May 1942

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.766
allied listening stations
around the Pacific

00:22:04.766 --> 00:22:08.030
picked up a lengthy radio signal in code

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.947
from Admiral Yamamoto to his fleet.

00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:14.417
The message was relayed
to the United States

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:18.584
Combat Intelligence Unit at
Pearl Harbor and deciphered.

00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:22.063
It was revealed that the Japanese Navy

00:22:22.063 --> 00:22:24.064
was about to mount a powerful attack

00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:27.153
on the mid-Pacific Atoll of Midway with a

00:22:27.153 --> 00:22:29.184
secondary diversionary attack

00:22:29.184 --> 00:22:31.767
on the Aleutians further north.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.025
Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians will

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:39.458
be hit on the 3rd of June
and Midway the next day.

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.338
Operation MI, the Midway strike,

00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:45.921
had all the hallmarks
of Japanese planning.

00:22:46.975 --> 00:22:48.546
It was over complex.

00:22:48.546 --> 00:22:50.530
Made unjustified assumptions about

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.697
how the enemy would react and
fail to concentrate force.

00:22:56.465 --> 00:22:59.153
Even so, the plan might well have worked

00:22:59.153 --> 00:23:03.232
had the Americans not
discovered it's secrets.

00:23:03.232 --> 00:23:05.984
The very choice of Midway was flawed.

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:08.365
One of Yamamoto's carrier
captains called it

00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:11.532
an impossible and pointless operation.

00:23:12.477 --> 00:23:14.496
But while the Japanese
leaders were debating

00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:19.168
where to strike, their minds
had been made up for them.

00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:22.139
The Doolittle Raid on
Tokyo the previous April

00:23:22.139 --> 00:23:26.127
had put their sacred emperor in danger.

00:23:26.127 --> 00:23:28.094
The mortified generals and admirals

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:31.870
knew then that every
gap in Japan's defensive

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.656
perimeter must be plugged.

00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:36.739
Yamamoto's plan was thus.

00:23:37.677 --> 00:23:40.510
While part of his fleet
were attacking Midway,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.258
the rest of the fleet would create

00:23:43.258 --> 00:23:45.967
a diversionary attack on the Aleutians.

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:49.132
If Midway fell, this would pose a serious

00:23:49.132 --> 00:23:51.087
threat to Pearl Harbor.

00:23:51.087 --> 00:23:53.421
Therefore, Admiral Nimitz would have

00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:55.754
to attempt to retake Midway.

00:23:56.975 --> 00:24:00.320
Waiting for him would be
the Japanese Pacific fleet.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.927
Supported by land base aircraft operating

00:24:02.927 --> 00:24:05.510
from the newly captured island.

00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:09.612
Yamamoto would spring the trap

00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:12.365
and achieve what had
eluded him at Pearl Harbor.

00:24:12.365 --> 00:24:16.532
The destruction of American
Naval power in the Pacific.

00:24:17.487 --> 00:24:20.243
Yamamoto believed that
following the destruction

00:24:20.243 --> 00:24:22.993
of Nimitz fleet, the
western seaboard of the

00:24:22.993 --> 00:24:24.422
United States of America

00:24:24.422 --> 00:24:27.981
would be at the mercy of the Japanese.

00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:31.374
President Roosevelt would
therefore have no alternative

00:24:31.374 --> 00:24:34.129
other than to sue for peace.

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:37.713
At least that is how the Japanese saw it.

00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:40.951
Yamamoto committed almost
the entire Japanese fleet

00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:42.726
to his plan.

00:24:42.726 --> 00:24:46.353
160 warships including
eight aircraft carriers

00:24:46.353 --> 00:24:50.389
with more than 400 carrier based aircraft.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:54.291
The force was separated
into five battle groups.

00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:55.637
At the head of the force was the

00:24:55.637 --> 00:24:57.687
first carrier striking force.

00:24:57.687 --> 00:25:01.020
With four carriers and 225 dive bombers.

00:25:02.485 --> 00:25:04.230
These were to bombard Midway

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.157
before the invasion force with 5,000 men

00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:10.566
were to be landed from 12 transport ships.

00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:13.971
The invasion force was
protected by two support groups.

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:16.804
Each 80 kilometers away.

00:25:16.804 --> 00:25:19.810
950 kilometers behind this force

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.562
would be the main Japanese battle fleet

00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:24.676
with seven battleships.

00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:27.189
These were to finish off the United States

00:25:27.189 --> 00:25:29.604
Pacific fleet after the carriers had

00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:32.437
inflicted the decisive damage.

00:25:32.437 --> 00:25:35.761
Knowing that the odds were
stacked heavily against him,

00:25:35.761 --> 00:25:38.035
Nimitz staked everything on his faith

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:40.659
and the aircraft carrier and it's ability

00:25:40.659 --> 00:25:43.654
to strike from long range.

00:25:43.654 --> 00:25:45.877
He decided that his
much slower battleships

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.531
would be a liability and ordered them

00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:52.149
to stay on the United States west coast.

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:55.942
Nimitz divided his force
into two battle groups.

00:25:55.942 --> 00:26:00.081
Taskforce 16 with the carriers
US Hornet and Enterprise.

00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:04.275
And Taskforce 17 with
the carrier Yorktown.

00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:06.942
(ominous music)

00:26:09.361 --> 00:26:10.737
On the 28th of May,

00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:13.320
Taskforce 16 left Pearl Harbor.

00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:18.714
Meanwhile Taskforce 17 had been delayed.

00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:22.933
Having just returned from
the Battle in the Coral Sea

00:26:22.933 --> 00:26:25.183
Yorktown was badly damaged.

00:26:26.035 --> 00:26:28.352
The Pearl Harbor crews told Nimitz

00:26:28.352 --> 00:26:31.731
that the repairs would take
three weeks to complete.

00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:34.097
Nimitz however asked for the Yorktown's

00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:37.097
repairs to be completed in 48 hours.

00:26:38.037 --> 00:26:41.186
Working around the clock,
the job was completed.

00:26:41.186 --> 00:26:42.837
And on the 30th of May under the command

00:26:42.837 --> 00:26:44.915
of Admiral Frank Fletcher,

00:26:44.915 --> 00:26:47.330
the Yorktown left port.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.954
Once at sea, Fletcher was to take tactical

00:26:49.954 --> 00:26:53.269
command of the United States force.

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:54.677
"You will be governed by the principle

00:26:54.677 --> 00:26:58.436
"of calculated risk" Nimitz commanded.

00:26:58.436 --> 00:27:01.333
Warned by intelligence
they were in position

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:03.283
well before the Japanese submarines

00:27:03.283 --> 00:27:06.180
had established a cordon west of Hawaii

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.263
to watch for the United States fleet.

00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:12.943
(ominous music)

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.312
Midway Island.

00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:19.846
A small outpost midway between the

00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:22.304
US state of Hawaii and Japan

00:27:22.304 --> 00:27:25.491
and the centre gate to Pearl Harbor.

00:27:25.491 --> 00:27:28.132
The island was on a state of alert.

00:27:28.132 --> 00:27:30.483
They know that somewhere beyond the clouds

00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:34.275
and the horizon lay the Japanese fleet.

00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:36.580
Intelligence had reported that the attack

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.198
on the island was due the next day.

00:27:40.198 --> 00:27:42.916
The Midway garrison had been reinforced.

00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:44.405
And during the previous night,

00:27:44.405 --> 00:27:47.655
flying fortresses had landed at Midway.

00:27:48.676 --> 00:27:52.843
By 0700 hours they were on
the runway being refueled.

00:27:54.052 --> 00:27:58.733
Bombs were loaded and their
guns were fully armed.

00:27:58.733 --> 00:28:00.721
Once the enemy had been sighted,

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.771
they would be in place and ready

00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:05.990
to mount an air raid attack on the fleet.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.109
On dawn patrol, Ensign Jack Reid,

00:28:09.109 --> 00:28:12.302
flying a Catalina flying boat from Midway

00:28:12.302 --> 00:28:14.421
was scouring the skies looking for signs

00:28:14.421 --> 00:28:16.004
of the enemy fleet.

00:28:16.913 --> 00:28:19.831
At 0900 hours he spotted
the transport ships

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:23.812
and escort cruisers of the
Japanese invasion force.

00:28:23.812 --> 00:28:27.725
A signal was relayed to
Fletcher aboard the Yorktown.

00:28:27.725 --> 00:28:30.788
This target was not his prime concern.

00:28:30.788 --> 00:28:35.076
He wanted the Japanese
carrier striking force.

00:28:35.076 --> 00:28:37.390
Instead he ordered an attack to be mounted

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.783
by the Midway based
B-17 Flying Fortresses.

00:28:41.783 --> 00:28:44.181
As the bombers lumbered
down the air strip,

00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:46.541
news came in to Fletcher that the Japanese

00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:49.766
diversionary attack was already underway.

00:28:49.766 --> 00:28:52.433
(ominous music)

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.694
(faint explosion)

00:29:18.694 --> 00:29:20.341
In the early hours of the morning,

00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:24.996
the Japanese had attacked
the Aleutian islands.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.950
Torpedo bombers and Zero Fighters

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.399
from the carrier Ryujo attacked the

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:33.566
United States base at Dutch
Harbor on Unalaska Island.

00:29:34.455 --> 00:29:36.774
They inflicted damage on the oil dumps,

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:39.524
barracks, hospital, and a church.

00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:42.955
However, inexperienced pilots from the

00:29:42.955 --> 00:29:47.337
other carrier in the
force, Junyo got lost.

00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:50.391
The American flying boats
had spotted the Japanese

00:29:50.391 --> 00:29:52.649
but they were too far away
from the United States

00:29:52.649 --> 00:29:56.816
ships or shore based aircraft
to make effective attacks.

00:29:58.281 --> 00:30:02.539
Meanwhile, Nimitz, not
deceived by this diversion,

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:05.530
refused to divert large forces north

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.689
away from Midway.

00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:10.356
(ominous music)

00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:14.810
The 4th of June

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.835
and the United States main prey,

00:30:17.835 --> 00:30:20.038
the Japanese carrier striking force

00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:24.491
under Admiral Nagumo was
zigzagging through dense fog.

00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.243
Completely oblivious to Fletcher's fleet

00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:29.160
lying in wait for them.

00:30:30.426 --> 00:30:31.735
In the early hours of the morning

00:30:31.735 --> 00:30:35.383
they reached calm and clear conditions.

00:30:35.383 --> 00:30:39.339
At 0430 hours, Nagumo
launched his first strike

00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:44.023
108 aircraft took off from
the carriers to attack Midway.

00:30:44.023 --> 00:30:45.060
(loud gunshots)

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.774
They were immediately
spotted on Midway's radar.

00:30:48.774 --> 00:30:50.987
The Zero Fighters appeared
from behind the clouds

00:30:50.987 --> 00:30:55.339
and the islands defenses
went into action immediately.

00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:58.006
(loud gunshots)

00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:03.339
Midway's fighters went
up to engage the enemy.

00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:05.922
(loud buzzing)

00:31:17.402 --> 00:31:20.841
(loud gunshots)

00:31:20.841 --> 00:31:23.591
(loud explosion)

00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:32.722
(loud gunshots)
(engines buzzing)

00:31:33.862 --> 00:31:36.695
(loud explosions)

00:31:55.968 --> 00:31:58.551
(loud gunfire)

00:32:05.483 --> 00:32:07.377
Considerable damage was inflicted on the

00:32:07.377 --> 00:32:09.708
airfield buildings and garrison.

00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:12.766
But the air strip remained intact.

00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:15.151
A few transport aircraft were damaged,

00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:17.391
but most of the fighter
and bomber aircraft

00:32:17.391 --> 00:32:21.547
were in the air and out of
the way during the attack.

00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:23.468
As the fires burned over Midway,

00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:26.237
the extent of the damage was surveyed.

00:32:26.237 --> 00:32:29.248
(crackling)

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:31.787
Nagumo was now in a quandary.

00:32:31.787 --> 00:32:33.711
His first attack had not knocked out

00:32:33.711 --> 00:32:35.499
the airfield as planned.

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:37.582
It was still operational.

00:32:38.464 --> 00:32:41.277
A second air attack was needed.

00:32:41.277 --> 00:32:43.439
He had been following Yamamoto's orders

00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:45.824
and had held back his best air crews,

00:32:45.824 --> 00:32:48.270
their planes being armed
with anti-ship weapons

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.449
in case the United
States fleet had arrived

00:32:50.449 --> 00:32:52.915
sooner than expected.

00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:56.819
Yet his search planes had
spotted no United States ships.

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:00.639
And he needed to finish the job at Midway.

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:03.777
Before he had made a decision however,

00:33:03.777 --> 00:33:07.251
the Americans had made
up his mind for him.

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.030
The bombers from Midway
had arrived overhead

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.102
and were attacking his ships.

00:33:12.102 --> 00:33:13.491
Although they did no damage,

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:17.734
they did change the course of the battle.

00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:19.684
The Japanese commander ordered his

00:33:19.684 --> 00:33:21.574
second wave torpedo bombers to be

00:33:21.574 --> 00:33:25.862
rearmed with bombs for
another attack on Midway.

00:33:25.862 --> 00:33:29.139
At 0728 hours, 15 minutes
after the commander

00:33:29.139 --> 00:33:31.716
had ordered his aircraft below,

00:33:31.716 --> 00:33:33.926
one of Nagumo's search planes spotted

00:33:33.926 --> 00:33:35.957
10 United States warships

00:33:35.957 --> 00:33:40.124
some 335 kilometers northeast
of the Japanese carriers.

00:33:41.875 --> 00:33:44.324
Ironically, this plane had taken off

00:33:44.324 --> 00:33:47.366
30 minutes late that morning.

00:33:47.366 --> 00:33:49.699
Had it taken off on time,

00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:52.644
it would have spotted the
Americans 30 minutes earlier

00:33:52.644 --> 00:33:54.769
and got the news back before the torpedo

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:57.102
bombers had been sent below.

00:33:58.089 --> 00:33:59.754
If this had been the case,

00:33:59.754 --> 00:34:01.929
Nagumo would almost have certainly sent

00:34:01.929 --> 00:34:04.605
his aircraft against
the United States fleet

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:06.730
and the course of the battle,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.017
and of the entire war in the Pacific

00:34:09.017 --> 00:34:11.600
might have been very different.

00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:16.544
As it was, Nagumo was
yet again in a quandary.

00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:20.571
Should he turn his attention
to the United States ships,

00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:22.654
or concentrate on Midway?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.394
He halted the rearming.

00:34:26.394 --> 00:34:28.090
But there was one more question for the

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.881
Japanese commander to worry about.

00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:34.631
Did the United States
force include carriers?

00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:38.094
His worst fears were realized when

00:34:38.094 --> 00:34:41.558
at 0820 hours a scout
reported that the enemy

00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:45.475
was accompanied by what
looked to be a carrier.

00:34:46.538 --> 00:34:50.334
The news could not have reached
Nagumo at a worse moment.

00:34:50.334 --> 00:34:52.674
His first wave was just arriving back

00:34:52.674 --> 00:34:53.738
from the attack on Midway

00:34:53.738 --> 00:34:55.905
and had to land to refuel.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.778
What bombers he did have available

00:34:58.778 --> 00:35:01.342
would have to fly without fighter escort

00:35:01.342 --> 00:35:05.469
and were only armed with
bombs and not torpedoes.

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:09.010
By 0918 hours, the Japanese flight decks

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.584
were full of aircraft.

00:35:10.584 --> 00:35:13.917
Some now rearmed, others being refueled.

00:35:14.754 --> 00:35:17.814
The carriers were like floating bombs.

00:35:17.814 --> 00:35:20.498
Also unbeknown to Nagumo,

00:35:20.498 --> 00:35:22.466
Fletcher had launched his aircraft

00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:25.090
and was about to attack at any moment.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.673
(loud buzzing)

00:35:40.286 --> 00:35:42.414
News that airborne Catalinas had spotted

00:35:42.414 --> 00:35:44.486
the Japanese carrier fleet had reached

00:35:44.486 --> 00:35:47.486
Fletcher that morning at 0534 hours.

00:35:49.344 --> 00:35:50.786
Fletcher had ordered the Hornet

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:53.498
and the Enterprise ahead
to attack while the

00:35:53.498 --> 00:35:57.294
Yorktown waited to retrieve
the spotter planes.

00:35:57.294 --> 00:36:00.682
At 0700 hours the Hornet
and Enterprise still

00:36:00.682 --> 00:36:02.754
a long way off from the Japanese carriers

00:36:02.754 --> 00:36:05.094
launched their aircraft.

00:36:05.094 --> 00:36:06.094
152 of them.

00:36:08.318 --> 00:36:09.816
They were aware that the Japanese were

00:36:09.816 --> 00:36:12.670
landing aircraft after
the attack on Midway.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.784
But they were taking a big gamble

00:36:14.784 --> 00:36:18.834
launching from such a
dangerous long range.

00:36:18.834 --> 00:36:21.249
Yet these men were to make probably

00:36:21.249 --> 00:36:25.646
the most decisive naval
airstrike in history.

00:36:25.646 --> 00:36:28.404
However, what these pilots didn't know

00:36:28.404 --> 00:36:31.226
was that Nagumo had changed course when he

00:36:31.226 --> 00:36:34.286
decided to reload his aircraft.

00:36:34.286 --> 00:36:36.504
As a result, the first aircraft

00:36:36.504 --> 00:36:39.802
had difficulty locating their prey.

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:42.469
(ominous music)

00:36:53.966 --> 00:36:56.906
At 0928 hours the first United States

00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:59.230
torpedo planes from the Hornet appeared

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:03.310
over the Japanese fleet
diving in to attack.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.274
The Japanese launched their Zeroes.

00:37:05.274 --> 00:37:08.185
Attempting to drive the
bombers away from the ships.

00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:10.644
And there was a fierce and
bloody fight in the skies.

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:12.446
(loud buzzing)

00:37:12.446 --> 00:37:15.196
(loud explosion)

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.677
(faint gunfire)

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.916
(loud screeching)

00:37:26.916 --> 00:37:29.499
(loud gunfire)

00:37:45.866 --> 00:37:49.462
By 0945 hours, another
wave of torpedo bombers

00:37:49.462 --> 00:37:51.158
arrived from the Enterprise.

00:37:51.158 --> 00:37:55.344
Followed by another wave
from the Yorktown at 10:15.

00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:58.177
(loud screeching)

00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:03.624
(loud gunfire)

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:09.713
The American losses were high.

00:38:09.713 --> 00:38:12.534
The Zeroes and anti-aircraft
fired from the ships

00:38:12.534 --> 00:38:14.694
were taking their toll.

00:38:14.694 --> 00:38:17.390
Only four out of the
Enterprises first wave

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.642
made it back to the carrier.

00:38:19.642 --> 00:38:23.475
The Hornet and Yorktown
crew suffered equally.

00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:45.642
(loud rumbling)

00:38:45.642 --> 00:38:47.158
Those that did make it back,

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:50.006
had the problems of
landing a battle damaged

00:38:50.006 --> 00:38:53.502
aircraft on a rolling carrier deck.

00:38:53.502 --> 00:38:55.752
This pilot wasn't so lucky.

00:38:59.186 --> 00:39:01.122
Others landed in flames.

00:39:01.122 --> 00:39:03.789
(ominous music)

00:39:26.301 --> 00:39:28.884
Amazingly, this pilot survived.

00:39:44.797 --> 00:39:46.969
Lieutenant Commander McClusky scanned the

00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:50.737
sparkling blue Pacific
northeast of Midway island.

00:39:50.737 --> 00:39:54.349
He was leading 33 dive
bombers from the Enterprise

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:55.432
and was lost.

00:39:57.305 --> 00:40:00.305
He needed to make a decision.

00:40:00.305 --> 00:40:03.905
Where he had expected to find
the enemy there was nothing.

00:40:03.905 --> 00:40:05.377
And his planes would soon have to

00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:08.209
turn back for lack of fuel.

00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:10.297
But McClusky had a hunch.

00:40:10.297 --> 00:40:14.615
He decided to continue his
search a little further west

00:40:14.615 --> 00:40:16.615
and the gamble paid off.

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:19.897
Nimitz later described this as

00:40:19.897 --> 00:40:23.795
the most important decision of the battle.

00:40:23.795 --> 00:40:26.405
A few minutes later,
McClusky spotted the wake

00:40:26.405 --> 00:40:30.109
of an enemy destroyer and followed it.

00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:34.276
Just after 1000 hours he
found the Japanese carriers.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.489
The first waves of bombers which had

00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:40.909
attacked previously had
suffered disastrously.

00:40:40.909 --> 00:40:44.405
Most of them had been
shot down by the Zeroes.

00:40:44.405 --> 00:40:46.521
But this first attack had let McClusky's

00:40:46.521 --> 00:40:49.104
dive bombers come in unnoticed.

00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:54.469
Joined by a further 17 dive
bombers from the Yorktown,

00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:58.596
McClusky could not have
arrived at a better moment.

00:40:58.596 --> 00:41:00.349
The decks of the Japanese carriers were

00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:02.913
crammed with nearly 100 aircraft

00:41:02.913 --> 00:41:04.700
as they prepared for their own strike

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.547
against the United States carriers.

00:41:07.547 --> 00:41:09.665
All of them were loaded with explosives

00:41:09.665 --> 00:41:11.825
and high octane fuel.

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:13.249
The tiniest spark would turn them

00:41:13.249 --> 00:41:15.166
into floating infernos.

00:41:24.501 --> 00:41:26.780
As the Japanese carriers
were turning into the wind

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.945
to launch their aircraft, 50 United States

00:41:29.945 --> 00:41:32.603
dive bombers were
hurdling in from the sky.

00:41:32.603 --> 00:41:35.186
(loud gunfire)

00:41:38.045 --> 00:41:40.878
(loud screeching)

00:42:11.149 --> 00:42:12.829
The first hits turned the carriers

00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:16.662
Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu
into exploding torches.

00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:21.123
One Japanese sailor later recalled

00:42:21.123 --> 00:42:23.329
"The terrifying scream of the dive bomber

00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:26.105
"reached me first,
followed by the crashing

00:42:26.105 --> 00:42:28.221
"explosion of a direct hit.

00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:30.621
"There was a blinding flash
and then a second explosion

00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:32.473
"much louder than the first."

00:42:32.473 --> 00:42:35.056
(loud gunfire)

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:43.390
(loud screeching)

00:42:45.221 --> 00:42:48.145
(loud gunfire)

00:42:48.145 --> 00:42:50.728
(loud buzzing)

00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.905
Within minutes, most of the
Japanese first air fleet

00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:38.177
had been wiped out.

00:43:38.177 --> 00:43:41.475
The 4th carrier, Hiryu was saved

00:43:41.475 --> 00:43:44.865
and tried a desperate counter attack.

00:43:44.865 --> 00:43:46.709
At 1200 hours she launched

00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:48.976
her aircraft against the Yorktown.

00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:51.559
(loud gunfire)

00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:59.704
(loud buzzing)

00:44:02.669 --> 00:44:05.252
(loud gunfire)

00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:44.177
During this stage of the battle,

00:44:44.177 --> 00:44:46.397
despite desperate maneuvering,

00:44:46.397 --> 00:44:49.517
the Yorktown took several direct hits.

00:44:49.517 --> 00:44:52.100
(loud gunfire)

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:10.217
You can see here how a large carrier

00:45:10.217 --> 00:45:12.497
with her powerful engines can turn

00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:15.585
dramatically in full rudder.

00:45:15.585 --> 00:45:18.253
Here you can see the
effects of a bomb exploding

00:45:18.253 --> 00:45:20.401
close to the Yorktown.

00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:25.201
Notice how the aircraft
bounces on the flight deck.

00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:28.049
(ominous music)

00:45:28.049 --> 00:45:29.997
The Yorktown fought hard for survival

00:45:29.997 --> 00:45:32.197
against the Japanese bombers.

00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:34.093
But it was in vain.

00:45:34.093 --> 00:45:36.760
(ominous music)

00:46:13.185 --> 00:46:16.102
(slow paced music)

00:46:22.648 --> 00:46:25.813
By 1440 hours, following
another direct hit

00:46:25.813 --> 00:46:29.293
from a torpedo, the Yorktown
was so badly crippled

00:46:29.293 --> 00:46:32.193
that Fletcher had no other alternative

00:46:32.193 --> 00:46:33.860
than to abandon her.

00:46:34.721 --> 00:46:37.093
He handed command over
to Admiral Spruance,

00:46:37.093 --> 00:46:39.260
commander of Taskforce 16.

00:46:42.057 --> 00:46:45.525
At 1700 hours, Spruance
launched his aircraft

00:46:45.525 --> 00:46:48.837
from the Hornet and Enterprise.

00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:50.004
Their mission?

00:46:50.915 --> 00:46:52.582
To attack the Hiryu.

00:46:55.317 --> 00:46:57.900
(loud buzzing)

00:47:16.015 --> 00:47:19.421
(suspenseful music)

00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:21.777
The attack took the Japanese by surprise.

00:47:21.777 --> 00:47:23.877
Once again the aircraft were on deck

00:47:23.877 --> 00:47:25.917
as they were preparing for a twilight raid

00:47:25.917 --> 00:47:28.573
on the remaining American carriers.

00:47:28.573 --> 00:47:31.073
(eerie music)

00:47:48.613 --> 00:47:51.196
(loud gunfire)

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.627
Four direct hits set her decks ablaze.

00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:21.062
The Hiryu was crippled beyond repair.

00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.316
During the night of the 4th of June,

00:48:32.316 --> 00:48:34.365
whilst the United Stated crews onboard

00:48:34.365 --> 00:48:36.595
Hornet and Enterprise prepared their

00:48:36.595 --> 00:48:39.086
aircraft for the next days battle,

00:48:39.086 --> 00:48:42.236
the Japanese carriers Soryu and Kaga

00:48:42.236 --> 00:48:44.903
sank to the bottom of the ocean.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:55.877
(ominous music)

00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:01.231
As dawn broke on the
morning of the 5th of June,

00:49:01.231 --> 00:49:04.034
news came back to the United States fleet

00:49:04.034 --> 00:49:06.872
that the Hiryu, still burning like a torch

00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:09.019
was sinking fast.

00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:10.915
Shortly afterwards, reports came back

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:13.885
that the remaining carrier, Akagi,

00:49:13.885 --> 00:49:17.383
had followed the same
fate as the other three.

00:49:17.383 --> 00:49:20.881
Four of Japan's finest carriers had gone.

00:49:20.881 --> 00:49:23.548
(ominous music)

00:49:29.131 --> 00:49:32.131
On the 6th of June,
Yamamoto gave the order

00:49:32.131 --> 00:49:34.121
for a general withdrawal.

00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:36.339
But not before United States planes

00:49:36.339 --> 00:49:38.728
attacked two of the Japanese cruisers.

00:49:38.728 --> 00:49:42.811
Sinking one of them and
badly damaging the other.

00:49:46.934 --> 00:49:51.101
(loud buzzing)
(loud gunfire)

00:50:11.928 --> 00:50:14.595
(ominous music)

00:50:25.376 --> 00:50:27.647
On the morning of the 7th of June,

00:50:27.647 --> 00:50:30.445
damage control crews boarded the Yorktown

00:50:30.445 --> 00:50:33.048
in an effort to save her.

00:50:33.048 --> 00:50:35.277
However, a short while
later she was torpedoed

00:50:35.277 --> 00:50:39.444
by a Japanese submarine
and was sent to the bottom.

00:50:40.453 --> 00:50:43.286
(loud explosions)

00:50:52.877 --> 00:50:55.265
Also on this day, the Japanese landed

00:50:55.265 --> 00:50:59.432
on the islands of Attu and
Kiska in the Aleutians.

00:51:00.281 --> 00:51:03.001
Capturing a little more
than a weather station.

00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:05.440
(loud gunfire)

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.435
These two western most
islands in the Aleutian chain

00:51:08.435 --> 00:51:10.459
were so peripheral that they were of

00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:13.019
little consequence to the Americans.

00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:15.845
In fact, so much so they took four days

00:51:15.845 --> 00:51:19.307
before the Americans actually
knew they were there.

00:51:19.307 --> 00:51:23.474
And even then, made no
immediate effort to regain them.

00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:29.771
Whilst both sides claim
the previous battle

00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:31.535
in the Coral Sea a Victory,

00:51:31.535 --> 00:51:34.655
there could be no doubt about Midway.

00:51:34.655 --> 00:51:36.912
The United States had
destroyed the Japanese

00:51:36.912 --> 00:51:40.485
main striking force of four
carriers and a heavy cruiser,

00:51:40.485 --> 00:51:44.485
322 aircraft, and almost
5,000 men and officers.

00:51:50.046 --> 00:51:51.881
The United States Pacific fleet,

00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:55.049
far from being destroyed
as Yamamoto had promised,

00:51:55.049 --> 00:51:57.632
had won the remarkable victory.

00:51:59.088 --> 00:52:02.454
And what's more, as often
happens in military history,

00:52:02.454 --> 00:52:04.601
they won a victory against an enemy

00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:07.351
far superior in terms of numbers.

00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.346
Whilst the Japanese effort was compromised

00:52:11.346 --> 00:52:14.859
by poor strategy, tactical
error, and misfortune,

00:52:14.859 --> 00:52:18.408
the Americans were aided
by excellent intelligence,

00:52:18.408 --> 00:52:21.959
naval air organization, tactical command,

00:52:21.959 --> 00:52:25.959
and most important of
all, a great deal of luck.

00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:34.002
Despite the loss of one
carrier, 137 aircraft,

00:52:34.002 --> 00:52:36.923
and 307 men, the Americans had

00:52:36.923 --> 00:52:40.863
turned the tide of war in the Pacific.

00:52:40.863 --> 00:52:42.841
No longer would Japan be in position

00:52:42.841 --> 00:52:45.798
to risk a major fleet versus fleet action

00:52:45.798 --> 00:52:48.298
and were now on the defensive.

00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:53.137
By the time Japan had rebuilt it's fleet,

00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:55.931
American power had become fully mobilized

00:52:55.931 --> 00:52:58.241
into the unstoppable might

00:52:58.241 --> 00:53:01.277
that Yamamoto had so feared.

00:53:01.277 --> 00:53:04.027
(dramatic music)

00:53:07.776 --> 00:53:10.359
(upbeat music)
