MUSLIM IMMIGRANT FROM KENYA AND 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.842
HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WOULD ONE 

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.276
DAY LEAD TO HER BEING FIRST LADY

HOW -- 

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:13.970
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CRY.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.373
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU SEE HOW MUCH WE 

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:16.640
MISS YOU?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.676
I MEAN, WE REALLY -- WHERE DID 

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:22.095
YOU GO?

00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:22.429
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:23.997
WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN 

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:24.497
ANOTHER HOUSE.

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.165
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:30.704
WE NEED YOU BACK IN THE OLD 

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:30.904
HOUSE.

00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:31.538
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE 

00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:31.872
LIVING THERE.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:32.505
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: HOW IS UNEMPLOYMENT 

00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:32.706
GOING?

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:33.173
ARE YOU EMBRACING IT?

00:01:33.173 --> 00:01:34.207
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S GOING OKAY AND I 

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:35.976
WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:36.810
WE'VE BEEN DOING, BUT 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.597
TRUTHFULLY, WE'RE BORING.

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:40.864
YOU KNOW?

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.732
WE HAVE A TEENAGER AT HOME, AND 

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:45.268
SHE MAKES US FEEL INADEQUATE 

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:45.835
EVERY DAY.

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.438
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: NICE.

00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:50.240
&gt;&gt; SO, OUR SELF-ESTEEM IS LOW.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.675
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: CAN I TELL YOU HOW WE 

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:51.875
FEEL?

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.410
WE FEEL LIKE -- DO YOU REMEMBER 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.396
THE FIRST SUPERMAN MOVIE, 

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:57.063
CHRISTOPHER REEVE, WHEN HE GAVE 

00:01:57.063 --> 00:01:58.899
UP HIS POWERS TO SAVE LOIS 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.167
LANE'S LIFE AND THEN HE WAS 

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:04.037
POWERLESS AND THEN HE GOT BEAT 

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:05.639
UP IN A DINER AND HE HAD TO GET 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:07.574
HIS POWERS BACK TO COME SAVE US 

00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:09.342
FROM LEX LUTHOR.

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:10.010
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU AND

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.343
YOUR HUSBAND.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.101
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S THIS THING 

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:19.002
CALLED THE CONSTITUTION.

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:19.669
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: WE'VE DISPENSED WITH 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.204
THAT ALREADY, HAVEN'T WE?

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:22.572
WHAT IS HE DOING RIGHT NOW?

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:23.907
LIKE, RIGHT NOW, WHAT IS HE 

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:24.107
DOING?

00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:25.542
&gt;&gt; MY HUSBAND?

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:25.875
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YES.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.828
&gt;&gt; OH, HE'S PROBABLY IN HIS HOLE

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.196
IN OUR NEW HOUSE.

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:31.898
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IN HIS OFFICE?

00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:32.632
&gt;&gt; WRITING.

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:35.068
HE'S WORKING ON HIS BOOK.

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:35.669
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: WHEN I WAS READING 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.237
ABOUT YOU MENTIONING IN YOUR 

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:38.538
BOOK THAT HIS OFFICE IS MESSY 

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:40.173
AND DISORGANIZED, IT GAVE ME 

00:02:40.173 --> 00:02:41.908
LICENSE TO HAVE A MESSY AND 

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:43.310
DISORGANIZED OFFICE BECAUSE MY 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.843
WIFE -- 

00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:45.161
&gt;&gt; WAS IT LIKE THAT BEFORE?

00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:47.130
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT'S A DISASTER BUT 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.698
NOW I FEEL LIKE, THE PRESIDENT 

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:49.299
DOES THAT TOO.

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:49.833
&gt;&gt; GOOD.

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.067
CLEAN UP YOUR OFFICE.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:52.302
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IT SEEMS TO ME -- 

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:53.370
&gt;&gt; IT'S ANNOYING.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.704
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: ARE YOU SENDING A 

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:54.938
MESSAGE?

00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:56.373
&gt;&gt; I'M HERE FOR MOLLY.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:56.940
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: TO YOUR HUSBAND 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.240
THROUGH ME?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.976
&gt;&gt; NO, GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER.

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.478
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: I WISH I COULD.

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:02.095
I REALLY DO.

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:05.999
IT APPEARS BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.233
THAT YOU ARE REALLY FOLLOWING 

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:08.401
BEYONCE AROUND THE COUNTRY, 

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:11.304
GOING TO HER CONCERTS.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:11.805
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:12.572
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS THAT WHAT'S 

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:13.974
HAPPENING NOW?

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.475
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN EXCELLENT ACTIVITY.

00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:16.776
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: BESIDES YOUR HUSBAND 

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:17.577
AND DAUGHTERS, WITH WHICH 

00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:19.229
CELEBRITY DO YOU TEXT MOST 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.598
OFTEN?

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:23.099
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.000
YOU KNOW, THERE'S -- I'M NOT 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.136
GOING TO TELL YOU, BECAUSE THEN,

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:28.672
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T 

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:29.973
TEXT AND TELL.

00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:31.341
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S NOT A THING.

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:31.975
THAT'S NOT -- YOU JUST MADE THAT

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:35.795
UP.

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.464
&gt;&gt; I HAD DEPENDS ON WHAT'S GOING

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.899
ON, LATELY, BECAUSE OPRAH KICKED

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.901
OFF THE BOOK TOUR, AND SHE WAS 

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:42.669
AN EARLY READER.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.771
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF 

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:45.205
TEXTING.

00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:47.240
GAIL IS A WORRIER, SO A LOT OF 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.576
TIMES SHE'LL CALL, LIKE, WHAT 

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:49.809
THE -- 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:50.643
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: OH REALLY?

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:51.378
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:51.378 --> 00:03:53.029
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: OPRAH AND GAIL.

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:53.930
THAT'S PRETTY SOLID.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.169
&gt;&gt; THOSE TWO.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:03:59.769
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU SAID BARACK IS 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.370
WORKING ON HIS BOOK RIGHT NOW.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.937
DID YOU GUYS EVER HAVE A 

00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:01.604
SITUATION WHERE YOU FIGHT OVER 

00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:02.472
AN ANECDOTE?

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:04.107
LIKE I WANTED THAT FOR MY BOOK.

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:05.508
&gt;&gt; SINCE MY BOOK WAS FIRST, HE 

00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:06.743
LOST ON ALL THAT.

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:08.495
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU GET FIRST DIBS ON 

00:04:08.495 --> 00:04:09.229
ALL THAT.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.697
&gt;&gt; ON ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:11.564
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND WOULD IT CAUSE A 

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:13.433
RIFT IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP IF 

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:15.335
OPRAH DOESN'T PUT HIS BOOK IN 

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:16.836
HER BOOK CLUB?

00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:17.971
BECAUSE SHE DID IT WITH YOURS.

00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:19.539
&gt;&gt; IT MIGHT HURT HIS FEELINGS 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.641
BUT HE'LL GET OVER IT.

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.176
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THE BOOK IS NUMBER ONE

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:23.443
ON AMAZON.

00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:24.277
THAT'S GOT TO BE AN EXCITING 

00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:24.611
THING FOR YOU.

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:27.297
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CRAZY.

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:29.299
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: BY A LOT, I WOULD 

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:29.532
IMAGINE.

00:04:29.532 --> 00:04:31.401
WAS IT FUN TO WRITE THE BOOK?

00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:34.037
&gt;&gt; IT WAS MORE FUN THAN I 

00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:34.270
THOUGHT.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.139
BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.309
RARELY DOES ANYBODY GET TIME, 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.895
AND THEY GET PAID TO REFLECT.

00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:42.729
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S TRUE.

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.330
&gt;&gt; AND REFLECTING, I FIND, IS 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.500
VERY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THE 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.102
TRUTH IS, FOR THE LAST DECADE, 

00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:49.969
THERE WAS NO TIME TO EVEN REALLY

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:50.603
THINK ABOUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED 

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:54.174
TO US.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:55.308
YOU KNOW, I WRITE ABOUT THE FACT

00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:56.810
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE WEEK WOULD 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.944
START, SOMETHING AMAZING WOULD 

00:04:57.944 --> 00:04:59.996
HAPPEN, AND THEN BY THE END OF 

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:00.930
THE WEEK, I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.931
ALL ABOUT THAT OTHER AMAZING 

00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:02.132
THING.

00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:05.835
I MEAN, OUR DAYS WERE FULL.

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:07.403
WE WERE JUST INUNDATED.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:11.040
SO, COMING OUT OF THE WHITE 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.742
HOUSE, YOU NEEDED THAT TIME TO 

00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:13.943
TAKE STOCK AND SAY, WHAT JUST 

00:05:13.943 --> 00:05:14.477
HAPPENED?

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:15.495
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:16.896
AND THIS BOOK ALLOWED ME TO DO 

00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:19.432
THAT AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND 

00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:22.235
WHAT THOSE EIGHT YEARS MEANT TO 

00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:23.603
ME, PERSONALLY, AND HOW IT FIT 

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:24.904
INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE REST OF 

00:05:24.904 --> 00:05:25.605
MY LIFE.

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:27.707
SO, THAT WAS SOMETHING I NEEDED.

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:28.308
IT WAS THERAPEUTIC FOR ME.

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:29.876
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND SUCH A BIG PART OF

00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:31.511
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR DAUGHTERS 

00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.496
BEING SO YOUNG WHEN -- HOW OLD 

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.131
WERE YOUR DAUGHTERS ON THE DAY 

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:36.299
YOU STARTED LIVING IN THE WHITE 

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:36.499
HOUSE?

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:37.801
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE 7 AND 10, AND I 

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:40.436
HOPE I GET THAT RIGHT, BECAUSE 

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:40.904
THAT'S -- 

00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:42.238
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH.

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:43.840
&gt;&gt; BUT THEY LIVED IN THE WHITE 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.175
HOUSE LONGER THAN THEY LIVED IN 

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:47.076
ANY HOUSE THAT WE LIVED IN.

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:48.461
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOUR MOM MOVED IN, 

00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:49.295
LIVED THERE THE WHOLE EIGHT 

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:50.864
YEARS WITH YOU.

00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:52.832
&gt;&gt; RELUCTANTLY, BUT SHE STAYED.

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:53.833
SHE TRIED TO GET OUT.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.602
IT'S LIKE, NOPE, LOCK THE DOORS.

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:56.636
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND WHAT YEAR DID SHE 

00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:58.071
TRY TO GET OUT?

00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.838
HOW FAR IN?

00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:00.006
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SHE FELT LIKE BY 

00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.174
THE TIME SHE WASN'T TAKING THE 

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:03.042
GIRLS TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY, THEY 

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:05.795
WERE BOTH IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, SHE 

00:06:05.795 --> 00:06:08.598
THOUGHT, I CAN GO, RIGHT?

00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:10.099
AND I WAS LIKE, NO, NOT YET.

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.968
SO WE LET HER GO HOME IN THE 

00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:12.202
SUMMER.

00:06:12.202 --> 00:06:13.703
IT'S LIKE, YOU CAN HAVE A SUMMER

00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:15.572
BREAK BUT YOU GOT TO COME BACK 

00:06:15.572 --> 00:06:16.773
AND I WOULD CALL HER, LIKE, 

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:18.741
YOU'RE COMING BACK, RIGHT?

00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.761
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IF AND WHEN SASHA OR 

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:22.595
MALIA BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE 

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:22.962
UNITED STATES.

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:24.731
&gt;&gt; OH, GOSH, THAT WILL NEVER 

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:24.964
HAPPEN.

00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:27.167
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: DON'T SAY THAT.

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:27.534
DON'T SAY NEVER.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:30.770
&gt;&gt; I CAN SAY NEVER WITH THOSE 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.937
TWO.

00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:32.005
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU WOULD NOT MOVE IN 

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:33.072
WITH THEM OR WOULD YOU MOVE IN 

00:06:33.072 --> 00:06:34.407
WITH THEM TO HELP THEM?

00:06:34.407 --> 00:06:35.074
&gt;&gt; I WOULD.

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:35.975
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU HAVE TO NOW.

00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:37.277
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF THEY HAD KIDS.

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:38.895
I MEAN, THAT'S THE ONLY -- MY 

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:39.863
MOTHER WASN'T HELPING ME.

00:06:39.863 --> 00:06:41.397
SHE WAS HELPING HER 

00:06:41.397 --> 00:06:41.731
GRANDCHILDREN.

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:42.165
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: GOT YOU.

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:42.966
I UNDERSTAND.

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:45.435
&gt;&gt; I WOULD, BECAUSE THEY WOULD 

00:06:45.435 --> 00:06:45.768
NEED THE HELP.

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:46.569
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: DID THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.704
DOG KNOW HE WAS THE WHITE HOUSE 

00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:47.871
DOG?

00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:50.440
&gt;&gt; HE ACTED LIKE HE DID.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.508
HE'S AN ODD -- HE'S AN ODD DOG, 

00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:54.844
BECAUSE -- AND BARACK, YOU KNOW,

00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:57.764
HE CRITICIZES BO A LITTLE BIT 

00:06:57.764 --> 00:06:58.731
BECAUSE HE IS ODD.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:01.100
HE HAS AN ALOOFNESS TO HIM.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.970
IT'S ALMOST SORT OF LIKE, DON'T 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.104
TOUCH ME.

00:07:05.104 --> 00:07:06.806
I AM A BO.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.308
DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

00:07:08.308 --> 00:07:09.142
HE WOULD PRANCE AROUND THE WHITE

00:07:09.142 --> 00:07:09.342
HOUSE.

00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:10.243
HE HAD A SCHEDULE.

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:11.177
BOTH THE DOGS DID.

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:12.395
THEY WOULD GET PICKED UP.

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:13.129
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AN OFFICIAL SCHEDULE?

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.865
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I WOULD DO BRIEFING 

00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:17.267
REQUESTS FOR THEM.

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:18.434
THEY HAD TO GET MY PERMISSION, 

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:19.736
BUT I WOULD FIND, YOU KNOW, IN 

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:21.704
MY BRIEFING BOOK, IT WOULD BE, 

00:07:21.704 --> 00:07:23.740
CAN BO AND SONNY STOP BY THIS 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.141
PRESS EVENT AT 2:30.

00:07:25.141 --> 00:07:27.977
THERE WOULD BE A TIME.

00:07:27.977 --> 00:07:29.762
AND I HAD TO APPROVE OF IT.

00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:31.197
SO THEY'D GET PICKED UP AND 

00:07:31.197 --> 00:07:36.936
THEY'D HANG OUT WITH THE 

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:37.670
GARDENERS FOR THE DAY AND WHEN 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.239
THEY WERE AT HOME, THEY WERE 

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:41.808
MOMMY'S DOGS, BUT IF THEY WERE 

00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:42.742
WORKING WITH THE FELLAS, THEY 

00:07:42.742 --> 00:07:45.695
WOULD IGNORE ME.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:46.062
DON'T TOUCH ME.

00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:46.996
I'M AT WORK.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:47.263
I'M BUSY.

00:07:47.263 --> 00:07:49.699
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: ONE OF THE MOST 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:50.300
INTERESTING THINGS I LEARNED 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.502
FROM YOUR BOOK IS THAT THE 

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:53.503
PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY, 

00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:54.604
FAMILY, YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR

00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:57.006
FOOD WHILE YOU'RE IN THE WHITE 

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:57.206
HOUSE.

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:57.440
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.707
GO FIGURE.

00:07:57.707 --> 00:07:58.374
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THAT'S CRAZY TO ME.

00:07:58.374 --> 00:08:00.543
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT IS AND IT ISN'T.

00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:02.061
IT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IT 

00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:02.929
AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT 

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.330
IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE WHITE 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.964
HOUSE.

00:08:04.964 --> 00:08:07.333
ONLY 45 FAMILIES HAVE DONE IT.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.168
BUT TRUTH -- RENT IS FREE, STAFF

00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:11.237
IS FREE, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T 

00:08:11.237 --> 00:08:15.375
BE MOOCHING OFF OF THE 

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:15.642
TAXPAYERS.

00:08:15.642 --> 00:08:16.242
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH 

00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:16.442
THAT?

00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:17.043
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IT'S A LITTLE 

00:08:17.043 --> 00:08:17.810
SHOCKING BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY 

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.962
TELLS YOU THIS STUFF AND THEN 

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:20.763
THEY LET YOU GET WHATEVER YOU 

00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:22.498
WANT, LIKE, IF YOU SAY YOU WANT 

00:08:22.498 --> 00:08:23.599
SOME EXOTIC FRUIT, YES, MA'AM, 

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.834
WE'LL GET THAT RIGHT AWAY, AND 

00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:27.070
THEN YOU GET THE BILL FOR A 

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.373
PEACH AND IT'S LIKE, THAT WAS A 

00:08:30.373 --> 00:08:31.140
$500 PEACH.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.507
YOU KNOW?

00:08:31.507 --> 00:08:34.210
I WOULD TELL BARACK, BARACK, DO 

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.329
NOT EXPRESS PLEASURE FOR 

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:37.697
ANYTHING UNTIL -- UNLESS I KNOW 

00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:38.097
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:40.300
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: WOW.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.169
&gt;&gt; SO, THEY'RE VERY RESPONSIVE 

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.638
AT YOUR EXPENSE.

00:08:45.638 --> 00:08:46.339
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH.

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:47.774
&gt;&gt; BUT I -- IN ALL FAIRNESS, 

00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:48.975
IT'S LIKE THE TAXPAYERS 

00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:50.576
SHOULDN'T -- IF WE WANT A 

00:08:50.576 --> 00:08:53.162
CERTAIN KIND OF JAM OR JELLY, WE

00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:53.863
SHOULD PAY FOR THAT.

00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:56.699
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE 

00:08:56.699 --> 00:08:59.002
GOING SMUCKERS, IT SHOULD BE 

00:08:59.002 --> 00:09:00.670
FREE.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.771
WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO OTHER 

00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:02.505
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT ARE IN 

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:03.139
THIS BOOK.

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:05.408
THE BOOK IS CALLED "BECOMING."

00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:06.409
MICHELLE OBAMA IS HERE WITH US.

00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:09.178
MICHELLE OBAMA IS HERE.

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:10.713
CLETO, I DO WANT TO SAY, 

00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:12.448
MRS. OBAMA GAVE YOU GUYS A VERY 

00:09:12.448 --> 00:09:13.016
NICE COMPLIMENT DURING THE 

00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:16.686
BREAK.

00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:18.721
AND YOU MENTIONED IN THE BOOK 

00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.557
THE FIRST ALBUM YOU EVER BOUGHT 

00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:23.226
WAS STEVIE WONDER.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:25.845
&gt;&gt; MY GRANDFATHER, SOUTH SIDE.

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:27.213
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: SOUTH SIDE OR WAS IT 

00:09:27.213 --> 00:09:27.580
EAST SIDE?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.117
&gt;&gt; HE WAS -- IT WAS WEST SIDE.

00:09:31.117 --> 00:09:33.586
ME AND MY BROTHER DISTINGUISHED 

00:09:33.586 --> 00:09:34.620
BETWEEN MY MATERNAL GRANDFATHER 

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.089
AND MY PATERNAL GRANDFATHER.

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:37.457
ONE LIVED ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND 

00:09:37.457 --> 00:09:38.691
ONE LIVED ON THE WEST SIDE AND 

00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:40.309
HE WAS WEST SIDE UNTIL HE MOVED 

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:40.910
TO THE SOUTH SIDE AND BECAME 

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.011
SOUTH SIDE.

00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:49.552
YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT.

00:09:49.552 --> 00:09:51.521
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IF YOU WANTED TO GET 

00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:53.222
SOMEONE IN YOUR HUSBAND'S 

00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:58.544
ADMINISTRATION FIRED, HOW WOULD 

00:09:58.544 --> 00:09:58.778
YOU -- 

00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:00.346
&gt;&gt; WHY -- WHY DO YOU ASK?

00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:00.947
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: JUST CURIOUS.

00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:01.948
JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S 

00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:03.182
SOMEBODY THAT RUBBED YOU THE 

00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:05.718
WRONG WAY, WOULD YOU SEND THEM A

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:07.186
LETTER?

00:10:07.186 --> 00:10:08.588
&gt;&gt; WE HAD WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN 

00:10:08.588 --> 00:10:09.355
OUR ADMINISTRATION.

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:10.356
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND YOU NEVER HAD A 

00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:11.457
SITUATION LIKE THAT.

00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:12.592
&gt;&gt; NOT ONCE.

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.459
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: NOT EVEN ONCE.

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:16.379
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A 

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:16.612
SECOND.

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:18.481
BUT WE PLAY A GAME ALMOST EVERY 

00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:20.149
DAY HERE AT OUR SHOW, AND THEN 

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:22.218
MY WIFE AND I PLAY IT AT HOME.

00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:23.352
THE GAME IS -- DOESN'T REALLY 

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:25.888
HAVE A TITLE, BUT IT'S BASICALLY

00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:27.757
CALLED, WHAT IF OBAMA HAD DONE 

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:28.057
THIS?

00:10:28.057 --> 00:10:30.743
&gt;&gt; OH, GOD, WE PLAY THAT AT HOME

00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:30.910
TOO.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.880
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU DO?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.380
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:34.981
THAT WAS REALLY MY QUESTION.

00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:36.949
DO YOU PLAY THAT ONE AT HOME?

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:37.683
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:10:37.683 --> 00:10:38.885
QUITE OFTEN.

00:10:38.885 --> 00:10:39.886
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: I KNOW YOU'VE SAID 

00:10:39.886 --> 00:10:42.321
REPEATEDLY YOU WILL NOT RUN FOR 

00:10:42.321 --> 00:10:44.624
OFFICE, BUT HAS ANYONE EVER 

00:10:44.624 --> 00:10:45.324
REALLY, LIKE SERIOUSLY 

00:10:45.324 --> 00:10:46.793
APPROACHED YOU AND TRIED TO 

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:48.811
CONVINCE YOU TO RUN FOR OFFICE?

00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:50.146
&gt;&gt; ALL THE TIME.

00:10:50.146 --> 00:10:53.883
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: LIKE, I MEAN -- I'M 

00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:55.585
SURE -- I'M TALKING ABOUT, LIKE,

00:10:55.585 --> 00:10:58.287
THE HEAD OF THE COMMITTEE OR 

00:10:58.287 --> 00:10:59.288
BARACK OR HILLARY OR SOMEBODY 

00:10:59.288 --> 00:10:59.655
LIKE THAT.

00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:01.457
&gt;&gt; NO, BARACK KEEPS THOSE PEOPLE

00:11:01.457 --> 00:11:01.924
AWAY FROM ME.

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:02.792
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: HE DOES.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.210
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.478
NO, I'VE NEVER HAD ANY SERIOUS 

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:06.612
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYONE ABOUT 

00:11:06.612 --> 00:11:07.447
IT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING 

00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:10.216
THAT I'M INTERESTED IN.

00:11:10.216 --> 00:11:10.616
OR WOULD EVER DO.

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:10.817
EVER.

00:11:10.817 --> 00:11:13.252
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YOU SAID SOMETHING 

00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:14.320
VERY INTERESTING, I THOUGHT, 

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.455
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND IN YOUR BOOK 

00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:17.123
IS THAT ON HIGH-PRESSURE DAYS, 

00:11:17.123 --> 00:11:20.877
HE WOULD BE AT HIS MOST RELAXED 

00:11:20.877 --> 00:11:21.611
AND HE WOULD BE THE FRIENDLIEST 

00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:22.545
ON THOSE DAYS.

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.279
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.615
&gt;&gt; ON HIS BUSIEST DAYS.

00:11:25.615 --> 00:11:26.215
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH.

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.017
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT -- THAT'S WHAT 

00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:29.719
FUELS HIM.

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:31.554
HE'S A GRINDER, YOU KNOW?

00:11:31.554 --> 00:11:35.691
I THINK -- AND YOU KNOW, I THINK

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:37.910
HE FEELS MOST FULFILLED WHEN 

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.512
HE'S FULL, WHEN HIS PLATE IS 

00:11:39.512 --> 00:11:40.313
FULL.

00:11:40.313 --> 00:11:41.981
I CALL HIM A PLATE SPINNER, YOU 

00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:43.649
KNOW, THOSE JUGGLERS THAT KEEP 

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:45.585
SPINNING THOSE PLATES AND IF ONE

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:48.187
IS STARTING TO WOBBLE, HE SPINS 

00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:50.156
IT AND IF EVERYTHING'S GOING 

00:11:50.156 --> 00:11:51.357
OKAY THEN HE'LL PUT ANOTHER 

00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:51.858
PLATE UP.

00:11:51.858 --> 00:11:54.677
I THINK HE GET HIS ENERGY -- 

00:11:54.677 --> 00:11:56.245
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IS HE DOING THAT AT 

00:11:56.245 --> 00:11:57.413
HOME NOW, LIKE LITERALLY WITH 

00:11:57.413 --> 00:11:59.682
THE CHINA?

00:11:59.682 --> 00:11:59.882
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:11:59.882 --> 00:12:01.551
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: HE IS NOT DOING THAT 

00:12:01.551 --> 00:12:01.784
AT HOME.

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:02.852
DO YOU HAVE A SECRET, LIKE, 

00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:04.453
INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK OR PAGE 

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:05.321
LIKE THAT?

00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:07.123
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF I TOLD YOU, IT 

00:12:07.123 --> 00:12:11.711
WOULDN'T BE A SECRET.

00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.412
NO, I DON'T.

00:12:13.412 --> 00:12:14.046
I MEAN, I'M BARELY GOOD AT THAT 

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:14.380
STUFF ANYWAY.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.952
I MEAN, I HAVE AN INSTAGRAM 

00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:20.586
ACCOUNT AND A TWITTER ACCOUNT, 

00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:21.087
OBV

00:12:21.087 --> 00:12:21.721
OBVIOUSLY, BUT YOU KNOW, I HAVE 

00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:22.421
TO GET PERMISSION TO USE IT FROM

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:22.688
MY STAFF.

00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:23.155
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: I SEE.

00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:25.591
&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T TRUST ME WITH IT.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.043
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: SPEAKING OF 

00:12:27.043 --> 00:12:27.910
PERMISSION, IN THE BOOK, YOU 

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.212
TALKED ABOUT THREE KIDS.

00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:34.884
ONE OF THEM WAS A GIRL NAMED 

00:12:34.884 --> 00:12:35.518
DIDI WHO YOU FOUGHT, SHE WAS A 

00:12:35.518 --> 00:12:36.319
BULLY AND YOU FOUGHT HER.

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.453
&gt;&gt; MY FIRST FIGHT.

00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:38.988
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THEN THERE WAS A 

00:12:38.988 --> 00:12:40.556
BOYFRIEND YOU SMOKED POT WITH 

00:12:40.556 --> 00:12:43.092
AND THEN THERE WAS A BOYFRIEND 

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:43.709
THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH BECAUSE 

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:45.011
HIS GOAL, HIS CAREER GOAL, WAS 

00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:47.246
TO BECOME A MASCOT FOR, LIKE, 

00:12:47.246 --> 00:12:49.649
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS OR 

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:49.916
SOMETHING.

00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:51.284
RIGHT?

00:12:51.284 --> 00:12:51.817
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:54.320
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: NOW, DO YOU CALL THOSE

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.288
PEOPLE BEFOREHAND OR REACH OUT 

00:12:55.288 --> 00:12:57.323
TO THEM IN SOME WAY TO GO, GUESS

00:12:57.323 --> 00:12:57.557
WHAT?

00:12:57.557 --> 00:12:59.025
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:01.010
NO, I DID -- AND I DIDN'T USE 

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.478
LAST NAMES FOR THAT REASON, 

00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:04.046
ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE WILL KNOW 

00:13:04.046 --> 00:13:05.014
WHO THEY ARE.

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:05.681
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: YEAH, RIGHT.

00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.985
&gt;&gt; SO IT'S UP TO THEM TO OUT 

00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:09.518
THEMSELVES.

00:13:09.518 --> 00:13:11.621
BUT I DID GIVE BOOKS TO -- SEND 

00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:12.655
BOOKS TO EVERYBODY WITH KIND OF 

00:13:12.655 --> 00:13:14.991
A NICE NOTE LIKE, THANK YOU FOR 

00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:17.310
HELPING ME BECOME.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.510
OKAY.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.945
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: DID DIDI GET A BOOK?

00:13:18.945 --> 00:13:19.946
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:13:19.946 --> 00:13:21.380
WE'RE TRYING TO TRACK EVERYBODY 

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.181
DOWN, SO -- BECAUSE THESE ARE 

00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:24.283
PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW, THIS WAS IN 

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:24.550
CHILDHOOD.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.318
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN YESTERDAY.

00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:28.087
I WASN'T FIGHTING IN THE 

00:13:28.087 --> 00:13:28.354
BACKYARD.

00:13:28.354 --> 00:13:29.255
IT WAS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID 

00:13:29.255 --> 00:13:30.923
SO IT TAKES A SECOND TO FIND 

00:13:30.923 --> 00:13:31.190
EVERYBODY.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.792
SO I'M NOT SURE IF EVERYBODY'S 

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.243
GOTTEN A BOOK, BUT WE TRIED TO 

00:13:34.243 --> 00:13:35.278
GET EVERYBODY A BOOK.

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:35.945
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: GOT YOU.

00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:38.614
&gt;&gt; AND THEN IF THEY CALL AND 

00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:39.382
THEY WANT TO FIGHT AGAIN BECAUSE

00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:39.715
OF -- 

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:42.518
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THEN PAY PER VIEW.

00:13:42.518 --> 00:13:43.686
YOU HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN 

00:13:43.686 --> 00:13:44.220
YOU'RE A FIRST LADY.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.221
I SPOKE TO YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT 

00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:48.157
THIS ALSO, BECAUSE HE JOKES 

00:13:48.157 --> 00:13:49.458
AROUND A LOT, BUT THEN YOU 

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:52.278
REALIZE, LIKE, OH, I HAVE TO 

00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:53.713
MAYBE REEL IT IN BECAUSE OF THE 

00:13:53.713 --> 00:13:54.246
POSITION I HAVE.

00:13:54.246 --> 00:13:55.681
BUT YOU'RE NOT FIRST LADY 

00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:55.915
ANYMORE.

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:56.716
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT.

00:13:56.716 --> 00:13:58.951
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND AS FAR AS I'M 

00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:00.620
CONCERNED, YOU CAN CUT LOOSE AND

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.989
REALLY SAY ANYTHING NOW, RIGHT?

00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:03.456
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:05.491
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS 

00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:08.177
I'VE GOT A SERIES OF CARDS HERE.

00:14:08.177 --> 00:14:09.045
&gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:10.479
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: I'VE WRITTEN SOME 

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:12.048
THINGS DOWN AND IF YOU ARE -- 

00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.582
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE WRITTEN SOME STUFF 

00:14:13.582 --> 00:14:13.816
DOWN.

00:14:13.816 --> 00:14:17.386
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: IF YOU'RE GAME FOR 

00:14:17.386 --> 00:14:18.721
THIS, MAYBE HERE ARE SOME THINGS

00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:19.155
THAT YOU CAN SAY.

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:20.956
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AT THOSE 

00:14:20.956 --> 00:14:21.957
CARDS AND JUST READ -- 

00:14:21.957 --> 00:14:23.809
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: DON'T LOOK AT THEM.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:24.710
JUST READ WHAT I WROTE.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.411
START WITH THAT ONE.

00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:28.080
AND LOOK AT THE CAMERA RIGHT 

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.452
THERE SO WE FEEL -- LOOK AT THAT

00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:33.619
ONE.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:33.819
SORRY.

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:34.120
YEAH.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.189
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER EATEN A VEGETABLE.

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:38.924
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: I KNEW IT.

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:40.359
I KNEW IT.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:41.043
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:44.447
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:14:44.447 --> 00:14:45.614
THE WHOLE EIGHT YEARS WE WERE IN

00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:48.317
THE WHITE HOUSE, WE USED LAURA 

00:14:48.317 --> 00:14:50.920
BUSH'S NETFLIX PASSWORD.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.855
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: REALLY?

00:14:52.855 --> 00:14:53.022
WOW.

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:54.924
A REVELATION.

00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:58.144
&gt;&gt; LAURA, SORRY.

00:14:58.144 --> 00:14:59.445
SEND ME THE BILLS.

00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:01.914
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: THERE YOU GO.

00:15:01.914 --> 00:15:04.083
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE'S 

00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:10.256
SASHA AND WHICH ONE'S MALIA.

00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:13.292
YOU KNOW, THEY AGREE.

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:15.177
THEY GET SO MAD EVERY TIME I 

00:15:15.177 --> 00:15:15.911
MESS THEIR NAMES UP.

00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:17.046
I'M LIKE, WHO ARE YOU.

00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:18.314
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: PART OF BEING A 

00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:18.547
PARENT.

00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:19.548
&gt;&gt; THE GAME THAT SASHA PLAYS 

00:15:19.548 --> 00:15:20.516
WITH ME IS THAT WHEN WE'RE WITH 

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:22.752
A LOT OF PEOPLE, SHE'LL CALL ME 

00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:24.687
MOM, MOM, MOM, AND I DON'T HEAR 

00:15:24.687 --> 00:15:26.722
AND SHE'S LIKE, MICHELLE.

00:15:26.722 --> 00:15:27.356
MICHELLE OBAMA.

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:31.243
AND I LOOK UP AND SHE'S LIKE, 

00:15:31.243 --> 00:15:31.410
SEE?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.411
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: COUPLE MORE.

00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:33.145
THESE ARE IMPORTANT.

00:15:33.145 --> 00:15:36.115
&gt;&gt; I STOLE THE PHRASE, WHEN THEY

00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:38.851
GO LOW, WE GO HIGH FROM THE BACK

00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:42.888
OF A SNAPPLE CAP.

00:15:42.888 --> 00:15:46.425
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: TWO MORE.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:47.176
&gt;&gt; BARRY, BE QUIET AND HOLD MY 

00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:51.080
PURSE.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.616
&gt;&gt; Jimmy: AND YOUR FINAL 

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:54.250
OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT TO MAKE NOW

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.952

00:15:56.952 --> 00:15:57.153
