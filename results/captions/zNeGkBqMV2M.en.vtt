00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.268
Let's make like Steve Harvey

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.437
and get into the news.
I, uh...

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.372
I actually feel bad
for Steve Harvey, you know?

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.508
These days, whenever you see
his name in the headlines,

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.176
it's because
something went wrong.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.178
Two years ago
he accidentally crowned

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.280
the wrong Miss Universe
on live TV.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.816
He's constantly
calling families to feud.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.118
And last week
was a double whammy.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.888
Harvey's week off, uh,
started... or, his week, rather,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.057
started off with him
being slammed

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.392
for making jokes about
Asian guys being unattractive

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.361
in a segment
on his daytime talk show.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.564
And, uh, that wasn't even
Steve Harvey's whole week.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.300
Because after pissing off,
uh, a whole ethnic group,

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.837
where does one go
to find a sympathetic ear?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.272
REPORTER:<i> We are just getting
 some live pictures in</i>

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.606
<i> right now.
 The president-elect making</i>

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.409
<i> an unannounced appearance
 at Trump Tower,</i>

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.245
<i> where he is standing
 with Steve Harvey.</i>

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.481
REPORTER 2:<i> Comedian Steve
 Harvey revealed he'll work</i>

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.184
<i> with Donald Trump
 to improve inner cities.</i>

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.387
And you thought Donald Trump
wasn't gonna do anything

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.890
for black people. Huh? Huh?

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.492
<i> You</i> know what's funny
is every single

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.194
<i> black person
 who meets with Trump</i>

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.696
has that same
"What the (bleep) just happened"

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.665
expression on their face.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.367
Like...

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.603
As soon as... as soon as
the cameras come out,

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.205
they all look like
they've busted

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.507
on an episode of<i> Cheaters.</i>
 That's what it looks like.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.477
No, it's not what it looks like,
it's not what it looks like.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.779
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.747
any black person...

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.917
any black person seen to be
rolling with Trump

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.887
knows they will be subject to
the full fury of Black Twitter,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.789
uh, which is why Steve
was not ashamed

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:33.092
to justify his visit
and, uh, drop names.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.394
I was, uh, in-invited here

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.430
by the...
both transition teams--

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.799
Obama's transition team
and Trump's.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.135
President Obama says
you got to sit down and talk.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.870
It's just me following, uh,

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.973
orders from my friend,
uh, President Obama,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.676
who said, "Steve, you got to..."
as he told everybody,

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.278
"get out from behind
your computer,

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:53.779
"stop tweeting and texting

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:57.016
and get out there
and sit down and talk."

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.752
A-and O... and Obama told me
to call that woman, honey.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.053
Uh, Obama said I should...

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.688
I should talk to her
in the club.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.091
And Obama's why I drove
that fast, officer.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.325
He said... he said,

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:08.094
"Don't let anything
stop you, keep going."

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.897
And-and... and Obama i-is...
is just, like...

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.131
I like how Obama's become, like,

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.699
the "traffic excuse"
of politics.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:16.068
"Why are you doing..." Well, the
Obama was so crazy yesterday,

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.371
I just had to... I had to do it.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.673
Uh, so it was a really
rough week for Steve Harvey.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.608
I-I feel bad for him.
He's a good guy.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.477
But how you can defend yourself
about this? How...

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.381
Uh-uh, uh-uh, I can
defend myself, Trev.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.815
-(cheering, applause)
-Oh!

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.284
I can defend myself, boy.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.853
It's Steve Harvey, everybody,
it's Steve Harvey!

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.522
-Yeah.
-It's Steve Harvey!

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:37.890
Mm-hmm.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.560
What?

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.728
Now, you over here telling
your little jokes about me,

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.198
but see, Trevor, you don't even
understand how it went down.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.899
Let me tell you
how it went down.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.068
You got to explain
to these Africans real slow

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:50.803
how it go down.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:52.838
I was minding my business
at the dry cleaners,

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.342
'cause I dropped off my mustache
to get cleaned up.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.744
My phone rang,
and it was-it was...

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.413
and I knew it was
an important call,

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.682
'cause it was
the<i> Downton Abbey</i> ring tone.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.251
-(sings<i> Downton Abbey</i> theme)
-Uh...

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:07.787
Yeah. That's what I use
on my phone. It was Obama.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.856
I-I answered the phone...
and Obama said,

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.794
"Steve, I need you
to go talk to Trump."

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.396
Mr. Harvey, I-I hate
to call you out,

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.466
but it sounds like you're trying
to blame Obama for this.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.102
Well, white folks blamed
Obama for eight years.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.071
I can't do it once?

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:35.615
So, wait, so, wait-- if Obama
said jump off a building,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:36.882
would you do it?

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.652
If it helped black people, yeah.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.855
Still, hey, Trump...
It-it hurts me that black people

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:44.757
think I don't care about 'em.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.393
Every year I honor
the best in black business.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:49.762
I have a program
that mentors children.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.499
My mustache
won three NAACP awards.

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.768
You see, this is...
this is all it comes down to:

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.903
black people... black people,
we-we got two choices,

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:59.272
black people, look:

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.874
either we meet this man
and try to get something done

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:03.509
or we take four years
off politics.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:05.411
And I don't know about y'all,
but Steve Harvey

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:07.680
don't take a day off.
You better check your<i> TV Guide,</i>

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:11.284
I'm on four channels right now.
(laughs)

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.085
Yeah.

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.121
-Ste-Steve, take-take a seat.
-I'm on QVC,

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.523
I'm on damn ESPN Deportes.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:19.025
Steve, Steve, I understand,

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.127
-I'm on all them channels.
-I understand what you were

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.929
trying to do, but-but what do
you say to the people

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:25.498
who are mad at you?

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.333
The hell you mad for?

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.669
I stood next to a man
while he said dumb things.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.604
My whole job
is to stand next to people

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.673
while they say dumb things.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.676
Name me something that
has an eye but can't see.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.512
-Tiger.
-(applause)

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.782
Tell me a part of the body
that begins with the letter T.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:46.419
-Titties.
-(bell dings)

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.788
Good sucker?
(chuckles)

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.123
-Asparagus.
-(applause)

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:53.959
-Seagull.
-Good answer!

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:56.495
I could have said, "Do this,
say that." I don't want that.

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:58.264
<i> (bell dings)</i>

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.735
Roy Wood Jr., everybody.

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:06.305
-Give it up for Roy Wood Jr.
-(cheering, applause)

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:09.008
And by the way, by the way,
Roy, by the way,

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.609
I can't front, man--

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.378
that's a pretty good
Steve Harvey impression, man.

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:14.814
-The mustache does half the
work. -Yeah.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:17.016
Now, if Steve Harvey's
way of dealing with Trump

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.719
isn't your flavor,
we got the exact opposite way

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.054
of dealing with Trump this
weekend from Georgia congressman

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:24.623
and civil rights leader
John Lewis.

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.258
Do you plan on trying
to forge a relationship

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.460
with Donald Trump?

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.161
It's gonna be very difficult.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:33.132
Uh, I don't see this
president-elect

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.067
as a legitimate president.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.036
You do not consider him
a legitimate president.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.904
Why is that?

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:42.141
I-I think the Russians
participated

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:45.411
in helping this man get elected.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.013
And... and they helped

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.584
destroy the candidacy
of Hillary Clinton.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.687
Uh, I don't plan
to attend the inauguration.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.624
Damn, John Lewis
does not mess around.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:00.960
I mean, I've heard of people
turning down party invites,

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:03.529
but giving your reason
as illegitimate--

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.998
that's gonna change Evites
forever, people.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:11.370
So... John Lewis

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:14.073
called Trump
an illegitimate president.

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:15.474
And you know Trump--

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:19.145
I mean, he just
lets that (bleep) slide.

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:21.647
Straight onto his keyboard.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.351
MAN:<i> Trump lashing out at the
Georgia congressman on Twitter,</i>

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.387
<i> saying "Lewis should spend
 more time on fixing</i>

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.457
<i> "and helping his district,
 which is in horrible shape</i>

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.825
<i> and crime infested."</i>

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:34.660
MAN 2:
<i> "All talk, talk, talk.</i>

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:37.430
<i> No action or results. Sad!"</i>

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.198
-(laughter)
-I'm sorry. What?

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.866
All talk, no action?

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.068
You're calling
a civil rights hero

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.438
who marched in Selma
with Martin Luther King Jr.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.139
all talk, no action?

00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:50.643
Saying John Lewis isn't a man
of action is like me saying

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.345
Donald Trump is all tax returns,
no tweets.

00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:55.281
(laughter)

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:59.885
(applause and cheering)

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:04.089
This man... this man
got his head beaten in

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.592
on multiple occasions
by racist policemen

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.828
who were trying to silence him
in what he was doing.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.197
That is action.
I'm not gonna front.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.399
If you smashed me over the head,

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:14.834
I would seriously reconsider

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.735
-whatever issue
I was fighting for. -(laughter)

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:19.171
I'd be like,
"I'm sitting in the front." Bap.

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:20.773
"You know what?
The back's cooler anyway.

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:22.107
"It's where
all the cool kids are.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.442
"Rosa, you do you.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:24.610
"I've got
a one head-beating policy.

00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:26.045
I'm out. I'm out."

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.848
A part of me thinks Trump didn't
even know who John Lewis was.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.183
I mean, this seems like it's
just Trump's generic response

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.952
to any black criticism.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.720
Any time black people
criticize him, he's just like,

00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:37.423
"Go back
to your burning inner city."

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.391
You know, like,
if Trump met a black astronaut,

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:41.527
I bet he'd be like,
"Thank you for fighting crime

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.330
-in the burning inner cities
of space." -(laughter)

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:47.132
"Space crime is a huge problem.

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:49.301
-Sad."
-(laughter)

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:52.238
-But...
-(applause and cheering)

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.640
But here's the thing.
Here's the thing.

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:58.110
What Steve Harvey
and John Lewis did this weekend

00:07:58.143 --> 00:07:59.678
perfectly captures the debate

00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:02.648
about how to respond
to the Trump presidency.

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.351
Do you resist him,
or do you work with him?

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.653
And this weekend,
we saw examples of both.

00:08:07.686 --> 00:08:09.355
And it's appropriate

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:11.790
that we're talking about this
on Martin Luther King Day

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:15.528
because Dr. King also stood
for both approaches.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.898
Dr. King was out on the streets
marching and boycotting,

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:23.669
but he also sat down to
negotiate with those in power.

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:27.239
Yeah. And that's exactly
what I was trying to do.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.542
-(laughter) -That's what Obama
told me to do.

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.644
What you just said--
that's what Obama...

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.079
CHIENG:
Steve Harvey!

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:36.215
Oh, (bleep), It's Ronny Chieng,
everybody. Ronny Chieng!

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.050
-(applause and cheering)
-Wow. Ronny Chieng.

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.618
What's up?

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.353
Wow. What-what are you...?

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:43.355
What are you doing here, and why
do you have a baseball bat?

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:45.357
You think it's funny

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.726
to perpetuate stereotypes
about Asian men?

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:50.262
I will teach you
about racial discrimination.

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:52.761
Now, which one of you
is Steve Harvey?
