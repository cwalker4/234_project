Joshua: My name is Joshua Fields Millburn
and this is Ryan Nicodemus.

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:21.826
Together, we run a website
called theminimalists.com

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:24.780
and we promise the folks
we'd kick things off this afternoon

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.085
with something inspirational,

00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:30.105
(Laughter)

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.834
something to get you all excited.

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:33.590
(Cheers)

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.719
So, I'd like to talk about
something uplifting.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:38.615
(Cheers) (Laughter)

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:40.001
Let's talk about death!

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:45.133
If any of you are uncomfortable
talking about death,

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:48.368
now might be a good time for you to leave.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.356
(Laughter)

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:54.797
I have a feeling we will be
seeing him again in a minute.

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.106
Anyway, yeah, we could talk about death.

00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:00.043
Let's see, seven years ago,

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.109
I was 28 years old,
and up until that point in my life,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.737
I had achieved everything I ever wanted:

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:12.515
The six-figure salary, the luxury cars,
the closets full of expensive clothes,

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:15.646
the big suburban house
with more toilets than people,

00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:18.413
and all of this stuff

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:21.517
to filled every corner
of my consumer-driven lifestyle.

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:24.139
Man, I was living the American Dream!

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:29.083
And then my mom died.
And my marriage ended.

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:31.214
Both in the same month.

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.442
And these two events
forced me to look around

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:37.471
and start to question
what had become my life's focus.

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:39.253
You know what I realized?

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.048
I realized I was so focused
on so-called "success" and "achievement,"

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:48.041
and especially,
on the accumulation of stuff.

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:50.833
Yeah, I was living the American Dream,

00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:53.159
but it wasn't my dream.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.570
And it took getting everything
I thought I wanted,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.651
to realize that everything I ever wanted
wasn't actually what I wanted at all.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.087
You see, just a year earlier,
mom, she moved from Ohio down to Florida,

00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:08.302
to finally retire.

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.922
Because that's what you do
when you live in the Midwest.

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:15.521
And, well a few months
after she moved down there,

00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:17.481
she found out she had lung cancer.

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:19.968
And a few months after that,

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:22.308
she was gone.

00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:25.790
I spent a lot of time with her
down in Florida that year,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.146
as she went through
her chemo and radiation.

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.933
And when she passed, I realized
I needed to make one last trip,

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:34.112
this time it was to deal with her stuff.

00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:40.216
So, I flew from Dayton, Ohio,
down to St. Pete Beach, Florida,

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:43.836
and when I arrived, I found about
three apartments' worth of stuff

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:46.710
crammed in a mom's tiny
one-bedroom apartment.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.602
But don't get me wrong,
it's not like mom was a hoarder,

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:51.395
she wasn't.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:54.895
I mean, I didn't find
any dead cats in her freezer.

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:56.861
(Laughter)

00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:58.723
But she owned a lot of stuff.

00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:00.854
65 years worth of accumulation.

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:01.622
Did you all know

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:06.192
that the average American household
has more than 300,000 items in it?

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.176
300,000!

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.540
But of course, most of us
aren't hoarders, right?

00:03:13.938 --> 00:03:15.945
No, we just hold onto a lot of stuff.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.886
We hold onto a lifetime
of collected memories.

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:20.232
I know mom certainly did.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.755
So, I did what any good son would do --

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:29.041
I think that's me on a bad hair day --

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:31.512
I called U-Haul.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.924
I called U-Haul and I asked
for the largest truck they had.

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:40.916
In fact, I needed one so large,

00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:44.735
I had to wait an extra-day,
until the 26-foot truck was available.

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.541
And as I waited for that U-Haul to arrive,

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.799
I invited some of mom's friends over
to help me deal with her stuff.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.127
I mean, there was just
too much stuff to go at it alone.

00:03:57.076 --> 00:04:00.481
Her living room was stuffed
with big antique furniture,

00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:02.146
and old paintings,

00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:04.647
and more doilies that I could count.

00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:07.217
She loved doilies.

00:04:08.927 --> 00:04:11.835
And her kitchen was stuffed
with hundreds of plates, and cups,

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.957
and bowls, and ill-assorted utensils.

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:17.963
And her bathroom was stuffed

00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:21.842
with enough hygiene products
to start a small beauty supply business.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.345
And her linen closet,

00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:29.154
well, it looked like someone was running
a hotel out of her linen closet,

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:32.501
which was stuffed with mismatched
bath towels, and beach towels,

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.611
and bed sheets, and blankets, and quilts.

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.633
And don't even get me started
on her bedroom.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.842
Why did mom have 14 winter coats
stuffed in her bedroom closet?

00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:46.446
14!

00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:53.042
Now, come on, she lived
in St. Pete Beach, Florida!

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:57.035
Suffice it to say
mom owned a lot of stuff,

00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.557
and I had no idea
what to do with any of it.

00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:06.976
So, I did what any good son would do;
I rented a storage locker.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.124
When I called, I asked for
the largest storage unit they had.

00:05:11.124 --> 00:05:12.545
You what they asked me?

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:15.675
"Do you want one
that's climate-controlled?"

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.611
Climate-controlled, just so mom's stuff
could be comfortable?

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.623
No, I don't want one
that's climate-controlled,

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:27.030
just give me a big box
with a padlock on it!

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.755
You see, I couldn't co-mingle
mom's stuff with my stuff,

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:34.083
I already had a big house,
and a full basement full of stuff.

00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:36.924
But a storage locker?
Oh, yeah!

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:40.832
A storage locker would let me
hold on to everything!

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:46.243
Just in case I needed it someday,
in some non-existent, hypothetical future.

00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:48.764
You know, just in case.

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:52.333
Just. In. Case.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.203
[Just. In. Case.]

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:57.039
The three most dangerous words
in the English language.

00:05:57.963 --> 00:06:01.643
Anyway, so there I was,
attempting to finish packing mom's stuff,

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:06.940
when all of a sudden,
I noticed these four boxes.

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:10.321
These old printer-paper boxes.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:11.512
Kind of heavy.

00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:14.006
Sealed with excessive amounts
of packing tape.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:16.218
So, I pulled them out one by one.

00:06:16.218 --> 00:06:18.335
I noticed that each box was labelled

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:21.890
with just a number, written on the side,
in thick, black marker.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.574
All I saw was: one, two,

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:29.734
three, four.

00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:33.317
I stood there, looking down,

00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:40.152
wondering what could possibly
be in those boxes.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.429
It looks like we're out of time folks.
Hope you enjoy the rest of the conference!

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:47.352
(Laughter)

00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:49.926
No, it was my old
elementary school paperwork,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:51.585
grades one through four.

00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:54.979
You know, as I opened those boxes,
my curiosity ran wild,

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:57.875
and I thought to myself,

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.962
"Why was mom holding onto
all that stupid paperwork?"

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:03.463
But then, all those memories
came rushing back,

00:07:03.463 --> 00:07:06.070
and I realized she had been
holding onto a piece of me,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.173
she was holding onto all those memories
in those boxes, right?

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:12.012
Wait a minute!

00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:15.138
Those boxes had been sealed
for more than two decades,

00:07:15.948 --> 00:07:19.334
which made me realize something important
for the first time in my life:

00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:23.074
Our memories are not inside our things.

00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:24.934
[Memories}

00:07:26.074 --> 00:07:28.117
Our memories are inside us.

00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:32.468
See, mom didn't need to hold on to
those boxes to hold on to a piece of me,

00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:34.319
I was never in those boxes.

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.534
But then, I looked around
at her apartment,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.924
I looked around at all her stuff,

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.503
and I realized I was getting ready
to do the same thing.

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:49.569
Except instead of storing
her memories in a box in my home,

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:55.010
I was getting ready to cram it all
into a big box with a padlock on it.

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.628
So, I did what any good son would do,

00:08:01.038 --> 00:08:04.408
I called U-Haul
and I cancelled that truck.

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:09.963
And then I called and I cancelled
the storage locker.

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:18.376
And I spent the next 12 days
selling, or donating, almost everything.

00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:22.895
And I learned a bunch
of really important lessons along the way.

00:08:23.692 --> 00:08:27.692
Not only did I learn that our memories
aren't in our things, they're in us;

00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:31.654
but I also learned about
value, real value.

00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:34.365
You see, if I'm honest with myself,

00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:37.791
I was just going to selfishly
cling to mom's stuff,

00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.357
but of course, I wasn't going
to get any value from it,

00:08:40.357 --> 00:08:42.638
as it sat there,
locked away in perpetuity.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:47.703
But the truth is that by letting go,
I could add value to other people's lives.

00:08:47.703 --> 00:08:51.624
So, I donated much of her stuff
to her friends, and local charities,

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:54.249
giving the stuff a new home.

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.439
And the things I was able to sell,
I was able to take that money

00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:58.803
and give it to the charities

00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:01.303
that helped her through
her chemo and radiation.

00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:06.999
And when I finally returned to Ohio,

00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:11.011
I returned with just a handful
of sentimental items:

00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:17.105
an old painting, a few photographs,
maybe even a doily or two.

00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:34.216
And the final lesson I learned,
well, it was a practical one.

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:40.085
While it's true that sometimes,
our memories are in our things,

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:42.932
it's also true that sometimes,

00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:46.215
the things that we have
can trigger the memories

00:09:46.215 --> 00:09:47.946
that are inside us.

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:50.209
So, while I was still in Florida,

00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:52.702
I took photos of many
of mom's possessions.

00:09:54.472 --> 00:09:56.048
When I went back to Ohio,

00:09:56.048 --> 00:09:58.358
I went back with just
a few boxes of photographs,

00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:01.498
which I was able to scan,
and store digitally.

00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:04.506
And those photos made it easier
for me to let go,

00:10:05.636 --> 00:10:09.998
because I realized I wasn't letting go
of any of my memories.

00:10:09.998 --> 00:10:12.218
[Let go, move on]

00:10:12.218 --> 00:10:17.776
Ultimately, I had to let go
of what was weighing me down

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.582
before I was able to move on,

00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:26.161
and to move on, well,
I had to look in the mirror,

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:28.791
and take an inventory of my own life.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:34.548
It turns out I had an organized life,

00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:35.468
[Organized]

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.402
but really, I was just
a well-organized hoarder.

00:10:39.485 --> 00:10:43.100
I mean, everything looked great, sure,
but it was just a facade,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.756
and I knew I needed to simplify things.

00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:51.973
That's where this beautiful thing
called "minimalism" entered my life.

00:10:51.978 --> 00:10:54.606
For me, it all started with one question:

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.472
How might your life be better with less?

00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:00.975
You see, by answering this question,

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:03.866
I was able to understand
the purpose of minimalism,

00:11:03.866 --> 00:11:06.436
not just the how-to, but the why-to.

00:11:07.003 --> 00:11:11.936
I learned that if I simplified my life,
I'd have time for my health,

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:15.638
for my relationships,
my finances, my passions,

00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:19.618
and I could contribute beyond myself
in a meaningful way.

00:11:20.108 --> 00:11:24.589
See, I was able to understand
the benefits of minimalism

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:27.250
well before I ever cleaned out
a walk-in closet.

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:31.744
And so, when it came time for me
to actually declutter my life,

00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:34.440
I started small, I asked myself
another question:

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.145
What if you remove one material possession
from your life each day, for a month?

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:41.387
Just one. What would happen?

00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:43.332
The end result:

00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:47.561
Well, I unloaded way more
than 30 items in the first 30 days,

00:11:47.872 --> 00:11:49.678
like way, way more.

00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:53.809
It became this kind of personal challenge,
discovering what I could get rid of,

00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:59.318
so I searched my rooms and closets,
cabinets and hallways, car and office,

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:01.873
rumaging for items to part with,

00:12:01.873 --> 00:12:05.519
retaining only the things
that added value to my life,

00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:08.079
pondering each artifact in my home,

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:11.246
I'd ask, "Does this thing
add value to my life?"

00:12:11.728 --> 00:12:15.301
The more I asked this question,
the more I gained momentum.

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:18.482
And embracing minimalism
got easier by the day.

00:12:18.482 --> 00:12:21.946
I mean, the more you do it, the freer,
and happier, and lighter you feel,

00:12:21.946 --> 00:12:24.186
and the more you want to throw overboard.

00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:26.607
For me, a few shirts led to half a closet,

00:12:26.607 --> 00:12:31.240
a few DVDs led to deep-sixing
almost an entire library of discs.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.308
A few decorative items led to junk drawers
who shed their adjective;

00:12:36.308 --> 00:12:37.797
it's a beautiful cycle.

00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:41.094
I mean, the more action you take,
the more you want to take action.

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:46.427
Ultimately though,
the purpose of minimalism

00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:48.499
has to do with the benefits we experience

00:12:48.499 --> 00:12:51.309
once we're on the other side
of decluttering.

00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:55.076
Hence, removing the clutter
is not the end result,

00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:57.241
it is merely the first step.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.044
I mean, it's possible to go home,

00:13:00.044 --> 00:13:02.977
get rid of everything you own
and be absolutely miserable,

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:07.736
to come home to an empty house and sulk,
after removing all your pacifiers.

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:11.141
Because consumption is not the problem.

00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:14.269
Compulsory consumption is the problem.

00:13:15.124 --> 00:13:16.486
And we can change that

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:19.533
by being more deliberate
with the decisions we make each day.

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:22.745
Over the course of eight months,
I deliberately jettisoned

00:13:22.745 --> 00:13:26.255
more than 90 per cent
of my material possessions.

00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:30.497
Although, if you visited my home today,
you probably wouldn't walk in and yell,

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:33.458
"Oh my God! This guy is a minimalist!"

00:13:34.618 --> 00:13:39.379
No. You'd probably just say,
"Wow, he's tidy."

00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:42.771
You'd ask how I keep things so organized,

00:13:42.771 --> 00:13:45.348
and I'd simply grin and tell you
that I don't own much,

00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:48.291
but everything I do own
adds real value to my life.

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:53.467
Each of my belongings, my car, my clothes,
my kitchenware, my furniture,

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:54.294
has a function.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:14:00.121
As a minimalist, every possession
serves a purpose or brings me joy,

00:14:00.121 --> 00:14:02.356
and everything else is out of the way.

00:14:02.837 --> 00:14:06.421
With the clutter cleared, I felt compelled
to start asking deeper questions,

00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:07.665
questions like:

00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:10.427
Why did I give
so much meaning to my stuff?

00:14:10.427 --> 00:14:12.635
What is truly important in my life?

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.505
When did I become so discontented?

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:17.412
Who is the person I want to become?

00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:20.045
And how am I going to define
my own success?

00:14:20.045 --> 00:14:22.388
These are tough questions,
with difficult answers,

00:14:22.388 --> 00:14:24.446
but they've proven to be
much more important

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.437
than just trashing my excess stuff.

00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:30.086
And if we don't answer these questions
carefully, rigorously,

00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.886
then the closet we just decluttered
will be brimming with new purchases

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:35.358
in the not too distant future.

00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:39.773
So, as I let go, and as I started facing
life's tougher questions,

00:14:39.773 --> 00:14:41.435
things got simpler,

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:44.308
and the people around me noticed
something was different too.

00:14:44.308 --> 00:14:46.305
People at work started saying things like,

00:14:46.305 --> 00:14:49.650
"You seem less stressed!"
"You seem so much calmer!"

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.242
"What is going on?
You seem so much nicer!"

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:57.660
And then my best friend,
a guy named Ryan Nicodemus,

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.698
whom I've known since
we were fat little fifth graders,

00:15:00.698 --> 00:15:04.153
he came to me one day,
and he said he noticed how happy I was.

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:06.941
And that opened him up in time

00:15:06.941 --> 00:15:10.664
to the concepts of minimalism
and living a meaningful life with less.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:15.106
As he simplified his life, that made room
for these deeper conversations,

00:15:15.106 --> 00:15:18.734
conversations about
how our unchecked consumption

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:24.183
wasn't just affecting our lives,
it was infecting our entire society.

00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:30.427
Ryan: You see, the more we consume,
the more waste we produce.

00:15:30.427 --> 00:15:32.994
But then of course,
the opposite is also true.

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:36.708
If we consume less stuff,
we produce less waste.

00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:37.974
As you all might know,

00:15:37.974 --> 00:15:41.262
if the entire world
consumed like the United States,

00:15:41.262 --> 00:15:47.542
we would need over four Earths
to maintain our unchecked consumption.

00:15:47.972 --> 00:15:52.638
How can we, as consumer-driven Americans,
keep consuming like this?

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:56.342
It's pretty simple;
we go deeper into debt!

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:57.237
That's how.

00:15:57.237 --> 00:15:57.972
[Debt]

00:15:57.972 --> 00:16:01.937
Did you know the average American
carries four credit cards in their wallet?

00:16:01.937 --> 00:16:07.075
And one in ten Americans
has ten or more active credit cards.

00:16:08.043 --> 00:16:14.019
And the average credit card debt
is over $16,000.

00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:18.657
The total consumer debt
of the United States

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:21.773
is nearly 12 trillion dollars.

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:25.841
12 trillion dollars!

00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:28.956
Let me just put that
into perspective for a minute.

00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:34.249
If you went out and spent one dollar
every single second,

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:40.159
it would take you more than 31,000 years
to spend a trillion dollars.

00:16:40.159 --> 00:16:44.319
In fact, if you went out
and spent a million dollars a day,

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:47.100
ever since the birth of the Buddha,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.008
you still wouldn't have spent
a trillion dollars by now.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.394
And we have nearly
12 trillion dollars in debt.

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:04.388
And the only way out is to let go.

00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:12.676
When we let go, our actions,
it encourages others to let go, too.

00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:16.780
Six years ago, Josh and I,
we let go of our stuff,

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.858
so we could start living a life
that aligned with our values.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.849
We started consuming less,
so we could start living more.

00:17:26.173 --> 00:17:28.615
And when our lives became our message,

00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:32.067
we started a blog, so we could share
that message with others.

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.238
We called it "theminimalists.com."

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:37.741
Since then, we've written
books about simple living,

00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:40.428
we started a podcast about intentionality,

00:17:40.428 --> 00:17:43.918
and we released a documentary
called "Minimalism."

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.739
All in an effort to add value
to other people's lives.

00:17:48.774 --> 00:17:51.307
And that's really why we're here today,

00:17:51.307 --> 00:17:52.855
we really, really hope

00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:55.724
that we can add value
to all of your lives.

00:17:56.228 --> 00:17:59.332
So, if you leave here
with just one message,

00:17:59.332 --> 00:18:00.969
we really hope it's this:

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.292
Love people and use things,
because the opposite never works.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:07.652
[Love people, use things]

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:09.618
(Applause)
