00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.203
-President Trump is turning
on some of his closest allies

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.073
while standing by the one
that pays him, Saudi Arabia.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.475
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:13.379
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.583
Trump did a sit-down interview
with Fox News over the weekend,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.551
and in that interview,
he said some things

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.053
that might technically
qualify as news.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:23.823
But one thing he said
that was news to nobody

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.526
was when he described
his decision-making process

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.495
and made clear
he doesn't really have one.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.531
-When you're sitting at the
desk, how do you make decisions?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.300
I mean,
do you agonize over them?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.502
Do you second-guess yourself?

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.670
-I don't think about it.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.872
I don't think about
how I make them.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:42.474
-Yeah, yeah, we know.
[ Laughter ]

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:45.545
It's one of the symptoms.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.615
I imagine Trump makes decisions
the same way Netflix's algorithm

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.685
suggests something
totally random for you to watch.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.653
"Did you enjoy
the migrant caravan?

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.923
Then you might also like
raking in Finland."

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.858
[ Laughter ]

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.561
So while there's no process
to Donald Trump's decision,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.631
there is one central operating
principle, and that's loyalty.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.832
Doesn't matter who you are
or how decorated you are,

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.067
all Trump cares about

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.269
is whether you are nice to him
or mean to him.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:13.339
That's why Trump attacked
retired Admiral William McRaven,

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.374
a Navy S.E.A.L.
who oversaw the operation

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.709
to kill Osama bin Laden.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.545
McRaven has criticized
Trump's attacks on the press,

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:20.980
calling him
a threat to democracy,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.182
but when Trump was asked
about McRaven

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:25.818
he falsely accused him of being
a Hillary Clinton supporter

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.387
just because Hillary
had reportedly considered him

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.923
as a possible running mate
in 2016.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:35.128
-Bill McRaven, retired admiral,
Navy S.E.A.L., 37 years,

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.829
former head
of U.S. Special Operations --

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.098
-Hillary Clinton fan.
-Special Operations --

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.968
-Excuse me --
Hillary Clinton fan.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:44.871
-I'm so happy we have a
president who blurts stuff out

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.840
like a "Price is Right"
audience member.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.610
"Hillary Clinton!
$1!"

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.211
[ Laughter ]

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.979
Trump has also tried
to weaponize

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.348
the criminal justice system
against his political opponents.

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.651
For the same reason
he attacked McRaven,

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.020
he wants to punish them
for their disloyalty,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.755
and he's being egged on
by Fox News.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.257
Yesterday,
"The New York Times" reported

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.759
that Trump wanted to order
the Justice Department

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.694
to prosecute James Comey
and Hillary Clinton.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.564
Some of his more vocal
supporters stirred his anger,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.099
including the Fox News
commentator Jeanine Pirro,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.235
who has railed repeatedly
on her weekly show

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.736
that the President
is being ill-served

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:18.971
by the Justice Department.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.040
So not only is the President
a wannabe dictator

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.875
who thinks
he can jail whoever he wants,

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.311
he also genuinely believes

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.314
all the insane stuff
he sees on Fox News.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.916
Trump probably
sits there all day,

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.151
watching Fox
and shouting to his aides,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.787
"Prosecute Hillary!
Stop the caravan!

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.390
And ask my doctor is Otezla
is right for me!"

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.661
[ Laughter ]

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.564
"Why can't I have Otezla?"

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.065
[ Laughter ]

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.400
Trump doesn't care that Hillary
didn't actually break any laws

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.504
or that McRaven is Navy S.E.A.L.
and decorated military hero

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.706
who led a mission to kill the
world's most wanted terrorist.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.309
All that matters to Trump
is whether you're loyal.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.844
And sure enough,
Trump is now questioning

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.613
the loyalty of the man who was,
constitutionally speaking,

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.050
closer to him than anyone else
in the federal government.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.586
-In recent weeks,
with his electoral prospects

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.655
two years from now
much on his mind,

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.089
Mr. Trump has focused
on the person

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.527
who has most publicly
tethered his fortunes to him.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.729
In one conversation
after another,

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.598
he has asked aides and advisers
a pointed question --

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:21.200
"Is Mike Pence loyal?"

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.103
-Damn.
Now he's questioning Mike Pence?

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.404
How paranoid can you be?

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.906
Mike Pence has spent two years

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.909
doing everything he can
to suck up to Trump.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.345
I mean, he literally copies
Trump's physical mannerisms.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.214
Remember that time Trump
put his water bottle

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.448
on the ground during a meeting

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.751
and then Pence immediately
did the same thing?

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.552
[ Laughter ]

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:43.322
I mean, look at that --
Pence is like a pageant mom

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.224
who's doing
his daughter's routine

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.959
along with her
from the audience.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.495
"And clap, then spin,
then step, step, step,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:53.333
then jazz hands, jazz hands,
jazz hands.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.433
For Trump,
loyalty only goes one way,

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.569
and there's no better
example of that

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.171
than the man who's arguably
closer to Trump

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:01.341
than anyone else in the world,
Fox News host Sean Hannity.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.643
Just to give you an idea of
how loyal Hannity is to Trump,

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:05.178
it was reported a few months ago

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.180
that Hannity
has Trump's direct phone line

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.514
and they talk
multiple times a day,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.650
including after
the Fox News host

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.118
wraps up taping his show
most weeknights.

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.255
Can you imagine
that conversation?

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.056
It's probably
the phone call version

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.325
of two dogs
sniffing each other's butts.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.693
[ Laughter ]

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.828
And everyone in the White House
knows it's happening,

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:24.964
because Trump will walk around,
flaunting the fact

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.465
that Hannity
calls him every day.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.868
White House staff are aware
that the calls happen

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.072
entering a room and announcing,
"I just hung up with Hannity."

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.173
[ Laughter ]

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.475
No one has parlayed
the President

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.412
into less impressive
celebrity friends.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.648
I mean, JFK used the presidency
to hang out with Marilyn Monroe.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.050
Trump plays phone a friend

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.819
with the human embodiment
of a Christmas ham.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.757
[ Laughter ]

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:58.064
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.333
Sean Ham-ity.
So that's how close --

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:04.036
[ Laughter ]

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:06.805
That's how --
[ Laughter ]

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.540
That's how close those two are,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.610
or at least, that's how close
Hannity thought they were

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.611
until last week, when
"The Daily Beast" reported

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.314
that Trump calls Hannity
a suck-up behind his back.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.016
Trump has repeatedly made fun of
Hannity's interviewing skills

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:20.253
and called Hannity's
softball questions dumb.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:23.088
Now, I think I know
what Hannity did to anger Trump.

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.791
You see, Hannity has spent hours
on his show defending Trump

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.627
from one
especially salacious rumor

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.096
about a certain sex act
in a Moscow hotel room,

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.932
a rumor so salacious
that we will not stoop

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.134
to repeat the details of it here
on this show.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.570
But as we pointed out before,
Sean Hannity often repeats

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.472
all the embarrassing details
of that specific rumor

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:43.042
on his TV show, which is watched
by millions of people,

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.777
and I feel like it might have
started to annoy Trump,

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.680
because Hannity --
Hannity just won't let it go.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.849
-Remember, that's the dossier
that talked about Trump

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.918
at a Ritz-Carlton in Moscow

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:54.354
with two prostitutes
urinating on his bed.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.555
The fake document about
President Trump,

00:05:56.555 --> 00:05:58.357
and that goes
to the Ritz-Carlton,

00:05:58.357 --> 00:05:59.859
and that goes to hookers.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.429
Russians and the Ritz-Carlton
and hookers.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.832
You know, talking about hookers
and urinating in beds.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:08.467
Hookers, Ritz-Carlton,
urinating on a bed.

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:10.303
The Ritz-Carlton and hookers.

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.070
Russian hookers.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.040
Trump, hookers, hookers,
hookers, hookers, hookers,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.443
hookers, hookers, hookers
urinating in his bed.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.078
Peeing, urinating, urinating,

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.047
urinating, urinating,
urinating, urinating.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:25.518
Hookers at a Ritz-Carlton
in Moscow urinating in the bed.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.953
Employing a number
of prostitutes

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:32.125
to perform golden showers,
in other words, urination.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.795
-So, Hannity thought it was
a good idea to go on his show

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:38.331
and read in detail the single
most embarrassing rumor

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.032
about his friend, the president.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.601
I mean, now I know
why Trump is mad at him.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:43.869
Or should I say pissed?

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:50.776
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.412
Whether it's Hannity or Pence,
anyone who gets close to Trump

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.514
eventually learns his loyalty
has a limit.

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:57.783
There's really only one way
to ensure that Trump

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.252
will stand by you,
no matter what,

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.019
and that's simple --
to pay him off.

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.989
That's the lesson Saudi Arabia's
learning this week

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.658
amid a firestorm over the murder
of "Washington Post" columnist

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.627
and U.S. resident
Jamal Khashoggi.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.829
We know for a fact
that Trump has financial ties

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:12.264
to Saudi Arabia
because he told us.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:14.433
-I love the Saudis.
Many are in this building.

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:17.236
Saudi Arabia, and I get along
great with all of them.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.438
They buy apartments from me.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.205
They spend $40 million,
$50 million.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.641
Am I supposed to dislike them?
I like them very much.

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.543
-Saudi Arabia --
I like the Saudis.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.945
They're very nice.
I make a lot of money with them.

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:30.850
They buy all sorts of my stuff,
all kinds of toys from Trump.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.285
-Toys?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.987
He sounds like a guy on the
street selling knockoff LEGOs.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:38.591
"They don't snap together.
You got to use duct tape."

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.159
[ Laughter ]

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.660
Trump's financial ties
to Saudi Arabia

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.395
might explain
why he's been so reluctant

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:44.597
to condemn the kingdom

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.131
for murdering a journalist
and U.S. Resident.

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.799
Yesterday, Trump was asked why

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.468
he was siding
with the oppressive regime

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.103
over his own
intelligence agencies,

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:54.140
and he gave an answer
that made no sense whatsoever.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.008
-Why are you siding
with the Saudis

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.242
over your own
intelligence agencies?

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:59.245
-Because it's America first,
to me.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.180
It's all about America first.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.882
-No, that's not America first.

00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:06.084
That's Saudi Arabia first.

00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:08.988
This guy is George Orwell's
worst nightmare,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.389
including the fact
that his brain

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.591
stopped developing in 1984.

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.792
[ Laughter ]

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:15.328
The President
is an authoritarian

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.129
who demands loyalty
and punishes his enemies.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.064
He'll turn on
even the people closest to him,

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:20.433
but he'll stand by you

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.735
as long as you shower him
with gold,

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.970
also known as...

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.404
-Golden showers.

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:26.906
-This has been
"A Closer Look."

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:30.543
[ Cheers and applause ]
