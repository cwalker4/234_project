00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
Now are those yours or
are you borrowing them?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.170

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.033
- Yup

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:03.490
- I thought you were younger than that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.560
- No well if you took an
x-ray you'd know how old I was

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.404
- That's what I always say

00:01:08.404 --> 00:01:09.650
- They say black don't
crack but just take an x-ray

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.933
what's all that cholesterol?

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.068
- But you've been around for a long time

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:16.901
- A long time long time

00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:18.740
- A long time and happy anniversary

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.790
- Thank you thank you

00:01:22.664 --> 00:01:25.270
- I don't know that much about
you I had no idea that you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.474
33 years married

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.307
- Yeah

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.720
- That's all of your life

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270
- That's my whole, I've been married

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.700
since I was 21 years old

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.550
- You owe her

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.610
- Yeah I do for real that
that why she gotta stay

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.443
- Yes

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:39.276
- She gotta stay

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:40.463
- Children?

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.710
- Oh yeah my children
are what, I don't know

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.540
- There something older
and out of the house?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.610
- Well not really cause
now they millennials

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.500
you know millennials never leave

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.120
- Oh okay

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.370
- Like its hard to respect somebody

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.970
when they still sleeping in a double bed

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.803
- Exactly

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.827
- I graduated from college
but you still don't have

00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:58.983
Spiderman sheets so I don't get it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.530
- Where'd you meet your wife?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190
- I met her at the LA
Times I was a sales rep

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.220
and she was a sales rep too

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
and I knew I would marry
her the first time I saw her

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.280
- Did you want

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.113
- She didn't know she didn't know

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:12.920
- Did you originally
want to be a comedian?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.360
- I wanted to be something I didn't know

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.193
- Where are you from?

00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:17.890
- I'm from 135th and
Avalon so I grew up here

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.080
- Oh right here

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080
- No, in Los Angeles

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.220
- Oh right there

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.423
- And when you say 135th
black people they're like oh

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:29.020
- White people are like I don't I don't

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.050
I see it on the news sometimes

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.030
- Is that the hood?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.030
- Yeah well I think
everybody I grew up with

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.450
is either dead or in jail

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.283
- Oh okay

00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:40.910
- I think it's pretty but I always knew

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.260
I would be something I just
didn't necessarily know

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.820
- Know what? Well you're a pretty big deal

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.333
look let's talk hot topics.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.590
Now we talked about you here
on hot topics awhile ago.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.120
You were at war with our love Terry Crews

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.580
and I couldn't figure out
what you were fighting over

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.260
so then I did some digging and
it was something about Terry

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.940
not punching a man in the
face because a man grabbed

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.075
him in the (censored)

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.630
- Right I don't think that's unreasonable

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.463
- Do retell

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.283
Okay nevermind

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:16.710
- Like like like he got
mad because he thought that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.660
I was a emasculate which
I wasn't I was tellin him

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.970
you know his agent grabbed
him and he was shocked

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.030
and obviously that's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.960
- They were at a public event
and lots people were there

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.810
people were dressed in suits
Mrs. Crews Terry's long wife

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530
was there as well and
the agent out of nowhere

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.530
grabbed Terry in his privates
and Terry was talking about it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.363
on TV.

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:38.430
On Hot Topics and so DL said

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.053
well why didn't you punch him in the face?

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:40.886
- Right

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.690
- As apposed to just swatting
him and you know being like

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.340
ew ew ew

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.220
- The thing was that's your
agent your agent works for you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.710
like you can't touch my (mumbles)

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.750
But I that's not

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.140
This is not gonna this
is my general philosophy

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.831
there are few a very few
things that black people own.

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:04.760
- Yeah

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.000
- We can't, we're told
where to live and what to do

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.730
and how far we can go the only
thing we own is our person

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.400
and you not gonna put your hands on me.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.780
I don't care who you are
you're not gonna do it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.550
- And terry's thing was that
he didn't wanna perpetuate

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.650
being that big, angry black man

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.370
- Right but you can earn it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.290
like if you violate my person

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.070
you've earned everything
you finna right get.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.310
Everything and I don't
think like this whole notion

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.610
that we all have to think
alike and process things

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.010
like they made he's a big man

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.610
but they made more than
just one like it's the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.750
my father said never start a fight

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.237
but if somebody touches
you you'll finish it

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:40.160
that's good I don't think that that's

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.460
- Very popular saying
from fathers everywhere

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.850
so have you two made up

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.180
- No we haven't

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.013
- You haven't made up?

00:04:46.013 --> 00:04:47.530
- No cause we didn't
ever have a conversation

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.600
it was just a Twitter beef

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.640
- Is it a conversation or is it like

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.800
everybody's over 50 come on

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.080
- Listen I don't, I
disagree with the notion

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.850
that you are emasculating somebody because

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.010
you defend yourself.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.800
People they have laws in this country

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.480
you could get scared in Florida

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.030
shoot somebody just cause
you scared I'd be damned

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.050
I think that there's this notion that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.100
we all have to have the
same ideas and thoughts

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.933
I do not

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:13.470
- No we like different thoughts here

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.280
I'm just shocked that
it's you two going at it

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.760
over something that seems to stupid

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.593
- It is stupid

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:19.180
- But okay let's talk about R. Kelly

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.013
- Yes

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.450
- Alright we're moving on Hop
Topics here with DL Hughley

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.310
Gayle King did the
interview and your thoughts?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.140
- That looked like every
black woman who heard a man

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.863
that was full of
(censored) I've ever seen.

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:36.038
You know why I know that look Wendy?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.427
Did you see Gayle? Uh Robert

00:05:39.427 --> 00:05:41.980
- Yeah yes yes yes yes

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.870
- All she didn't say was

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.865
do I look like BooBoo the
Fool? That's all she would do

00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:48.398
and I know that look because
my wife has done that before

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:51.278
so you don't know this
bitch huh? You don't? Okay

00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:54.420
You don't? Alright. I've
seen that look before

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.300
- How guilty do you think R. Kelly is?

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.680
- To me it says a lot about a society

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.328
like if you look at the
charges they're from 98, 99

00:06:03.328 --> 00:06:06.260
it says a lot about
society that waited till

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.910
something was on a documentary
before they got enraged

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.383
it says a lot about society.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.350
Our level of empathy and
rage should not be connected

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.398
to a remote and that
seems disingenuous to him.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:19.630
- And how about him being illiterate?

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.576
- Yeah I am too so (Laughing)

00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:24.590
- I mean

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.390
- He believe he can fly but not read

00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:33.590
- I think we live in a
horrible situation and I think

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.480
people get mad at this all the time.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.915
Fame allows you a lot

00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:38.400
- Yeah

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.300
- We knew what he was doing to Aleigh

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.120
we knew what he was doing in that video

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.520
Michael Jackson we knew
he was sleeping with

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.180
now whether you believe
that he did it or not

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.470
I think they in the same
in that whether you believe

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.000
R. Kelly did it or Michael Jackson

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.290
They're both horrible babysitters

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.110
I don't think we're gonna argue about that

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.360
both horrible babysitters

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.310
- What were your thoughts on the

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.140
Michael Jackson documentary?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.430
- I think that it's horrible
again that society allow

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.280
I don't care who you are nobody's sleeping

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.280
a grown man is not sleeping
with my 7 year old son

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.971
it's not gonna happen
I don't care who comes.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.180
And I believe if we love our
children like we say they do

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.340
I think if we're going to
like people always ask me

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.420
and I still love I'm fans of their music.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.373
Like when you're black

00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:19.310
- Yeah you can separate

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.830
- Yeah I can't when you
black you gotta separate like

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.210
like how could you listen to R. Kelly

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.810
and sing R. Kelly and
Michael Jackson songs

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.280
the same way I can sing
the national anthem

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.113
that's the same way I can do that

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:30.230
same way I can do that so

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:36.686
- Wow

00:07:36.686 --> 00:07:39.950
When I grew up if a
piece of bread was moldy

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.150
You cut that mold off that
you are the rest of that bread

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.983
- Right right

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:44.520
- You don't punish the whole bread

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.070
- All the bread ain't goin away

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:52.475
- Do you feel that, oh nevermind

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.110
look you're kings of comedy

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.790
he's one of the original Kings of Comedy.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.094
This is where I think we first met you

00:08:00.094 --> 00:08:02.690
I don't know you before Kinds of Comedy

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.950
and you landed with
this great lot of people

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.035
all of you did well on your own

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:08.670
- Right

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.963
- Are you still touring?

00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:11.840
- Of course I still tour everywhere yes

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.400
- Do you, would you tour with them?

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.780
- Of course I love those guys

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.580
- Like an organized tour
if they just happened

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.800
to show up and pop up and then

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.680
- Well I'm touring with Cedric
and George Lopez right now

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.997
so we do that all the time but

00:08:22.997 --> 00:08:24.160
- That's good

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.870
- I'll say this, when you love each other

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.190
and you're brothers you
don't always have to

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.890
see things eye to eye like I

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.470
but I did resent the notion
like when Steve and Monique

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.510
had that conversation I can't say you know

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.210
what everybody else's
perspective was but when they

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.410
- What conversation? Refresh us

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.950
- Like when they were he was on our show

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.630
and they went back and forth
and a lot of people felt

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.580
like he was tellin her how to ya know

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.200
I can't say

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.510
- I haven't heard I don't know

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.470
- Wow you (laughing)

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.400
- What is going

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.233
- We gotta switch seats here

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.469
- What is going on?

00:08:54.469 --> 00:08:58.530
- They had an argument
on his show about ya know

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.988
her process and selling out
and all this other stuff

00:09:01.988 --> 00:09:03.910
they were intimating each other about it

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.760
they took a 10 year

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.510
they took a 20 year old
joke and put it to today

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.240
and took him out of
character I'll tell you this

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.420
two men I know Steve Harvey
and George Lopez have done

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.490
more for people like I've known
them to save peoples houses

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.870
I've known them to loan
people money and bail them out

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.851
and never talk about it so
to kinda reduce him to just

00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:25.920
that was insulting to
me it's insulting to me

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.710
- Well congratulations on
oh by the way by the way

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.600
cause I'm from radio, you do radio

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.760
did Stevie Wonder fire you
from his radio station?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.650
I used to work at that station

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.200
I was (mumbles) at that station

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.323
What happened?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.410
- Cause Stevie like I was the
morning like I was a sidekick

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.451
and one day I said

00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:52.860
- To who, who was the lead kick?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.672
- It was Cliff Winston Cliff
the body was he passed on now

00:09:55.672 --> 00:09:56.690
- Okay

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.240
- So he was

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.782
And I said do you think
this station would this bad

00:09:59.782 --> 00:10:01.053
if Stevie could see?

00:10:05.702 --> 00:10:08.410
And 45 minutes later true
story he came down and

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.770
he called me into his
office and he said we think

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.470
I think you're being disrespectful

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.800
and I was (mumbles) like 20 seconds

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.510
and I said Stevie I'm
over here and he's like

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.960
and then he fired me
then he hired me again

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.700
then he came to my Christmas party

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.533
- Okay

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:26.420
- In December this year

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.870
- So this is wealthy DL Hughley now

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.360
- And he at my Christmas party and I said

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.180
you remember when you fired me?

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.730
And he said I would do it again

00:10:35.683 --> 00:10:37.434
- That's how grown people fight

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:38.862
you know what I mean?

00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:41.270
- And then I said I'm over here

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.257
and he didn't like that either

00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:44.940
(laughing)

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.510
- Congratulations on your new

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.510
- Its really nice

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.250
I have to say

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.780
- I know

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.900
- It's a pleasure meeting you I think that

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.160
- We've never met but I always heard

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.260
- We met before when you
were on radio and that was

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.310
- I always heard you didn't
like me and I didn't know what

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.830
- I heard you didn't like me too

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.470
- No here's how I am I'm fair

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.150
I like everybody until I you don't like me

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.270
- That's how I am

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.600
- And once I hear you don't
like me then I don't like you

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.500
- That's right

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.930
- So when I heard that you were booked

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.230
to come on the show I
was like oh he likes me?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.450
Or are we gonna fight
like how is this gonna

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.150
- But here's the thing, I
wouldn't of came if I didn't

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:21.430
like here's the Thing

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.960
- I would of invited
you though just to see

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.240
how it would go down

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.670
- Here's the thing I'm
not too different than you

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.090
I'm not scared to have people dislike me

00:11:30.952 --> 00:11:33.110
or I think that you have a
right to your perspective

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.320
and it the most expensive
piece of real estate

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.980
in the world is what's between your ears

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.832
- Yes

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:40.740
- You can't get a

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.710

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.430
I respect what you do

misunderstood but I'll say
this it's been a pleasure

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.575
