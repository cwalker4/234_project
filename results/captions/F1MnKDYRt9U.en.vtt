00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.600
(FEED THE FLAME)

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm here in the small 
 village of Iten, Kenya,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
home to the Kalenjin tribe 
 and some of the world's

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.240
most dominant 
 long-distance runners.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.120
The Kalenjin tribe makes up

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.280
0.6% of the world's population.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.200
They are always in the top 
 80-90%

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.760
of long-distance runners in 
 the world at any given time.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.760
I've been told their diet is 
 the driving force

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.960
to their success.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000
Over the next week, 
 I'll train, diet, and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.920
fully immerse myself into 
 the Kalenjin lifestyle.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.080
I want to find out about 
 their training regimen,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.280
motivation to compete, and what 
 exactly it is about their diet

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.960
that fuels their bodies 
 for long distance running.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.480
(SUNRISE - ITEN, KENYA)

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
Gladys Chesir is one of the 
 women to watch this year.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.000
She has been running 
 for almost a decade

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.120
and is a highly 
 decorated runner.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.120
She has almost won every race 
 that she has ever competed in

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.520
and has even recently 
 claimed the title

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.320
Fastest 10,000m In The World

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960
at last year's Diamond League.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.280
She is training for her first 
 Olympic trials this year

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.440
and is expected to make 
 the Kenyan team and place.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.440
Maybe with one-minute recovery, 
 we do only once in a few weeks,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.880
depending on the season.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.440
Hugo Van Den Broek is 
 coach to Gladys Chesir

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.880
and a famed and well-respected 
 member of the Iten community.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.360
I met Gladys in 2014.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.000
From the first time 
 I saw her run,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.280
I realised that she's 
 a very big talent.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200
She has such a big foundation.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.720
She's really focused 
 and very professional.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.080
I think she has everything 
 it takes to become

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.960
one of the best 
 athletes in the world.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.920
I know Gladys always use a 
 little bit faster than I ask

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.400
and I shouldn't 
 ask for too fast.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.200
Most of the time

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.280
most Kalinjens have run.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.520
They have retired 
 like Lornah Kiplagat.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.120
I want to be like Lornah.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.520
Now if you meet a kid, 
 they say,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
"I want to run 
 faster than Gladys!"

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.680
So that motivation comes 
 when you're young.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.600
The circumstances here 
 definitely contribute.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.160
Training here at high altitude,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.920
it looks like training 
 has more impact.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.720
Plus the fact that we're in 
 the tropics, it's hot.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.200
The roads are really a good 
 training for your lower legs.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.440
What at least you're doing 
 90% of the time

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.680
is just running in nature.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.320
Maybe also the diet helps.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.480
The food is always healthy, 
 it's always natural.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.680
It has impact on the recovery.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.720
They eat lots of vegetables. 
 Once in a while, they eat meat

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.840
but meat is a kind of a luxury.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.560
They eat beans, rice, ugali, 
 which is just boiled corn meal,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.840
you would say.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.320
Most of the big marathons 
 now prepare ugali,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120
because the Kenyans like that.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.760
In the first place 
 they have this diet

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.560
because they have 
 no other option,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.360
because they have 
 not enough money.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.560
Ugali is like...

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.800
You need only a small portion 
 of it to get enough calories.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.120
Hello! I'm Rosie.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.560
Thanks for meeting me.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.400
Are you Kalenjin?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.240
Yes, I'm Kalenjin.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.160
- Specifically Keiyo. 
 - OK.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.440
This is my home district, 
 my home country.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.040
So what's the ideal breakfast, 
 lunch and dinner

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.200
for a long-distance 
 athlete here?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.920
You know there are no 
 specifics.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.480
You can't say, "Take this, 
 take this, take this."

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
It is what is available on 
 the table for them.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.280
So long as it has the main - 
 the carbohydrates,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.280
the protein, the vitamins,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.560
to meet their requirements.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.160
I've been learning a 
 lot about ugali

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.320
and a lot of people have 
 been telling me that

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.040
it's a much healthier 
 carb than other carbs.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.000
Ugali is a very simple meal.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.160
It's a source of carbohydrates.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.680
It's complex.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.960
It is milled with the outer 
 husk

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.800
so it has roughage 
 and it has fibre.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.440
It is locally made here.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.920
So no additives, 
 no preservatives added.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800
So simple.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.120
And then the maize germ 
 in it provides iron.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.640
And then it is also cheaper

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680
compared to other 
 carbohydrates.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
So there's not even a training 
 diet specific for the athletes?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.080
The food that 
 they eat is actually

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.400
the food that 
 their families eat.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.160
- Hello! 
 - Hello!

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.600
Yes, you are welcome.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.920
We plant the maize in April.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.400
By September or October,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040
it will be ready.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.560
So that is the time 
 when we can harvest the maize,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.120
so that we can make ugali.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.880
You only need the seeds,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.640
don't need fertiliser.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.320
Yeah, it's not expensive.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.200
Most of the people 
 here, they grow maize.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.120
So most families grow their 
 own?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.240
Yeah. We like ugali because it 
 makes your body very strong.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.120
So now you're going to show 
 me how to make ugali?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.480
Yeah, I'm going to show you.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.360
Step one - find the perfect 
 maize and collect.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.480
Step two - remove kernels.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.560
Step three - collect the 
 perfect kernels

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.960
and keep only the good ones.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280
Step four - finely 
 grind the maize.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.120
Step five - boil water.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.760
Step six - add little by little 
 the finely ground maize

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.200
and stir with a wooden spoon.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.960
It's good! You can 
 soak up a lot of flavour.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.680
You could eat it 
 with a lot of things.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.680
- Huh? 
 - Yeah.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.240
The idea is to add something.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.760
Like stew. Maybe a soup.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.320
It soaks it, no?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.560
Yeah, but eating it bare,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.080
it's very difficult. 
 It's very hard.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.400
Viola Lagat comes from a 
 decorated family of runners,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.000
one being her legendary 
 brother, Bernard Lagat,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.480
a two-time world champion 
 and Olympic silver medallist.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.160
Viola has yet to compete in the 
 Olympics and she faces

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.640
a lot of pressure to make 
 the team this year.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.520
Viola went to college and 
 trained in the US

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.960
for the past few years.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.320
And despite being 
 considered a clear underdog,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.240
she is determined to make the 
 team and make both her family

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.520
and country proud.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.440
So huge difference 
 from the US, right?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.920
- Huge! 
 - Yeah.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.200
You might feel sore after 
 because of the altitude.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.120
I feel that every time 
 I come back here.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.640
- Oh, really? 
 - Yeah.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680
Hi!

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.840
Iten is almost like 
 a running community.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.200
So if I go on a run 
 and I feel like

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.720
someone could help me, I could 
 just jump in their group

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.840
and just run with them.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.400
- OK 
 - Whoo!

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.120
- You're sweating already. 
 - Yeah! You're not?! Shit!

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.640
That was fun.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.360
Viola Kibiwot 
 is a two-time 1,500m

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.800
Olympic runner and has been 
 running for most of her life

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.360
here in Kenya.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.120
As a highly accomplished 
 veteran runner,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.560
Kibiwot has taken Viola Lagat 
 under her wings,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.520
and has been mentoring the 
 young hopeful to help

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.800
her make the team.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.760
They train together, eat 
 together

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.160
and even live together.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160
How about we make 
 a deal for 2017?

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.000
You're welcome to 5k.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.680
Well, after... No, I'll come to 
 five when you retire from five

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.360
because you're going 
 to kick my butt.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.320
But you 
 still have a long way to go.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.680
I know.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.320
Supper now.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.920
Today's good. It doesn't 
 have a lot of fat.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.600
You know what, I actually don't 
 enjoy eating meat in the US.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.880
I like it in Kenya.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.840
I think it's because I know 
 that it's organic here.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.760
How long have you been running?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.960
More than 15 years.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.560
Wow! So she can definitely 
 give you a lot of tips.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.280
It started when I 
 was in primary school.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320
Every time you are late,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.960
you have to 
 run from home to school

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.680
and then from home, 
 you go for lunch time.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.960
The bell goes, 
 and you have to run.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.320
I am from a family of ten 
 and I'm the youngest.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.840
So all my older 
 siblings used to run.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.040
I've never been to the 
 Olympics.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.960
For me, it would be 
 a dream come true.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.320
It would mean so 
 much to run, especially

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.880
in front of my family because

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.640
they'll be coming over to 
 watch.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.240
And it would also change my 
 career. Being an Olympian would

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.200
open doors for me and...

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.320
I have a lot of kids looking up 
 to me in my village,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.120
and when I was growing up 
 I have a brother-in-law

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.400
who passed away when 
 I was in high school and

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.720
he always encouraged me to do 
 the best in everything

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.040
that I do, so...

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.520
running reminds me of what he 
 wanted me to achieve.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.920
And also the kids in my 
 village,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.360
whenever I'm running out there,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.880
they just cheer for me and they 
 tell me that they're following

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920
on my footsteps.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.840
I told her 
 she has to run very fast.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.760
Not 4.05 because I ran 3.59 
 when I was running 5,000

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.880
so I want her to 
 run maybe 4.01, 4.02.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.000
OK, can you guys tell me 
 what we're going to have?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.560
This is managu.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.640
That's beef stew, with ugali.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.200
So in Kenya we have 42 tribes

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.800
and every tribe has 
 their own food.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.280
Kalenjin's main is ugali.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.000
Without ugali, it's 
 like you haven't taken a meal.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.880
Do you ever miss being in Kenya 
 and eating...?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.520
Yeah, I miss having 
 that family time.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.920
In the US, mostly people 
 just live on their own

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.440
and you have to eat by 
 yourself.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.560
So when I'm home, 
 our neighbours come over

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.360
and you'll eat 
 together sometimes.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.480
And like Viola today,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.560
she didn't even eat lunch until 
 I got back

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.560
from my training. She cooked 
 and waited for me to get home.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.920
- Do you also drink mursik? 
 - Yes.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.560
Do you drink that regularly? 
 Mursik?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.880
Mm, we drink fresh more.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.160
Mostly fresh.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.680
But if you go to the village, 
 most of the people like mursik.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.120
Viola and Viola told me I had 
 to try

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.640
this drink called mursik.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.080
I'm going to meet a couple that 
 provides the town with

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.680
locally made mursik 
 and see what it's all about.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.320
Mursik is a fermented milk.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.920
This is the calabash.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.480
This is now the 
 first process of preparing

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.680
the calabash before 
 they put the milk inside.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.360
The inside of the calabash is 
 all smeared with the ashes

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.720
from that tree.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.320
The special 
 type of tree they're using

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.680
will bring a 
 good flavour to the milk.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.800
And put milk into the calabash

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.840
and leave it for like 
 two to three days.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.440
It is already fermented.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.200
So if I drink this I should be 
 able to do a marathon?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.000
Yeah, you can just do 
 something good but not once,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.760
you have to 
 drink it several times.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.880
Smells like a 
 really strong cheese.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.160
Ah, more or less. 
 It's more of less like cheese.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.480
The fermentation process 
 breaks the proteins in the milk

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.880
down to simple proteins 
 to be easily absorbed

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.240
into the blood stream,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.800
providing energy and 
 the proteins that we need.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.640
Mursik also has live culture,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.200
so it maintains the good 
 bacteria in the stomach.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240
Cheers!

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.080
OK, it's not bad.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.800
I just feel off.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.240
I think it's one of those 
 things that,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.160
unless you're Kenyan, 
 maybe it's not your thing.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.720
We're almost a litre down...

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.680
I'm feeling like 
 it's time to go to sleep.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.840
She looks good today. 
 The way she's running...

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.960
I can see already.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.160
You make sure, at the first 
 line you are at maximum speed.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.200
I'm going to cook with Albert 
 and you're going to relax.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.680
This is your day off.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720
OK!

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.320
I'm at the market right now 
 with Gladys's husband, Albert,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.440
and we're going to look for the 
 perfect chicken

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.480
for dinner tonight.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.560
Oh, my goodness!

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.240
This is the cock.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.720
Really? We're going to eat 
 a cock?

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.200
Yeah.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.600
He's a nice cock?

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.840
Oh, my God.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.920
- Do I need gloves? 
 - No gloves.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.280
- Don't say mercy. No mercy. 
 - OK, no mercy.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.680
The whole neighbourhood 
 is eating this chicken.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.040
- Yeah, no mercy. 
 - OK, let's do it.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.120
Look at that neck. 
 This is guillotine style, OK.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.560
Faster, Rosie... 
 Faster! Faster!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.720
So, I saw you today on the 
 track and you were outrunning

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.960
even the men.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.320
How did you feel about 
 your training today?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.280
I'm happy because I've 
 improved.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.240
I was sick one month ago.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.160
Now I can 
 continue with my training.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.560
I have to believe in myself.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.200
You know, if you are no stress,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.920
nobody disturbing you...

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.600
you can run good.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.920
Do you think that after you win 
 the Olympics

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.120
and other marathons, 
 and set more records...

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.680
you'll still stay here?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.640
Yeah. Because here I started 
 my training,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.960
so everything is here.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.160
Life in Kenya is easy.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.600
Not like in some 
 other countries.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.160
Like, for us, we can 
 have food from our farm.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.600
Everything is 
 grown from a farm.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.560
If you don't have, 
 your neighbour asks.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.120
Like me, I can assist my 
 neighbour if he doesn't have.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.480
Do good and do your own way.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.440
It's clear that there are 
 many theories and reasons

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.840
as to why the Kalenjin produce

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.800
the most amazing distance 
 runners.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800
It's a perfect combination 
 of elevation,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.600
climate, diet,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.600
lifestyle and genes.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.480
Everyone here in Iten 
 seems to be so connected.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.640
To their food,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.720
their environment,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.000
their land and their families.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.880
When I was starting running,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.200
no shoes, 
 no training shoes.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.840
But my parents 
 were assisting me a lot.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.400
I said, "Ah! Let me 
 try my best."

(SHE PLANS TO MAKE THE TEAM IN 
 2020)

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.600
I would like to 
 have a small farm

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.920
because when I get home 
 I enjoy working on the farm

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.200
with my mom,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.600
growing vegetables.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.640
I feel like life goes by 
 so fast in America.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.080
Here in Kenya, it's just about 
 running and relaxing,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.880
and waiting to run 
 the next day.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.560
I've witnessed athletes 
 of all levels.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.120
From beginning runners to 
 world-class Olympians,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.640
training on the same dirt roads 
 at 6am sharp

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.960
every day of the week.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.880
Food is absolutely the common 
 thread here in Iten.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.600
But also the Kalenjin's 
 undisputed discipline,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.520
combined with their ability 
 to maintain

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.800
a balanced lifestyle,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.080
leads to their 
 constant accolades.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.320
It works for them

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.880
and they will 
 continue to do so

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.320
for generations to come.
