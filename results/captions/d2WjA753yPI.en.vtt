Narrator: Today on "Dream Digs,"

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.020
we go inside the $7 million

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.970
New York City loft that has a zip line,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.093
a full-size spiral slide,
a climbing wall, and more.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.053
Lucy: So much fun.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.283
Aly: I'm Aly Weisman,
and this is "Dream Digs."

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.720
Pediatrician Beth Worley has
four kids under the age of 14.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.280
Each child got to design
their own dream bedroom,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.523
and nothing was off-limits.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.060
Catherine, Alex, Lucy, and
Caspian are going to show us

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.830
not only their one-of-a-kind bedrooms,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.920
but also the family's biggest splurge,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.545
their most prized possession,

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.795
and the best seat in the house.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.930
Today we're outside the New York City loft

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.343
that's every kid's dream come true.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.350
Beth: I was concerned
about having four children

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.690
in a New York apartment and cooped up

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.490
in the wintertime with nothing to do.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.340
So we decided to create
a veritable playground

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.818
in the back of our apartment.

00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:23.790
All: Welcome to our apartment!

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.870
Aly: The 4,000-square-foot loft

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.380
takes over the entire floor
of a residential building.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.840
It has a 50-foot-wide great
room with 11-foot-tall ceilings,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.620
14 windows, and a perfectly framed

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.793
view of the Empire State Building.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.260
It was in the large chef's kitchen

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.870
that we found the
family's biggest splurge:

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.360
a 17-foot custom concrete kitchen island.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.970
Beth: One of my favorite
things in this apartment

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.740
is this cement countertop, and they came

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.280
in with big cement mixers and built

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.800
the structure and then
poured the concrete.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.860
We designed this to be able to seat eight

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.680
or 10 kids along it, and
then it also transitions

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.820
really well to adult dinner parties.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.410
Because I love entertaining
so much, it makes sense

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.670
that this would be my biggest splurge.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.930
Aly: Behind the large kitchen

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.000
and living room area
is the children's wing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060
The hallway connecting all
four siblings' bedrooms

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.530
comes complete with the family's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.573
most prized possession: a zip line.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.310
Beth: This zip line is our
most prized possession.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.010
We decided we wanted a zip line and worked

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.310
with our architect to
figure out how to do it.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:42.560
Lucy: When my younger
brother was really little,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.490
we'd take a little bag, it was canvas,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.910
and we'd hook it on, and
we'd push him in the bag.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.320
It wasn't super safe, but it was fun.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.210
This zip line is my most prized

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.330
possession. It's the most unique thing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.170
in the whole house. Definitely, 100%.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.543
Outside of my room, I spend
most of my time on this thing.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.490
Aly: Each child got to choose

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.453
one unique feature for their room.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.840
Beth: Late in the summer
of 2012, I boarded a plane

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.860
with my four young children in tow.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.350
We were leaving a big suburban house

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.330
in Menlo Park and moving to Manhattan.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
About an hour into the flight to JFK,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.130
I began to panic, and partly
to alleviate my anxiety

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.440
about the move and partly
to entertain my kids

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.000
during the flight, I
tasked them with drawing

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.360
pictures of what their
dream room would look like.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.270
Luckily, my kids are super creative,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.653
and they had just a bevy of ideas,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.310
many of which we were able to do.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.760
We searched for an architect

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760
and interviewed a few who
thought we were a little crazy,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.160
and then found Studio
DB who took the project,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.790
and they were very excited to run with it.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.340
Lucy: We have my lovely rock wall.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.070
So much fun.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.491
Aly: I sat down with the kids

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.430
to learn the inspirations
behind their designs.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.280
And how did you choose a climbing wall

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.590
as your feature in your bedroom?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.480
Lucy: Because I love
climbing, I climb on anything.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.550
Aly: All right, well let me see, we gotta

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.210
put your skills to the test.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.870
Am I too big for this wall,
or should I try climbing?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.073
Lucy: No way, you should
definitely climb it, come on.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.013
Aly: I did it!

00:04:42.013 --> 00:04:42.920
Lucy: You did it!

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:44.890
Do you wanna try to jump down?

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.490
Aly: No way, Jose.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.740
The siblings' bedrooms are all attached

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.240
by a tunnel that goes above each room.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.020
These are some pretty sweet digs,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.930
what makes this room so special?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.210
Catherine: The monkey bars.
You know, you have those few

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.430
adults who are like "Oh, I'm
too old, I can't do anything,"

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.530
and then you have those
who are just gonna go out

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.780
and do a full headstand.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.451
Aly: I love it.
Catherine: Being upside down.

00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:11.680
Aly: Oh, my gosh, look at this
cool room. This is awesome.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.240
Is this a world map?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.210
Alex: It is a world map.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.200
I used to and still do love maps.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.350
Aly: What's your favorite
place in the world?

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.920
Alex: New York City.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.750
Aly: Good answer, does it have anything

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.280
to do with you get to come home

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.210
to the coolest apartment in New York City?

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.770
Alex: Yes, that is a big factor.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.250
Aly: Alex's room is also home

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.140
to one very special feature:
the best seat in the house.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.540
It's a custom hammock in the kid's tunnel

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.330
that hangs above his bedroom. Alex

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.800
even has his own ladder to get there.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.483
Are you sure this can support me?

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:45.457
Alex: Oh yeah.             
Aly: I'm a lot bigger than you.

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:46.340
Alex: Oh yeah.

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:47.948
Aly: You pinky promise?

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:48.806
Alex: I do.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.100
Aly: Above Caspian's room is the entrance

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.623
to a spiral slide that
empties into the media room.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.230
Lucy: This is our playroom. It's awesome.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.430
Caspian: It has a slide.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.920
Lucy: Awesomest slide ever.
You can climb into it,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.943
go down from it, climb onto it.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.940
So one of the fun things
about this slide is

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.480
you can climb up from the outside,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.449
and now I feel like I'm
the king of this house.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.220
Aly: But the kids don't have
total control of the house.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.523
Welcome to Mom's master bedroom.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.550
Beth: I would like to say
that this is my sanctuary,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.950
but that would be
stretching it a little bit.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.850
Pretty much every time I come in,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.100
there are an extra child or two

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.961
in my bed and some in the bathtub.

00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:47.128
Lucy: So much fun.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.003
Beth: But come on in to my secret spot.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.690
So this is my study. When I really wanna

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.920
be alone and not hear anyone else,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.960
this is the best place in the house.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.600
I have two doors on each
side that block out the noise

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.113
from the rest of the house. Goodbye!

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.200
Aly: Now that mom is in her quiet space,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.250
it was time for me to
unleash my inner child.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.050
Lucy: Aly, you have to try this!

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.190
Aly: Is it my turn now?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.223
Lucy: Yeah, it's your turn.

00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:19.607
Aly: Uh oh, are you
guys gonna push me down?

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:20.440
Lucy: Definitely.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.835
Aly: OK, let's see. Three, two, one.

00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.552
Both: Ready, set, go.

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:57.690
Aly: I'm tired. I gotta go home.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.620
All right, you guys tuckered me out today.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.620
Thanks for the most fun day ever.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.580
Have fun, bye guys!
