No

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.059
Aria Shanti Shanti actually what I think I thought it was just very old-fashioned very cabaret

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:11.559
 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.449
Very affected just didn't get it. Did you want to see more energy no?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.580
It's a location what I want actually don't want to see anything. It's just it's just you a shanty

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.420
Wow

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.930
Guess what that old kind of soul R&amp;B singer sister you are

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.250
well, I

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.729
Just sounds old-fashioned. No matter what you do

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.029
Did I engage you did I hole it yes all that?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.540
That's tough randy. I got a bath - you look amazing though. I got a pass stuff

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.649
Yeah, I think I think you should

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.649
Go up for some Broadway audition. - honestly let me sing something ok - Auntie. It's a nurse

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.308
We have so get changing my mind. I mean you don't understand

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.469
I do you don't I do you don't I have fought so hard for this

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.070
No, I shan't see with it a chevy with the greatest respect you takin already two spots in Hollywood

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.419
It didn't work out then but how is my intonation? How's my timing? How is my pitch with anything, okay?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.000
Great problem was you didn't get your voice together. There was a problem with my voice ten times

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What do you need to hear from me?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.659
It seems the auditions here in New York

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.379
I've taken a melodramatic turn prepare yourself for these are the days of our idols I

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.078
Don't know how to say this but I feel it and I know that you know what I'm talking about

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.249
I know that you know that I can do this and I know that you have watched me grow

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.049
And I know that you know what it's like to struggle with your weight and the struggle with the music

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.399
And I have waited and I worked harder than anybody

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.430
Anybody up there and every time I got more and more

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.119
Encouragement and opinion it and I've internalized it

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.129
And I have fought harder than I ever thought me to be capable of fighting

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.280
And I understand your position

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.729
But I really in the depths of my soul belief that you don't have this right

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.300
In the depth of my soul, I know

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.119
That it was America got a chance. That's the only thing you haven't given me. It's the chance for America to view me

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.539
That's the only thing and if America saw me people who loved me

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500
These three are American and they don't

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.280
- that's the problem and did a near where it anything yes anything?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.519
Ash, ash, Auntie Auntie. Sorry. It's a nut

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.470
It was a pleasure to meet you

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.269
I still think you're making a move

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.250
And before I leave this room

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.849
If there's anything I can do to change your mind

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.809
It didn't work. You weren't good enough today. Get over it, It's a no. Okay, Sorry.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.079
Thank you.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.599
Oh, for God's sake

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.100
Dreaming about you and me

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:47.300
Can I ask you a question? Do you in your heart, really think you can sing? No.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.200
Okay, that's really helpful. So why are you here?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.500
Listen to me, I'm not a singer.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.000
Oh, wow, we agree.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.950
Your standing there shaking your head the entire time I'm belting.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:09.820
You are - Paula, you're looking at him, and you're laughing at me. No, I'm laughing with you. So you came because you wanted to be on TV.  No. Why are you why are you here?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.160
Now I'm gonna get all emotional um.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.900
I'm not a singer. No, we've got that.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.239
You know I really love to sing, I really do, and my friends make fun of me all the time because I'm tone deaf

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.050
but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.859
Yeah, well yeah, that's true.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.419
I don't need to hear you say it. I know it. Okay, fair.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.959
Even if I don't sing, I can be the next American idol. Why? And you want to know why?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.039
Yeah, I'd love to know why. You want to know why? Yeah. Because I've never sung before.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.169
And so you can teach me how to sing oh yes. Huh? Yes, I think I practice I practice with like music

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.478
I can't believe I'm crying this much.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.090
I think you don't have to sing to be an American idol

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.509
I really don't I think Paris Hilton can't really sing. She's not an American Idol.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.369
I'm actually aware of that.  I know you don't realize it, but I

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:18.319
am a little but smart here don't these people behind just turn around see these five winners and one thing and they were all great singers

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.320
This is a singing competition

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.050
It's not a competition of like trying to find the best person that can't sing but really wants you. You know what Randy?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:35.119
Yes, these people can sing yes, I can but I could be the only American idol who has never say before hey

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.370
I can't sing either. Look at this, I'm unique! Woooo!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.410
Sarah I don't think there's anything left to say I think you actually said it all

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.889
You entered a singing competition and you don't sing so

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:52.788
What do you think we're gonna say we have to we have to know yes or no well no Paul are you for though -?

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.639
It's a no sorry

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.510
And I'm sorry that you're upset and you guys are eating dancing

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.029
So you got what you wanted you got some fame out of what I wanted are you kidding? I?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
Wanted to be the next minute

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.310
Thanks, Sarah

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.099
And just beginning no, it's not if you get it. That's pretty obvious

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.820
Well at least she's not harboring any resentment towards the judges. It's absolutely rude like you are people

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.180
We are people, too

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.099
Just because we don't have a million dollars

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:38.299
If we don't have singing deals doesn't mean that we don't have lives and doesn't mean that we don't have important things, not luck

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.509
New York is weird today as the weird day today

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.449
I have become friends with these guys yeah

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.419
I remember and with Ray and Jen and build a security guy because I am betty or forever

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.879

First-class because they have the money to do that

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.990
First one second one Hollywood is New Jersey with celebrities. It's not even that great

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:24.729
On every single show we need a british to judge us Americans. I'm sick of it Paula Abdul's didn't even talk on my behalf

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.440
She's sitting there like she's in the middle of world who are 80? What's the wrong with her?

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.320
She could have swore she could have opened up and said something

00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:43.819
Okay, okay, okay, Junie. What normally happens when you perform in public?

00:09:47.699 --> 00:09:52.308
Depends I mean I sang with George Clinton. They liked it there you know sometimes when I sing other places

Okay, all right. It was fantastically terrible dearly, but all right I

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:11.809
mean like dick pop artists you notice if you do someone to chick doing something like

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:13.889

How would you sum up date two in New York State two or three?

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.589
Bra serious - okay, how many for you?

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.570

Thanks for watching thank you. Thank you Julie

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.750

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.780
but

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.679
What makes you audition for this competition?

Would you like me to sing like myself? I have a ton of different voices

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.690
Right what were those?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.979
You don't want to hear them give a lot of voices, huh?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.330
Yeah, are they talking all the time yeah? I think so. What do they thing now

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.990
they're saying

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.350
I didn't know judges on American idol would actually think I was terrible

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.980
They're also saying mark McGrath is a hottie they're also saying good judge um oh

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.489

All that would tell me that they're wrong

00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:44.769
But still the fact of these setbacks

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.920
That doesn't make me want to pursue any kind of singing career

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.809
Not unless I'm going to be a lead singer in a rock band now. I want to say big to simon and

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:57.099
Randy and Martin Grass even though he's a hottie I won't deny that

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.899
Although I'm not going to say Paula because at least she was nice and at least she was sweet

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:05.498
She's got the sweet heart and I can't say anything bad about her. Oh

00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:12.789
It's that off her chest mary collected herself enough for one last performance. I know I gave you your freedom

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.740
But I still feel time since you've never heard good

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:24.009
But you know you lad said we weren't right to insist that we were wrong

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:29.109
Why didn't you realize through her for you then me oh wow?

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:37.149
But remains my empty shell I want a human tight as I could

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.179
That one brought in in my personal hell

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:47.459
you

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.350
you

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.590
you
