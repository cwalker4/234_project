&gt;&gt;&gt; A SECRETIVE MOTHER, A

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.966 line:92%
GRANDFATHER SHE HAD NEVER MET

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.666 line:92%
AND A FAMILY HISTORY SHE NEVER

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.033 line:92%
EXPECTED.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.866 line:92%
GAIL COULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.466 line:92%
WHAT SHE WOULD DISCOVER WHEN SHE

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.000 line:92%
DECIDED TO DIG INTO HER MOTHER'S

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.433 line:92%
MYSTERIOUS PAST.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.400 line:92%
WATCH.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.700 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY MOM AND DAD.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.500 line:92%
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, MY FATHER

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.033 line:92%
WENT TO HIS GRAVE NEVER KNOWING

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.266 line:92%
MY MOM'S SECRET.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.400 line:92%
MY PARENTS MET DURING WORLD WAR

II.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.433 line:92%
MY MOM WAS AN ABSOLUTELY

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.900 line:92%
STUNNING LLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.066 line:92%
MY DAD, HE HAD A GREAT SENSE OF

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.366 line:92%
HUMOR.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.700 line:92%
HE SERVED IN THE PACIFIC.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.066 line:92%
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THAT.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.100 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN 1944, AFTER THE

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.733 line:92%
WAR, HAROLD MARRIED OLIVEIRA

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.100 line:92%
FREDERICK.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.500 line:92%
THEY SETTLED IN PALMA, OHIO.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.300 line:92%
THROUGHOUT HER CHILDHOOD, GAIL

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.966 line:92%
SAID HER MOTHER MYSTIFIED HER IN

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:01.600 line:92%
SOME WAYS.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.466 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS METICULOUS ABOUT HER

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:04.800 line:92%
MAKEUP.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.300 line:92%
SHE WOULD WEAR A LIGHT

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.666 line:92%
FOUNDATION MAKEUP TO BED AT

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.266 line:92%
NIGHT, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.100 line:92%
LITTLE STRANGE.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600 line:92%
SHE WOULD NEVER GO OUT IN THE

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.100 line:92%
SUN, UNLESS SHE HAD A WIDE-BRIM

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.366 line:92%
HAT.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.066 line:92%
SHE WOULD COVER HER HANDS WITH

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:16.400 line:92%
GLOVES.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.966 line:92%
DIDN'T LIKE TO BE IN THE SON.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.233 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT GAIL SAID THE

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.900 line:92%
BIGGEST MYSTERY WAS HER MOTHER'S

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.166 line:92%
SELECTIVE MEMORY WHEN TALKING

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.766 line:92%
ABOUT HER OWN FATHER.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.200 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I SAID, MOM, WHEN HE WAS

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.566 line:92%
BORN?

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.066 line:92%
WHEN DID HE DIE?

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:30.600 line:92%
I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.533 line:92%
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.133 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GROWING UP, GAIL

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.866 line:92%
NEVER SAW ONE PHOTO OF HER

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.300 line:92%
GRANDFATHER.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.666 line:92%
FINALLY, IN 1995, WHEN SHE WAS

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.700 line:92%
48, SHE DECIDED TO SEARCH FOR

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.400 line:92%
HIS IDENTITY, COMBING THROUGH

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.766 line:92%
MICROFILM.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.033 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AT FIRST, I COULDN'T FIND

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.966 line:92%
HIM.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.400 line:92%
THEN, I PUT IN THE 1900

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.833 line:92%
LOUISIANA CENSUS RECORDS AND I

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.433 line:92%
SEE THE NAME.

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.566 line:92%
THERE ARE ALL THESE FREDERICKS

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.633 line:92%
IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:57.566 line:92%
I NOTICED SOMETHING CURIOUS,

00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.700 line:92%
NEXT TO ALL THEIR NAMES IS THE

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700 line:92%
LETTER "B."

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.166 line:92%
I GO TO THE HEAD OF THAT COLUMN

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.633 line:92%
TO SEE WHAT IT STANDS FOR.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.066 line:92%
AND IT SAYS RACE.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:11.366 line:92%
I THOUGHT, "B"?

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:11.933 line:92%
DOES THAT MEAN BLACK?

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:12.766 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Reporter: GAIL WANTED TO

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.566 line:92%
CONFRONT HER MOTHER.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.166 line:92%
BUT FIRST, SHE REACHED OUT TO

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.733 line:92%
THE STATE OF LOUISIANA,

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:19.700 line:92%
REQUESTING HER MOTHER'S BIRTH

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.100 line:92%
CERTIFICATE.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.600 line:92%
I PRETENDED I WAS MY MOTHER AND

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.166 line:92%
I LOST MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:28.433 line:92%
I OPENED THAT BIRTH CERTIFICATE

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.000 line:92%
AND IN THE PARENTHESES, THERE

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.900 line:92%
WAS COL.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.266 line:92%
AND I SAID, MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.266 line:92%
SAID COL, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:38.533 line:92%
WHAT THAT MEANS?

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.066 line:92%
THEY SENT ME A VERY OFFICIAL

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.033 line:92%
LETTER BACK AND SAID, COL IS FOR

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:43.400 line:92%
COLORED.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400 line:92%
I WAS SPEECHLESS.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.066 line:92%
I DIDN'T KNOW IF MY MOTHER KNEW.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:49.866 line:92%
I AM THINKING, HOW COULD SHE NOT

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:51.200 line:92%
KNOW THIS?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.233 line:92%
AND WHY HAS SHE NEVER SAID

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.133 line:92%
ANYTHING TO ME?

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.066 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE JOINED BY GAIL WHO HAS

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:01.066 line:92%
WRITTEN ABOUT HER MOTHER'S

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:02.266 line:92%
SECRET PAST IN A NEW BOOK "WHITE

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.400 line:92%
LIKE HER."

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.166 line:92%
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.666 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YOU DID WORK UP THE NERVE TO

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.266 line:92%
ASK YOUR MOTHER ABOUT THIS

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:10.666 line:92%
CERTIFICATE.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:14.466 line:92%
YOU SAT DOWN WITH HER.

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:16.200 line:92%
YOU KNEW IT HAD TO BE

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.666 line:92%
FACE-TO-FACE.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:17.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.066 line:92%
YOU HAVE ON THE TELEPHONE.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.066 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AND YOU ASKED HER WHY SHE'S

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.066 line:92%
LISTED AS, QUOTE, COLORED ON THE

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:24.733 line:92%
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:25.866 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I DID.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.666 line:92%
I TOLD HER, I FOUND A BERTH

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.066 line:92%
CERTIFICATE.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:30.400 line:92%
IT SAID COLORED.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.166 line:92%
SHE BECAME VERY INDIGNANT WITH

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:32.433 line:92%
ME.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.633 line:92%
SHE SAID, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.566 line:92%
BIRTH CERTIFICATE YOU HAVE, BUT

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:37.733 line:92%
MINE SAYS I'M WHITE.

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.400 line:92%
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.200 line:92%
I HAVE OTHER KUDOCUMENTS I CAN

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.766 line:92%
SHOW YOU.

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:45.866 line:92%
THE CENSUS RECORDS, YOUR FATHER

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:46.400 line:92%
IS LISTED AS BLACK.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.200 line:92%
AND I HAVE A LETTER FROM THE

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.833 line:92%
STATE OF LOUISIANA SAYING THAT

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.800 line:92%
COL MEANS COLORED.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.333 line:92%
SHE GOT VERY QUIET.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:53.933 line:92%
VERY QUIET.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:58.900 line:92%
AND SHE IS SITTING IN THIS LARGE

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.400 line:92%
CHAIR.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.100 line:92%
IT SEEMED LIKE THE CHAIR WAS

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.566 line:92%
SWALLOWING HER.

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:03.900 line:92%
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, YOU

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.100 line:92%
HAVE TO PROMISE ME YOU WILL

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.966 line:92%
NEVER TELL ANYONE UNTIL AFTER I

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:09.466 line:92%
DIE.

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.833 line:92%
AND THEN, SHE SAID, HOW WILL I

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.966 line:92%
HOLD MY HEAD UP WITH MY FRIENDS

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:15.966 line:92%
IF THEY KNOW?

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:16.666 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:17.833 line:92%
WHAT YEAR WAS THAT?

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS 1997, WHEN I

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:21.400 line:92%
CONFRONTED HER.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.933 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SO, SHE HAD SPENT HER ADULT

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.766 line:92%
LIFE PASSING, A TERM YOU USE IN

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.233 line:92%
THE BOOK.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:27.833 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.033 line:92%
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU TELL THE AUDIENCE

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:30.900 line:92%
WHAT THAT IS?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.366 line:92%
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS PASSING FOR WHITE.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.800 line:92%
MY MOTHER, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.233 line:92%
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER, SHE VISUALLY

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:37.966 line:92%
LOOKS WHITE.

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:39.666 line:92%
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND IN

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.566 line:92%
THE CENSUS RECORD, SHE IS LISTED

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:43.433 line:92%
AS COLORED OR BLACK.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.433 line:92%
WHEN SHE DECIDED TO MARRY MY

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:48.000 line:92%
FATHER, WHO BY THE WAY, IS

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.833 line:92%
WHITE, SHE MOVED NORTH TO OHIO

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.266 line:92%
AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, SHE

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.400 line:92%
TOOK ON THE WHITE RACE THAT SHE

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.733 line:92%
PASSED.

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:56.933 line:92%
SHE WENT FROM BEING DESIGNATED

00:04:56.933 --> 00:04:59.500 line:92%
BLACK TO BEING DESIGNATED WHITE.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.000 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YOU WRITE IN THE BOOK ABOUT

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.133 line:92%
THAT MOMENT THAT YOU SAW COL AND

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:06.766 line:92%
KNEW IT TO BE COLORED.

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.600 line:92%
AND WRITE ABOUT THE DAY I FOUND

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.066 line:92%
OUT I WASN'T WHO I THOUGHT I

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:10.333 line:92%
WAS.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.833 line:92%
WHAT DID YOU GO THROUGH UPON

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:13.166 line:92%
THIS REALIZATION?

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:15.000 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THE INITIAL DISCOVERY WAS

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.833 line:92%
1995 WHEN I WAS AT THE FAMILY

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:17.500 line:92%
HISTORY CENTER.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.333 line:92%
I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THIS.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.500 line:92%
I WALKED INTO THAT FAMILY

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.433 line:92%
HISTORY CENTER A WHITE WOMAN.

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:24.466 line:92%
TOTALLY CONVINCED I WAS A WHITE

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:26.966 line:92%
WOMAN.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.200 line:92%
AND I WALKED OUT OF THERE AND I

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.800 line:92%
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.500 line:92%
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS MIXED

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.233 line:92%
RACE, IF I WAS BLACK, IF I WAS

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:31.700 line:92%
STILL WHITE.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.700 line:92%
I HAD NO IDEA.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.333 line:92%
IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME.
