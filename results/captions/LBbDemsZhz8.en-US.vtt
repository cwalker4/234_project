00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.320
- This test is so important for me

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.947
to take because I'm a handsome man.

00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:07.133
And like, my genetics are
so freaking strong, ladies.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.590
You want your kids to look like me.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.519
And I just wanna know
where that comes from.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.102
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.500
- So, I'm Key, and today,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.710
we're gonna be finding out
which African tribe we're from.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050
- I'm from Kansas City, Missouri.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.760
At least that's where the
colonizers brought me.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160
The little that I know
about my family background

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800
mostly comes from my mom's side.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.670
On my dad's side, I don't know much

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.970
about where it comes from.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.200
My dad's last name, it
is Irish, I believe.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.500
So, like, I don't know.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.230
I don't know if that has anything

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.440
really to do anything other
than like they were owned

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.110
by people from Ireland
or something like that.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.850
My grandfather on my mom's side,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.230
he always told me that we were Nigerian,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.610
and part Irish, too.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.638
But he also was like a pathological liar.

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:56.221
(gentle music)

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.730
- Hi, my name's Kwesi James,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.800
and I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.710
So, I'm lucky enough to know like

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.820
where my ancestors kind of come from.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.830
My grandfather and my grandmother,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.250
they were both from Trinidad and Tobago.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.200
So, most of my family
have like Caribbean roots.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.880
And my mom was the first one

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.360
to come over to the United States.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.547
So, I'm first generation American.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.630
(lighthearted music)

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.500
- So, I was born in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.490
But I spent most of my time
growing up in Arkansas.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.150
Maternally, I know a few things.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.437
One, I know that Williams
is obviously a slave name.

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:39.490
That's like one of the
biggest slave owner's name.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.550
But I also know my grandmother's
maiden name Boykin,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.525
which I know was huge in South Carolina.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:48.608
(lighthearted music)

00:01:57.587 --> 00:01:59.920
- I don't know where I'm from.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.050
It probably has to be Western Africa,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.090
because like, I'm like a nerd for history.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.800
- I honestly don't know.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.070
I feel like it is shrouded in mystery.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.220
One time I did this
ancestry project in school,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.870
and like all the other kids like,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.670
oh, my family is from England,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.120
or my family has direct ties
to Russia, or like whatever.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.020
And it was just weird for me

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.810
'cause I asked so many
people in my family,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660
and a lot of them didn't even know.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210
And it's kind of sad 'cause like,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.130
a lot of black people don't have that.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.190
That ability to be like,
yeah, this is where I'm from,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.850
or I know exactly where we go.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.580
And I feel like a lot of
that was stolen from us.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.360
- I texted two of my uncles,
who I think are like--

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.110
They know most about everything

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.120
that happening in our family
and our family history.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.690
So, I texted them both.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.900
And here was my eloquent solicitation

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.737
for more information on family history.

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.447
"Hey, y'all, I'm shooting
a video tomorrow for work

00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:53.757
"where I get my DNA tested to find out

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.647
"which African tribe I'm from

00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:57.817
"via the new African Ancestry test.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.787
"Do either of you guys know anything

00:02:59.787 --> 00:03:01.727
"about where our family
is from originally?

00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:04.267
"The United States or
outside of the United States?

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.187
"Or any idea where our folks
were from before Arkansas?

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.730
"Any information helps, thank you."

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.830
So, I sent that long text to my uncle,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.090
and his response, "Wakanda."

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.717
- Well, before I even get into this,

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:21.858
all like white people have to do this?

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:23.750
Do white people really
trace back their family

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.628
like because of brutal slave trade?

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:32.280
- All right, so it says,
better, bolder, blacker.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.500
Choose African Ancestry,
yes, here for all of this.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.748
- I just wanna

- I wonder if our ancestors knew

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.040
that we were gonna be the way that we are,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640
would they still have done
the things that they did?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.860
- So, I filled out everything,
I got the packet together.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.410
I'm not gonna lick this stamp.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.710
I'm gonna use a sponge and close this.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.480
And I'm ready to find out

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.445
where my ancestors were stolen from.

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:30.028
(upbeat music)

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:32.860
- Hi, I'm Gina Paige.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.310
I'm the president and cofounder
of AfricanAncestry.com.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.550
So, I'm in the business of being black.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.280
I love sitting down with black people,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.190
and telling them where they're from,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.940
and sharing this
transformative information.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.260
So, I'm looking forward
to the crew from BuzzFeed

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.565
to tell them where their roots are.

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.150
(gentle music)

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.000
- [Ryann] Hi, I'm Ryann.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.940
- Hi, Ryann.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.773
- [Ryann] Nice to meet you.

00:04:56.773 --> 00:04:58.197
- Nice to meet you, too.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.700
The test that you took

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.950
looks at one branch of your family tree.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.890
- Okay.
- Right.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.770
So, you know you have two parents,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.026
four grandparents, eight
great grandparents.

00:05:09.026 --> 00:05:09.859
- [Ryann] Math.

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:10.877
- [Gina] And it keeps going back, right?

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:11.710
- [Ryann] Yeah (laughs).

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.500
- We're only looking at one branch.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.550
- Okay.
- So, we looked at

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.090
your mother's mother's mother's mother's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.670
mother's line.
- Whoa.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.773
- And that goes back 500 to 2,000 years.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.890
So, when we trace paternal line,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.980
we use what's called the Y chromosome.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.813
- Right.
- That's what

00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:31.130
you inherited from your father.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.370
He got it from his father, and
his father, and his father.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.370
Well, during the history of slavery,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.350
white men were having
brown babies more often.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.050
So, let's say a British slave holder

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.250
fathers a son with an
enslaved Nigerian woman.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.800
The son's gonna be black, right?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.633
- Right, right.

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:53.810
- He's gonna have black sons

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.570
who have black sons who have black sons.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.270
Whether they look like me or you.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.093
The Y chromosome goes
back to the British man.

00:06:03.337 --> 00:06:06.110
- So, that would like divert
where the lineage goes.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.940
- So, it's going to be
your European, not African.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.400
And that's no surprise,
we know that history.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.310
- Right, right, right.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.288
- So, white women we're having--

00:06:15.288 --> 00:06:16.170
- Brown babies.
- Brown babies.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.630
As often as white men.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.680
So, that's why we see African ancestry

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.770
more often on the maternal line.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.310
So, your results are
actually a little unusual.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.850
- (gasps) Oh, God.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.120
- And that's because we
found matches for you

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.760
in several different countries.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.460
- Whoa, whoa.
- They're all African.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.325
- Okay, good.
- So, you're African.

00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:39.158
- (laughs) Yes.

00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:41.600
- You're part of the family.
(laughs)

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.250
But we found your results
in four countries,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.720
most of which were part
of the Mali Empire.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.360
One country that we found your ancestry in

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.950
has a group of people called Jola people.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.480
And they are in Guinea-Bissau today.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.470
- Guinea-Bissau.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.060
- So, that's one of the smallest countries

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.943
on the west coast of Africa.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.960
We found your same DNA signature

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.640
among people who are Mandinka.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.190
The Mandinka are the Grio of the culture.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.490
And the Grios are the
keepers of the culture.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.700
So, through music and song,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.320
they tell the history of families

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.810
in the different Senegalese communities.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.370
So, they're from Senegal.
- That's cool.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.203
That's cool.

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:32.470
- So, the Mandinka are
also known as warriors.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.760
- Okay.
- Which leads me

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.480
to the next group that
you share ancestry with,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.577
which is the Mende.
- The Mende.

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:41.710
- The Mende people in Sierra Leone today.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.570
- Okay.
- And the Mende

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.760
are known as those who
were on the Amistad.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.010
Basically, the enslaved
Africans on the ship

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.580
refused to be captured.
- Yes.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.730
- And they turn the ship around.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.400
- I've always like thought back to like--

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.820
'Cause I'm very good at directions.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.880
Like, I can go somewhere once,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.255
and I'm like, oh, I can get back.

00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:00.810
Like, I just have that innate sense.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.860
And thinking about being a warrior,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.550
I've always like considered myself,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.740
like we lived like in a society

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.600
where we didn't have like electronics,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.940
and like things that like
tell us where we're going,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.060
I would just be like a
gatherer or a warrior

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.480
'cause I know where I'm going.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.080
- So, then, this is crazy
because I haven't met you before.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.770
Like, five minutes ago.
- Right.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.390
- We didn't plan this.
- No.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.210
- But the last group that
you share ancestry with

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.560
were the Coastal People
in south eastern Liberia.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.110
And they were sailors.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.737
- That is weird (laughs).

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.340
- Not only were the sailors,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.330
but they were very
resistant to enslavement.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.110
And the British often
wouldn't enslave them,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.803
but instead would have
them navigate the ships.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.040
I'm just saying.
- That's really cool.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.270
- I'm not making this up.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.520
- I'm very excited to just like,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.900
to be able to pinpoint
where my people are from,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.540
and like also have a lot

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.470
of historical context
of who I am as a person.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.460
I mean, I knew obviously your DNA

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.970
holds a lot of like
secrets to who you are,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.651
but I didn't realize how
specific it would be.

00:09:08.651 --> 00:09:12.030
To like know these tribes
and these groups of people

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.300
make up part of my personality,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.820
or part of the talents
and abilities that I have.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.810
There's a level of
understanding I have now

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.890
that makes me so much more excited

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.340
than I ever thought I would've been.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.333
So, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.670
- [Ryann] I'm so, so appreciative.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.857
- Welcome to the African Ancestry family.

00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:33.478
- Yes (laughs).
(gentle music)

00:09:33.478 --> 00:09:34.497
- [Kwesi] Hi.

00:09:34.497 --> 00:09:35.510
- Hi, Kwesi (laughs).

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.990
- What's going on, how's it going?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.110
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.990
My whole family's
waiting on these results.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.827
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:42.740
- So, I was really excited when I saw

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.340
that your people were from Trinidad,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.310
'cause that helps to give us some variety,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.940
and to spread the word that, yeah,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.470
it's great to be Trini, but guess what?

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.127
It's great to be from
wherever before Trinidad, too.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.560
- [Kwesi] For sure, for sure.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.070
- We found your ancestry in Africa.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.577
- Right.
- Which is great.

00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:01.410
- (laughs) Okay.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.740
- The first country, the group
that you share ancestry with

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.840
has the secret societies
called Poro societies.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.720
And they're where men raise boys up.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.930
They initiate them into manhood.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.170
- Whoa.
- And so,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.780
there's this whole set of culture,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.560
almost cultural practices,
almost like a rites of passage.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.240
- Yeah.
- That Temne

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.160
boys go through in Sierra Leone.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.210
- Wow.
- As they become men.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.750
So, I really want you to look into that.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.396
- I'm like on some warrior type joint.

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:39.077
(both laugh)

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:40.160
Yo, this is crazy.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.380
- And there's another
thing that you'll see

00:10:44.822 --> 00:10:48.060
connects you in this whole BuzzFeed crew.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.440
This theme of resistance.
- Yeah.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.480
- Because the Temne People were also

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.260
resistant to enslavement.
- Right.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.450
That rebel spirit, I feel it in me.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.745
I mean, it's even hard for
me to work a nine to five.

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.310
(laughs) You know, to
be held down like that.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.230
- Well, there's another group
that you share ancestry with.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.090
- From my father's side?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.347
- No, on your mother's side still.

00:11:09.347 --> 00:11:11.080
- Oh, on my mother's side still?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.470
- So, we found two groups
that you share ancestry with.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.080
So, not just the Temne in Sierra Leone.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.943
But there's another group
called the Balanta People.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.443
And guess what Balanta means.

00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:24.809
- I don't know.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.707
- It means those who resist.
- Wow (laughs) wow.

00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:31.343
- So, when Portuguese came,

00:11:33.724 --> 00:11:38.140
and colonized this very tiny
country called Guinea-Bissau,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.670
- Yeah.
- They were met

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.870
with a lot of resistance
by the Balanta People.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.370
- 'Cause they weren't having it either.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.660
- Wow, if anyone knows me,

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.820
everyone knows I'm super rebellious.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.470
Yeah, like, naturally.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.610
I almost can't help it.
- Yeah.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.570
And see, that's the beauty of learning

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.890
the specific groups and countries

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.130
that you have connection to genetically.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.028
- Wow, wow, you're
changing the world, man.

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:12.167
(laughs) Oh, my goodness.
- One Kwesi at a time.

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:15.330
- [Kwesi] Oh, man (laughs), man.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.341
- [Key] Hello.

00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:17.174
- [Gina] Hi.

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:18.007
- [Key] I'm Key.

00:12:18.007 --> 00:12:19.720
- Nice to meet you, Key.
- Nice to meet you.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.300
I'm super excited about this.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.220
- Good.
- I don't know

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.700
anything about my family.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.870
- We exist to help you better

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.640
understand who you are.
- Yeah.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.140
- That's the only reason we're here.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.030
- Yeah.
- Is because you deserve

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.270
to know where you're family was

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.100
before Mississippi and before Arkansas.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.030
There was this disconnection.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.730
And, Key, you know, that makes us

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.003
the original victims of identity theft.

00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:45.360
- That's real.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.410
- We're the very first ones.
- Yeah.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.430
- We lost our names,
we lost our languages,

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.500
we lost the freedom to
honor our ancestors,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.510
and our families were torn apart.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.520
So, if you don't know your name,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.130
you can't speak your language,
you can't talk to your god,

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.540
and you don't know where your
brothers and sisters are,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.687
or who they are, then how
can you know who you are?

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:09.770
- Yeah, yeah.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:14.770
- So, we found your ancestry
among people in two countries.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.100
- Okay, two countries?
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.120
- Got ya.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.310
- And the first group that
you share ancestry with,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.283
those people are known as nomads.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.270
You'll find that they've traveled

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.850
all across, all across Africa.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.000
All across West Africa.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.690
You'll find them in probably six

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.930
or seven different West African countries.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.180
- Wow.
(gentle music)

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.520
- Like I said, they were nomads,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.310
so they moved with their
cattle from place to place.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.980
They were often traders

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.780
because they had to
negotiate in each new place.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.710
And the women are considered

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.370
the most beautiful women in Africa.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.150
- Oh, yes.
- Which makes you my cousin.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.970
Because I share maternal
ancestry with the same group

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.110
in a different country but the same group.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.988
So, you share maternal genetic
ancestry with the Fula,

00:14:08.988 --> 00:14:11.523
or Fulani People.
- Sounds familiar.

00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:14.950
- Yeah, so there are Fulani
People who live in Nigeria.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.440
That's my ancestry.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.060
They are Fulani People
who live in Cameroon,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.060
who live in Mali, who live in Senegal,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.610
and in your country of Guinea-Bissau.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.360
Isn't this crazy?
- Yes.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.230
- Guinea-Bissau.
- Just like Kwesi, yeah.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.210
- And Ryann.
- Oh, yeah.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.320
Look, we're all related.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.740
- But you all have different people.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.020
- Yeah, and like the nomad
thing makes so much sense.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.160
Look, every couple of months,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.717
like this unrest happens in me.

00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:42.810
I'm like, something has to change.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:43.700
And I feel like that's just

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.913
a part of the nomad inside of me.

00:14:44.913 --> 00:14:49.070
- And then, there's this
theme going on here today.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.030
And I swear, you will acknowledge,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.460
I have never met you guys before.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.823
- Yeah, yeah, no.

00:14:54.823 --> 00:14:57.460
- I didn't know anybody about any of you.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.180
But this team here, there
is something about you all.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.180
And the Mende and Temne
are from Sierra Leone.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.520
- That's crazy.
- Let me tell you

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.020
something I didn't tell the others.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.770
- Oh.
- So (laughs).

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.020
Sierra Leone is known for rice production.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.630
So, Sierra Leoneans are
outstanding rice farmers.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.090
The planters in South Carolina

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.800
and Georgia at the rice plantations,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.370
they specifically got enslaved
labor from Sierra Leone

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.990
because of their ability--
(bell rings)

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.020
(gentle music)

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.980
Farm rice.
- Whoa.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.470
- So, that's why when we are talking

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.720
about where you all are from,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.700
I was listening to see if anybody

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.880
was from South Carolina or Georgia

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.750
because we get a lot of people.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.240
So, that whole Gullah Geechee culture.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.190
- Yeah.
- Is directly connected.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.194
- Wow.

00:15:52.194 --> 00:15:53.210
- To the people of Sierra Leone.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.190
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.490
And we've already been
through the resistance.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.810
The Mende were not having enslavement.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.060
The Temne were not having enslavement.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.970
They turned the ships around.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.960
- That's what I like to hear.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.200
Being quiet and not saying
anything is just like not me.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.510
- That's not what's gonna happen.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.120
- Wow.
- So, yes.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.700
So, I wanna welcome you to
the African Ancestry family.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.210
- I love this.
- Good.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.660
- Same as Kwesi, I don't
have my diploma either.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.210
It's packed up in a box somewhere.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.430
But this is gonna be hanging
up somewhere in my apartment.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:30.430
- You got some great women,
strong women, leaders.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.860
- I'm so interested in it.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.693
- Doctor Dorothy Height was Temne.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.260

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.207

ancestry with you.

00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:51.760
- That's so cool like hearing
about Coretta Scott King

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.910
because I know they like spent
a lot of time in Memphis.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.500
And that's where Martin
Luther King was assassinated.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.860
And I was born in Memphis, too.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.470
So, that like little tiny connection

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.800
is like super cool to have.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.930
And also, just hearing
about like the Fula women.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.830
Like, I wanna like read up about 'em.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.530
I don't know, just like learn more.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.110
- See, isn't she pretty?
- Aw, cousins (laughs).

00:17:12.118 --> 00:17:13.489
- My cousin, my cousin.

00:17:13.489 --> 00:17:14.569
- Thank you so much for this.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.402
- You're welcome.

00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:17.350
- This is like my very
first DNA test ever.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.820
And I just didn't wanna take one.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.710
It was gonna be like, oh, you're European.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.150
'Cause I'm like, I
already know this happens.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.140
- [Gina] This is something you need.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.670
You know, this isn't a novelty.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.749
This isn't just nice to know.

00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:30.940
This is a need to know,
and now you're gonna share.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.560
