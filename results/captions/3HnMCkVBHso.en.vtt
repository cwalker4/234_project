00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.749
...your air conditioning unit was these loose
fuses.

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.850
We know that because we deliberately pulled
them out, cutting power.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.540
That'll shut down the compressor.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.889
What was your name?

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:10.889
I'm sorry.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.889
Tim.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.219
We're testing the expertise of home repairmen.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.981
These techs that showed up did exactly the
right thing.

00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:23.910
They pushed the fuses back in and told Jenny
no other work was needed.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.269
Rafael wouldn't even accept payment.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.720
How much do I owe you?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
Nothing.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.740
Will George from America's Comfort Heating
&amp; Cooling do the same?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.460
He quickly finds the loose fuses and pushes
them back in and does his inspection.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.750
Instead of telling Jenny the job's done, he
has some bad news.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.340
You have a leak somewhere.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.620
The system he says is leaking Freon, the coolant
inside the air conditioner.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.620
But how would he know?

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.989
Testing a leak is a long and complicated process,
something George didn't do.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.210
So there's a leak?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.210
Oh yeah.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.030
100% there's a leak.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.149
George says dealing with a leak could get
expensive.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.810
Especially if it's in the long snaking coil
where Freon circulates.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.620
You're looking at probably about $1500 to
replace the coil.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.490
Either we can look for the leak and fix the
leak, and if it's in one of the coils it's

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.710
not worth it.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.840
It's worth getting rid of the whole thing.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.299
Then there's the cost of adding Freon.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.080
We have to recharge the system so you're looking
at probably $1900.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.530
How would that cost compare to getting a brand
new air conditioning unit?

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.970
It's $3826.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.259
That's three thousand eight hundred and twenty-six
dollars.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.450
Bottom line, what do we need to do?

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.940
I would just replace it.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.409
We're talking the whole thing.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.409
Yes.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.409
All right.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.579
Stay here and I'll be right back.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.680
It's time for me to have a chat with George.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.799
What exactly is wrong with the air conditioning
unit.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.560
I think it's just a little bit low on Freon,
and I don't know how low it is....But what

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.719
you told Jenny is that it's about half empty.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120
Yeah I think it's about half empty.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.020
Like I said I have to weigh it all in that's
why I can't give her a price on all the Freon.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.280
That's why I can't give her a price on all...I
understand that.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.690
What is this man?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.690
You guys trying to test us here?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.690
Actually I am.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.690
Here's something you need to know George.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.200
We had that system tested.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.989
The only issue with that system is that the
fuse, George come on I want to talk to you.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.300
George sees our cameras and quickly heads
to the door.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.340
George I'm Chris Hanson with Dateline NBC
and we're doing a story on the quality of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.340
service.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130
You've got a 20 year old unit man.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.130
George is right.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.610
It is an old system.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.460
But the fact is, even though it isn't as energy
efficient as the new one, it works just fine

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.330
according to our expert Carl.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.130
It is up in age.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.160
It's efficiency is not what the newer one
is.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.290
But operationally it's sound.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.330
If Jenny had followed George's advice she
would've been out thousands of dollars to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.750
replace an air conditioning unit that wasn't
broken.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.990
Here comes our next technician, Tony from
Abode Air.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.770
All of the sudden I can feel air, but it's
not cool.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.520
Tony comes in and after meeting Jenny, heads
back outside.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.150
Checks himself out and gets his tools.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.020
How carefully does he check out the air conditioner?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.300
He appears to examine the circuit board and
take some notes.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.350
He never spots the loose fuses we deliberately
pulled out.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.340
Instead he jumps on the fact that it's an
older unit.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.110
He says he's found an entirely new problem.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.110
How does it look?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.300
Well you've got some bad news from the older
one.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.560
It has what we call an LRA.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.430
It's locked up rotor head.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.300
Tony tells Jenny that the problem is something
called a locked rotary head and her motor

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.690
isn't working.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.790
So it's just bad?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.670
The unit is completely bad?

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.670
It's shot?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.670
Yeah it's bad.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.290
Tony's best advice?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.290
Get a new unit.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.340
Do you know how much a new unit would cost?

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.610
Just a rough estimate?

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.310
We'll say $5000.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.440
Rough estimate.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
$5000?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.560
Remember all that's wrong are the loose fuses.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.980
Hey are you?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.060
So I head downstairs to speak with Tony.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.050
So all in, what do you estimate this will
cost?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.120
Probably about $5200.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.350
Good, so this is the estimate?

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.320
I have to still finish filling it out.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.280
Tony before you go, there's something I need
to tell you.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.790
I'm really not the man of the house.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.440
I'm Chris Hanson with Dateline NBC.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440
OK.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.790
We're doing a story on the quality of service
provided by repairmen and mechanics of the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.790
house.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.790
Sure.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.790
So a couple things...go ahead and have a seat.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.790
Relax.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.790
Can I ask you a couple questions.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.790
No.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.050
In fact I'm not going to have a seat I got
to get things.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.160
I'll walk with you.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.380
There's something I want to show you out there.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.070
Things that you said needed to be repaired
on this unit weren't broken.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.070
That's the bottom line.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.690
I wouldn't say that system works fine at all.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.730
Bottom line is, on a 24 year old system, they're
going to have multiple problems with that.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.500
I don't care what anybody says.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.510
He stuck with his story even though I pointed
out the real problem minutes earlier.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.090
Can I show you one thing?

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.630
Go ahead.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.610
Works just fine now.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.710
Yeah it does.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.530
All you had to do is push this in.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.530
Good to go.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.310
I didn't push the fuse in.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.470
Whey didn't you push the fuse in?

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.260
Because I didn't notice that it was sticking
out.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.980
But wouldn't you check that as a matter of
routine?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.980
No.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.843
You don't go to a job where the disconnect
is sticking out.

00:05:23.843 --> 00:05:25.910
We just check the fuses.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.110
So what can you do to make sure the repair
person you call is the right one for the job?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.070
First, when someone gives you the bad news,
get a second opinion.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.460
So this is a must do right now?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.780
One of the best ways to find someone who knows
their stuff is by word of mouth.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.110
Get a referral from someone who's had a good
repair experience.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.780
That way the odds of finding someone you can
trust will go way up.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.721
We want to hear from you.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:59.960
If you feel you've been victimized or treated
unfairly and there's something we should look

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.780
into, or maybe someone I should talk to, let
us know.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.889
Send an email to TheHansenFiles@nbcuni.com.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:10.580
That's all for this.....
