00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:07.707
OVER THE WEEKEND, TRUMP VISITED
THE AREAS DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRE

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.808 align:start position:0%
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.412 size:84% position:42%
IN THE FACE OF UNIMAGINABLE
TRAGEDY, THE PRESIDENT WAS

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
CONSISTENT.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:15.882
IN THE FIRE-RAVAGED TOWN OF
PARADISE, CALIFORNIA, HE SAID

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:20.553 align:start position:0%
THIS:
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:24.390 align:start position:0%
UNTIL YOU COME HERE.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
AND WHAT WE SAW AT PLEASURE--
WHAT A NAME RIGHT NOW.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:29.829 align:start position:0%
BUT WHAT WE JUST SAW, WE JUST
LEFT PLEASURE--

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:30.696 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; PARADISE.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.566 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OR PARADISE.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.436
AND WHAT WE JUST SAW AT PARADISE
IS JUST, YOU KNOW, IS JUST NOT

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
ACCEPTABLE.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:40.139 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: PLEASURE,
PARADISE... IT'S EASY TO GET

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.508 align:start position:0%
THEM MIXED UP.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.378 align:start position:0%
JUST REMEMBER, MR. PRESIDENT
"PLEASURE" IS THE DANCER,

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.415
"PARADISE" IS WHERE SHE WORKS.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:58.157 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ALSO REFUSED TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.528
MIGHT BE CAUSING THESE FIRES.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.730
&gt;&gt; WILL SEEING THIS DEVASTATION
CHANGE YOUR OPINION AT ALL ON

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.499 size:88% position:44%
CLIMATE CHANGE MR PRESIDENT?

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.701 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, I HAVE A STRONG
OPINION.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:12.972 align:start position:0%
I WANT GREAT CLIMATE.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU WANT LEARN

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.649 align:start position:0%
GRAMMAR.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
I WANT NEW PRESIDENT.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:39.632 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TRUMP HAS CLAIMED MANY TIMES

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0%
THAT CALIFORNIA'S WILD FIRES ARE
CAUSED BY POOR FOREST

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.336
MANAGEMENT, AND HE DID IT AGAIN.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.840
&gt;&gt; I'M COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE WE
GET ALL OF THIS CLEANED OUT AND

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.375 align:start position:0%
PROTECTED.

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:50.877 align:start position:0%
GOT TO TAKE CARE OFF THE
FLOORS-- YOU KNOW THE FLOORS OF

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.477 align:start position:0%
THE FOREST.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.448 align:start position:0%
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.384 align:start position:0%
YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES
WHERE THEY DO IT DIFFERENTLY AND

00:01:58.417 --> 00:01:59.585
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.222 align:start position:0%
I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
FINLAND AND HE SAID, "WE HAVE A

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.591 align:start position:0%
MUCH DIFFERENT-- WE ARE A FOREST
NATION."

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.661 align:start position:0%
HE CALLED IT A FOREST NATION AND
THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.831
RAKING AND CLEANING AND DOING
THINGS AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.499 align:start position:0%
PROBLEM.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.468 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHAT
FINLAND ALSO SPENDS A LOT OF

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.603 align:start position:0%
TIME DOING?

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:19.305
BEING COVERED IN SNOW BECAUSE
IT'S RIGHT BELOW THE ARCTIC

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:24.043 align:start position:0%
CIRCLE!

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:29.682 align:start position:0%
THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T HAVE A
SMOKE

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:33.286 align:start position:0%
DETECTOR INSIDE OF YOUR
FREEZER!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.454 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT, FINLAND'S

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.590
PRESIDENT SAID HE WASN'T SURE
WHETHER HE GOT THE IDEA THAT

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:44.297 align:start position:0%
RAKING IS PART OF THE ROUTINE
FOR PANGING ITS FORESTS.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.400
CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST
RESORTED TO MAKING UP ADVICE

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.267 align:start position:0%
FROM WORLD LEADERS.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.305 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"I WAS SPEAKING TO THE SUPREME

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:57.410
IMPERIAL VIKING OF NORWAY THE
OTHER DAY, HIS NAME IS ARTHUR

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:04.250 align:start position:0%
NORWAY.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:07.086 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND HE SAID SO MANY TIMES THEY

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:12.325 align:start position:0%
PREVENT FIRES BY MOISTURIZING
THE TREES.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.526 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY THEY

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.962 align:start position:0%
LOOK SO YOUNG-- MOST OF THE
NIVEA IN NORWAY GOES STRAIGHT TO

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
THEIR FORESTS.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.735 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
NO, THIS IS TRUE.

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.705 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHAT THE SONG 'NORWEGIAN
WOOD' IS ABOUT.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:29.308 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:31.043 align:start position:0%
( PIANO RIFF )
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU 

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:31.578 align:start position:0%
TONIGHT!
