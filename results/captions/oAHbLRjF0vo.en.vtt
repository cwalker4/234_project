00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
[Inaudible airport announcements]

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.600
[Grey sighs]

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.960
What’s the fastest way to board an airplane?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.740
I mean, you can’t just throw open the gates like funneling cattle into a chute.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.540
That’s not for us.  We’re primates, after all!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
So let’s put our monkey brains to work to tackle this queue which is what boarding groups do:

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200
Prioritize, plainly packing primates precisely. (Primarily)

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.780
Ok, we have a suggestion: pour people into the plane back to front.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.580
This is an intuitive solution to fill a cylinder.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.200
But there's almost a law of the universe that solutions which are…

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.040
…the first thing you'd think of and look sensible and are easy to implement are often…

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.280
… terrible, ineffective solutions, once implemented will drag on civilization forever.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.360
:: Cough, voting systems, cough ::

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
So it should come as no surprise that this method is…

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.640
… not good and also what most airlines use to board their planes.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.920
Let's watch it in action:

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.400
The first boarding group walks to the back of the plane.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.240
Everything is smooth right until the first to go reaches their row and starts to stow.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.880
So slow.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.760
And for passenger two, while their seat is in view, there's nothing to do.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.440
The aisle's one queue, where all can naught but stew, stuck like glue until this guy's through.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.760
:: Phew ::

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.520
It's bags.  Bags cause most of the delay boarding a flight.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.680
Like with this: a full-stop stow.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.680
When it happens, everyone boarding the plane within and without must wait until one person finishes stowing their bag.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.120
Can you feel it?  The aggregate lost seconds of human life piling up like a bounty for a delighted reaper?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.840
Of course you can.  You can feel it with every bag.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840
:: Uhhh :: What was I saying?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.640
Right, back-to-front boarding groups have a lot of full-stop stows, and very few of what you want:

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.560
… pullaways and parallels and parallels and pullaways.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.560
Pullaways turn one queue into two.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.840
And parallels decrease total bag stow time and are super satisfying.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.280
The rare triple partner parallel invoking a double high-five at the sheer pleasure of its efficiency.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
But loading back to front lets few of these happen.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.560
Now say you weren't just… not good at designing boarding groups,…

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.600
… but you were malicious and wanted to maximize the amount of human life wasted upon a flight.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.640
What would you do?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.960
Not back-to-front but front to back -- the smaller the boarding group the better.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.600
This makes almost every tedious shuffle forward result in a full stop stow,…

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.240
…because most of the line waits by rows already full or outside the plane.  Look familiar?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.680
This is where we acknowledge the class structure of airplanes.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.840
Real planes look like this and first class boards first, front to back, …

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.400
… before the pro-conomy file in back-to-front.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.480
So, excluding pre-boarding, all airlines start with a little of the slowest boarding method you could intentionally design.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.120
Now, obviously, this video will soon reveal faster boarding procedures.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.440
And you will wonder, “why don't airlines use the faster methods?”

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.760
One possible answer is economic incentives.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.360
First class pays for perks -- sometimes breathtaking perks for breathtaking amounts.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.400
And boarding first is one of them.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.720
Also, airlines give everyone loyalty points that move you up the class structure the more you fly with that airline.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.520
Which gives airlines another good reason to group people.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.040
And probably helps explain why they switched away from the older faster method you won’t believe they used to use:

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.120
[Grey on microphone]: "Hey, everyone.  Plane’s here.  Go ahead."

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.600
Doing nothing and having people board the flight in whatever order they show up…

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.600
… to get their assigned seat, is faster than organizing tidy boarding groups.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600
This is because random people are spread, well, randomly, …

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.000
… increasing the chances of pullaways and parallels, unlike the more orderly methods airlines have switched to.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.600
Man, it's always frustrating to know that to literally have done nothing …

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.960
… would be faster than the something that is done.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.880
But surely there's a better boarding group order to be found if we can just subtract malice and add thinking to this problem.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.880
Ahh!  Three groups: window, middle, aisle.  In that order.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.400
This is really the same as doing random thrice, one for each column of the craft ...

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.400
… but the reason it's a smidge faster is because it eliminates the other source of boarding delay:

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.440
Seat shuffles.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.120
When people board randomly, seat shuffling is going to happen a bunch.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.400
And when people spill into the aisle, it slows the queue.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.920
Ordering everyone by window, middle, aisle ensures a seat shuffle will never happen.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.440
This seems like it should be a big improvement.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.760
But when you simulate boarding an aircraft with a ton of real math …

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.240
(rather than just animating it in a dramatically simplified fashion)

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.840
… or do actual experiments, the seat shuffle just isn't a big deal compared to bag stowage.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.280
People wrangling their one bag that won't possible fit, …

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.320
… or trying to get onboard with three bags because they don't think the rules should apply to them, …

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.000
… who then also fiddle around getting their laptops out after stowing them.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.720
Those kinds of delays count for much more.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.400
So, Window-Middle-Aisle is maybe a smidge faster than random, which is good …

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.240
… and some airlines use this method, which gets their planes turned around faster than back-to-front …

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.760
… while still giving them boarding groups to play games with.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.280
The vast majority of airlines use either back to front or window-middle-aisle.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.760
So keep an eye out next time you’re boarding a flight for which is happening to you.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.280
But can we go farther?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.320
Leaving the real world: with its class systems and people, and untidiness and smells, …

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.920
… ascending to the platonic plain of physics, …

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.680
… where cows are spheres and people cellular automaton who will execute instructions perfectly.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.080
Here, in the Celestia, what is the theoretically fastest way to board a plane?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.880
On this level, here is what’s possible:

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:53.040
[The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a: VIII. Waltz of the Flowers]

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.240
To achieve this ballet, there are no boarding groups, but everyone stands in an exact order.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.440
Back-to-front in alternating rows, on alternating sides, windows in.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.480
This maximizes pullaways and parallels.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.960
Pristinely packing people in a pinch.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.800
Witnessing such glory is too much for mortal minds to bear for long…

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.240
… so we are forced to descend back down into the meat world.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.720
The cacophony!  The smell!

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.520
Where we must stuff monkeys into a tube.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.160
Monkeys with families, where separating their young invites chaos and cleanup.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.040
Where economic incentives divide and profit.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.280
And where, even at their best, the human inability to follow instructions is breathtaking.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.000
Here, people, upon seeing 'boarding group 123', would flip the hell out.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.480
Let alone the impossibility of trying to get them to stand in line in order.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.320
And where even if faster, like watching seconds of a clock, people would complain it was slower.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.760
[Grey sighs]

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.680
Such gifts we were not meant to have.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120
But is there a way we can modify this perfection to improve our lot on this plane?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.920
Yes.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.480
Instead of exact order, boarding group the first would be all one side of the plane in every other row.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.320
Boarding group the second, the other side, then back, and back again.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.240
One, two, three, four.  We can't ask people for more.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.240
This shadow of the perfect method has a chance of working in the real world with benefits like:

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.200
letting humans with families and friends board together, …

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.000
giving airlines boarding groups they can still play with, …

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.960
and still being faster than the current methods.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.080
Reaching for perfection, we will always come up short.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.920
But perhaps we can manage to get closer in the process.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.280

You know how boarding a flight from front to back row by row is the slowest possible method?  The reaper method?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.680
Well, after your flight, when the plane pulls into the gate, …

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.360
… and everyone ignores the flight attendant’s admonishments to wait until the fasten seat-belt is off to grab their bag, …

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.080
… and the door opens, how do we de-plane?

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.320
That's right: front-to-back, row by row.  No slower could we go.
