FOR ALL OF THEM.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:23.412 line:92%

SHARE DNA WITH.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:33.422 line:92%
IT WOULD SORT MATCHES BY WHO YOU

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:34.856 size:75% position:38% line:92%
SHARE THE MOST WITH.

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:36.058 line:92%

BROTHER, WHICH WAS VERY ODD TO

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.001 line:92%

AND THE WOMAN ON THE OTHER END

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:58.914 line:92%
OF THIS CHAT IMMEDIATELY KNEW

00:01:55.482 --> 00:02:00.482 line:92%
WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT, AND SHE

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:03.185 line:92%
TYPED BACK, THAT MEANS HE IS

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:05.487 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YOUR HALF BROTHER.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:06.588 line:92%
I LOOKED AT THE SCREEN AND I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.090 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
JUST BACKED UP.

PAUSE.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:11.326 line:92%
I KNEW AT THAT MOMENT THAT WHAT

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:13.428 line:92%
I WAS SEEING WAS NOT NATURAL,

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:15.397 line:92%
WHICH MEANT I WAS ABOUT TO BLACK

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:17.466 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
OUT.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:17.733 line:92%
THIS PERSON I DIDN'T KNOW WAS

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:20.102 line:92%
CLEARLY A PATERNAL MATCH.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:22.204 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WOW, WHAT KATHERINE FOUND OUT

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:24.473 line:92%
FROM HER DNA TEST WAS THAT THE

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.241 line:92%
MAN WHO RAISED HER WAS NOT HER

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:28.643 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:29.244 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
SHE JOINS US NOW.

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:30.679 line:92%

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:40.155 line:92%
FEELING THAT PAIN CAME BACK.

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:41.857 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S NOT -- IT'S INTERESTING

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:43.759 line:92%
FOR PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:45.494 line:92%
FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS LIVING IT,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:47.362 line:92%
IT CAN BE KIND OF DEVASTATING IN

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:48.897 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
THE MOMENT.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:49.398 size:75% position:38% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH, IT WAS.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:50.065 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
IT WAS.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.499 line:92%
I FEEL LIKE I'VE COME A LONG WAY

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:52.667 line:92%
IN THE PAST 15 MONTHS SINCE I

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:55.137 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
MADE MY DISCOVERY.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:55.904 line:92%
BUT GOING BACK AND RELIVING IT

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:57.906 line:92%
BY WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.940 size:75% position:38% line:92%
BROUGHT IT ALL BACK.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:59.875 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WHEN THE WOMAN SAID TO

00:02:56.376 --> 00:03:01.376 line:92%
YOU, THAT MEANS HE'S YOUR HALFS

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:05.914 line:92%
THOUGHT WAS YOUR FULL BIOLOGICAL

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.150 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BROTHER GROWING UP.

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:09.151 line:92%
DID YOU REALIZE THAT'S WHEN IT

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:10.585 line:92%
MEANT, HE WAS YOUR HALF BROTHER?

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:12.687 line:92%
WHAT THAT MEANT ABOUT YOUR

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:13.655 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
PARENTS AND SO ON.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.856 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MY RESPECT FOR SCIENCE WAS

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:16.558 line:92%
TELLING ME THIS WAS A FACT THAT

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:20.762 line:92%
I NEEDED TO ACCEPT BUT MY HEART

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:22.564 line:92%
WAS HAVING A REAL HARD TIME WITH

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:24.666 line:92%
IT BECAUSE IT NEVER, EVER, EVER

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:26.334 line:92%
OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS COULD

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.769 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EVEN BE POSSIBLE.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:28.603 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEN YOU HAVE TO START TO

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:30.872 line:92%
WONDER, LIKE, WELL, IS THIS

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:34.076 line:92%

AND ALL MY SIBLINGS?

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.980 line:92%
HOW DO WE ARE E TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.049 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT MADE ME QUESTION

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:43.318 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EVERYTHING.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:43.718 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT, THEY

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:45.454 line:92%
ARE ALL, FOR LACK OF A BETTER

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:47.322 line:92%
WORD, FULL BIOLOGICAL SIBLINGS,

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:48.957 line:92%
AND YOU ARE THE ONE THAT IS A

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:50.358 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HALF TO THEM.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:51.293 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; OF MY FOUR SIBLINGS I GREW UP

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:53.495 line:92%
WITH, THREE OF THEM TESTED SO

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.130 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FAR.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:55.464 line:92%
THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THEY ARE

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:56.198 line:92%
FULL SIBLINGS AND THEY SHARE DNA

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.700 line:92%
WITH OUR DAD'S SIDE OF THE

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.469 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FAMILY.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:04:00.802 size:75% position:38% line:92%
I'M THE ODD ONE OUT.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:01.803 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU DON'T.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:02.804 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON'T.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:03.405 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WERE YOUR PARENTS ALIVE WHEN

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.540 size:75% position:38% line:92%
YOU GOT THAT RESULT?

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:06.274 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO, THEY HAD BEEN PASSED AWAY

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.909 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YEARS BEFORE.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:08.443 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO NOW YOU HAVE TO BECOME A

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
DETECTIVE.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:12.581 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:12.948 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT'S THE

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:15.584 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
STORY THERE.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:16.017 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:16.384 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:17.018 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TRY

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:18.386 line:92%
TO DETERMINE WHO THIS FIRST

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:19.721 line:92%
PERSON WAS I SHARED THE MOST DNA

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.190 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WITH.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:22.491 line:92%
SO I REACHED OUT THROUGH E-MAIL

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
TO THIS PERSON.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:25.927 line:92%
FORTUNATELY FOR ME SHE RESPONDED

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:29.197 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
IMMEDIATELY.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:29.598 line:92%
AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:31.032 line:92%
DID OUR OWN DIGGING AROUND AND

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:34.369 line:92%
ASKING QUESTIONS AND FIGURED OUT

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:35.604 line:92%
THAT MY MOTHER WORKED FOR HER

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:37.739 line:92%
DAD FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:39.808 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BACK IN 1960.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:43.345 line:92%
AND SHE SAID I'M CERTAIN I'M

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:44.946 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YOUR HALF SISTER.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.780 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO YOU AND SHE ARE HALF

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:49.584 line:92%
SISTERS THROUGH YOUR FATHER.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.819 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THROUGH MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:53.288 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ITALY YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.689 line:92%
NOT THE MAN WHO RAISED YOU.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:56.024 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; EXACTLY.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:56.458 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IS THERE A REASON SHE WAS

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:57.826 line:92%
MORE RELATED TO YOU ON THE DNA

ANY SIGN GROWING UP YOUR DAD WAS

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.926 size:78% position:39% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NONE AT ALL.

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:06.328 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NONE.

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:07.128 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHEN YOU HOOKED UP WITH THE

ABOUT YOUR BIOLOGICAL DAD?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:13.702 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I LEARNED HE WAS IN THE SAME

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.270 line:92%
TOWN WE GREW UP IN ALL THOSE

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:17.239 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
YEARS.

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.739 size:84% position:42% line:92%

TWA US A SMALL TOWN.

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:21.843 line:92%
AND THIS HE HAD A DAUGHTER FROM

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:23.845 size:88% position:44% line:92%
HIS FIRST MARRIAGE AND A

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:24.913 size:88% position:44% line:92%
DAUGHTER FROM HIS SECOND

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:25.847 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
MARRIAGE.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:26.214 line:92%
THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT MY

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:27.682 line:92%
SECOND SISTER I DIDN'T KNOW I

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:28.783 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:29.084 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:30.085 line:92%
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MOM?

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:33.688 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:34.155 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO TO THIS MOMENT WE HAVE NO

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.259 size:78% position:39% line:92%
IDEA HOW IT HAPPENED.

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.159 size:88% position:44% line:92%
WE KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:39.694 line:92%
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YOU DON'T

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.229 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
KNOW THE STORY.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.130 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:43.765 line:92%
ANY RELATIONSHIP THEY MAY OR MAY

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:45.133 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
NOT HAVE HAD.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:45.767 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHE WORKED IN HIS STORE.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:47.068 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YES.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:47.602 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT KIND OF STORE WAS IT?

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:49.004 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WAS LIKE A GIFT SHOP.

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:51.106 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SO IT'S A MYSTERY YOU'RE NOT

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:52.907 line:92%
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE.

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:54.276 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'LL NEVER KNOW.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:59.748 line:92%
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT I'LL

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.950 line:92%
NOT HAVE ANSWERS I'D LIKE TO

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:04.286 line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SUPPORT GROUP, PEOPLE SAY

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.920 line:92%
WHY DO YOU NEED A SUPPORT GROUP?

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:07.622 line:92%
IT'S SHOCKING, JARRING, SEEING

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:09.224 line:92%

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:16.598 size:84% position:42% line:92%
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT'S A TRAUMA.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:17.499 line:92%
I WOKE UP AND DECIDED I'M GOING

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:20.302 line:92%
TO CREATE A SUPPORT GROUP.

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:22.137 line:92%
INSTEAD I HAD BEEN ON FACEBOOK

YOU LEARNED FROM YOUR DNA TEST.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.780 line:92%
I WENT, I LEARNED MY DAD WAS NOT

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:34.249 size:78% position:39% line:92%
MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:35.684 line:92%
I WALKED AWAY AND I HEARD A

NOTIFICATION ON MY PHONE

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:39.387 line:92%
SOMEBODY WAS SENDING ME A TEXT.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:41.122 line:92%
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF MY

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:42.691 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FRIENDS.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:43.024 line:92%
IT WAS A WOMAN I NEVER HEARD

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:46.194 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
FROM BEFORE.

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:47.262 line:92%
IT WAS ONE SENTENCE, OH, MY GOD,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.830 line:92%
I THOUGHT I WAS THE OM ONE.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:50.298 line:92%
WE TEXTED FOR THREE HOURS

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:52.367 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
STRAIGHT.

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:52.734 size:75% position:38% line:92%
WE CRIED, SHARED OUR

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:56.137 size:84% position:42% line:92%
FRUSTRATIONS, OUR FEAR.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:56.905 size:88% position:44% line:92%
WE VALIDATED EACH OTHER.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:58.306 line:92%
WE VALIDATED OUR FEELINGS.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:08:00.108 line:92%
WE FOUND OUT WE WEREN'T CRAZY,

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.910 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
WEREN'T FREAKS.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.610 line:92%
AT THE END OF THAT THREE HOURS I

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.978 line:92%
SAID TO HER, NOTHING HAS CHANGED

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:05.413 line:92%
FOR ME, NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:07.415 size:84% position:42% line:92%
YOU, BUT I FEEL BETTER.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.550 line:92%
JUST TALKING TO YOU, I FEEL

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:10.118 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
BETTER.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:10.585 line:92%
LATER SHE TOLD ME THAT WHILE WE

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:12.454 size:88% position:44% line:92%
WERE TEXTING DURING THAT

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:13.855 line:92%
THREE-HOUR PERIOD, EVERY TIME

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.590 line:92%
SHE WOULD TYPE SOMETHING TO ME,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:18.259 line:92%
HER HEART WOULD POUND HARD IN

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:20.462 line:92%
HER CHEST AND SHE WOULD SAY,

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:21.796 line:92%
PLEASE, GOD, LET HER RESPOND

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:24.065 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
AGAIN.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:24.366 line:92%
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO THIS WOMAN.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:27.168 line:92%
WE LEARNED FAST WE WERE HELPING

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.770 line:92%
EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH NOTHING

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:30.505 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
CHANGED.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:30.839 line:92%
I SAID MAYBE WE CAN FIND FOUR OR

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:33.974 line:92%
FIVE PEOPLE LIKE US, THEY WOULD

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.210 line:92%
HELP US FEEL BETTER AND WE COULD

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:37.746 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
HELP THEM.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:39.114 size:78% position:39% line:92%
IT WAS PURELY SELFISH

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:40.949 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
MOTIVATION.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:41.349 line:92%

00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:55.996 line:92%
I GOT TO MEET BOTH OF THEM.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:56.498 line:92%
