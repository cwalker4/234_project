00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:07.898
FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.499
THE 2020 ELECTION CYCLE HAS

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.834
ALREADY BEGUN.

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:12.302
AND THE SUPERSTARS OF THE

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:13.503
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE NOW MORE

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:14.705
LEFT-WING THAN EVER BEFORE AND

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:17.074
THEY ARE ALREADY TRYING TO OUTDO

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.942
ONE ANOTHER ON THE COMPASSION

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:19.242
SCALE.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:22.913
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:25.048
RESTORE WHAT'S BEEN LOST.

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:25.816
THE INTEGRITY AND THE COMPASSION

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.818
OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:33.123
&gt;&gt; NEW YORK LOVES YOU IF YOU ARE

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:36.326
L OR G OR B OR T OR Q.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.861
IF YOU ARE BLACK OR WHITE OR

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:38.161
BROWN.

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.898
IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, A

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.300
MUSLIM, OR IF YOU ARE JEWISH.

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:46.103
IF YOU ARE A NEW APPLICANT OR AN

00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:49.106
OLD IMMIGRANT.

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:50.307
NEW YORK LOVES YOU AND WHAT

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:52.242
MAKES US GREAT IS WE HAVE NO

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:57.114
TOLERANCE FOR HATE IN OUR STATE.

00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:58.014
&gt;&gt; Laura: CATCHY.

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:02.919
HE LEFT OFF ASIANS AND ATHEISTS.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.320
OKAY.

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.689
OF COURSE WHAT CUOMO SAYS NO

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.525
TOLERANCE FOR HATE, HE REALLY

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:09.760
MEANS NO TOLERANCE FOR

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:10.961
CONSERVATIVES IN THE POSITIONS

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.763
THAT THEY HOLD.

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.331
BECAUSE IN CUOMO'S COMPASSIONATE

00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:16.466
NEW YORK, THERE'S NO TOLERANCE

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.368
FOR THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.536
THE UNBORN.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.305
YOU KNOW, THE LIFE IN THE WOMB

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:24.508
THAT HIS OWN CHURCH SAYS IS

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:24.841
SACRED.

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:27.043
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WE SHOULD PASS A

00:01:27.044 --> 00:01:29.346
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, NOT

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:31.815
JUST A ROE V. WADE LAW, A

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.951
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:37.154
LET'S WRITE THE RIGHTS OF ROVE

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:38.121
HE WEIGHED INTO THE STATE

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.490
CONSTITUTION SO IT CAN NEVER

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:40.991
BE CHANGED.

00:01:40.992 --> 00:01:42.125
&gt;&gt; Laura: I THINK WHAT'S GOING

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:43.960
ON HERE IS THAT CUOMO, LIKE SO

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.797
MANY ON THE LEFT, IS REALLY

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:47.130
WORRIED.

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.065
HE'S WORRIED THE SUPREME COURT

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.934
MIGHT REVERSE ROE, MIGHT SEND IT

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.302
ALL BACK TO THE STATE.

00:01:52.303 --> 00:01:54.538
HE ALSO HAS TO KNOW THAT PUBLIC

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.206
OPINION IS SHIFTING A BIT TOWARD

00:01:56.207 --> 00:01:59.376
THE MORE PRO-LIFE POSITION.

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:01.144
BY THE WAY, IF AMERICA'S

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.513
DECLINING FERTILITY RATE

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:05.115
CONTINUES, ANDY, I HAVE A

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:05.482
QUESTION.

00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:07.117
WHO'S GOING TO PAY ALL THOSE

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:09.786
TAXES TO SUPPORT HIS PET

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:10.153
PROJECTS?

00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:11.087
OF COURSE WITH ZERO REGARD FOR

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:16.126
FACTS, CUOMO BREXIT HE HAS THIS

00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:19.162
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THING DOWN

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:19.763
DOWN.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.499
&gt;&gt; THE MOST PROGRESSIVE

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.433
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:23.834
OF AMERICA.

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:25.302
WE HAVE BALANCED BUDGETS.

00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:30.040
WE HAVE THE MOST SOCIALLY

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:30.774
PROGRESSIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.909
ANY STATE IN THE NATION AND IT'S

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.544
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.546
FIRST BIG STATE TO PASS MARRIAGE

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:36.913
EQUALITY.

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:40.650
FIRST STATE TO PASS $15, HIGHEST

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.719
MINIMUM WAGE.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.921
&gt;&gt; Laura: YEA, THE DEMOCRAT

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.723
ZOMBIES, THEY ACTUALLY PANNED

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:47.357
THE AUDIENCE, THEY ARE

00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:49.259
STANDING, PLOTTING, STANDING

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.761
OVATION.

00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:52.596
BUT THEY ARE UNCONCERNED WITH

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:53.597
THE REAL-WORLD EFFECTS OF SOME

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.533
OF THOSE POLICIES, NAMELY THIS

00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:57.734
RISE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:02:57.735 --> 00:02:59.102
JOHN BLUESTEIN WHO OWNED SIX

00:02:59.103 --> 00:03:01.171
RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK CITY

00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:03.540
TOLD CBS WE LOST CONTROL

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:06.343
OF OUR LARGEST CONTROLLABLE

00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:07.444
EXPENSE, SO IN ORDER TO LIVE

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:08.578
WITH THAT AND STAY IN THE

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.814
BUSINESS HERE, WE ARE CUTTING

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.315
HOURS.

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:13.750
WELL, THIS IS THE THIRD WAGE

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.553
HIKE IN NEW YORK SINCE 2016.

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:18.755
SO WHO DOES THAT REALLY HELP?

00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:20.523
CERTAINLY NOT THE RESTAURANTS,

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.158
NOT THE WORKERS GETTING HOURS

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.761
CUT, AND OUT THE PATRONS.

00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:25.962
THE NEW YORK CITY HOSPITALITY

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:28.365
ALIGNED SURVEY OF 574

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:31.368
RESTAURANTS FOUND THAT 75% OF

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:32.903
FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANTS PLAN TO

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.805
CUT EMPLOYEE HOURS THIS YEAR DUE

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:37.507
TO THE MINIMUM WAGE HIKE.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:39.910
THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.947
47% SAY THEY WILL CUT JOBS IN

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:46.549
2019, AND 87% SAY THEY ARE GOING

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.250
TO RAISE MENU PRICES.

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.419
WE WENT OUT TO DINNER LAST NIGHT

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.120
NEW YORK.

00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:51.721
HE WAS PRETTY EXPENSIVE ALREADY.

00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:54.758
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE, MY

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.159
FRIENDS, OF COMPASSION.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.227
THIS BRINGS US TO THE FRESHEST

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.896
OF CONGRESSIONAL FRESHMEN.

00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:02.999
FRESH PEOPLE, WHAT CAN WE SAY?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.934
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ WHO

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.535
HAPPILY REFERS TO HERSELF AS

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:07.570
BOTH A SOCIALIST AND A RADICAL.

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.406
BY THE WAY, I THINK IT'S IN THE

00:04:09.407 --> 00:04:10.607
STATE FOR CONSERVATIVES NOT TO

00:04:10.608 --> 00:04:12.008
TAKE HER SERIOUSLY, TO BRUSH HER

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.511
OFF AS A FLASH IN    IN A PAN OR

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:14.978
AN UPSTART.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.347
SHE IS AS CLOSE TO A THOUGHT

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:18.114
LEADER THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:18.581
HAS TODAY.

00:04:18.582 --> 00:04:21.184
AND SHE HAS A MASSIVE

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:22.585
SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWING.

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.187
SHE IS BOTH CHARISMATIC AND

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:24.921
SHE'S COMMITTED TO TRANSFORMING

00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:29.125
BOTH OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND OUR

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:29.526
CULTURE.

00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:33.129
FIRST, SHE AIMS TO CREATE A

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.930
SOCIALIST ECONOMIC SYSTEM WITH

00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:35.865
SKY HIGH MARGINAL RATES.

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.535
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT OUR TAX

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.570
RATES BACK IN THE '60s AND

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.739
WHAT YOU HAVE A PROGRESSIVE TAX

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.141
RATE SYSTEM, YOUR TAX RATE, YOU

00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:48.945
KNOW, LET'S SAY FROM 0

00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:51.514
TO $75,000, MAY BE 10% OR 15%,

00:04:51.515 --> 00:04:52.115
ET CETERA.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:55.919
ONCE YOU GET TO THE TIPPY TOP,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.921
ON YOUR $10 MILLION, SOMETIMES

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:00.590
YOU SEE TAX RATES AS HIGH AS 60

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:03.727
OR 70%.

00:05:03.728 --> 00:05:05.562
DOESN'T MEAN ALL $10 MILLION OR

00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:06.296
TAX AT EXTREMELY HIGH RATE BUT

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:09.332
IT MEANS AS YOU CLIMB UP THIS

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.934
LATTER, YOU SHOULD BE

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:11.601
CONTRIBUTING MORE.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:13.870
&gt;&gt; Laura: WELL, IT DOESN'T

00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:14.738
STOP THERE.

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:17.407
&gt;&gt; IF WE GET PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR

00:05:17.408 --> 00:05:19.075
FAIR SHARE, THAT'S

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:19.909
2,000,000,000,010 YEARS.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.345
NOW IF WE IMPLEMENT A CARBON TAX

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:25.582
ON TOP OF THAT, SO THAT WE CAN

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:26.516
TRANSITION AND FINANCIALLY

00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:27.717
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE AWAY FROM

00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:30.053
FOSSIL FUELS, IF WE IMPLEMENT

00:05:30.054 --> 00:05:33.156
CARBON TAX THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:34.791
AMOUNT OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.259
REVENUE THAT WE CAN HAVE.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.130
&gt;&gt; Laura: TREVOR NOAH'S EYES

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:40.864
ARE GLAZING OVER.

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:42.732
HOW DOES ANY OF THIS ADD UP?

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:43.566
IT DOESN'T.

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:44.868
ON THE CULTURAL SIDE, SHE AND

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:46.870
OTHERS LIKE OR INTEND TO USE THE

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:47.570
GOVERNMENT AND THEIR POSITIONS

00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:52.742
OF INFLUENCE NOW TO MANDATE

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:53.309
CAMPUS-STYLE POLITICAL

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.710
CORRECTNESS.

00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.145
WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT?

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.179
WELL, ANYONE WHO DARES QUESTION

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.915
THIS PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IS NOT

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.717
JUST WRONG BUT THEY ARE

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:02.052
DOWNRIGHT EVIL.

00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:04.721
SO THERE'S NO ROOM FOR DEBATE,

00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:05.955
ONLY DEMONIZATION.

00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:08.925
AND A RECENT TWEET SHE ASSERTS

00:06:08.926 --> 00:06:10.026
MANY HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT

00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:12.028
FOX NEWS HAS CROSSED A LINE

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.063
BEYOND CONSERVATISM INTO

00:06:13.064 --> 00:06:14.764
OUTRIGHT BIGOTRY WITH THEIR

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.233
FINANCE OF TUCKER CARLSON

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:18.568
LAURA INGRAHAM.

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.071
YOU SEE, MY FRIENDS, THIS ISN'T

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:22.138
YOUR DADDY'S LIBERALISM WHERE IT

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.307
WAS ALL ABOUT LOVE AND PEACE AND

00:06:24.308 --> 00:06:26.543
LIVE AND LET LIVE.

00:06:26.544 --> 00:06:29.312
THIS IS KIND OF THE OLD-SCHOOL

00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:30.213
NEW ENGLAND PURITANISM WITH A

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:30.914
RADICAL TWIST.

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:33.850
THEY ARE GOING TO WITH BUFFED

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:35.718
THEIR FOLLOWERS TO TRY TO

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:36.519
INTIMIDATE AND SILENCE ANYONE

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.322
WHO GETS IN THEIR WAY.

00:06:39.323 --> 00:06:40.090
NOW, SHE'S ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB

00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:41.357
FOR LIKE SIX DAYS BUT SHE'S

00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:46.129
ALREADY PRACTICING THE RULES FOR

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.496
RADICALS.

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:49.532
RULE 13, PICK THE TARGET, FREEZE

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:52.302
IT, PERSONALIZE IT, AND POLARIZE

00:06:52.303 --> 00:06:52.569
IT.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.071
CUT OFF THE SUPPORT NETWORK AND

00:06:55.072 --> 00:06:55.939
ISOLATE THE TARGET FROM

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.340
SYMPATHY.

00:06:57.341 --> 00:06:59.943
GO AFTER PEOPLE AND NOT

00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:00.376
INSTITUTIONS.

00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:02.178
PEOPLE HURT FASTER THAN

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.214
INSTITUTIONS.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.749
RATHER THAN DEBATING THE MERIT

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.719
OF POLICIES, THESE NEW LEFT-WING

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.855
PROGRESSIVE PURITANS AIM TO

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:13.723
SHAME.

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.992
A WALL IS RACIST, SO PEOPLE WHO

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:17.560
WANT A WALL ARE RACIST.

00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:20.530
END OF STORY.

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:22.365
&gt;&gt; A WALL IS IN IMMORALITY.

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:24.734
IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION.

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.170
IT'S A WALL BETWEEN REALITY AND

00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:30.140
HIS CONSTITUENTS, HIS

00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:30.540
SUPPORTERS.

00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:31.741
&gt;&gt; Laura: NOW, ALL OF YOU WHO

00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.143
ARE DOING BETTER IN THE TRUMP

00:07:33.144 --> 00:07:34.777
ECONOMY, YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.

00:07:34.778 --> 00:07:36.079
THEY PLAN TO TAKE YOUR MONEY

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.983
AWAY AND REDISTRIBUTED TO, YOU

00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:40.984
KNOW, WHATEVER THEIR PET CAUSES

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:41.351
ARE.

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:43.186
AND TO ALL OF OUR LIBERTARIAN

00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:44.888
FRIENDS WHO BELIEVE THAT TRUMP

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.122
IS THE BIG THREAT TO THE FREE

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.191
MARKET BECAUSE OF TARIFFS AND SO

00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:50.593
FORTH, OPEN YOUR EYES.

00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:52.595
THESE PEOPLE, INCLUDING

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:54.130
NANCY PELOSI, THEY ARE GOING TO

00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:55.932
TAKE IT ALL AWAY.

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:57.967
FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF

00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:00.336
CONTRACT, FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR

00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:00.737
CONSCIENCE.

00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:01.938
YOU THINK I'M EXAGGERATING.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:02.739
I'M NOT.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.541
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THE WRONG

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:06.876
THING IN OR BECAUSE IO CORTES'

00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:07.710
WORLD, THEY PUT YOU IN DETENTION

00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:10.113
HALL AND YOU NEVER GET OUT.

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:13.016
REMEMBER, THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE

00:08:13.017 --> 00:08:16.619
RIGHT AND YOU ARE EVIL.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.354
MODERATES EVEN SEEM PETRIFIED OF

00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:19.322
TAKING ON THESE NEW

00:08:19.323 --> 00:08:19.756
PROGRESSIVES.

00:08:19.757 --> 00:08:24.260
THIS IS FORMER SEC CHAIR RICHARD

00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.895
BREDON TODAY ON CNBC.

00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:28.331
&gt;&gt; ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ

SERVICES COMMITTEE LED BY MAXINE

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:32.001
WATERS.

00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:32.735
WHAT IS THAT GOING TO LOOK LIKE

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.138
FOR THE INDUSTRY?

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.573
&gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE SHE WILL LEARN

00:08:36.574 --> 00:08:37.740
SOMETHING.

00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:38.074
[LAUGHS]

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.877
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU QUESTIONING SOME OF

00:08:40.878 --> 00:08:41.177

00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:43.346
SOME OF HER ECONOMIC IDEAS THAT

00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:43.880
SHE'S PUT OUT THERE?

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.917
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY

00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:50.186
HISTORIC EVIDENCE THAT 70% TAX

00:08:50.187 --> 00:08:54.591
RATE FACILITATES GDP GROWTH.

00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:56.726
PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, WE WILL

00:08:56.727 --> 00:08:57.327
DISCOVER SOMETHING.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.328
&gt;&gt; Laura: [LAUGHS]

00:08:58.329 --> 00:08:58.728
OH, MY GOD.

00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:01.331
I AM WASHING THIS THIS MORNING

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.933

00:09:03.934 --> 00:09:04.334

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.935
REAL POWERFUL REPUTATION, REAL

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:06.936
STRONG DEFENSE STRONG DEFENSE OF

00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:07.937
FREE MARKET IN CAPITALISM.

00:09:07.938 --> 00:09:09.973
REPUBLICANS ARE TO TAKE THE

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:11.140
PROGRESSIVE TAKE OVER THE

00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:12.141
DEMOCRATIC PARTY VERY SERIOUSLY

00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:14.344
AND OFFER A STRONG COUNTER

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:14.711
NARRATIVE.

00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:15.612
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:17.614
LOOKS LIKE TO BE A CONSERVATIVE

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:18.781
AND PERPETUALLY IN THE FETAL

00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:20.717
POSITION WORRIED ABOUT BEING

00:09:20.718 --> 00:09:22.352
BRANDED RACIST OR EVIL, WELL,

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.686
LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THERESA

00:09:23.687 --> 00:09:23.953
MAY.

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:25.788
DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL FOR HER

00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:26.856
TO BE ON HER HEELS.

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.324
NOW TRUMP IS THE OPPOSITE.

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:28.691
HE FIGHTS.

00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:30.526
HE FIGHTS FOR LAW AND ORDER.

00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:31.928
HE FIGHTS FOR SOVEREIGNTY.

00:09:31.929 --> 00:09:32.829
HE FIGHTS FOR JUDGES TO APPLY

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.797
THE LAWS OF DON'T REWRITE IT.

00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:37.734
AND HE FIGHTS FOR A STRONGER

00:09:37.735 --> 00:09:38.067
ECONOMY.

00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:39.135
SO AFTER TWO YEARS OF

00:09:39.136 --> 00:09:43.139
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE HIGHER

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.274
WAGES, 500,000 NEW MANUFACTURING

00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:46.809
JOBS, THE STRONGEST GDP GROWTH

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.178
AMONG ALL THE G-7 NATIONS.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:52.148
BUT THE PROGRESSIVES, THEY DON'T

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:53.149
CARE BECAUSE IF ENACTING THEIR

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.384
GREEN CONTRACT WITH AMERICA

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.685
REQUIRES YOUR STANDARD OF LIVING

00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:58.421
TO GO DOWN, TOUGH COOKIES.

00:09:58.422 --> 00:10:00.857
THESE PEOPLE ARE FANATICS, AND

00:10:00.858 --> 00:10:03.960
THEY ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.395
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CONSIDERING RUNNING

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:05.962
FOR PRESIDENT?

00:10:05.963 --> 00:10:07.964
&gt;&gt; I'M FOCUSED ON MY JOB BUT

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:09.999
LISTEN, RIGHT NOW OUR PARTY IS

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.134
GOING THROUGH A SERIES DEBATE

00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:12.101
AND THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

00:10:12.102 --> 00:10:13.536
MODERATE VOICES IN THE PARTY

00:10:13.537 --> 00:10:15.972
THEY DID NOT LEARN THE LESSONS

00:10:15.973 --> 00:10:16.306
OF 2016.

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:17.573
THEY ARE NOT LISTENING TO WHAT

00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:18.975
PEOPLE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY, SO

00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:20.743
I WANT TO PUSH THIS WHOLE PARTY

00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:22.578
-- WE COULD GO A LOT FARTHER.

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.580
WE COULD BE BOLDER THAN WHAT

00:10:24.581 --> 00:10:25.148
WE'RE DOING NOW.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:26.683
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU RULING IT OUT?

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:28.184
&gt;&gt; I NEVER RULE THINGS OUT.

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.153
&gt;&gt; Laura: WATCH YOUR WALLET.

00:10:30.154 --> 00:10:31.321
WHAT ARE THE PROGRESSIVES

00:10:31.322 --> 00:10:33.356
ACTUALLY LEARNING THEMSELVES?

00:10:33.357 --> 00:10:34.357
MODERATES AREN'T LEARNING.

00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:35.792
WHAT ARE THE PROGRESSIVES

00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:36.359
LEARNING?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.360
NOT MUCH.

00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:39.595
AMERICANS ARE FLEEING THE MOST

00:10:39.596 --> 00:10:40.730
PROGRESSIVE STATES IN AMERICA

00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:44.267
DUE TO HIGH COSTS AND HIGH TAXE

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:44.567
TAXES.

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:45.635
NO WONDER THEY ARE WELCOME THE

00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:46.736
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN NEW YORK

00:10:46.737 --> 00:10:47.337
AND CALIFORNIA.

00:10:47.338 --> 00:10:48.805
THEY NEED THE CITIZENS COME

00:10:48.806 --> 00:10:49.339
AGAIN.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.374
ALL THAT OTHER CITIZENS ARE

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:51.708
LEAVING.

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:54.845
ARE AMERICANS REALLY READY TO BE
