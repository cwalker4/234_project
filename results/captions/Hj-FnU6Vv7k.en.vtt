00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.469
President Trump
is a threat to democracy,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.738
but as Republicans
in Wisconsin and Michigan

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.807
have made clear this week,
he's not alone.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.209
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.346
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:17.249
We know Trump thinks
he's above the law.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.652
That much is clear
in the Russia investigation.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.988
Trump keeps interfering
in that investigation

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.590
by dangling the possibility
of pardons for his aides

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.560
or praising associates
who refuse to cooperate

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.695
like his ex-campaign chairman
Paul Manafort

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.931
or his former adviser
Roger Stone.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.832
-"I feel very badly
for Paul Manafort

00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:35.067
and his wonderful family.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.503
Justice took
a 12-year-old tax case

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.473
and, among other things, applied
tremendous pressure on him.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.342
And unlike Michael Cohen,
he refused to break

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.645
and make up stories
in order to get a deal.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.313
Such respect for a brave man."

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.315
-"I will never testify
against Trump."

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.884
This statement was recently made
by Roger Stone,

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.920
essentially stating
that he will not be forced

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.356
by a rogue and out-of-control
prosecutor

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.359
to make up lies and stories
about President Trump.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.663
"Nice to know that some people
still have guts!"

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.998
-Well, he is right
about Stone's guts.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.467
This is a real photo

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:11.337
of his actual outfit
from the inauguration.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.407
It takes real guts
to go out in public

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.376
dressed like a coke dealer
from a Charles Dickens novel.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.545
I mean, look at him.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:25.084
He looks like he's about to
carjack Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.220
And for months,
Trump has been openly

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.856
floating the possibility
of pardoning Manafort,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.924
even as Special Counsel
Robert Mueller

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.761
tries to get Manafort to
cooperate in the investigation.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.529
Trump even praised Manafort
publicly

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.031
in an interview on Fox News
and complained that Mueller

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.434
was trying to get him and
other Trump associates to flip.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.837
-This whole thing about
flipping, they call it --

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.539
I know all about flipping.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.108
For 30, 40 years,
I've been watching flippers.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.777
They flip on whoever
the next-highest one is.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:54.581
It's called flipping, and
it almost ought to be illegal.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.850
-You know...

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.952
Trump may say
he's against flipping,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.686
but if he was ever arrested,

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:03.489
he would flip more than a dad
working the grill at a cookout.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.092
Here is our scientific
computer simulation

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:10.029
of how Donald Trump would react
if he was indicted.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.931
"It was Don Jr., it was Eric,
it was Ivanka,

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.165
it was Melania, it was Tiffany!

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.468
Take Tiffany! You don't want me!
You want Tiffany!"

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:18.338
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.644
And Trump did it again last week

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.278
in an interview
with the "New York Post"

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.780
where he confirmed again

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.482
that he's considering
pardoning Manafort.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.083
-During an Oval Office
interview,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.952
President Trump told
the "New York Post"

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.420
he has not ruled out a pardon

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.789
for former campaign chairman
Paul Manafort.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.326
"It was never discussed, but I
wouldn't take it off the table.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.229
Why would I take it off the
table?" The President said.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.563
-Here's my question.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:47.233
Why are you doing interviews
with the "New York Post"?

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.936
Trump so desperately wishes
he was the mayor of New York

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.605
and not the president.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.707
Then all he'd have to do
is talk to the "Post,"

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.142
show up to ribbon cuttings,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.444
and have sandwiches
named after him at delis.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.446
"Make sure you order
the Donald Trump.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.015
It's a turkey sandwich,

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.550
but the turkey is ham
because I'm a liar."

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.619
[ Laughter ]

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.255
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.290
Trump was already facing

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.093
possible obstruction of justice
charges before,

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.862
but his comments praising
Manafort and Stone

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.199
and dangling the possibility of
a pardon raised a new question.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.200
Is he also guilty
of witness tampering?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.901
That's the opinion
of at least one

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.070
prominent Republican lawyer,
George Conway --

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.406
the husband of
Kellyanne Conway --

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.707
who's been an outspoken critic
of Trump.

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.377
George Conway retweeted Trump's
tweet about Roger Stone

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.845
and added this --

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.082
"File under '18 USC
subsections 1503, 1512.'"

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:38.418
Which are the statutes
of witness tampering

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.286
and obstruction of justice.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.387
The best part of that move

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.088
is that by tweeting out
the actual laws,

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:46.058
he made sure Trump will have
no idea what he's talking about.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:49.294
"18 USC 503.
What language is this?

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:51.597
You know what? I'm just gonna
quick 'translate tweet.'"

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.932
[ Mouse clicks ]

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:55.101
[ Laughter ]

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.206
So...

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.808
Trump has been dangling
the prospect of a pardon

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.376
and hoping Manafort and Stone

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.045
will refuse to cooperate
with Mueller.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.180
If you're Mueller, the question
is, how do you respond to that?

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.950
And we found out on Tuesday
when he filed a sentencing memo

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.219
for ex-national security adviser
Michael Flynn

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.388
and recommended
that Flynn get no jail time

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.957
because he's cooperated
with multiple investigations.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.259
And yet,
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.962
tried to argue that that was
actually good news for Trump,

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:25.865
although I really can't follow
his logic or his syntax.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.867
Here's a text message
that Rudy Giuliani,

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.771
the President's lawyer,
sent to a political reporter

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.305
after the Flynn news broke.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:36.075
"Wow. Big crime
for a special whatever.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.911
Maybe a group of angry, bitter
Hillary supporters

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.582
who are justifying themselves
by the goal justifies the means.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:45.485
Over-the-top
unethical behavior."

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.787
What?!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:52.758
Does Giuliani's iPhone
have auto-incorrect?

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:56.428
I have no idea what that means.

00:04:56.428 --> 00:04:59.298
It's like when your grandpa uses
the voice-to-text feature

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.766
while he's driving.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.368
"Wow. Big crime
for special whatever.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:03.936
Watch where you're going,
you idiot.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.671
Oh, that was my exit."

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.473
[ Laughter ]

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.109
Of course,
Rudy isn't just bad with phones.

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.644
He's also terrible at Twitter.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.879
Last week, he tweeted,
"Mueller filed an indictment

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.015
just as the President left
for G-20.In July

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.683
he indicted the Russians,
who will never come here,

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.352
just before he left
for Helsinki."

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.487
But because Giuliani
forgot to put a space

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:24.557
between the period and "in,"
he accidentally created a link.

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:27.392
So someone bought
that link for $5,

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:30.696
and now when you click on it,
you get this message.

00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:33.299
[ Laughter ]

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.000
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.004
Ya burnt.
So basically, ya burnt.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:42.374
In reality, we burnt
because the same grandpa vampire

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:44.844
who wrote that tweet was named
cyber security adviser

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.380
by Trump in 2017,
which is like putting

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.182
the Hamburglar in
charge of security

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.317
at the ground-beef factory.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.318
So the story that's
unfolding here is simple.

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:55.287
Trump broke election laws,
lied about it,

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:57.556
and then tried to obstruct the
investigation with those lies.

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:59.658
He's a threat to democracy
and the rule of law.

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:01.927
But he's not alone,
as we've seen this week

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:03.996
in states like
Wisconsin and Michigan.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.365
After the GOP lost elections
in those states,

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.901
Republicans in Wisconsin
and Michigan responded

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.669
with pushes to limit the power

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.838
of Democrats
who won those offices.

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:15.675
The GOP's power grab
in Wisconsin is so shameless

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:18.944
that hundreds of protesters
have streamed into the capitol

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.346
to vent their anger, and
they just happened to be there

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:22.815
on the same day
that the outgoing

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.516
Republican governor,
Scott Walker,

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.952
was hosting the annual
tree-lighting ceremony,

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:29.288
which produced
this very odd scene.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:32.258
-Protesters swarm the capitol
for the second day straight.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:35.928
-The governor of the state
of Wisconsin, Scott Walker.

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.165
[ Mixed applause and boos ]

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.136
-Merry Christmas.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.371
-Demonstrators booed
Governor Walker

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:48.040
at a Christmas
tree-lighting ceremony.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.343
-It's so weird to watch
someone say "Merry Christmas"

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.678
to a bunch of people booing him.

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:55.647
He's like a dad who got his kids
a graphing calculator

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:58.450
when what they really wanted
was an Xbox.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.918
"Hey, kids, let's do some math.

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:02.355
You want to show me
what you're working on?"

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.323
[ Laughter ]

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:07.059
Republicans are trying to get
away with this as we speak,

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.395
but protesters have
courageously challenged them

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.696
in public hearings.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.097
Here's one Wisconsin resident

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:13.866
who showed up
to a public hearing

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.934
and stood up to Republicans
while also trying

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.370
to maintain
her Wisconsin politeness.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.274
-Greetings. My name is Jan...

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:26.679
And I'm speaking mainly
to the Republicans here

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:31.183
because I believe there is
something you don't understand,

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.519
and that is that you lost.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.420
You lost! You lost!

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.023
The problem is
you can't let go of power.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.326
And you're stealing!

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.062
I've looked at this panel
for six hours.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.596
You couldn't look at us.

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.699
You don't trust us.
You think you're better.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.968
You think
you're more intelligent.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.637
Well, you're not. You're not
letting the voters choose.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.473
Look at me!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.609
-Oh, you done it now!
Jan is angry!

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.677
[ Laughter ]

00:07:58.677 --> 00:08:00.579
In Wisconsin...

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:03.416
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:05.951
And that's a big deal
because in Wisconsin

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:08.854
the highest threat level
is Angry Jan!

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:11.990
[ Laughter ]

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.962
Jan even put on
her yellin' turtleneck.

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:19.031
Republicans in Michigan
are also trying

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.599
to preemptively take power away

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:21.934
from the incoming governor

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.336
and the incoming
attorney general, Dana Nessel,

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:26.505
and if you're wondering if
Nessel is the kind of attorney

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.740
who's going to sit quietly
for that sort of thing,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.577
allow me to direct you
to this very real campaign ad

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:32.978
she aired last year.

00:08:32.978 --> 00:08:35.447
-If the last few weeks
has taught us anything,

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:39.552
it's that we need more women
in positions of power, not less.

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.220
So when you're choosing

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.122
Michigan's
next attorney general,

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:44.823
ask yourself this.

00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:46.792
Who can you trust most

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.896
not to show you their penis
in a professional setting?

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:53.833
Is it the candidate
who doesn't have a penis?

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.301
I'd say so.

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.336
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.476
And she was right,
but unfortunately,

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:06.545
even if Republicans
don't take out their penises,

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.081
they can still act
like a bunch of dicks.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.284
You might be thinking
to yourself,

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.819
hey, Republicans won the state
legislature fair and square,

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.988
so they get to pass the laws
if they want.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:19.025
but Republicans actually won the
state legislature in Wisconsin

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.792
despite getting fewer votes

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:23.929
because gerrymandering
in Wisconsin is insane.

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:26.232
-Wisconsin Democrats
won a majority of votes

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.168
for the state assembly,
state legislature.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:32.104
They won by a margin
of 8 points.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:35.341
That's where Wisconsin Democrats
hit a snag.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.543
Because of the way
Republicans in Wisconsin

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.112
have gerrymandered the districts
in the state,

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:44.283
even though the Democrats got
more votes in the assembly --

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.718
they got a ton more.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:48.821
They won by 8 points in terms
of votes for assembly seats,

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:51.957
but still, Republicans won
most of the seats.

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:55.861
-Republicans won 45% of the vote
and 64% of the seats.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.630
And look,
I'm not saying Dana Nessel

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.531
is right about Republicans
and penises,

00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:01.967
but some of those districts
look very strange.

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:04.136
[ Laughter ]

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.338
Trump might be
the most prominent example

00:10:06.338 --> 00:10:08.407
of the GOP's lawlessness,
but he's not alone.

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:10.609
We have a president
who thinks he's above the law

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.544
and Republicans who think
they're above elections.

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:14.747
A democracy can't function
if you change the rules

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:15.981
after the game just because --

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.318
-You lost! You lost! You lost!

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:23.422
-You're a hero, Jan!
This has been "A Closer Look."
