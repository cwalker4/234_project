00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.020
this enormous tank next to me is the
King Tiger tank the Tiger II Konigstiger

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.480
sometimes called for the Allies
sometimes a royal tiger and as you can

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.609
see it is an enormous beast for many
people they consider this the ultimate

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.429
development of German tanks in World War
two now the tiger we've already

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.470
discussed the tiger program with our
tiger one tank chat with the tiger II

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.360
what we're looking at here is a vehicle
that obviously comes after the tiger one

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.110
but it's done with a desire from Hitler
and a desire of Hitler's is a really an

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.490
order that has to be carried out his
desire in early 1943 is to see the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.460
massive l71 Rhine Mattel gun
it's an 88 millimeter gun put onto a

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.460
tank and what happens about that is that
he goes as ever to the Panzer Commission

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.260
there's discussions about this they go
out and they look at the two companies

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.790
that have built the tiger one and asked
them if they can find a way of putting

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.540
this new 88 millimeter gun onto a tiger
chassis of some sort so it's all part of

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.100
this what's called overall the tiger
program in the German military so

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.440
Porsche and Hinkle are the two people
who competed for the tiger one they

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.159
compete again in essence for the tiger -
initially Porsches design he's coming up

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.900
with the same petrol electric drive that
he's been thinking about for his early

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.180
submission for the tiger one that then
goes into the elephant vehicle he thinks

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.479
that's a way to go he looks at that he
puts out a prototype he actually does

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.580
two variations of prototypes VK 4502
brackets p that means basically the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.019
porsche variant now those vehicles are
demonstrated in October of 1943 the

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.849
prototypes the design work is shown to
Hitler then at the same time in the

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.720
background Henkel are looking at their
designs fir

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.490
of all they suggest why don't we just
add some extra armor on the front of the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.040
tiger one will that help do that's not
good enough that won't actually meet the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.970
bill so Porsha's design its exhibited he
has two variants of it one with the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.630
turret at the front of the vehicle one
with the turret at the rear of the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.940
vehicle one of the versions has the
engine in the middle one of the versions

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.520
has the engine in the rear so different
ways of putting the combination of his

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.990
petrol electric drive together the
Henschel version after they've suggested

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.340
this initial extra bit of armour they
then come up with the idea of stretching

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.670
the tiger one hull they used an angled
front they actually put the armor plate

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.170
at about fifty degree angle and they
actually angle the rear in a similar

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.320
manner to what's going on with the
Panther design at that particular time

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.950
they make interleaved road wheels these
now actually are a slightly different to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.350
what was done on the tiger they overlap
but they're not interleaved in between

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.430
so that it was easier to actually get
access to some of the inner road wheels

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.630
they need to do that because again the
weight of this vehicle is increasing all

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.510
the time you need that level of
suspension to spread the way over the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.500
wide tracks they look at the track issue
again they're going to do what they've

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.360
done with Tiger one we have 80
centimeter wide tracks for cross country

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.140
work we have 66 wide centimeter tracks
for transportation so again the side

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.760
skirts will come off smaller tracks put
on if we're going to transport that

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.090
vehicle by rail which is a usual way of
moving big vehicles like this behind the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.420
lines and they're taken as close as they
can to rail heads behind the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.010
battlefields before off-loaded the
transportation tracks taken off and the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.130
wider tracks put back on now henckles
design winds that they're both are

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.830
exhibited in October of 43 Henkel gets
the contract for the hulls the porsche

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.060
design it's considered still when he's
trying to push his petrol electric

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.170
design at this stage of the wards
as earlier on the German military are

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.470
very very nervous about the use of too
much copper which his electric engines

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.270
in essence are going to be needing on
the motors there so the copper is not

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.450
going to be available and they're
worried about that so they go for the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.380
Henschel design it goes into production
in December of 1943 and order is put in

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:02.810
for 1500 Tiger twos a couple of built
just before Christmas of 1943 three

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.550
prototypes of the first vehicles to come
out of the Hinkle works and we're very

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.690
lucky here at the Tank Museum because
we've actually got the second prototype

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.400
vehicle that's v2 so we've got v1 v2 and
v3 are the vehicles that are actually

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.000
put as test vehicles v2 was used as a
test vehicle at house and back

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.180
throughout the entire rest of the war it
was captured by the British it was still

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.540
being used for trials by the Germans and
we're lucky enough to have that vehicle

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:44.540
here now in December of 1943 crap have
been asked could they redesign the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.330
turret that they've originally come up
with with this new gun on now crap

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.730
first of all they don't like the idea of
fitting a rival gun to their turret so

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.820
the RAI metal 88 millimeter l/71 gun
Krupp decides to redesign it so they

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.770
have a go at it themselves it looks very
similar its performances is exactly the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.630
same as a Rui Mattel gun and that's the
gun they fit actually to their turrets

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.890
again it's very important now to
emphasise crop designs that German tank

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.290
turrets poor Hensel are designing for
this competition the hulls very

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.090
different things to think about because
the turret that is put on that Porsche

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.650
design initially is often called by
people the pork

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.490
turret Porsche had nothing to do with
the design of that tire and that's

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.400
something that we've in our Tiger
display here we've been trying to get

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.760
across to people so we perhaps because
it's erroneous really to call it a

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.820
Porsche turret he has nothing whatsoever
to do with it

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.390
crup has a design
process and as the contracts for

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.520
designing the turrets for the tiger to
program the German military arsim to

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.320
redesign the turret because they don't
like the shape of it and also its

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.050
production costs and the time it takes
to make it it's very complex now when we

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.660
look at that early version of the turret
it's got a curved front to it that was

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.070
considered a potential shot trap rounds
coming in could actually be glossed

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.840
underneath that curved frontage and the
other issue as well is the side of the

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.460
turret has a bulge in it where the
commander's cupola is and that again

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.930
cause much more trouble in its
production process so crap redesigns the

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.000
turret to make it simpler to manufacture
and to eliminate that shot trap and that

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.300
we often all here at the tank museum
we're calling that the production turret

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.150
they've already built over 50 of the
earlier model turrets so they decide to

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.020
use those first they were thinking it
might have gone on the porsche design

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.880
they changed one or two small elements
of it and they thickened the roof armour

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.400
and then they're actually issued to the
first 50 Tiger twos that Henschel

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.140
actually makes so they're those that
early type of turret you can see in some

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.660
of the shots where the tiger is used for
the very first time in July of 1944 in

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.910
the battles in Normandy the production
turret narrower front the gun is

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:16.160
slightly offset to allow the optic scope
to be fitted it starts with a binocular

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.870
optic scope but then it goes on to a
monocular optic scope the gun we've

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:26.540
mentioned very powerful gun basically
the difference between the l71 88

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.510
millimeter and the tiger 1 gun the L 56
gun is the cartridge case is doubled in

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.200
size there's double the amount of
propellant and that means a very similar

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.070
sized round comes out the end of that
barrel with an enormous amount of force

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.780
behind it and it's actual velocity goes
about to speed wise you're looking at

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:51.290
about a thousand meters a second and
that gun can take out most known allied

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.470
tanks at a range up to three kilometers
so that's a very very impressive

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.500
advantage this tanks going to have being
- if you've got that sort of distance to

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.190
fire from that's going to give you a
huge advantage before any of the Allied

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.740
tanks can start getting in range so very
powerful gun the armor that Henschel

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.040
puts on it
you've got 15 centimeters of armor at

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.750
the front they're angled at 50 degrees
that is very very thick for World War

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.780
two terms thinner armor on the sides and
on the rear turret front mantlet again

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.610
very thick and they built this enormous
cast man clip round the gun to help

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.150
protect it
that narrower frontage also means you've

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.340
got much more less of a target area to
hit from frontal strikes and there's a

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.380
general consensus that pretty much no
Tiger - was penetrated on its front

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.250
armor during the course of the war
statistically we think probably a

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.440
discarding sabot round with a tungsten
core from a 17 pounder could penetrate

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.770
the front armor but that engagement that
never took place

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.720
so that thick armor that again was one
of the things Hitler is influencing the

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.670
design he's insisting thicker armor on
his tanks Hitler's the general view is

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.980
every year he wants to see another
generation of German tanks coming out

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.140
that he's going to leapfrog a head and
not allow the Russian or the Western

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.720
Allies tanks to either catch up or
overtake his own tanks in service so

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.140
very thick armor very powerful gun they
still use the Maybach HL 230 engine the

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.120
engine that's gone in the later tiger
ones and into the panther those engines

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.040
there when you're looking at it with a
tiger - basically it's powering a

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.430
vehicle that is 20 tons heavier so again
that sense of the available power to get

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.560
what becomes about a 68 ton vehicle
around the battlefield again you you

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.339
there's that general sensors consensus
that really this is not a powerful

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:59.810
enough engine transmission very again
similar to Tiger one the Tigers as I say

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.220
they go into action of July 44 for the
first time they're issued two heavy tank

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.110
battalion Shred pounds wrapped islands
normally about 45 tanks per battalion

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.549
the first engagement takes place in
Normandy with a 503

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:17.660
heavy tank battalion this particular
vehicle is serving with an SS battalion

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:24.769
heavy tank battalion in Normandy it's
being used by the 501st they are in

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:29.989
retreat we think this particular vehicle
the crew member drives it into a field

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:34.189
near Beauvais were not too sure whether
or not that's when the final drive was

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:39.109
damaged by the crew member who may be
inexperienced in it we know there's an

00:11:39.109 --> 00:11:43.730
account that it's claimed by a sergeant
Roberts of the 23rd has ours there in

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.999
the field they fire at the vehicle we
can have a look at the battle damage in

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:51.350
a moment that vehicle when it was firing
at this vehicle we think it's already

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.519
abandoned by the Germans and again we're
doing a little bit of research because

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:59.660
we can't quite work out why the 23rd has
ours or in that part of Normandy at the

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.999
time according to their battle their war
Diaries so these things again peeling

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:08.869
away the layers about why certain
vehicles get certain stories associated

00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:12.049
with them sometimes we just make you
have to make sure that they're not

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:15.769
confused with something else so more
research to be done there the vehicle is

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:19.040
photographed in the field where it's
captured so we have those photographs in

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.699
the collection and ultimately it's
recovered and brought back to the UK as

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:26.480
part of a number of German tanks that
have bring ball back for analysis and

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.910
this particular tiger with its 104 on it
ends up at the teaching account in the

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.679
Academy it's shriven 'im where it was
there for many many years sadly various

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:42.649
components engine etc was stripped from
it over the years it's good outside

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:46.879
condition that's got a reproduction
zimmerit coat on not a bad-looking paint

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:52.730
job but again it's not quite as it was
when it wouldn't in service and about a

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.629
decade or so ago it came down here it's
now part of the tank museum's collection

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:02.899
down here at Bovington so an amazing
beast one thing we just like to round up

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:08.149
on we're here at bobbington this is a
teaching base a teaching collection for

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:10.549
the serving military you can probably
hear in the background there's military

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:16.160
vehicles driving around here all the
time now the issue for us is we use this

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.509
vehicle as an example to teach to the
modern military because this is an

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:26.030
example of where technology has gone in
a certain direction the skill set needed

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:31.150
not just to make this vehicle but to
also crew it a very high now that issue

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.960
modern militaries are going to face
again if you look at it the stats show

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.600
that this vehicle would take about three
hundred thousand man-hours to make three

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.210
hundred thousand that is an awful lot of
man-hours it cost obey about eight

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:53.420
hundred thousand Reich marks to build
and again that's about the price of two

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.760
tiger ones a hugely expensive vehicle
now to give a bit of a comparison eight

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.900
hundred thousand right marks is about
three hundred and thirty thousand US

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.910
dollars in World War two a Sherman tank
cost about thirty to thirty three
