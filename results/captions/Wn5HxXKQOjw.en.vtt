00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.700
For the past decade, the entire world has
had their eyes on SpaceX as they have revolutionized

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.070
rocket engineering and space travel.
From launching a sports car into orbit, to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.749
the promise of establishing a futuristic colony
on mars, their spectacles have generated levels

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.929
of public excitement and media coverage that
haven’t been seen since NASA’s Apollo

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.130
program which ended more than 40 years ago.
At the core of their ambitious plans is one

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.159
of the greatest technological developments
in the history of rocket engineering: reusable

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.240
rockets.
First announced to the public in 2011, the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.780
SpaceX reusable launch system development
program set out to create a new generation

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.979
of launch vehicles that would drastically
reduce the cost of reaching orbit.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.149
To accomplish this, SpaceX proposed the seemingly
impossible task of recovering rocket boosters

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.679
using powered-descent.
Their goal was to develop a rocket that could

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.700
be launched vertically to deliver a payload
into orbit, and then return back to earth

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.430
with a controlled descent and vertical landing
at a pre-determined landing site.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.099
Either on land, or on an autonomous floating
drone ship.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.159
In just 7 years, SpaceX was not only able
to achieve their goal of creating such a rocket,

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.120
but they have proven that their system is
both reliable and economical with more than

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.549
60 successful launches and 30 successful landings
of their Falcon 9 boosters, along with a 100%

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.390
success rate since the completion of their
experimental testing program.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.819
Or at least that was the case until December
2018, but at least they had a pretty good

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.160
run.
17 of their boosters were also re-used on

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
successive missions, and their unit cost for
launching a kg of payload into orbit has been

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.870
reduced to just a fraction of the nearest
competitor.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.540
But how exactly did SpaceX accomplish this,
and how do they manage to land 70 m tall rockets

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.610
weighing in excess of ½ a million kilograms
precisely on a 50 m wide landing pad after

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.030
they are launched more than 70 km into the
atmosphere at speeds exceeding 8,000 km/h?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.139
It all comes down to just 2 key things: experience,
and ridiculously well-engineered rockets.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.389
Let’s start with experience by taking a
brief look at the history of the reusable

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.180
launch system development program.
The program itself was first announced in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.379
2011, but it wasn’t until late 2015 that
SpaceX was able to land a Falcon 9 booster

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.690
on land successfully, and it took several
years beyond this to achieve a respectable

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.970
landing success rate.
Before this, SpaceX spent 5 years conducting

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.750
experimental landings where they tested their
new technologies and learned how to build

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.019
better rockets through trial and error.
They began with a prototype vertical takeoff

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.180
and vertical landing vehicle called Grasshopper,
which completed 8 successful flights from

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.209
2012 to 2013.
Following the initial success of Grasshopper,

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.030
SpaceX then equipped their first Falcon 9
boosters for powered-descent and conducted

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.610
several soft landings on the ocean surface
from 2013 to early 2015.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.630
Unfortunately, these first tests with the
Falcon 9 were only able to achieve a landing

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.259
accuracy of about 10 km, but this was greatly
improved in future tests.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:12.900
When the first landings on an autonomous floating
drone ship were attempted later in 2015, SpaceX

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.209
endured a series of public failures as 4 consecutive
barge landings failed quite dramatically.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.430
Despite these failures, they obtained valuable
data from every single flight, and they used

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.180
the failures as opportunities to learn from
their mistakes in order to develop a more

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.400
robust landing system.
SpaceX continued to perform Falcon 9 landing

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.479
tests through 2015 and 2016, both on drone
ships and on land, and successful landings

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.930
became routine by early 2017, with SpaceX
deciding to stop referring to their landing

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.110
attempts as experimental.
From the beginning of 2017 to nearly the end

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.110
of 2018, SpaceX maintained a 100% landing
success rate with a minimum landing accuracy

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.360
of just 10 m.
This impressive accuracy represents a 1000-fold

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.740
improvement compared to the initial soft-landing
tests which were only able to land within

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.930
a 10 km radius from the intended target.
But how did SpaceX manage to increase the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.050
landing accuracy of their rocket boosters
by 10,000% in just 4 years?

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.690
Obviously, this wasn’t achieved through
experience alone, and so this brings us to

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.680
point number 2: ridiculously well-engineered
rockets.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.139
When SpaceX performs a rocket launch with
the Falcon 9, the rocket separates into two

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.160
stages in Earth’s upper atmosphere.
The second stage of the rocket carries the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000
payload into space, while the first stage
booster returns to Earth and lands at a landing

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.650
site for re-use.
The booster is programmed to follow a precise

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.479
flight path back to Earth, and it must autonomously
perform a series of controlled maneuvers in

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.930
order to maintain that path and land vertically
on the landing pad.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.580
The exact flight path depends on whether the
rocket is landing on a floating drone ship

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.009
in the ocean, or on land, and for landings
at sea there is the added complexity of ensuring

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.360
that the drone ship is in the correct position
when the rocket touches down.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.800
However, the greatest engineering challenge
by far is building a rocket capable of performing

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.520
the maneuvers that are necessary for controlled
descent and landing.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.500
After stage separation occurs, the rocket
booster re-orients itself and performs a boost

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.129
back burn to achieve the proper trajectory
towards Earth.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:10.009
During the descent, it performs a re-entry
burn which is used to reduce its velocity.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.509
As the booster approaches the landing site,
it re-orients itself again so that it is in

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.249
line with the landing pad, it deploys its
landing legs, and it performs a landing burn

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.340
to bring its velocity to zero as it touches
down on the pad.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.360
During the entire flight, from stage separation
to landing, the rocket continuously measures

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.580
its orientation and velocity, and it adjusts
its trajectory accordingly so that it maintains

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.879
the correct flight path.
To accomplish all of this, SpaceX has implemented

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.229
several rocket technologies that were developed
and refined through their experimental testing

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.629
program, and it’s these technologies that
have been pivotal to the development of their

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:46.559
reusable high-accuracy rockets.
The six key technologies incorporated into

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:52.130
the Falcon 9 rocket booster are as follows:
1) Thrust vector control.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.300
The merlin rocket engines of the first stage
booster are gimbaled using hydraulic actuators

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.240
so that the direction of thrust can be adjusted.
This is a method of thrust vectoring that

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.159
can be used to control the orientation of
the rocket both within Earth’s atmosphere

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:08.339
and outside of Earth’s atmosphere where
aerodynamic control surfaces such as fins

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.529
are ineffective.
Thrust vectoring is actually a common technology

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.680
that is used for rockets, as well as military
aircraft and missiles, however it is absolutely

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.090
necessary for the maneuverability of the Falcon
9.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.740
2) Cold gas thrusters.
The Falcon 9 is equipped with a total of 8

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.279
nitrogen cold gas thrusters that are mounted
towards the top of the first stage.

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:31.300
There is 1 pod on each side of the rocket,
each containing 4 thrusters.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.629
Like the gimbaled main engines, the cold gas
thrusters are used to control the orientation

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.159
of the rocket.
They are particularly useful for the flip

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:41.919
maneuver after stage separation because of
the large lever arm between the thrusters

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.589
and the rocket’s center of mass.
They are also used to control the rocket at

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:49.520
times during flight when the gimbaled main
engines are shut off.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.110
3) Re-ignitable engines.
Since the first stage must perform three separate

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.039
burns after stage separation, it is necessary
for the main rocket engines to be re-ignitable.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.909
The engines of the first stage booster have
therefore been designed so that they can re-ignite

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:07.389
in the upper atmosphere at supersonic speeds
as well as in the lower atmosphere at transonic

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:11.909
speeds.
4) Inertial navigation and global positioning

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:14.789
systems.
The Falcon 9 is equipped with an inertial

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:19.680
navigation system, or INS, that uses several
types of sensors to measure the position,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.289
orientation, and velocity of the vehicle.
A global positioning system, or GPS, is also

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:28.319
used to measure geolocation.
The onboard computer receives data from the

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.550
INS and GPS in real-time and checks this information
against the pre-programmed flight path.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.550
If the computer detects any deviations from
the flight path, then it instructs the rocket

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.909
to adjust its orientation and velocity as
necessary.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.610
5) Deployable landing gear.
In order to perform vertical landings, the

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.550
Falcon 9 is equipped with 4 lightweight landing
legs that are deployed using high-pressure

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.450
helium just before touchdown.
Each leg is constructed from carbon fiber

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.650
and aluminum, and contains an impact attenuator
for particularly hard landings.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.090
The total span of the deployed landing gear
is approximately 18 m, and the entire landing

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:08.100
system weighs less than 2,100 kgs.
6) Deployable grid fins.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.160
Four titanium grid fins are mounted at the
top of the first stage booster, and are deployed

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.390
during the rocket’s descent back into Earth’s
lower atmosphere.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.490
The fins are aerodynamic control surfaces
that are used for precise control of the rocket’s

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.230
position and orientation prior to landing.
The four grid fines alone are primarily responsible

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.820
for the incredible 10 m landing accuracy of
the Falcon 9 first stage booster.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.920
Grid fins were first used on the fifth soft-landing
attempt of the reusable launch system development

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.080
program in 2015, and iterations on their design
were continued through 2017 in order to achieve

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.110
the accuracy that we see from SpaceX today.
So in the end, SpaceX was able to employ experience

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.070
and good engineering to develop a reusable
and highly accurate launch vehicle, the Falcon

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.089
9.
The Falcon 9 is an astonishing feat of modern

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:57.149
engineering, and I hope that it sets a precedent
for the future of space travel.

00:09:57.149 --> 00:10:01.060
Without a doubt, the development of a reusable
launch system has been one of the greatest

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.050
technological developments in the history
of rocket engineering, and I can’t wait

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.910
to see what the future has in store for SpaceX.
Or perhaps I should rather say, what SpaceX

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.100
has in store for the future.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.900
I really hope that you enjoyed this video, and I hope that I was able to provide some insight into the landing

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.200
technology used by SpaceX.
