00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.000
So Quantum Mechanics, is the subject of the discussion here tonight.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.400
And look it's the year 2014

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.860
And the first glimmers of the Quantum Mechanics

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
really came on the scene on the early part of the 20th Century.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.400
Certainly by 1930 or so the basic framework of Quantum Mechanics was place and yet,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.900
today right some 80 years later there are still questions at

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.560
our right for discussion at the foundations of the subject

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.300
questions that are still controversial, and we're going to discuss one of those

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
controversial questions here tonight

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.500
so you'll see various perspectives on that.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.340
At the same time, quantum mechanics of all the subjects

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.740
of modern physics

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.280
has really been embraced by the culture of at least the language of QM

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.340
has been embraced by the culture I mean, just to give a couple examples right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.060
it's there from hollywood, right we have quantum thrillers right

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.440
we also have, you know, quantum sporting goods right, golf clubs, quantum bowling balls, quantum baseball

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.080
we've got quantum cartoons right

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.220
"Oh Alice, you're the one for me"

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.320
"But Bob, in a Quantum world how can we be sure"

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.360
and the we have physicist talking dirty right

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
you fiinsh I'm not going, I, I...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.320
It's a family program here right

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.140
so we also have quantum healthcare right

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.400
so this one, Quantum herbal canker sore gel, nothing to do with the previous cartoon, completetely seprarate

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.740
We have the Quantum Pendant, which protects the body against any harmful rays

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.140
I like this one, we got the QuantumVet right

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.800
Use your cellphone to instantly diagnose and medically treat your pet at home

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.340
and I love this tagline that you see at the bottom, Don't take me to the Vet, use QuantumVet

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.040
which makes use of the famous of all adages which is a sure fire way to get words to rhyme, is to use the same word

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.540
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.760
[laughter]

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.640
now this, this one is absolutely my favourite

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.560
the Quantum Sleeper

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.880
protection from bio-chemical terrorist attack, kidnappers, stalkers, bullet-proof

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.940
and look how... look at the loving couple over there

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.180
about to enter the sarcophagus over there

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.540
right so, so QM in this sense is certanly out there in the world

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.880
but of course, this is just a word

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.540
quantum is this really quantum bullshit right

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.000
so, um,  we're gonna talk about here tonight is

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.320
the real Quantum Mechanics

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.340
and what I'm going to do here for just about 10-12 minutes

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.140
is run through the basic ideas of Quantum Mechanics

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.100
again I think that it's probably familiar to many of you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.560
but just to make sure we're all on the same page

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.880
and that'll actually lead us into the issue for tonight's discussion

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.260
which is this quantum measurement problem

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.100
okay so for the basic premier on Quantum Mechanics

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.480
the key experiment that really gets the ideas of Quantum Mechanics across is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.660
the Double Slit Experiment

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.920
and I don't know if any of you go to Spooky Action last year

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.240
just by any chance. Yeah, so a handful of you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.140
so you may recall that we actually did the Double Slit Experiment

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.240
on the stage last year

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.560
we're not going to do it again this year

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560
we don't have enough time

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.040
rather these animations will give you the essential ideas

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.460
and if anyone doesn't believe the animations, just ask someone whose hand was up

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.400
cause they saw the real experiment done last year

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.060
OK. So, what is a Double Slit Experiment

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.180
the idea is this

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.620
imagine that I have a gun

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.620
that's firing ordinary pellets

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.460
like BBs at a barrier that has two openings

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.120
now you'd expect that those BBs that'd go thru the left slit

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.180
will land aligned in a band on the left

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.240
those pellets that go thru the right opening will land in a band aligned with it on the right

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.580
and indeed we're to do this experiment that is the result you'd find

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.100
now, what we're going to do is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.860
imagine dialling down the size of those pellets, those BBs

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.920
making them smaller and smaller until they are the size of little tiny particles, let's just call them, electrons

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.560
imagine we're doing this with electrons

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.560
you would expect that if you ran the same experiment

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.220
again those electrons that pass through the left opening

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.060
will land in a band and aligned with the opening on the left

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.760
and similarly, for those that pass through the right

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.520
that is what you would expect

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.920
should

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.920
happen

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.200
and the thing is, many of you are familar, this is

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.560
not what happens

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.760
when you do this experiment

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.540
instead if you do this experiment you get results that look rather different

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.840
they look like this

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.700
you get a bright band next to a dark region

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.180
next to a bright region

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.280
next to a dark region

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.400
next to a bright region

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.980
and so forth

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.080
and that data, that strange data

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.300
is really what impels us towards

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.360
now that data is strange because it's not what we'd think should happen

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.240
we expect to get two bands and we get more

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.900
but it turns out that that pattern

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.100
bright, dark

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.800
bright, dark

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.720
is a familiar pattern to most physicist

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.480
and we're trained from birth to recognise that pattern

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.680
right if you're to go

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.240
to any physicist, 3'o clock in the moring

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.960
shake that physicist,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.940
wake them up, and tell them "I got this data, bright band, dark band, bright band, dark band "

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.580
The very first thing they would say to you is, "What the hell are you doing in my room at 3 o'clock in the morning"

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.380
[laughter]

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.200
But after that, they would say, "I know what that is, that's an interference pattern"

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.020
that is the hallmark signature that there is some kind of wave phenomenon

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.100
Some kind of wave phenomenon taking place

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.780
right to understand that, let me just give you

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.200
a little visual here, where we are looking at water waves

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.680
Imagine I throw 2 pebbles

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.460
The first one over here it makes these circular ripples, and now I throw in a second one...

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.140
and look what happens

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.340
when the waves overlap, in some regions they work together, but

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.860
in other regions, the peak of one wave is crossing the trough of another

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.780
causing the wave to cancel out, and those are those dark regions that you see

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.480
on the screen

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.160
So this is exactly the kind of data that we are encountering, and to make that point

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.140
a little more clearly. Let me show you an animation, same idea

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.780
Imagine you got water waves going toward the barrier with the two openings

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.520
and again regions where the waves work together the water is very agitated

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.560
regions in between, where the peak of one wave crosses the trough of the other

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.380
they cancel each other out, and if on the back screen I put bright regions

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.860
associated with very agitated water, Dark regions with not agitated water

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.120
Look what I get, Bright Dark Bright Dark Bright Dark

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.940
and again, just to remember that is the data that we find in this experiment

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.400
So this suggests, that there is some deep connection

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.020
between these particles, these electrons

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.900
and this other idea, a completely separate idea, of waves

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.300
Now, at first sight, that might not seem all that surprising

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.220
Right? Because water has water waves,  but we all know

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.500
that water is itself made of little particles, molecules, H2O molecules

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.340
So certainly we know, if a large collection

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.560
of molecules, behave in a choreographed manner

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.280
those particles can yield a wave.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.280
So maybe what's going on in the experiment

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.700
is just that, you've got a lot of electrons

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.120
and maybe they are behaving in a choreographed manner

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.800
and in that way, yielding a wave just like H2O molecules

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.620
yield a water wave. Now how would you test that idea?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.540
Well you could run this very experiment

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.060
But only firing particle by single particle at this barrier with the 2 openings.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.880
and by recording dot by single dot where each of those single particles lands on the detector screen

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.240
So let's run that version of the experiment

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.860
and see what happens.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.100
So again,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.540
Particle by single particle,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.420
we're recording on the back screen

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.620
the history of all the landing locations.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.600
And this is what happens in this experiment.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.520
Dot by single dot,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.700
we build up the same pattern,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.420
the same interference pattern,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.360
the same data.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.360
That suggests to us

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.980
That there must be some kind of

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.700
wave like phenomenon involved to yield this interference pattern.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.300
So this is where things get really strange.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.300
Particles, electrons little tiny dot.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.300
That is the image that we always have in mind.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.500
Waves are these spread out entities.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.600
How could a dot particle and a spread out wave

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.800
somehow be connected

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.200
And this was the puzzle that physicist faced

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.100
In the early decades of the 20th century

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.280
And many tried to figure out

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.280
what could the connection between

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.280
a particle and a wave be.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.200
The natural suggestion that you might throw out as you know

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.000
maybe particles somehow are kind of ...kind of smeared out in some way

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.200
there are kind of spread out the way we didn't realize

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.400
that deal out it doesn't really work. Because whenever you measure an electron you find all of it

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.000
if it was truly smeared out. You find a piece of it here and a piece of it there

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.200
And the idea ultimately was settled out the part  came from the mind of the physicist--Max Born.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.200
without the way they think about the wave associated with the particle is this .

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.200
This is a new idea. The wave is a wave of probability.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.200
The wave is telling us the likelihood of the probability that the particles at one location or another.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.200
They show you a little visual of that. Imagine this is the wave associated with a particle like an electron.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.440
Where the wave is big, that is a likely location to find the particle.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.660
Where the wave is small, an unlikely location.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.300
Where the wave is absolutely zero,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:32.600
that is the place where you simply will not find electron at all.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.640
That's the picture that comes forward.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:44.320
Now how would you test this idea to see if it's actually describing reality how the world works.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.400
For the first thing is you need some kind of mathematics equation

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.900
that allows you to understand how this wave evolved how it changes over time.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.700
And that equation came to us from over Schrodinger.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.700
Whether you understand the mathematics symbol or not, it doesn't matter.But it is good to see that there is

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:13.700
a bona fide rigorous mathematical equation behind all of the imagery that you will be see here tonight.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:21.700
That is the equation that describes how this wave this probability wave evolves over time.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.040
That's step one. So now you understand how things change in time.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.120
But the test is  while you said yourself this

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:36.580
look.Yep. At a given moment in time,  I’ve got this probability profile for where a particle should be located.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:46.360
where I tested it, I run experiments of searching for the particles over and over again in identically prepared situations.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.100
And I count the number of the times that I found it in one of the location or another.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.000
And if the theory is correct,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.080
you should find the particles more often where the wave is big, and the less often where the wave is small.

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:09.060
Qubism. So we've heard this word a few times mentioned.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.680
Ruger tell us what this approach is about.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.700
OK. I brought a Quantum System to experiment on

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.520
So I just flip this Quantum System

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.380
Ok, what is the probability of "heads"?

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.080
100 % by the "many worlds" approach.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.220
Sorry. I will play along. 50%.

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.140
Stick with a 100%

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.420
So, I have 0 %.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.620
My point being the probability, you have a different one from me.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.800
So this is actually about you, it is not about me.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:56.220
So the probability actually is your belief or my belief about what you will see if I show it to you. I can show it to you, you see. He's right.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.900
So, probability in this is used in ??? ??? probability theory

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.760
which actually is a model on full account probability which is used in widely

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.740
in Statistic Economics in some parts of physics

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:31.960
So, this is a respected and very useful and I believe is the only really fully consistent approach of probability.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.320
Probability is a believe of what you will experience of what you will see.

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:43.920
Now Qubism says that, you do not need to modify the probability of Quantum Mechanics.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.760
So, even Quantum Mechanics Probabilites are personal degrees of belief

01:15:49.540 --> 01:16:00.160
So the probability ??? a measurement outcome is my expectation of what I will experience from the experiment

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:07.660
The point is the Probability is not a property of the coin in my hand, the Probability is actually my belief.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.700
Now, Quantum States,

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:13.580
are equivalent to probabilites.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.500
Quantum States determine probabilities of outcomes

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.000
Quantum States are fully mathematical equivalant to probability distributions.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:29.740
So in that sense, Probabilities are an experiment on agent's expectations

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:37.900
Quantum States encode an experiment on Agent's expectations for experimental outcome.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.680
Now, what this says about the measurement problem is it just dissolves.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:22.980
Exactly, I experience an outcome and I update my own expectations for the future.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.140
This forth approach is the dart is going and the idea is

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.800
if we are not looking

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.580
if we are not actually yet doing the observation there is nothing really we can say

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.260
until the observer looks, so if we bring our observer

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.300
and then you look, you take in the observation, you update your understanding of the world

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.780
based on your observation.

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.940
In science, what are we doing? We are making predictions and

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.940
we test this predictions in experiments

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.400
So this is really what Qubism talks about

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:32.000
Quantum Mechanics, this must be the reason that most physicists are not interested in the potential of Quantum Mechanics.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:39.100
because Quantum Mechanics is a tool they can use for predictions, to design experiments

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:49.740
to build machines,  Quantum Mechanics has transformed the world in a way that is unprecedented

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:57.120
In all these experiments, experimental designs, predictions, including cosmological predictions

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.400
You never actually need to talk about hidden variables or spontaneous collapse

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:13.080
You just apply Quantum Mechanics as a tool to make predictions

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.880
And that works, and this must be one of the reasons physicists are not interested in the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.540
When you look at Cosmology, what do you base Cosmology on

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.280
You base it on what you observe or experience now

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:07.260
What are the Cosmological predictions or your conclusions you draw, well they are about your future experience

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:13.940
You will never stop at just saying "Oh well, I have explained all things I know because

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:31.640
So, even Cosmology is about taking your present and the few past experiences and

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.020
Using the Theory, using Quantum Mechanics as you know it

01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.580
to make predictions about future experiences.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:47.500
In your approach the spookiness evaporates if I understand it, can you describe to us

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.020
where it goes.

01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:01.140
In the Qubist approach these correlations,, this situation is very much like ???'s socks.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:15.100
He used to wear different color socks and when his colleague so him coming in, when he saw one foot, one sock, he knew immediately

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.160
what the color of the other sock would be, namely different.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.720
Nobody would call that Spooky action at a distance

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:29.420
What Qubism says here is, if I have a belief about

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.860
this is a belief about what I will see experience when I am making the experiment

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:38.740
on that particle here.

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:53.100
What happens is, if I make a measurement on this particle her I see it spins down and then I update my expectation

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.820
on the other particle here.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:37.120
No, it is always about me and the world because Qubism emphatically says that it is not all about the subject

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:46.200
nor is it all about the world. Any measurement is an action, subject and observer, physicist, system

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.740
take on the world.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:54.500
So measurements are active processes they are actions

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:11.520
Any measurement is an action on the world and it needs subject and the object,  it needs... is where the experience and the world meet.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.520
But that experience is something  that the individual

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.520
,the observer has,that's the point ?Yeah good !

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.520
So,what do you think ? David ?
