CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, BUT IT’S NOT QUITE CRIMINALITY AS IT’S

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:30.372 line:92%
QUITE CRIMINALITY AS IT’S SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAT.

&gt;&gt; DO YOU DISAGREE THAT CRIMINALITY IS THE POLITICAL

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:34.743 line:92%
CRIMINALITY IS THE POLITICAL BARR THAT SCHIFF AND PELOSI HAVE

00:04:34.778 --> 00:04:35.010 line:92%
BARR THAT SCHIFF AND PELOSI HAVE SET?

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.445 line:92%
SET? &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON’T THINK

00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:37.546 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON’T THINK IT’S JUST CRIMINALITY THAT

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.747 line:92%
IT’S JUST CRIMINALITY THAT THEY’VE SET.

00:04:38.748 --> 00:04:39.748 line:92%

19-PAGE MEMO WHICH FLOATS THE IDEA, WELL, NO, NOT NECESSARILY,

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.365 line:92%
IDEA, WELL, NO, NOT NECESSARILY, IT’S NOT A CRIME BECAUSE THE

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.333 line:92%
IT’S NOT A CRIME BECAUSE THE CRIMINAL LAW DOESN’T ACTUALLY

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.868 line:92%
CRIMINAL LAW DOESN’T ACTUALLY SAY THE PRESIDENT IS INCLUDED

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:00.836 line:92%
SAY THE PRESIDENT IS INCLUDED WITHIN IT.

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:01.637 line:92%
WITHIN IT. IT’S A TECHNICAL LEGAL DEFENSE,

00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:04.240 line:92%
IT’S A TECHNICAL LEGAL DEFENSE, BUT I THINK IF HE OBSTRUCTED

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.275 line:92%

OWN HIDE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS, AGAIN, A CLASSIC IMPEACHABLE

00:05:15.686 --> 00:05:17.587 line:92%
IS, AGAIN, A CLASSIC IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES EVEN IF IT IS NOT A

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:19.188 line:92%

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:19.922 line:92%
CRIMINAL ACT, AND I DON’T TAKE IT THAT ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:22.291 line:92%
IT THAT ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID YESTERDAY TAKES BACK THAT JUST

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.326 line:92%
YESTERDAY TAKES BACK THAT JUST BASIC COMMON SENSE IDEA.

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:26.996 line:92%
BASIC COMMON SENSE IDEA. &gt;&gt; WE NEVER HEARD ANYONE SUGGEST
