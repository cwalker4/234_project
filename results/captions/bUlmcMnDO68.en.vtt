00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.334
-Let's get to some news,
here, you guys.

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:03.736
Today in Congress,
Trump's former lawyer,

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.205
Michael Cohen,
testified about the president

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.740
and all his scandals.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.310
Yep. He called Trump a "conman,"
a "cheat," and a "racist."

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.445
Trump heard that and was like,
"Great.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.747
Now, I need a new
2020 campaign slogan."

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.049
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.984
"And a new Tinder bio."

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.418
[ Laughter ]

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.387
That's right.
Cohen went in front of Congress

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.589
and called Trump a "conman"
and a "cheat."

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.291
Then, he followed it up
by saying,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.925
"He taught me
everything I know."

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.930
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.433
But Cohen's testimony
was on every TV channel,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.102
and I heard that it was also
aired on Russian TV.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.470
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.704
You know it's crazy when even
Vladimir Putin is like,

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:39.905
[ as Putin ]
"Pass popcorn."

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.040
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.709
"It's getting good.
This getting good."

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.112
[ Normal voice ] At one point,
Cohen discussed what Trump said

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.647
about his son, Don Jr.
Watch this.

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:52.385
-Mr. Trump had frequently
told me and others

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.488
that his son Don Jr.
had the worst judgment

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.423
of anyone in the world.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.626
[ Laughter ]

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.663
-In response...

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.331
Don Jr. was like,
"Dad talked about me?"

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.867
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:08.902
"Wow."

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.206
And get this -- Cohen also said
that he's responsible

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.609
for making sure Trump's
SAT scores never leaked.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.311
[ Laughter ]

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.946
It's safe to say the only time
Trump's seen a 1600

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:22.915
is when he passes
the White House mailbox.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.285
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.189
Later on, a Congresswoman
asked Cohen how many times

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.725
Trump made him threaten someone
on his behalf.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.026
Check this out.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.630
-How many times did Mr. Trump
ask you to threaten

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.133
an individual or entity
on his behalf?

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.036
-Quite a few times.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.437
-50 times?
-More.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.406
-100 times?
-More.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.242
-200 times?
-More.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.311
-500 time?
-Probably.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.347
[ Laughter ]

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.615
-"600 times?"
"Double it."

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.283
"700 times?"
"Square that."

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.519
"800?"
"Times that by infinity."

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.519
[ Laughter ]

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.054
"Wow."
During his testimony,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.091
Cohen showed a check that he
says Trump used to pay him back

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.859
for Stormy Daniels'
hush money.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.060
Take a look at this.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.795
It's for $35,000.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.831
Well, it turns out the president
wrote checks to Cohen

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.933
for all sorts of other
expenses, too.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.401
Take a look.
First, Trump wrote a check

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.869
for a private investigator

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.637
to find out who
The Masked Singer is.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.240
-Really?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.374
-He also wrote a check

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.443
for taking Don Jr. and Eric
to Six Flags

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.477
and leaving them there.

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.880
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.016
And finally,
Trump sent a check to Cohen for

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.051
"hush money for my barber."

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.454
He writes
too many checks.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.990
You guys, Cohen's testimony
was such a big deal

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.891
that it completely overshadowed
the summit

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.093
between Trump
and Kim Jong-un.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.895
You could tell Trump was upset
'cause at one point,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.196
he leaned over to Kim
and said,

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.132
[ As Trump ] "How much to
fire off a nuke right now?"

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.199
[ Laughter ]

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.269
"Don't hit anything."

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.471
[ Normal voice ] But get this -
I heard Kim Jong-un

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.873
actually brought his sister
to the summit.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.275
It got awkward when Trump went
up to Kim's sister and said,

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.943
[ As Trump ] "Which one are you,
Khloe or Kourtney?"

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:01.247
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.849
[ Normal voice ]
Later on, Trump gave Kim

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.517
a pretty enthusiastic
handshake.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.419
Check out the way Trump's arm
swoops in there.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.453
Watch this.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:13.693
[ Laughter ]

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.461
Trump shakes hands
like a used car salesman

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.729
who's desperate
to make a deal.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.263
He's like, "So, we got a deal.
It's yours, right?

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:19.665
That's yours.
You own it now.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.169
That's your car.
You own that forever now."

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.304
Well, throughout the day,
Trump actually posted

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.540
a bunch of photos about
his summit with Kim Jong-un

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.275
to his Instagram story.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.277
Let's check it out.
Here's the first photo.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.945
It's Trump and Kim
at dinner.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.947
If we tap it,
we see that Trump wrote,

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.050
"Love being here in
Vietnom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom."

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.786
[ Laughter ]

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.754
Here's the next photo
in the story.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.222
You tap it,
and you see Trump wrote,

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.625
"That feeling when you and your
bro are about to touch tummies."

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.227
[ Laughter ]

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.929
And finally,
here's the last photo.

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.963
Tap it,
and Trump wrote,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.698
"#faceswap."

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.433
[ Laughter, applause ]

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.569
He's having fun.
He's having fun.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.170
-Come on.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.505
-All right,
Here's some good news.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.208
Target is now selling wine
for just $10 a bottle.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.776
[ Cheering ]

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.145
Meanwhile, Walmart just tapped
a keg of Natty Light

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.247
in the patio section and said,
"Go nuts."

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:10.916
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:14.053
And finally,
today Oprah lost $58 million

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.722
after the Weight Watchers stock
went down.

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.124
Even worse --
thanks to Weight Watchers,

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.826
she'll never
gain it back.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.060
[ Laughter ]
