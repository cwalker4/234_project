00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.020
JUDY WOODRUFF: High school students and their
parents know all too well just how intense

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.220
the competition for college admissions can
be.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.549
But today's announcement from federal prosecutors
was still a shocker.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.990
They arrested and charged 50 people across
the U.S. for participating in a bribery and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.010
cheating scam to get students into elite schools.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.320
The case was called Operation Varsity Blues.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.050
As William Brangham tells us for our weekly
education segment, Making the Grade, the scheme

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.079
allegedly included wealthy parents, among
them well-known actresses, college coaches,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.510
and a dishonest college admissions counseling
program.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.019
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The scheme revolved in large
part around a college prep business, often

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.949
referred to as the Key.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.489
The government said the company's founder,
William Singer, helped students cheat on standardized

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.980
tests, and paid roughly $25 million in bribes
to college athletic coaches so that kids could

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.280
enter college with fake athletic credentials.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.749
In some instances, the students didn't even
play the sport.

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.340
To mask the fraud, some students faces were
actually Photoshopped onto another athlete's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.460
body.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.780
Two well-known actresses, Felicity Huffman
and Lori Loughlin, allegedly paid into the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810
scheme for their children.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.860
Among the schools targeted were Yale, Georgetown,
Stanford, and UCLA.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.730
And here's how Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney
in Massachusetts, characterized this case:

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.040
ANDREW LELLING, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts:
This case is about the widening corruption

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.560
of elite college admissions through the steady
application of wealth, combined with fraud.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.720
Every year, hundreds of thousands of hardworking,
talented students strive for admission to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.090
elite schools.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.850
As every parent knows, these students work
harder and harder every year, in a system

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.450
that appears to grow more and more competitive
every year.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.090
And that system is a zero-sum game.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.350
For every student admitted through fraud,
an honest, genuinely talented student was

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.350
rejected.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.250
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on this, I'm joined
by Jeffrey Selingo.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.240
He's been covering higher ed in America for
20 years, including for "The Chronicle of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.140
Higher Education," as well as in three of
his own books on the topic.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.140
Welcome back.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
JEFFREY SELINGO, Author, "College Unbound:
The Future of Higher Education and What It

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Means for Students": It's great to be here.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.530
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this is a jaw-dropping
bribery scandal.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.830
I just sort of am gobsmacked by the complexity
of this.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
It seems that the bribery falls into two categories
here, cheating on athletics and that role

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.040
in admissions, and cheating on standardized
tests.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.930
Can you explain how cheating on the testing
worked?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.030
JEFFREY SELINGO: So, what they did was essentially
get doctor's notes to allow these students

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.410
to take the test by themselves with proctors
that were paid off.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.090
And those proctors either had somebody else
take the test for these students, or they

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.940
corrected the exam, so that the students would
get higher scores.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.040
Those scores were then reported to the universities,
who, of course, didn't really know who actually

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040
took the test.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.200
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then -- so, obviously,
a higher test score helps you get into schools

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
no matter what.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.480
But the second part of this is that -- the
bribing of athletic coaches and the creating

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.330
of these sort of phony athletic resumes.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.330
Can you explain a little bit?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.440
JEFFREY SELINGO: I mean, this was the most
amazing one to me, because many of these students

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.840
didn't even play the sports they were purported
to play and that they recruited for.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.650
And every year, these coaches -- and these
are at high-level institutions, in some cases

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.070
at Division I institutions -- they're recruiting
athletes starting in their sophomore and junior

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.070
year.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.020
So for these students to not have to play
these sports,and then to get in under that

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.130
pretense of those sports, I think, was absolutely
shocking and amazing to me.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.070
And these athletes are given tips in admissions,
right?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.170
They -- all these colleges have to fill teams,
right?

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.430
They need a starting pitcher on the -- on
the baseball team.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.319
They need rowers on the crew team, right?

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.720
So they need to fill these spots.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.910
And so, every year, athletes are given advantages
in admissions.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.420
And, clearly, these students were as well.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.250
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How significant is that
advantage?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.250
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.540
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, for people who are
not familiar with this, the role -- if you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.900
really are a star athlete, can you get into
a school that would really traditionally be

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900
out of your league?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.900
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes, you can.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.800
I mean, in many of these schools, they are
basically the -- the athletic director or

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.550
the coaches come to the admissions team and
say, these are the students we really want.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.540
Now, will they accept the bottom of the bottom
in terms of academics?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.989
Some schools will not.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.500
Other schools will and just basically say,
we will give them kind of academic support

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.970
while they -- while they're here.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.610
But, basically, every other part of their
application could be pretty minimal, but as

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.990
long as they have athletics on it, it really
does help.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.030
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the details that
you touched on here, I just find it so striking.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.750
This is the example in Yale.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.370
And this was a young woman in Southern California
who didn't play soccer.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.400
This -- the guy William Singer helped set
up a phony athletic profile, sort of pretending

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.080
that she played on a very competitive team
in Southern California.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.440
They then bribe the Yale soccer coach, $400,000,
to recruit this student, even though the coach

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.910
knew that the student had never even put her
foot on a ball.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.910
JEFFREY SELINGO: No, and it's amazing.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.580
I can't even imagine what these other athletes
on the team thought of this.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.970
But, more so, there was probably an athlete
or two that were in the recruiting system

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.630
for Yale that didn't get in because this student
or these students got in.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.729
And that's not only true at Yale, but at these
other institutions.

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.389
The U.S. attorney talked about it as a zero-sum
game.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.440
I mean, in admissions, to be honest with you,
I think that many more students are not admitted

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.270
who are qualified, because the admissions
rate at some of these places is like 8 to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.270
10 percent.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.590
But, in athletics, you're really competing
against one or two other people.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.800
And so, in those cases, I think they probably
took a spot of somebody.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.919
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At its core, really, this
is about wealthy parents who are trying to

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.250
buy in some ways even more influence for their
wealthy children, right?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.240
JEFFREY SELINGO: I mean, what's amazing to
me is that, in some cases, it wouldn't really

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.850
matter where these kids went to college, right?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.710
They have both the means, the financial means,
but also the connections to live a great life

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.060
because of their parents, no matter where
they go.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.050
So it's kind of shocking that they really
wanted that piece of paper from an elite college

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.080
-- an elite college, because, in many cases,
it wouldn't matter where they went.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.040
And what was interesting to me about the -- about
the ACT and the SAT is that, at many elite

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040
colleges, including...

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These are the standardized
tests.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040
JEFFREY SELINGO: The standardized tests.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.460
At many elite colleges, including the University
of Chicago last year, they're diminishing

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.500
the use of these, right?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.930
University of Chicago went what's called test-optional
last year, where students don't have to submit

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.100
test scores.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.150
And at many colleges that I followed over
the years, they kind of use the standardized

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.860
test kind of as a check-in.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.840
They're more interested in high school curriculum
and high school grades and other parts of

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.860
the application.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.230
So the fact that they spent so much money
on standardized tests, thinking that would

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.110
get them into college, in many ways, they
were mistaken.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.380
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The criminality aside -- and
we can't emphasize how much that this is breaking

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.070
the law with the bribes that were paid -- doesn't
this strike you that this is also an indictment

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.820
of the cutthroat nature of college applications?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.820
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.820
Yes.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.100
I mean, we're seeing this more, that the seats
are scarce at these -- at the selective colleges

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.100
and universities.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.270
There are more people every year trying to
get into them.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.210
They represent about a third of applications
every year, even though they only represent

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.630
about 18 percent of students, the most elite
colleges.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.039
So the competition to get into them is great.

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.650
And yet we know from research that, in many
ways, it doesn't matter where you go to college.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.580
It matters how you go to college, and being
really engaged in your studies and extracurricular

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.229
activities, getting internships and other
types of activities matter more.

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:25.950
But yet we want to get into these colleges
because we know the seats are scarce.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.199
We're worried about the future of the economy
and the future of our children.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.150
We want to make sure that they get -- have
all the same privileges that we had.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.630
And so every year, more and more people are
trying to get into these colleges.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.360
And we see this in their application totals,
right?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.210
Everyone's up like 8, 10 percent every year.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.880
And they're getting tens of thousands of applications
and admitting in many cases fewer than 10

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.620
percent, in some cases fewer than 5 percent
of applicants.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.260
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, as we see, people are
turning to devious means to try to get in.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.260
JEFFREY SELINGO: Exactly.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.260
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jeffrey Selingo, thank you
very much.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.267
It was great to be with you.
