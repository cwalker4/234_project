00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.640
Hey, Sup Don

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600
We gon make it right? This is work

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Camera guy: This is the whole tour, start and finish right here.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.900
So, I'm on my computer

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.080
No hands

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880
Camery guy: You have hands

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
No feet

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
It's roomie

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.500
Alright, welcome to the international space station

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.860
Here's a tour

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.000
We're starting right now in Columbus

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.300
And if you look on this little iPad right here

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.920
there's a picture of the station

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.300
And right here, that's Columbus

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.900
so we're on the starboard side

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.600
front area in that module right there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.400
As you can see it's the European laboratory

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.500
but it's not just European

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.680
we also have NASA

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.100
racks in here, NASA payloads in here too at the same time.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.340
There's actually quite

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.620
new stuff over here.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.540
This is the EML? (not sure)

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.500
Alex'll have to tell you about that cause that's his

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.100
But it's actually really cool because it talks about

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.160
because it talks about magnetic limitation

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.400
and I just think that's a cool sounding thing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.260
I don't know exactly

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.780
what it's gonna do

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.620
but it sounds great to me.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.500
Over here you can, it's hard to see, again, everything

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.600
but we are growing the ah

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.460
In here that's where we grew the lettuce, it's right in there.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.240
Farther,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.100
just a work bench

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.840
storage area, there's a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520
storage area above me

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.620
storage area bellow me over here.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.940
This is where we take our blood,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
get it all set up for doing that.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040
All the stuff is really neat for that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.320
all around here

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.380
It's a pretty easy task.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.680
We even have a centrifuge

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.180
we put the blood into

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180
to help process it. Then after we do that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
for 30 minutes we freeze it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.180
get it all cold and then we ship it to ground

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.180
and hopefully they can tell something

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.180
about it, when we get there

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180
Again, more storage over here and also

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.180
the Ultrasound we hooked up right here.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180
We do Ultrasounds of all sorts of the parts

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.180
of our body. Make sure we're still doing okay.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.380
And then ah

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040
There's also in here the slam d

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040
which we don't want to set up but that's where

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040
we do the ah, measure our mass

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.300
That's to see if we are loosing or gaining weight.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.660
Again, there's a lot of science actually going on here too

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.660
that we don't touch too much,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.600
that we just set up.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.660
It's a good place, it's going pretty well

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660
and this is Alex's, you can tell this is ah

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.660
the German flag in the back

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400
it's a good place for Alex.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
Moving on in Node 2

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.500
Camera man: The vacuum cleaner

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.620
Yes that's true. We do have one of the most important

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.620
pieces of equipment on the ISS

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.700
hidden up here

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.720
This is the vacuum cleaner.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.280
We say, NASA's talk is that this is the only piece of equipment that doesn't suck on International Space Station.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.100
But, actually this is much better than the old one

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.100
so we actually like it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.020
and ah, it's nothing too fancy, just a vacuum cleaner.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.740
but we have to use it every week to get stuff clean

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200
Come into Node 2

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
and if you look on the picture here

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.940
Node 2 is this section right here

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960
it's this front little piece that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960
fits on that station

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.960
so it's actually where the shuttle used to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960
front and this black part is where the shuttle used to dock to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.780
and so right now, nothing of course is docking to that

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780
but we are in this area right after there

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960
It's called Node 2

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.380
If you look out here, this is where the shuttle actually docks

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.380
just right through that hatch right that way

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.380
and there's still a device on Earth

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.420
a module called PMA that... (sorry can't hear it)

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200
and when we get a visiting vehicle such as the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200
Cygnus

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200
or a Space X (manufacturing company)

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200
we avert it down here

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200
on the near side, the lower side

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200
we will open that hatch and we have that there.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.280
That's the idea of being a Node,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.380
it has multiple spots to attach to

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.000
so you have all four sections here

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
around and the one on the front

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.540
and actually one behind us so there's actually six places to dock.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.480
Beside's that, it's really our ah work bench area

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480
and our living quarters in Node 2

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.640
Come this way.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.640
Actually I see over here another one of our work benches

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.700
we usually keep both work benches, here and here

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.320
but this time we have one the Columbus Module

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.600
just cause Alex is working on a special project there.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.580
And then if you go back you'll see now it's coming into view

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.340
the four crew quarters around here.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800
So we have four of us

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800
this one's mine over here

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800
We have Oleg/Alek (Artemyev/Skvortsov?), we have Tonto

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
we have Alex's

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800
It's kind of interest because once you get into one

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800
you really can't tell which one's

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.880
which orientation you are so if I happened to go

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.600
in to Tonto's to look at a picture, something he's got on his screen

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.140
I'll come out and I'll be kinda confused because I don't know which way I'm going.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.740
Especially if you go into Alex's you come out and your really confused

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.320
because it feels like your in your own but when you come out it's a totally different orientation. (speaking really fast and not clearly)

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
If you look in here these aren't too

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.860
big at all. You can take a quick look and I'll jump in here real quick

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.180
So

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.300
we have our sleeping bag attached to the wall.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.500
The way I like to do it is I just have it attached here

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.500
at one point and one point up here

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.420
so I can put my feet right up here when I'm sleeping

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.420
and I kind of do it in the sense of

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.420
this position like this

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.420
and I'm kind of curled up a little bit

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.420
in a semi on my side sleeping position

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.420
which is what I like to do back on Earth

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.420
and I works out pretty well, gives me that same feeling

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.100
almost, but it works well for me.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.740
Then when you wake up in the morning the first thing you see

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.740
is your laptops. I got one that

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.740
connects to the internet which

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.740
works like 50% of the time

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.740
and then I've got another one that does

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.900
the our lan*? which gives us our schedule,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.900
all the other information or email

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.460
everything we need to do to work up here, that's what that one does.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500
We also have an iPad as you can see

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.940
and tht's also a

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.860
I know it's small but really it works out well for me, we didn't need much more room up here

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.240
So let's now move on to the lab

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.200
And again if you look up here... so what we're doing right now, it's we are heading towards the back

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.120
if we go to the port side

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.780
now you can see that on your

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.500
the port side is called node 3, and again it's very similar

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.080
to

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.060
ahhh

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.660
node 1 and 2

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.140
and it's not even on this picture

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.060
so that just makes it more difficult!

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.260
but I might even have another one

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.980
it shows... but it doesn't matter, it's to the ahh port side

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.060
Cameraman: blame the guy who downloaded the picture

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.780
yeah...blame the guy who downloaded the picture

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.980
exactly

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360
which you normally don't have

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.060
Let's go on back.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.460
We're gonna do, we're gonna head to the gym,

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.060
'cause we missed that at the beginning.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.520
So, we'll head there.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.140
And then we have finished up the USOS segment

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.560
And on the way I'm gonna get some water

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.560
'cause I'm really dead thirsty.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.660
And I'll show you how we put water either for drink bags

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.500
or for if we need to rehydrate some food.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.480
it's either gonna be room temperature water

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.740
or  it's hot water.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.540
This is the location

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.200
Now the PWD, portable water dispensible

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.320
dispenser

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.920
potable water dispenser

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.920
I knew that, well it's probably portable too

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.300
not that good

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.080
so you just put

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.100
whatever it is

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.400
into the adapter

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.940
how much water you want

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.800
and hit the button

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.080
it's pretty easy, even I can do it

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.440
Now if you do want some cold stuff we have this

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.400
where we look at them

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.440
and we have stuff in there

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.840
our main sauce right there is Sriracha

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.980
and we live out of that, nice diet

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.760
that makes everything taste better

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.680
It's done.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.720
Fills up.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.960
And, uh,  the nice thing about these things, these straws of course

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.020
it's got a little clamp on there so

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.500
if I didn't have that on there I show you

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.040
the water pressure, it just starts coming on out

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.780
There you go.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.240
Let's go in to the gym.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.100
I'm going back actually right now

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.360
back to node 2
