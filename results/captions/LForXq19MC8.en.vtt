00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.201
And first up,
she is a Grammy winner,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.070
and a two-time
Emmy-winning comedian,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.939
and an actress who holds
the Guinness record

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.907
for most comedy specials
by a woman.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.376
More importantly,
she is a good American

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:11.544
who loves her country

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.347
and should be able
to work in it, Kathy Griffin!

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.683
(APPLAUSE)

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:22.621
-BILL: See, told ya!
-I was afraid, I was afraid.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.991
-I was afraid.
-There you go.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.094
-Look at this. Let's do this.
-All right.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.997
How you doin--
I love your new do!

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.733
-I did, I cut my hair very,
very short.
-Yes.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.602
We're all shaving our heads now,
the pissed-off women,

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.202
we're angry,
we're shaving our heads.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.339
Just for fun.
To scare you guys.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.439
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.908
Bill, first of all,
I really wanna thank you

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.177
for being one of the first
and only people

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:48.981
to publicly support me, and say
what happened was bullshit.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.251
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS)
-It was bullshit.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.484
Yeah.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.988
-Publicly.
-Well, yeah, and--

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.290
Public-- 'Cause I got texts
from some celebrities

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.092
that were like,
"Um, don't tell anybody

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.760
I sent you this text,
but I support you all the way,

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.962
-I love you."
-(BILL LAUGHS)

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.664
-Jerry Seinfeld.
-(AUDIENCE GROANS)

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.332
-No, I'm kidding. I'm kid--
-Oh, no!

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.334
-No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
-Oh! (LAUGHS)

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.370
As if-- By the way, as if
we have each other's numbers,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.072
me and Jerry Seinfeld.
But go ahead.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.473
Exactly,
I happen to know they don't.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.575
(LAUGHING)

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.911
Well, we've missed you.
You know, I mean... It's true.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.580
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS)
-Oh, my goodness.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.951
I-- Uh-- One thing nobody
could ever take away from you,

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.519
you are a hard worker.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.221
-I love it, man, love it.
-You...

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.556
You got where you are
through hard work.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.927
-You, joke-by-joke...
-One dick joke at a time, baby!

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.395
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-I never had a writer,

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.964
I never had a studio,
I never had a manager,

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.433
just out grinding it out,
and that's what I love doing.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.903
-So, for you to have it
all taken away--
-Overnight.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.871
It just really pissed me off
more than anything,

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.374
because, I mean, look,
you took a picture--

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.810
-you took a very bad selfie.
-(LAUGHING)

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.479
I blame the photographer,
I've been on these photoshoots

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.247
and they're always trying
to do something provocative,

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.282
-Right.
-so they said, "Hey,

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:57.950
-why don't you pose--"
-The wacky picture!

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.419
The wacky picture,
and it turned out to be
a little too wacky.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.587
It was quite wacky.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.990
Okay, it was very wacky,
and, uh, but, you know,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.858
if this wasn't
the United States of babies,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.693
you know, you woulda--
The first thing you said was,

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.829
"Look, I went too far,
I get it,"

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.265
it should've been over.
Okay, there, she gets it. Fine.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.300
But of course,
everybody has to go

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.435
bat-shit nuts about everything,
all the time.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.736
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-And--

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.171
Actually, the selfie analogy
is really good,

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.374
because almost like,
imagine if you took--

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.142
You had the worst selfie
in the world,

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.376
you went to bed, and you woke up

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.779
and you found out that
the President tweeted about it,

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.883
which then mobilized
the alt-right, Fox News,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.151
-Right.
-everybody else, and then,

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.320
-you know, they also thought
it was illegal, which...
-BILL: And also--

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.522
-BILL: Right, I mean--
-Distasteful, but not illegal.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.557
Covered by the first amendment.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.458
-No, I went through...
-(APPLAUSE)

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.162
While we still have one.
While we still have one.

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.932
I mean, I went through
something like this.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:49.935
Yours is worse because you
were actually interrogated,
you were detained--

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.572
Two month federal investigation
by two, um,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.941
departments from the DOJ,
Department of Justice.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.175
-(AUDIENCE MOANS)
-Right.

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.711
I mean, after 9/11 I had this
on my wall for a while,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.880
the<i> Variety</i> headline that says,
you know,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.383
"White House keeps heat
on ABC's Maher."

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.551
KATHY:<i> I remember it very well.</i>

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.453
BILL: Yeah, okay, so--
And it was bad,

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:09.022
Ari Fleischer was talking
about me

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.523
in the press conference
every day.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.092
But you had it far worse
because you literally had

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.094
your livelihood
taken away from you,

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.729
-Yeah.
-My show kept going,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.964
uh, our ratings never dropped...

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:22.334
I even had my-- Um,
I was in the middle
of a fifty-city tour,

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.372
and I had like 25 dates
up until the following February,

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.740
'cause this happened
on May 30th,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.609 line:0%
TMZ was reporting
my show cancellations

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.412 line:0%
in real time which scared,
I think, the theaters.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.214 line:0%
So these theaters,
which I don't blame,

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.315 line:0%
because all of a sudden,
you know,

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.650 line:0%
normally they do like,
<i> Stomp,</i> or<i> Mama Mia!,</i>

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.619 line:0%
and all of a sudden,
they're getting robocalls

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.722
from like, a bot farm
in Macedonia going,

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.424
"If I see that bitch on stage
I'm gonna cut her in the cunt,

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.226
chop her head off,
and put her head up her cunt."

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.827
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-That was-- No joke,

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:52.465
that was the number one reason
that the, um,

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.034
folks who are angry,
want to kill me.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.170
That's the number one procedure
they wanna do.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:01.373
-Moving on... (CHUCKLES)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.309
-Yeah, it was ugly, and...
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.044
and I mean, but...
It really got outta hand,

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.715
I think, when the official
security apparatus

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.718
of the United States of America,
which you'd think

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:12.985
would have something better
to do,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.721
and I am sure knew better,

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.389
than you were somehow
a threat to the president...

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.892
-Well, they--
-...interrogated you, I mean,

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.794
flying is still a problem
for you, is it not?

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.428
-Yeah, I...
-I mean, you were on the D-List,

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.365
-now you're on the no-fly list.
-(LAUGHING)

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.034
-The D-List is much better.
D-List is much better.
-BILL: Yeah, way better.

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:31.270
Um, yeah, I'm on
the Interpol list and so,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.638
when I couldn't get work here
after that...

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:33.806
-BILL: The Interpol?
-Yeah.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.441
-For international criminals?
-Yeah.

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:40.513
So, I did an overseas tour,
I did 15 countries and 23 cities

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.415
and I was detained
at every single airport,

00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:46.819
which is frightening,
because they scan your passport,

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.056
they see-- And by the way,
this is really scary

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.824
when you're at
the Singapore airport,

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.959
and you see the person
go like this...

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.195
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-And then there's like,

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.764
whispering, and then they put me
in, like, a detention room,

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.366
and you don't know
how long it's gonna take,

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.601
and I'm thinking, you know,
"I got-- 'Scuse me,

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.537
I have an eight o' clock show
I gotta make soccer moms

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.573
-and gay guys laugh. Let's go."
-Right.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.041
(AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS)

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.277
But in all seriousness,
there were times

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.613
when they took my devices,
they can do that,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.748
and you might think, you know,
we all have our rights,

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.351
but when you're in that moment,
you're really at the mercy

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.652
of one or two people
in that room.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.721
So, it happened at LAX,
it happened at London, Heathrow,

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.757
um, and it's scary every time

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.325
'cause you don't quite know
what it is.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.795
So, if you had to do it
all over again, I mean,

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.763
I assume you wouldn't
take the picture,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.164
but... (CHUCKLES)

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:35.034
I'd do Mike Pence.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.902
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-(BILL CHUCKLES)

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.004
(CHEERING)

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.373
(APPLAUSE)

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.943
Ten months I waited
to do that joke, ten months.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:47.847
Okay, um,
but would you do anything over?

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:50.682
Uh, the way it was--
The aftermath of it?

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.418
Oh yeah, I mean, everything
about the aftermath was,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.321
you know, it truly is
a historic situation,

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.089
so one of the things
I like doing--

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.859
About touring is, as you know,
you're on stage

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.226
and you can really
tell your story

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.762
without censorship and stuff,
so, the current show I'm doing

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:05.831
actually does have, like,
a couple serious moments in it

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.467
because when I describe
the interrogation,

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:10.369
you could hear a pin drop,
you know what I mean?

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.005
Like I said, I've just done
23 cities in 15 countries,

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.040
and the intensity
of those moments,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.676
when my first amendment attorney
said to me, you know,

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:20.046
"If this doesn't go well
you'll leave here in handcuffs."

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.484
And the DOJ called my attorneys
every single day for two months,

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.753
"Did she come in yet?
Did she come in yet?"

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.189
Every day they called
and said we can do a--

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.423
It's called a No-Knock,

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:32.891
which is what they did
to Paul Manafort

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:34.626
-Sure.
-No knock, come in.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.462
You know, and I'd be like,
"Fine, come on in,

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.997
we can take my Backstreet Boys
CDs," you know.

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:42.200
So, it was crazy,
but that's how crazy it was.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.937
So I was determined to not do,
like, a perp walk,

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.972
so it cost me a lot of money
of course,

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.541
but at least
we were able to negotiate

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.110
the interrogation happening
in my attorney's office.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.646
But, you know, just being told
you could leave in cuffs.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:55.781
-Yeah.
-You know, it came straight

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.115
from the DOJ
and the White House.

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.285
-So, uh...
-And that's the--

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.886
That's the administration
that we have now.

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:03.155
So that's what I am here
to talk about, is,

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.224
I really believe that
it happened to me,

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.559
and I really believe
it could happen to you

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.727
and other people,
or people's kids or relatives.

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:10.229
It could happen,
it's gotten crazy.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.098
-Well, I-- We're not gonna...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.100
(CHUCKLES)
...hopefully take that picture.

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:18.938
But I do believe
what you're saying in general
is correct,

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:22.574
everything that was unthinkable
two years ago, is thinkable now:

00:07:22.674 --> 00:07:25.611
dictatorship, fascism.
All those kinds of things,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.047
-uh, so, I don't think...
-ICE deportations are going...

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.448
-BILL: Nuclear war,
-Yeah.

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:30.783
-nothing is off the table.
-Correct.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:35.053
Okay, so, do you think--
I know some friendships were...

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.757
-casualties in this.
-I'm down to three gay guys.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:42.194
-(LAUGHTER)
-And you. And you.

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.830
But I hear you're fluid,
I hear you're fluid.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.232
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Which is very trendy.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.634
Very trendy, Bill,
very hot, sells tickets.

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:53.372
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS)

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.275
Um, I'm just gonna play
straight man today, I...

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.246
-So, uh...
-Oh, and I got canned from CNN

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.948
which sucked because
I was never a CNN employee,

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.349
I only worked there
one night a week,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.485
but they made like this
sweeping statement,

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:07.753
-and you know...
-Well I was gonna say--

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:10.522
Don Jr. was like--
Of all people, like, Don Jr.,

00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:11.958
that freakin' cro-mag, like...

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:14.326
-Right.
-...barely human,
whatever his deal is.

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.028
-Right. (CHUCKLES)
-He goes on, like,
<i> Good Morning America</i>

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.564
and says, "We don't just wanna
ruin Kathy Griffin's career,

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.999
we wanna decimate her."

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.335
And that was like,
months after the photo, so...

00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.371
-But do you thi--
-I'm not decimated.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.773
Right. No, you're not.
You look very strong.

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.976
(AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS)

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.445
(BILL LAUGHS)

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.815
I-- I mean, we need comedians,

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.584
I mean, I know that sounds
like a pat on the back

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.652
'cause I'm one of them,
but what we really do,

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:41.953
-especially in this era,
-Yeah.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:45.323
and any era, to sometimes
go over the line...

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.826
-Yes!
-...so we know where
the lines are.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.260
-Of course.
-And also to establish

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.163
that we do live in a country
with free speech, that was--

00:08:51.263 --> 00:08:52.931
As distasteful
as it might have been
to a lot of people,

00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:54.433
-it was free speech.
-Yes!

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.802
And free speech is still
kind of important
and I'd like to defend it.

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.938
It's important
and also the alt-right
has kind of co-opted it, like...

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.406
-Right.
-...you know, a speech
at Berkeley

00:09:01.506 --> 00:09:02.941 line:0%
and somebody
knocks over a garbage can,

00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:05.110 line:0%
sets it on fire
and if it's an alt-right person

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.713 line:0%
they'll say it's free speech
but they kinda co-opted that,

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.415 line:0%
but you know, you and I
do the kind of comedy

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.383 line:0%
that pushes boundaries
and to do that

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:12.852
you have to move them,
and then cross them,

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:14.186
and push them again,
and see what works.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.388
And I'm finding, like,
I know you're on the road
as well,

00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:18.490
I'm finding that people
are wanting that kind of comedy.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.693
-We're in such an intense time,
-Oh. So thirsty, yes.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:22.194
people don't want
dog and cat jokes.

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:24.129
-No, they-- I mean--
-You know, so...

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.997
-They definitely...
-They want the real deal.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.433
And they want to be very mean
to Donald Trump,

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:30.069
and I can do that,
I can do that.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.137
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
-You can do that, too, so...

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.473
I'm definitely trying.
I do have, by the way,

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:36.041
I have a small,
victorious announcement.

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.409
-Okay. All right.
-Small. Okay.

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:39.579
So I'm dipping my toes
into touring again,

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.847
even though the Trumps,
nobody wants me to work again,

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:46.151
but I'm dipping my toes in
and, um, I just booked today,

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:48.888
I'm gonna do a show
at Carnegie Hall in New York...

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:49.922
And...

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.723
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
-BILL: I've heard of it.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.994
And I'm also gonna go
right to Trump's back yard

00:09:56.094 --> 00:09:57.529
and do a show
at the Kennedy Center.

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:59.731
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-BILL: All right.

00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:01.901
Kathy Griffin! Triumphant!
