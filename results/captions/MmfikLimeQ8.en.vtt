00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.690
So, I want to get you all 
involved in my talk today.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.424
and we are going to test out
a little experiment.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:14.916
but in order for me to do that,
I need somebody to come up here

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.700
and join me on the stage.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.395
So please, can I have a volunteer?

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.727
Don't all run at once.

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:24.210
So, you can come 
and join me up here with Ted.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.050
We can have a little cup of tea together.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.235
Anyone? Come on!

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:32.457
You just come up, whoever wants,
I am not going to pick anyone.

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:33.848
Someone has to come up,

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:37.033
and there are volunteers down here,
to bring you up onto the stage.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.953
Oh, here's somebody.

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:41.454
(Applause)

00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:50.082
It's a bit of an obstacle course, I think,

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:52.969
but I promise it's worth it.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.251
(Laughter)

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.521
Poor person.

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.806
Woo, thank you.

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:04.806
What's your name?

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:05.934
Volunteer: Ian.

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.079
Carrie Green: Ian, thank you so much Ian

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.605
I have something for you,
you just won £20.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.995
There you go, thank you so much,
you can go, sit back down now.

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:15.733
A big round of applause!

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.462
(Applause)

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:26.651
So, my question to you is this:

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.891
Why didn't you volunteer?

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.297
What stopped you from coming up here?

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:35.859
(Laughter)

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.686
My guess is that was probably
for one of these reasons;

00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:40.510
Fear.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.194
Fear of coming up here in front 
of nearly 1000 people.

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:45.025
It's pretty damn scary.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:48.842
Or maybe it was fear of the unknown,
because you had no idea

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.481
what I was going to get you to do.

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.469
Maybe you thought,

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.964
"She might ask me to do something
I'm not able to do,

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.789
and I'll look like a complete prat."

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.275
Or maybe it was because of obstacles.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.297
There are a lot of obstacles in this room.

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:03.861
Maybe you're at the back,
and you just thought,

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.456
"I'm so far away, it's dark,
there're a lot of tables in my way,

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.797
I'll probably fall over some
of them like a fool,

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:11.926
and I just can't do it,
it's too difficult,

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.120
someone else will have 
to volunteer for me."

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.845
Or maybe it was just lack of motivation.

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:20.725
Maybe you just couldn't be bothered
to move and come up here.

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:25.307
But no matter what your reason was,
your decision started up here;

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.859
in your mind.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.121
Because the moment I said,
"Please, can I have a volunteer?"

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.597
Thoughts will have started 
flooding into your mind.

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:35.846
That little voice inside your head
would have started talking to you,

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.920
and maybe for some of you, it was saying,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.223
"Oh god, what is this girl
going to get us to do?

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:41.594
I don't want to go up there,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.922
please, don't make us do 
anything really stupid."

00:02:43.922 --> 00:02:46.911
And then, maybe for some other people,

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.337
maybe for some other 
people you were thinking,

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.163
maybe down at the front you were like,

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:54.338
"Oh gosh, I don't want 
to do this, look away,

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:57.670
avoid eye contact, avoid eye contact,
then she won't pick me!"

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.298
And then maybe for some of you 
the moment I said,

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:01.877
"Please, can I have a volunteer?"

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:05.438
Maybe, fear, doubts, and worry
just flooded through you

00:03:05.474 --> 00:03:07.597
at the prospect of actually
coming up here,

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.218
of coming up here in front 
of so many people.

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:13.036
And then, for those of you
that did volunteer,

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:15.336
you were thinking 
something entirely different.

00:03:15.336 --> 00:03:18.917
You were thinking things maybe like,
"Oh, she wants a volunteer,

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:22.430
I wonder what she's going to get us to do,
how exciting, I'll do it"

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.847
Or maybe some of you thought,

00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:26.819
"Oh my gosh this is really awkward,
no one is volunteering,

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.449
so I'm going to have to step up and do it"

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.646
But for those of you 
that didn't volunteer,

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:36.051
you missed out on the chance to win £20.

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.392
But this experiment isn't about the money.

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:43.689
This experiment demonstrates 
the power of your mind.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.585
The fact that what is going on
up in your head

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:50.354
has such a huge impact on 
the actions that you take,

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:53.544
on the decisions you make,
and the things that you experience.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.349
And it's not just in silly 
situations like this,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.873
when people miss out
amazing opportunities.

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:02.419
People are missing out on incredible 
opportunities all of the time.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.472
because of what is going on their head,

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:09.188
because they are making bad decisions
based off a really bad frame of mind.

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:12.118
You know, those kind 
of self-limiting thoughts like:

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.786
"I can't do that",

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.118
"I'm not good enough",

00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:17.436
or, "I don't have the time or the money".

00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:18.849
Or maybe it's that you think,

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.121
"I can't be bothered;
I'll just do it tomorrow".

00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:23.747
But then, you never do it,

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:27.917
and so these wonderful ideas,
and these incredible potentials

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:32.194
stay locked up inside,
and you never do anything with them.

00:04:32.194 --> 00:04:35.641
and that is exactly what was happening
to me a few years ago.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:38.968
It was the summer of 2005,
and I had just finished studying

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:41.695
my full first year of law
at the University of Birmingham.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:45.780
I had completely run out of money,
and I was like, what am I going to do?

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:48.489
So I started to look around for jobs,

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.825
and I was looking around and found
absolutely nothing appealing.

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.176
So, I was looking around 
for more opportunities,

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.770
and eventually found this opportunity.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.283
It was to start my very own 
mobile phone unlocking business

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:04.138
which basically meant 
that if you have a mobile phone,

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:06.153
and it was locked to a certain network,

00:05:06.153 --> 00:05:08.315
and say you want to go
travelling to Australia

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:09.886
and use an Australian sim card,

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.362
you could come to the website 
and unlock your phone.

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:14.699
There were just a few massive 
problems with this;

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.173
first, I didn't know 
much about mobile phones

00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:19.617
beyond the fact that they
made calls and sent texts,

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:21.577
let alone mobile phone unlocking.

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:25.045
And I had no idea how to build 
an online business.

00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:28.323
But the only other opportunity
was to sell sweets at Cirque du Soleil.

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:30.513
so I was like sell sweets 
at Cirque du Soleil,

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:31.725
or start my own business.

00:05:31.725 --> 00:05:34.689
So, I went with the idea
of starting my own business,

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.332
it sounded a way more adventurous.

00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:39.313
So, I got started,
and I realised really quickly,

00:05:39.313 --> 00:05:41.555
that when you don't have 
a clue of what to do,

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:44.719
the only thing you can do
is ask for help, and that is what I did.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.185
So, I asked for help and within
a few short weeks,

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:50.731
I put together probably 
the world's worst website.

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:55.360
I discovered Google AdWords
as a way to drive traffic to the website,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.950
and with a credit card
and spending a limit of £30 a day,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.589
my business was officially up and running.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.345
Then over the next couple of years,
when I wasn't studying for my degree,

00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:07.629
I was learning how to build this business;

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.196
I was reading books,

00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:11.080
I was listening to audio programs,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.136
and in my final year,
I went to night school

00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:15.009
to learn more about web development.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.071
I graduated in 2007 
with an amazing degree

00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:20.540
and a business that was flying.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.239
And I decided that being an entrepreneur

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.124
was going to be way more fun 
than being a lawyer.

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:29.395
So I set my sights high 
and I decided to build,

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:30.928
- to take the business global -

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:33.134
to build a successful global business.

00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:35.132
So, we got a new supplier based in America

00:06:35.132 --> 00:06:37.908
who can unlock practically 
every phone under the sun.

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:40.702
We redid the website,
we expanded the team,

00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:42.968
we got real good at online marketing,

00:06:43.358 --> 00:06:45.580
and within a few years, we were receiving

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.461
over 100 000 hits
to the website every month.

00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.997
And we were selling thousands 
and thousands of codes every single month,

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:55.581
and I had reached my goal
to build a successful global business.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.903
But there was one massive problem.

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:01.406
I was miserable.

00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:04.751
I was running this business
predominantly from my home office,

00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:08.612
where I lived in an apartment; my second 
bedroom was turned into an office.

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:13.068
And I felt completely lonely,
totally isolated and lost.

00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:15.376
Something that I think 
so many people experience

00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:17.102
but not very many of us talk about.

00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:19.125
And I crumbled.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:24.032
I started to question everything
and I started to think questions like:

00:07:24.032 --> 00:07:25.352
What am I doing?

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:27.642
What is the point of all of this?

00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:30.781
The more I thought about those
questions, the more confused I felt.

00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.330
And the more confused I felt,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.879
the more these negative thoughts 
which cloud my mind,

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.061
the more I began to doubt everything,
and worry about everything,

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:40.050
and just question everything.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.685
And as the months rolled by,
I became more and more negative,

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:45.790
more and more self-defeatist,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:51.283
and literally, this positive optimistic
and "go get it "person that I once was,

00:07:51.283 --> 00:07:52.678
had just disappeared.

00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:55.976
I'd become totally negative 
and self-sabotaging.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.196
I'd come up with ideas,

00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:59.778
I'd shoot them down,
I'd talk to myself out of it.

00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:04.316
Then it got to 2010 and I felt like 
I was in complete despair.

00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:08.384
And so I packed my bags 
and I went travelling to Australia

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:11.051
in the hope of having an epiphany.

00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:15.567
Spent three months traveling 
around Australia, no epiphany,

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:17.789
and I was just like: 
what am I supposed to do?

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:22.768
So then I came back to the UK, and well,
even more miserable than before,

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.496
because all of my problems 
were still waiting for me,

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:27.060
and the weather was rubbish.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.075
Then I was like, "What am I going to do?"

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:33.313
So the next few months, I found myself
being suffocated by my problems.

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:36.243
you know where you feel like
you can't get rid of these doubts

00:08:36.243 --> 00:08:38.801
and these worries 
and it was all I'd focus on.

00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.002
I'd come up with ideas,
I'd find opportunities,

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:44.268
and I'd just talk myself out of it,
thinking that I couldn't do it.

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:49.880
And then finally, in 2011,
I figured out where I was going wrong.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.530
And I believe I was going wrong 
for two massive reasons:

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.806
the first reason was that
yes, I wanted to be successful,

00:08:57.806 --> 00:08:59.104
and quite frankly,

00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:02.294
doesn't every single person 
in this room wants to be successful?

00:09:02.294 --> 00:09:06.076
But mobile phone unlocking
was not my dream.

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:10.331
At the time, I was reading this book
by Michael Gerber called "The E-Myth",

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:13.034
and in "The E-Myth",
there is a chapter on primary aims.

00:09:13.394 --> 00:09:17.448
Michael Gerber says:
Imagine walking into a room;

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:21.146
sat in the room,
are your friends and family,

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:24.945
and as you walk down the center
of the room, you see a box.

00:09:25.285 --> 00:09:29.921
And as you get to the front of the room
you realize that you are in the box,

00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:31.836
and it's your funeral.

00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:36.394
And he says, "What kind of things
do you want people to be saying

00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:38.678
about the kind of life that you lived,

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.938
about the kind of person that you were,

00:09:40.938 --> 00:09:42.992
and the kind of things that you achieved?"

00:09:43.222 --> 00:09:46.951
And I realized, I had no idea.

00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:50.939
So there was no wonder 
that I felt so off track.

00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:54.198
I had never ever been on track

00:09:55.338 --> 00:09:57.955
And the second reason 
why I think went wrong,

00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:01.235
is because of what was going on up here;
what was going on in my head.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:05.093
All these doubts, all these worries,
all this self-limiting belief.

00:10:05.093 --> 00:10:07.782
I came across a quote 
by Anthony Robbins that said,

00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:13.968
"Your destiny is determined by the choices
you make. Choose now. Choose well."

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:19.703
And I realized that I was 
responsible for this misery;

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.575
I was responsible for the fact 
that I was stuck in a rut.

00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:25.916
I remember looking at my life thinking
I am waking up every single day

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.803
and focusing on my problems.

00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:32.229
I am waking up every day and giving
so much focus and attention

00:10:32.229 --> 00:10:36.240
to all of these awful thoughts,
these doubts, and these worries.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.989
I am coming up with ideas
and I am shooting them down,

00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:42.505
I am talking myself out of doing
anything whatsoever.

00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:46.598
And I realized that if I wanted
to live an incredible life

00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:49.692
and achieve amazing things,
- and I really did -

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:53.575
that I had to get my mind to be 
on the same wavelength as me.

00:10:53.575 --> 00:10:58.235
I realized that I had to figure out 
what it was that I wanted to achieve;

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:01.613
why I was wanted to achieve it,
why it actually meant something to me.

00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:05.212
I had to figure out the kind of person
that I needed to become,

00:11:05.212 --> 00:11:06.855
in order to make it happen.

00:11:06.855 --> 00:11:11.132
And then, I had to program 
my mind to make it happen.

00:11:11.132 --> 00:11:14.826
I had to program my mind for success.

00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:17.539
And that is exactly what I ended up doing,

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:19.977
"Mission Success" began.

00:11:19.977 --> 00:11:24.428
And so I started this off by thinking 
about: what do I actually want?

00:11:24.428 --> 00:11:28.434
And so I looked at my life and I thought,
"I love being an entrepreneur,

00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:31.263
I love coming up with ideas 
and turning them into reality

00:11:31.263 --> 00:11:32.402
it is so much fun."

00:11:32.402 --> 00:11:34.450
And then looked 
at my problems and thought,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.893
"I feel really lonely and lost 
as an entrepreneur."

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:39.513
And I looked at them with 
a different perspective.

00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:42.917
Rather than feeling bad about it,
I thought, "What can I do about it?

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:46.795
There must be other people out there that
are in exactly the same position as me."

00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:51.795
So I came up with this idea to create 
the Female Entrepreneur Association,

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.718
and it sounded so official.

00:11:53.718 --> 00:11:56.105
And I was doing it,
and I had this massive idea,

00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:57.825
I would create this global network

00:11:57.825 --> 00:12:00.060
of thousands of women 
from all over the world

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.808
and help to inspire them and connect them

00:12:02.808 --> 00:12:06.401
and just help to empower them 
to build successful businesses.

00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:09.758
But I had no idea, 
how I was going to do this.

00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:13.594
Then I was like, "Right, I need to program
my mind to make this happen."

00:12:13.874 --> 00:12:16.163
So I started by becoming consciously aware

00:12:16.163 --> 00:12:18.343
of the things I was thinking every day,

00:12:18.553 --> 00:12:21.256
and whenever I caught myself 
thinking of something like,

00:12:21.256 --> 00:12:23.406
"Carrie, who is going to come
to this website?

00:12:23.406 --> 00:12:25.501
Who are you to give advice to anyone? 

00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:27.597
This is rubbish,
this is a ridiculous idea,

00:12:27.597 --> 00:12:29.529
you're never going to be able to do it."

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:33.224
Every time I caught myself saying
something like that,I would stop myself,

00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:37.314
and I realized that I had the power 
to take control over my thoughts

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.555
rather than letting them control me.

00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:43.704
I knew that I could stop myself 
from thinking these things.

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:44.826
And I did,

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.962
I replaced the negative rubbish 
annoying thoughts,

00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:49.501
and told them to shut up,

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:53.271
and I replaced them with positive 
thoughts that were empowering me,

00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:56.822
thoughts that were actually helping me
to move towards my goal.

00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:59.630
I also started to listen 
to guided visualization,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.224
to program my subconscious
mind for success.

00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:05.382
And I got really into doing visualizations

00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:09.364
vividly picturing what I wanted 
to achieve, seeing it happen,

00:13:09.364 --> 00:13:13.120
and then feeling it happen, like
it was happening right then and there,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.500
just like all the top athletes do.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.731
I got so clear on what
I wanted to make happen,

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:22.546
and since then my life 
has totally changed.

00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:26.290
I've built one of the largest online
networking groups of female entrepreneurs,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.358
with over 100 000 women involved.

00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:32.180
And then I came up with this crazy 
idea to launch a digital magazine,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.994
which then became the fastest growing 
digital magazine for female entrepreneurs.

00:13:35.994 --> 00:13:38.536
When I created it, I made
this wish list in my mind

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:40.765
of all the people I wanted 
on the front cover;

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:44.606
these best-selling authors,
these incredibly successful entrepreneurs.

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:48.259
I had no idea how I would make it happen,
but I was so convinced it would.

00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:51.642
I then put their faces
on mock-ups of the front cover,

00:13:51.642 --> 00:13:54.459
printed them off and stuck them 
on my goal board,

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.271
and just visualized them
being on the front cover;

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:59.438
visualized what it would 
feel like the moment

00:13:59.438 --> 00:14:01.256
I'd send out an email to my network.

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:03.063
And I could say to them,
"Hey everyone,

00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:05.884
this person's on the front cover 
this month, how exciting!"

00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:08.902
I got so unbelievably clear 
about what I wanted to do.

00:14:08.902 --> 00:14:10.574
People would come up to me and say,

00:14:10.574 --> 00:14:12.476
"How are you going
to make this happen?"

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:15.385
I was like, "I don't know, 
but I am going to make it happen."

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:16.249
And it did happen,

00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:17.425
So then I thought,

00:14:17.425 --> 00:14:20.051
"What other crazy goals
could I make happen?

00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:21.768
What else is possible?"

00:14:21.768 --> 00:14:23.529
So I set more crazy goals for myself.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:26.078
I was like, "I want to go 
to Buckingham Palace,

00:14:26.078 --> 00:14:29.689
I want to go to the House of Lords,
I want to speak at the House of Commons."

00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:31.892
And I set more crazy goals for myself.

00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:34.550
And last year every single one 
of them happened.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:40.550
And I realized that if I could 
get my mind to be certain,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.833
that I could make something happen,

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:47.102
that somehow I would figure out
a way, and I always have.

00:14:47.572 --> 00:14:49.975
Because success is no accident.

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:54.109
Living an incredible life is no accident.

00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:56.519
You have to do it on purpose.

00:14:56.519 --> 00:15:00.693
and it starts by knowing exactly 
what is it that you want to achieve,

00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:03.419
knowing why you want to achieve it,

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:07.895
knowing the kind of person that you 
need to become in order to make it happen,

00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:11.562
and then programming
your mind to make it happen.

00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:15.789
Because you just have one life
in which to achieve everything,

00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:19.102
that you are going to achieve,
so you have to act accordingly.

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:20.367
Thank you so much.

00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:22.775
(Applause)
