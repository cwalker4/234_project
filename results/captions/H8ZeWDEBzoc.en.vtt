OCASIO-CORTEZ.

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:07.774 align:start position:0%
THE NEW CONGRESSWOMAN FROM
QUEENS.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:12.011 align:start position:0%
NOW, CONGRESSWOMAN, FOR YOU AND
OTHER FRESHMEN MEMBERS OF

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:18.017
CONGRESS, YOU'RE GETTING A FAIR
AMOUNT OF PUSHBACK FROM EVEN

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.889
MEMBERS OF YOUR OWN PARTY SAYING
WAIT YOUR TURN, GO SLOW, DON'T

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.292 align:start position:0%
ASK FOR SO MUCH SO FAST RIGHT
NOW.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:31.998
YOU'RE NEW, WAIT YOUR TURN FOR
EVERYTHING AND DON'T MAKE WAVES.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE BOOING )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WANT TO ASK THIS

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:37.403 align:start position:0%
QUESTION IN A RESPECTFUL MANNER,
KNOWING ALSO THAT YOU'RE FROM

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start position:0%
QUEENS, SO YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
THIS QUESTION.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start position:0%
( CHEERING )
ON A SCALE FROM ZERO TO SOME,

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:53.886 align:start position:0%
HOW MANY (  BLEEP  ) DO YOU GIVE
&gt;&gt; ZERO.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:56.022
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S MY THOUGHT!

00:00:56.055 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO WH WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PEO

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.231
WHO SAY WE NEED PARTY UNITY AND
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU MEETING WITH

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:09.102 size:88% position:44%
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OCCUPYING
PELOSI'S OFFICE BECAUSE THAT

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.705
SHOWS A DIVIDED FRONT FOR THE
DEMOCRATS THAT THE OPPOSITION

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:14.607 size:88% position:44%
PARTY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.644 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IT'S HOW WE CHOOSE TO
INTERPRET ITEMS AND HOW WE

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start position:0%
CHOOSE TO INTERPRET EVENTS AND
THINGS LIKE ACTIVISM AND

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.350 align:start position:0%
ADVOCACY.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
IF YOU THINK ACTIVISM IS
INHERENTLY DIVISIVE -- I MEAN,

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.920
TODAY IS MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:31.090 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE CALLED MARTIN LUTHER KING
DIVISIVE IN HIS TIME.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:40.366
WE FORGET HE WAS WILDLY UNTOP
LAR WHEN ADVOCATING FOR THE

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.302 align:start position:0%
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start position:0%
SOCIAL MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE THE
MORAL COMPASS O.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.511 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU BROUGHT THE

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.514 size:78% position:39%
BOOK "WHY WE CAN'T WAIT."

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.482 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:04.257
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HAVE TO GET INTO
ONE POLICY ISSUE WITH YOU HERE

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:14.433 align:start position:0%
IS THAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED A 70%
TAX ON RICH FOLKS.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, I HAVE NO -- I HAVE NO DOG

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.642 align:start position:0%
IN THIS FIGHT --
( LAUGHTER )

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:29.949 align:start position:0%
-- I'M JUST CURIOUS, HOW WOULD
THAT WORK?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.186 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT IF SOME OF THE MONEY IS IN

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:33.886 align:start position:0%
THE CAYMAN ISLANDS?

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.588 align:start position:0%
HOW WOULD THAT WORK?

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.391
&gt;&gt; SIGNING THIS IS SOMETHING WE
OFTEN SEE, TOO, WITH FOX NEWS.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
IT'S, LIKE, THEY WANT TO TAKE
ALL YOUR MONEY!

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:44.630
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A 70%
MARGINAL TAX RATE, IT'S NOT ON

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:58.077 align:start position:0%
ALL OF YOUR INCOME, IT'S ON YOUR
$10,000,001.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.151
YOUR DOLLARS AFTER 10 MILLION,
YOUR DOLLARS ARE TAXED AT AN

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.752 align:start position:0%
INCREASED RATE.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:10.623
IT'S THE TAX RATE INTERPRETATION
TO ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:15.094
AT WHAT LEVEL ARE WE REALLY JUST
LIVING IN EXCESS AND WHAT KIND

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:20.333
OF SOCIETY DO WE WANT TO LIVE
IN, AND DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN A

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.367 align:start position:0%
CITY --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:26.539 align:start position:0%
-- FOR EXAMPLE, DO WE WANT TO
LIVE IN A STAR WHERE

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:32.745 size:88% position:44%
BILLIONAIRES HAVE THEIR OWN
PERSONAL UBER HELIPADS, WHEN

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:34.046 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN GET THOSE?

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.114 align:start position:0%
OH, YEAH.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE THE
TRAFFIC IN THE TUNNEL SUCKS.

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:37.550 align:start position:0%
GOOD TO KNOW.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.784 align:start position:0%
GO AHEAD.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.921
&gt;&gt; SO DO WE WANT THESE KIND OF
FOLKS WITH HELIPADS IN THE SAME

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:46.859
CITY AND SOCIETY AS PEOPLE WHO
ARE WORKING 80 HOUR WEEKS AND

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
CAN'T FEED THEIR KIDS?

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:52.164
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND THIS KIND OF
TAX RATE WAS THE NORM UNTIL THE

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
EARLY '80s.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:53.766 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.601 align:start position:0%
THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.738 size:81% position:41%
PEOPLE ARE YELLING SHE'S A
SOCIALIST, SHE WANTS 70%

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.972 align:start position:0%
MARGINAL TAX RATES.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:06.812 align:start position:0%
UNDER REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION,
DWIGHT EISENHOWER, WE HAD 90%

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
MARGINAL TAX RATES.

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:08.914 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT I WANT TO
POINT OUT, SHE'S A SOCIALIST AND

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:13.452 align:start position:0%
WANTS 70% TAX RATES, THOSE ARE
BOTH CORRECT?

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.955 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.224 align:start position:0%
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.325 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU FOR

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.226 align:start position:0%
BEING SHEER.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.460 align:start position:0%
HOPE WE SEE YOU MANY TIMES IN
THE FUTURE.

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:26.165 size:78% position:39%
CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA
