00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:02.375
- [Interviewer] Michelle,

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:04.846
you're homeless here in Venice.

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:06.799
Tell me about it.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.464
- I never asked to be
homeless here in Venice.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:11.327
It just happened to me.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.827
(car driving)

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.512
I've got five minutes of a story

00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:19.044
and in five minutes
it'll go short and sweet.

00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:20.852
I came from Orleans, Indiana

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:22.055
which is southern part of Indiana,

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.197
farmland, Midwest territory.

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.662
Bad divorce.

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:28.448
Friend out here in Salinas, California

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:29.528
talked me into moving out here

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.643
to put some space between me and my ex.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:34.206
Which I did.

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:37.727
She flew into Indianapolis, Indiana.

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:39.724
She came to my home.

00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.921
We packed my vehicle.

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.125
My belongings, put what
I couldn't bring with me

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.635
and put the rest of it in storage.

00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:49.218
Brought my puppy, Russell Otis.

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:51.702
They stole him.

00:00:56.843 --> 00:01:00.661
I used to have my own
business back in Indiana.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.593
I was a pet groomer.

00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:04.593
Boarded dogs. Bred dogs.

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:08.994
I was living on a farm with my,

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:12.592
ex-husband was a farmer
of corn and soybeans.

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.342
Wealthy, wealthy man.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:21.988
I got to where I thought I was
better than everybody myself.

00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:23.238
Now look at me.

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:30.760
I've lived a hard life
and I've lived a hard way.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.361
Two and a half years ago
I had a massive stroke

00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:34.611
before I ever left Indiana.

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:37.306
Couldn't get no insurance,

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.261
tried and tried to get insurance,

00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:41.384
couldn't get no insurance and my husband

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:42.770
being that he's a wealthy, wealthy man,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.066
made hundreds of thousands of dollars,

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.399
could not afford to pay insurance on me.

00:01:57.487 --> 00:01:58.939
There is a lot of programs and resources

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.772
out here on these streets
if you just use 'em.

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:05.351
I can't do no more I'm sorry.

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:06.184
- [Interviewer] You sure?

00:02:06.184 --> 00:02:07.017
- Mhmm.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.040
- [Interviewer] So, cause you said you had

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.036
a stroke six days ago.

00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:11.448
- Six days ago I had another stroke,

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:12.854
a light one.

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:14.419
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.853
- I'm prone to having strokes now that

00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:19.242
I had that first massive
one six months ago.

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:20.709
Before I even landed in California,

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.439
in between Indiana and here,

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.466
I ended up in Arizona
hospital, Kingman, Arizona.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:29.244
I was in the hospital/rehabilitation,

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:33.079
acute rehabilitation center
slash for twelve weeks

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.711
before ever I landed at my
friends house in Salinas.

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:36.817
She went ahead to Salinas,

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:39.842
took my car, took my belongings,

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:42.887
took care of everything
while I was in the hospital.

00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:46.387
Now who's got all my stuff and my car now?

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:48.119
She does.

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.952
- [Interviewer] So how'd you end up here?

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:49.785
- How did I end up here?

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:50.618
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:51.917
- I got on a Greyhound,

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:55.454
didn't have no ID cause somebody
stole my purse, of course.

00:02:55.454 --> 00:02:57.029
Live and you learn.

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.362
Didn't have no ID, got on the Greyhound.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.036
My friend did help me purchase the ticket,

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.322
first driver didn't have no issue

00:03:06.322 --> 00:03:09.916
with the no license, no ID, or whatever.

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:13.470
Second driver didn't go that way.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.637
And then, I missed my bus.

00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.251
The next bus that came in,

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.293
the next driver would
not let me on that bus.

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:25.861
They wouldn't fix my ticket.

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:26.694
They wouldn't do nothing.

00:03:26.694 --> 00:03:27.625
They threw me out on the streets

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:31.854
at 3:34 o'clock in the
morning in LA. Downtown.

00:03:31.854 --> 00:03:35.576
First time I had ever
been here in my life.

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:39.250
I stayed down there for three, four days.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.269
Downtown I did run into a group

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.778
of some people that was homeless as well,

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.160
that pitched in there and showed me

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.327
a little bit of ropes and
took me to a safe place.

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:52.338
So I have made several friends out here.

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:56.005
I've been out here for
a little over a year.

00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:01.466
- [Interviewer] Now, what's
homelessness like out here?

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.270
- What is homelessness like out here?

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.492
- [Interviewer] Yeah, what is it like.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.325
- Awful.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.915
- [Interviewer] What would
you want people to know

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.656
about homelessness, that they don't know.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:11.919
- What they don't know about homelessness

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.335
is that we're not out here, you know,

00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:15.343
I've heard so many smart comments

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:17.671
about only the finest for the homeless.

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.890
Only the finest for the homeless.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.587
It should never be that way.

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:23.204
Why would I choose to be out here

00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:24.540
showering in the cold waters

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.373
and laying on these cold concrete.

00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:32.728
How is that that, you know,
the best for the homeless?

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.123
- [Interviewer] People
think that, you know,

00:04:35.123 --> 00:04:36.843
homeless people are lazy,

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.723
yet every day is work,
work, work to survive.

00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:42.804
There's no vacation days,
there's no time off,

00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:45.629
and like you, you have medical problems.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.712
There's no place to rest.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.152
- Absolutely. You can't lay down and rest.

00:04:51.152 --> 00:04:52.779
You know, if you lay down and go into

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.113
a deep sleep you're going to have someone

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:56.286
waking you up, telling you to move,

00:04:56.286 --> 00:04:57.834
you're not allowed here,
you're not allowed there.

00:04:57.834 --> 00:04:59.216
Which I understand that.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.630
We're not supposed to be out here.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.463
I never chose this,

00:05:02.463 --> 00:05:04.940
but I need to choose a safe spot

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.014
wherever I need to lay down

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.175
cause I can only do so much.

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:08.008
- [Interviewer] Right.

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:09.536
- If I keep on pushing
myself the way I am,

00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:11.826
I'm going to die out here.

00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:14.076
- [Interviewer] Oh my gosh.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:17.062
I'm so sorry.

00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:18.535
- I don't want nobody
to feel sorry for me.

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:20.022
I don't want them to pray for me.

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:21.928
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

00:05:21.928 --> 00:05:26.452
You need people to be an
answer to your prayers.

00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:29.953
If you had three wishes
what would they be?

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:32.453
- Three wishes. Better health,

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:38.479
better relationship, and a
better financial situation.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.001
And I'm regrouping sir.

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.592
I will get back on my feet.

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:42.654
- [Interviewer] Yeah.

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:43.630
Well that's one thing you said

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.271
when I asked if people are helping you,

00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.636
you said you're gonna get on your feet.

00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:49.281
You're gonna do it.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:50.463
- I'm the one that did it,

00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:53.130
I'm the one that's gonna fix it.

00:05:55.624 --> 00:05:56.457
- [Interviewer] Well thank you very much

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:57.591
for talking to me.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.963
- You're welcome.

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:02.713
