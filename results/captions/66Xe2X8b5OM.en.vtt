WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO "THE LATE

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.804

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HAVE A GOOD ONE?

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start size:88% position:13%
MINE WAS GREAT.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.148
I WAS DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.450 size:75% position:38%
REALLY RELAXING.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
NO INTERNET.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.887
THEY DON'T HAVE IT THERE YET.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:25.058
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I HEARD THERE WAS AN ARTICLE

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.360
ABOUT CBS CHAIRMAN AND MAN I
HOPE ISN'T WATCHING TONIGHT'S

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.431
MONOLOGUE, LES MOONVES.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.198 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
WHERE WAS THE ARTICLE?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:32.699 size:88% position:44%

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.735
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: QUALITY PUBLICATION.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.038
WAS IT ONE OF THOSE CARTOONS?

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.140 size:78% position:39%
TALK OF THE TOWN?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.277
WAS IT A SHOUT OR A MURMUR?

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.713
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHO WROTE
IT?

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:54.621
&gt;&gt; "THE NEW YORKER" ARTICLE BY
RONAN FARROW.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:01:02.695 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:05.799 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:14.674
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
RONAN ISN'T EXACTLY KNOWN FOR

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:17.811
HIS PUFF PIECES ABOUT GLAMPING.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.381
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THIS SO, JIM?

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:26.119
&gt;&gt; SIX WOMEN WHO HAVE
PROFESSIONAL DEALINGS WITH HIM

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.857
, LESLES MOONVES,
TOLD ME THAT BETWEEN THE 1980S

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.592 size:88% position:56%
AND THE LATE 2000S, MOONVES
SEXUALLY HARASSED THEM, FOUR

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.993
DESCRIBED FORCIBLE TOUCHING OR
KISSING IN BUSINESS MEETINGS IN

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.528
WHAT THEY SAID APPEARED TO BE A
PRACTICED ROUTINE.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.863
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WELL, YOU KNOW THE
OLD SAYING: HOW DO YOU GET IN A

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.164
RONAN FARROW ARTICLE?

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.434
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:46.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
IS THIS JUST THIS AFTERNOON?

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.774
THIS HAPPENED MOMENTS AGO.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.175 align:end position:100%
THIS CBS BOARD MET TODAY AND
ANNOUNCED THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.244
OF HIRING OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start size:88% position:13%
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE
OUTSOURCING THIS, THEY COULD

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:58.251
JUST USE THE CAST OF THE NEW CBS
PROCEDURAL, "CSI: CEO."

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.088
( LAUGHTER )
I'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THIS

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:05.091
LATER OVER THERE, ASSUMING WE
MAKE IT PAST THE COMMERCIAL

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
BREAK.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.630
( LAUGHTER )
THERE'S ALSO ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.197
SOMEBODY I DON'T WORK FOR.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE LAST WEEK WE LEARNED
THAT "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALLEGEDLY LEFT FOX NEWS AMID

MISCONDUCT."

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:22.142
SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:22.342 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEAH.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.710
THE BEST NEWS OF THE DAY IS THAT
WOMEN CAN ALSO BE GUILTY OF

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.411 size:81% position:41%
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.479 size:84% position:42%
WHAT A TRAILBLAZER!

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.849 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU GO, GIRL!

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU GO!

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.891
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY --
SERIOUSLY, YOU SHOULD GO.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.825
( LAUGHTER )
ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AT

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.394
FOX NEWS, "GUILFOYLE'S BEHAVIOR

GENITALS THEY WERE."

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.570
WHICH IS HORRIBLE WORKPLACE
BEHAVIOR AND ALSO THE LEAST

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.073 align:start size:88% position:13%
POPULAR EDITION OF THE BOARD

( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:01.181 align:start size:88% position:13%
EVER PLAY THAT?

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.584
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I DON'T MESS WITH
THAT ONE.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.351
THAT'S ANOTHER VERSION.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.589 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.758
AND THIS STORY BECOMES WAY MORE
INTERESTING WHEN YOU KNOW THAT

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.893
GUILFOYLE IS CURRENTLY DATING
"PRESIDENTIAL SON AND MAN

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.395 size:88% position:56%

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.466
WHICH MEANS, AND BRACE
YOURSELVES FOR THIS, THERE'S A

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.835 size:88% position:56%
CHANCE GUILFOYLE WAS FORCING

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:32.045
( LAUGHTER )
I HEAR THE CARPET IS AS GELLED

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:36.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
AS THE DRAPES.

( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.822
STRAIGHT -- STRAIGHT BACK.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.458
BUT THE HUGE NEWS WAS THAT
MICHAEL COHEN CLAIMED THAT TRUMP

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.962
NOT ONLY KNEW IN ADVANCE ABOUT
THE INFAMOUS 2016 TRUMP TOWER

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.397
MEETING, BUT THAT HE ALSO
APPROVED GOING AHEAD WITH THE

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
MEETING.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:56.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT A SHOCKER.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S LIKE THE ENDING OF "THE

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.106
SIXTH SENSE" WHERE BRUCE WILLIS
FINALLY NOTICES HALEY JOEL

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:04.177 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.346 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE THIS WAS SO OBVIOUS,

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.448
IT'S THE COVER OF THIS WEEK'S
"IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT"

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.984 align:start size:88% position:13%
MAGAZINE.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.986 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT EVEN IF THIS IS OBVIOUS,

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.922
IT'S STILL A BIG DEAL.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.959
THIS IS WHOLE BALL OF WAX,
BECAUSE THAT'S KNOWINGLY

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.427
RECEIVING HELP FROM A HOSTILE
FOREIGN POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:30.103 align:start size:88% position:13%
ELECTION.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.005
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
YOU WERE A LITTLE LATE ON THAT,

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.006
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.301
LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS, BUT
A LOT OF IT WAS CHAFF, LIKE

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.736
THIS:
"WOW, HIGHEST POLL NUMBERS IN

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.839
THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.576
THAT INCLUDES HONEST ABE LINCOLN
AND RONALD REAGAN.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:15.214
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG,
PLEASE RECHECK THAT POLL!"

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.218 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY, WE DID!

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:23.723

DIDN'T START UNTIL 1935.

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:32.865 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, OF COURSE, LINCOLN DID

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:33.633 align:start size:88% position:13%
BADLY.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:37.570
WHO WANTS TO VOTE FOR A GUY
WHO'S BEEN DEAD FOR 70 YEARS?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.776
ME, IF HE'S RUNNING AGAINST
TRUMP IN THE NEXT ELECTION.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.778 align:start size:88% position:13%
DEAD ABE 2020: MAKE AMERICA
GRAVE AGAIN.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:49.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TWEETS WEREN'T THE ONLY WAY

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.418
TRUMP FOUGHT BACK-- HE ALSO
UNLEASHED TRUMP ATTORNEY AND MAN

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:57.290
WATCHING THEM OPEN THE ARK OF
THE COVENANT, RUDY GIULIANI.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:04.030
( LAUGHTER )
SO IT'S GIULIANI VERSUS COHEN,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.936
AND AS ALISYN CAMEROTA POINTED
OUT TODAY ON CNN'S "NEW DAY"

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:13.539 align:start size:88% position:13%
TODAY, THIS FEUD IS A RECENT
DEVELOPMENT.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.410
&gt;&gt; YOU HAD SAID NOT TWO MONTHS
AGO THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS AN

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.112
HONEST AND HONORABLE MAN.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
NOW YOU'RE SAYING HE'S A
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR?

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.483 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOW IS IT?

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.284
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S ABOUT AS UNFAIR
AS YOU CAN SAY.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.254
HOW DID I KNOW HE WAS A LAWYER
TAPING HIS CLIENT?

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:31.424
YOU TELL ME A LAWYER IS TAPING
HIS CLIENT, I GOTTA SAY SORRY, I

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.993
MADE A MISTAKE, THE GUY IS
UNETHICAL, HE'S A SCUMBAG, HE'S

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:37.563 size:81% position:41%
A HORRIBLE PERSON.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.300
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A LAWYER
TAPING HIS CLIENT WITHOUT THE

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.435 size:78% position:39%
CLIENT'S CONSENT.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.903
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT'S JUDGMENT?

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:49.308
&gt;&gt; HE MADE-- HE TURNED OUT TO
HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND BETRAY HIM,

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.944
LIKE IAGO BETRAYED OTHELLO, AND
BRUTUS PUT THE LAST KNIFE INTO

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.113 align:start size:88% position:13%
CAESAR.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:57.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THAT'S A PRETTY
LOFTY COMPARISON.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
THIS ISN'T SHAKESPEAREAN

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
BETRAYAL.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:05.625
THIS ISN'T EVEN THAT EPISODE OF
"JERSEY SHORE" WHERE SNOOKI AND

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:08.361
JWOWW WROTE THE NOTE TO SAMMI
TELLING HER THAT RON CHEATED

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:13.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT NIGHT AFTER THEY HAD A
FIGHT AT "KLUTCH."

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:17.003 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
IS WHATT SAYS HERE.

( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.510
THEN THEY WENT ON TO COVER THE
PRESIDENT'S WEEKEND RAGE-TWEETS.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.345
&gt;&gt; IS ROBERT MUELLER EVER GOING
TO RELEASE HIS CONFLICTS OF

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.581
INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP, INCLUDING THE

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
FACT WE HAD A VERY NASTY AND
CONTENTIOUS BUSINESS

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:31.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
RELATIONSHIP?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.885
WHAT'S HE REFERRING TO?

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:33.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT IS IT?

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.588
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S UP TO THE
PRESIDENT AND MUELLER TO

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:38.191
DESCRIBE, NOT PART OF MY LEGAL
REPRESENTATION.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:40.960
&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE, THIS DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.629
HOW CAN THE PRESIDENT MAKE THIS
CLAIM AND NOT SUPPORT IT?

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.530
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.666
&gt;&gt; WHY IS IT UP TO ROBERT
MUELLER TO SUPPORT THE

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.167 size:81% position:41%
PRESIDENT'S TWEET?

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:51.604
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAS THE CONFLICT,
NOT THE PRESIDENT.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:55.241
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YES, IF SOMEONE
STARTS A RUMOR ABOUT YOU, IT'S

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:59.612
"YOUR RESPONSIBILITY" TO ADDRESS
THAT RUMOR.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.914
LIKE IF I SAY RUDY GIULIANI HAS
SEX WITH UNDERAGE GOATS, IT'S UP

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.984
TO HIM TO PROVE ME WRONG.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:09.121 size:88% position:56%
RELEASE THE TAPES OF YOU NOT
HAVING SEX WITH GOATS, RUDY!

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
RELEASE THE TAPES!

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.291 size:81% position:41%
RELEASE THE TAPES!

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.594 size:81% position:41%
RELEASE THE TAPES!

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:17.930 size:81% position:41%
RELEASE THE TAPES!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.166 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE CHANTING )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.635
WE'VE MADE OUR POINT.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:28.374
AT A CERTAIN POINT, GIULIANI HAD
HAD ENOUGH OF THESE QUESTIONS

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:31.744
ABOUT THINGS THAT HE SAID, AND
HE SAW HIS CHANCE TO EXIT.

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.712 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; HOLD THAT THOUGHT, MR.
MAYOR--

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.146
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, I'M GOING TO LEAVE
AFTER THIS ONE.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.748
&gt;&gt; WE'VE SCARED YOU AWAY?

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:36.616
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, YOU SCARED ME AWAY.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.884
I LOOK REALLY SCARED.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
NO, IT'S STARTING TO GET
USELESS.

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:41.754 align:end position:100%
THE CONVERSATION IS STARTING TO
GET REALLY, REALLY PETTY AND

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:42.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
SILLY.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.156
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID THAT
YOU WOULD STAY ALL DAY TO TALK

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.458 align:start size:88% position:13%
ABOUT THIS.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.993
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I'LL STAY ONE MORE TIME
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOME

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:47.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
COFFEE.

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.628 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, GOT IT.

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:49.529 size:88% position:44%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.666 size:78% position:39%
COFFEE COMING UP.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.501
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WAIT THAT'S ALL IT

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.869 size:88% position:56%
TAKES TO RENT RUDY GIULIANI?

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:57.904
"THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND A SHAM.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:58.371 size:88% position:44%
HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.071 size:88% position:44%
OH, IS THAT A LATTE?

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.674
I'M STICKING AROUND."

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:04.844 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
AND GIULIANI ALSO UNVEILED

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.446
WHAT'S SURE TO BE AN AIRTIGHT
DEFENSE FOR HIS CLIENT.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:12.351
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE
COLLUDING ABOUT RUSSIANS, WHICH

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.587
I'M NOT EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S A
CRIME, COLLUDING ABOUT RUSSIANS.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:19.225
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: "I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THAT'S A CRIME?"

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.059 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE HIS LAWYER, YOU'RE

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.162
SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THE LAW
IS.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.430
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S LIKE YOUR DOCTOR GOING:

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.598
"I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S A
DISEASE: BLEEDING FROM YOUR

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:29.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
EYEBALLS."

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I DON'T KNOW, WHO KNOWS?"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.012
AND HE WENT ON -- EYEBALL
BLEEDING, I DON'T KNOW.

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.247
AND HE WENT ON TO DESCRIBE THE
REAL CRIME.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YOU START ANALYZING THE
CRIME.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.149
THE HACKING IS THE CRIME.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:43.816
THE HACKING IS THE CRIME.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:44.984
&gt;&gt; THAT CERTAINLY IS THE
ORIGINAL PROBLEM, YES.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.385
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T
HACK!

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT, THAT'S THE
ORIGINAL PROBLEM.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.921 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T PAY THEM FOR
HACKING.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.523
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YES, HE DIDN'T PAY
THEM FOR HACKING.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:54.393
AND I HOPE HE'S NOT PAYING YOU
FOR LAWYERING, EITHER.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:59.031 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HOLD ON A SECOND --

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.866
BESIDES, DO WE KNOW HE DIDN'T DO
THE HACK?

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:01.801
DO WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE
HACKER?

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.869 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; IT ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY
SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:06.005 size:78% position:39%
400 POUNDS, OKAY?

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.207
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, SO HE COULD'VE
DONE IT.

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S POSSIBLE.

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:13.512 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:23.723 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT "COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME"

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:27.259
IS THE SONG OF THE SUMMER
BECAUSE WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:27.693 size:84% position:42%
IT ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.128
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE
LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL CODE

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:33.499
TRYING TO FIND COLLUSION AS A
CRIME.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:33.933 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.434
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:36.602
&gt;&gt; WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE,
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:37.236
&gt;&gt; AND COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.038
&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.440
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WOW, THEY ARE REALLY
MOVING THE GOALPOSTS ON THIS.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.543 size:88% position:56%
FIRST, IT WAS "RUSSIA DIDN'T
INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION."

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.045 align:end position:100%
THEN IT WAS "OKAY, THEY DID, BUT
NOBODY ON THE TRUMP TEAM MET

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
WITH THEM."

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.081
THEN IT WAS, "OKAY, THEY DID,
BUT IT WAS JUST ABOUT

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.549 align:start size:88% position:13%
ADOPTIONS."

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.418
THEN IT WAS "OKAY, THEY OFFERED
US DIRT ON HILLARY, BUT THERE

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.420 size:81% position:41%
WAS NO COLLUSION."

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.722
AND NOW WE'RE AT "COLLUSION IS
NOT A CRIME."

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.057 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.559
"OKAY, COLLUSION'S A CRIME, BUT
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CRIME."

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:06.098
AND THEN IT'LL BE, "SINCE WHEN
ARE CRIMES ILLEGAL?"

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:12.638
( LAUGHTER )
"IF CRIMES ARE ILLEGAL, TAKE ME

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:13.239 align:start size:88% position:13%
AWAY."

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.007 align:start size:88% position:13%
OH, OKAY!

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.143 align:start size:88% position:13%
( PIANO RIFF )
( APPLAUSE )

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:21.547
SO, WE KNEW ABOUT THE MEETING AT
TRUMP TOWER WITH DON, JR AND THE

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.517
RUSSIANS, AND THE MEETING COHEN
CLAIMS TOOK PLACE WHERE DON, JR

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.788
GOT HIS DAD'S APPROVAL FOR THE
RUSSIA MEETING.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.489
BUT TODAY, RUDY ACCIDENTALLY
REVEALED A THIRD MEETING WE'VE

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:33.926
NEVER HEARD ABOUT BEFORE.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:36.996
&gt;&gt; COHEN ALSO NOW SAYS THAT-- HE
SAYS TOO MUCH-- THAT TWO DAYS

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.398
BEFORE HE WAS PARTICIPATING IN A
MEETING WITH ROUGHLY THE SAME

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.734
GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT NOT THE
PRESIDENT, DEFINITELY NOT THE

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.170
PRESIDENT-- IN WHICH THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.438
THE MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.673 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: SO ACCORDING TO
GIULIANI, MICHAEL COHEN SAYS

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:51.143
THAT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE TRUMP
TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIANS,

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.346
THERE WAS A STRATEGY MEETING,
WHICH THEY PROBABLY SHOULD'VE

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:59.819 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAD BEFORE THEY HIRED RUDY
GIULIANI.

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.921
BECAUSE, THERE'S NO INDICATION
THIS PLANNING MEETING WAS PUBLIC

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:09.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
KNOWLEDGE BEFORE GIULIANI
BROUGHT IT UP ON-AIR.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:16.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN OTHER WORDS -- SURPRISE!

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.070
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S BRINGING
SOMETHING UP JUST TO TELL YOU

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.006
HIS CLIENT ISN'T GUILTY OF IT.

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:21.907
( LAUGHTER )
"THAT BODY THAT NO ONE'S FOUND

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:22.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
IN THE CREEK?

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:27.313
THE PRESIDENT DEFINITELY DIDN'T
PUT IT THERE."

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.949
HE'S JUST GIVING AWAY DAMAGING
INFORMATION!

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.418 size:88% position:56%
HE'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST
LAWYER EVER TO HAVE TO TREAT

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.987
HIMSELF AS A HOSTILE WITNESS.

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:40.960
NOW, RUDY SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT
HE HAD MADE A LEGAL

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.497
OOPS-A-COLLUSION, SO HE WENT ON
FOX NEWS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN...

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:46.198 align:start size:88% position:13%
SOMETHING.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.268
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE
PRESIDENT WASN'T AT THE MEETING?

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:52.238
I UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO MEETINGS
THAT YOU JUST SET OUT THERE, BUT

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:56.876
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE
SAYING.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:57.676
WHO ASKED IF HE WAS THERE?

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.578
NO ONE ASKED IF HE WAS THERE.

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:03.349
&gt;&gt; COHEN IS ALLEGING THE MEETING
TOOK PLACE AND WE ARE MAKING IT

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.084
CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT
AT THAT MEETING.

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.952 size:78% position:39%
NEVER TOOK PLACE.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.255 align:start size:88% position:13%
(CROSSTALK)
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:09.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:11.157
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: SO THE PRESIDENT WAS
NOT AT THE MEETING THAT DIDN'T

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:14.727 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAPPEN.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.061
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH MEANS IT HAPPENED AND HE

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.763 size:84% position:42%
CALLED THE MEETING.

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.265
( LAUGHTER )
BUT WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:19.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT?

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:23.836
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD YOU SAY TODAY WAS
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT AT THAT

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.038 align:start size:88% position:13%
MEETING.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.974
THAT ACTUALLY TAKES ON A
QUESTION THAT HAS NOT BEEN ASKED

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:29.608 size:81% position:41%
OR EVEN SUGGESTED.

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:32.111
SO WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.514 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO
DIFFERENT MEETINGS.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.583
THERE WAS ANOTHER MEETING THAT
HAS BEEN LEAKED THAT HASN'T BEEN

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:40.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
PUBLIC YET.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.053
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: I THINK I FOUND THE

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
LEAKER!
