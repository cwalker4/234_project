00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.230
Jabba the Hutt was one of the most powerful
and infamous crime lords in the entire galaxy.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.820
But how did such a fat, slow, and sloppy creature
gain so much power?

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.730
Well, Jabba himself gained most of his power
from his family, by proving to them that he

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.350
was intelligent and vicious enough to run
the family’s crime business, and by also

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.840
murdering any potential rivals that could
have taken the throne from him.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.689
So, the question now is, how did the Hutts
in general get so much power to begin with

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.689
then?

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.300
This answer can be found by going back to
the Hutt’s origins and their first expeditions

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.690
onto other worlds over 25,000 years before
the clone wars.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
Initially, the Hutts’ homeworld was Varl,
which was under the rule of the Rakata and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.160
their galactic empire known as the Infinite
Empire.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.649
Eventually, the Infinite Empire fell apart,
and some of their technology fell into the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.149
hands of the primitive Hutts.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.379
It’s believed that the Hutts used this Rakata
technology to develop their own ships, allowing

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.269
for interstellar travel.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.000
Once the Hutts achieved interstellar travel,
they began to conquer and enslave neighboring

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.500
worlds, which usually contained only primitive
species.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.680
Although their superior technology allowed
them to conquer these worlds quickly and easily,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.860
the Hutts themselves were actually pretty
formidable when it came to fighting.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.500
Despite looking like overweight slugs, they
were pretty strong with the amount of muscle

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.969
they contained, with even those that wanted
to, could train themselves into becoming pretty

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.200
quick warriors, transforming their fat into
muscle, allowing them to move fast despite

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.850
their large size.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.610
Sort of like bears.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.619
Their skin was very resistant to many harmful
elements, like poisonous gas and disease.The

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.299
skin could also resist light blaster bolts
and regenerate in some cases.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.850
Just to illustrate how the Hutts fought without
blasters, was that they usually would thrust

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.070
themselves at their enemies and just straight
up eat them, swallowing them up entirely and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.219
literally suffocating them to death within
their own bodies.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.960
So even without weapons, trained Hutts could
easily kill you if you underestimated them.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.930
And the Hutts were brutal in their early conquest
campaigns, driving some species to complete

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.930
extinction.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.090
They eventually started to use a slave army
to fight most of their wars.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.700
Obtaining millions of slaves and countless
resources, allowed the Hutts to create the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.069
Hutt Empire, which composed much of the Outer
Rim.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.500
Unlike many of the other major empires and
governments emerging around this time frame,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.290
the Hutt Empire mainly focused on control
of commerce rather than building up its military

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.680
or expanding its political influence.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
This resulted in them becoming very wealthy.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.409
The Hutt Empire eventually crumbled after
it experienced a massive civil war, leaving

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.280
the Hutt homeworld Varl completely destroyed
and lifeless.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.970
This civil war transformed the Hutt Empire
into the Hutt Space, and the planet Nal Hutta

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.620
later became the new Hutt homeworld.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.720
The Hutt Ruling council was formed, with the
purpose of preventing another civil war from

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.799
happening among the Hutt Clans.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.910
The Hutt Ruling council settled disputes among
rival Hutt Clans by playing a neutral role,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.580
and by encouraging cooperation rather than
rivalry.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.090
Despite the collapse of the Hutt Empire, most
of the ruling Hutts maintained their immense

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.060
wealth, leading to many to invest their fortunes
into creating underworld criminal empires.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.940
With their wealth, the Hutts were able to
purchase countless mercenaries and thugs to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.959
enforce and manage their rule over their respective
territories.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.540
The Hutts created a network among each other,
and protected each other in a sense, in that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.880
if you were to kill one Hutt, you were to
become an enemy of all other Hutts.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.099
So even if you were able to kill one Hutt
crimelord, you would probably be dead by the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.790
time you even attempt to kill another one,
as every other Hutt crime lord would send

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.629
their menerancies after you.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.860
And this also applied to other Hutts, who
were caught killing or attempting to kill

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.390
their rivals.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.470
We should note that Hutts on average live
over 1,000 years.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.750
Living for such a long time allowed the Hutts
to not only become very intelligent and knowledgeable

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.159
of galactic affairs, but it also allowed them
to make connections with other criminal syndicates

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.750
and contacts, boosting their influence in
the criminal world and branding their name

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.680
as something to be feared.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.640
They also negotiated deals with other neighboring
galactic governments, forging alliances and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.930
trading deals that benefited both parties,
giving no logical reason for anyone to invade

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.959
them.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.470
So for example, even though the Galactic Empire
could have easily killed all the Hutts and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.860
wiped out their entire criminal empire, they
didn’t really have a reason to.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.530
Doing so would have just been a waste of time
and resources, as the Hutts pretty much already

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.870
bent the knee to the empire and established
trading deals which benefitted the Empire

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.240
economically.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.139
So the empire invading Hutt space would have
done more harm than good for them.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.090
In other words, the Hutt’s knew their place
and understood that if they were to expand

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.190
onto the Mid and Inner rims of the galaxy,
that they would be crushed with ease.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.460
In Hutt culture, being as fat as possible
was viewed as a good thing, as it showed that

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.370
you were powerful and wealthy.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.960
This extra weight showed that the Hutt was
so powerful that he didn’t need to do anything

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.300
himself, but command his servants to do his
bidding.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.340
And although it may be easy to kill an overweight
Hutt in a one on one fight, the real problem

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.000
was not the Hutt himself, but the army of
mercenaries that stood between you and him.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.340
And getting to a Hutt was very difficult,
as they almost always just sat on their thrones

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.850
in the center of their criminal empire, being
surrounded by hordes of guards and traps.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.370
They maybe would leave from within their palace
or fortress once or twice a year at most.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.650
So Jabba’s power mainly came from his species
and family’s past, in which they accumulated

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.100
so much wealth and influence within a small,
undeveloped region, that they were able to

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:52.630
basically rule everything without any real
opposition within their corner of the galaxy.
