00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:07.424
â™ª

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.628
&gt;&gt; IF PEOPLE PAY THEIR FAIR

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.329
SHARE, IF CORPORATIONS AND

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.864
THE ULTRA WEALTHY, IF WE

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:19.236
RATE TO 28%, IF WE DO THOSE

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:20.504
TWO THINGS AND ALSO CLOSE

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.573
SOME OF THOSE LOOPHOLES,

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:23.174
THAT'S $2 TRILLION RIGHT

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:23.474
THERE.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.775
IF WE IMPLEMENT THE CARBON

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.678
TAX THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.180
AMOUNT OF THE LARGE AMOUNT

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:30.915
OF REVENUE THAT WE CAN HAVE.

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:32.216
AND THEN THE LAST KEY, WHICH

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:34.785
IS EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:36.921
IMPORTANT IS

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:37.421
REPRIORITYIZATION.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:38.956
JUST LAST YEAR WE GAVE THE

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:41.425
MILITARY A $700 BILLION

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:42.293
BUDGET INCREASE, WHICH THEY

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:45.262
DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR.

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:46.230
PETE: THAT'S THE NEW

00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.264
SOCIALIST DARLING FROM THE

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:47.631
BRONX.

00:00:47.632 --> 00:00:54.271
LET'S BRING IN DAN BONGINO,

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.406
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT

00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:57.908
AND HOST OF THE DAN BONGINO

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:58.242
PODCAST.

00:00:58.243 --> 00:00:59.176
SHE SEEMS TO BE SPEAKING FOR

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:00.778
A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS EVEN

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:02.546
THOUGH SHE CALLS HERSELF A

00:01:02.547 --> 00:01:03.314
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.582
HER IDEAS ARE GUTTING THE

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:08.652
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.321
&gt;&gt; YEAH, PETE, SHE IS ALSO

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:11.155
SPEAKING FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.489
DON'T READ BOOKS.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.457
BECAUSE ALMOST NOTHING SHE

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.292
SAID IN THAT CLIP WAS

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:16.727
FACTUALLY CORRECT.

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:18.562
RONALD REAGAN, YES, RONALD

00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:19.763
REAGAN ACTUALLY RAISED A

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:23.534
REVENUE WENT DOWN.

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.703
WHEN HE CUT INCOME TAXES

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:26.604
SIGNIFICANTLY, TAX REVENUE

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:27.238
WENT UP.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.706
SO WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:30.307
ABOUT RAISING TAXES SHE HAS

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.308
VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE GOING

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:32.843
TO PRODUCE MORE REVENUE.

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:35.246
NUMBER TWO, SHE CONFUSING

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:36.614
THE ENTIRE MILITARY BUDGETS,

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:37.848
PETE, WITH THE INCREASE.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.383
THE ENTIRE MILITARY BUDGET

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:40.851
IS AROUND 700.

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:43.387
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:43.954
$700 BILLION INCREASE.

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:45.856
SHE IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:46.991
DUPED THIS, RIGHT?

00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:49.293
NOT ONLY -- BY THE WAY, THE

00:01:49.294 --> 00:01:50.861
LIES GO ON OR THE MISTRUTHS

00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:52.663
OR WHATEVER THE FOCUS GROUP

00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:53.831
TESTED WORD IS AND THEN SHE

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:55.432
SAYS AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.935
ASK FOR IT GENERAL MATTIS

00:01:57.936 --> 00:01:59.470
ACTUALLY LOBBIED FOR THE

00:01:59.471 --> 00:01:59.837
INCREASE.

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:01.272
DOLLS SHE NOT KNOW THAT DID

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:02.873
SHE JUST MAKE UP THIS WHOLE

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:03.173
THING?

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:04.408
AT WHAT POINT IS SHE GOING

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.743
TO GO ON THE AIR AND SAY

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:07.578
SOMETHING THAT IS FACTUALLY

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:07.912
CORRECT?

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:14.218
THIS IS EMBARRASSING NOW.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.387
GRIFF: DAN, LET ME JUST TELL

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:17.955
YOU, SHE CLEARLY IS POINTING

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:19.123
OUT SOME OF THE WEAKNESSES

00:02:19.124 --> 00:02:19.790
OF THE G.O.P.

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:20.591
SHE TWEETED THAT THE G.O.P.

00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:21.859
IS WEAK ON FIGHTING FOR

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.893
WORKING CLASS AMERICANS.

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:24.828
WEAK ON CRIME, WORK ON EQUAL

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:25.262
RIGHTS.

00:02:25.263 --> 00:02:26.463
WEAK ON NATIONAL SECURITY,

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.699
WEAK ON REJECTING RACISM,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.267
WEAK ON MORAL COURAGE AND

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:34.104
A PROBLEM WITH THE

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:34.772
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:35.205
WHAT SAY YOU?

00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:36.440
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.208
THAT'S JUST A GENIUS TWEET.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.143
WEAK ON BORDERS.

00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:40.611
WE WANT A BORDER WALL THAT

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:42.212
L. WILL DEFINITELY WEAKEN

00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:42.613
THE BORDER.

00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:44.148
WEAK ON FAMILY VALUES.

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.316
S THAT FASCINATING.

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:46.483
GRIFF IS, SHE JUST MAKING

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:50.754
SHE MAY NEED AN INTERVENTION

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:51.388
AFTER THIS TWEET.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.189
THAT IS INSANE.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.357
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WRITE

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:53.657
THAT?

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:54.992
SHE DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:58.162
ABOUT FAIR SHARE?

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:02.800
TAXES.

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.867
BIG FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:05.235
THINK ABOUT THAT.

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:06.603
ONE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:07.771
WORKING THEIR BUTTS OUT

00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:09.506
THERE IS PAYING 40 CENTS OF

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:10.641
EVERY DOLLAR.

00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:12.676
THE TOP 20% OF EARNERS ARE

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.714
ON TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:18.449
SINCE TRUMP IS IN OFFICE AND

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:19.783
THIS.

00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:21.218
ONE WE ARE NOT APOLOGIZING

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.286
FOR HARD WORK ANYMORE.

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.254
NUMBER TWO, WE DON'T OWE A

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:25.389
DIME MORE CAPTAIN FEDERAL

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.789
GOVERNMENT.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.357
NOT A DIME.

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:31.161
FLUSHED OUR SOCIAL SECURITY

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:31.862
DOWN THE TOILET.

00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:32.730
HAVE YOU RUINED THE

00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:33.397
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:35.199
YOU ARE DROWNING US IN

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.833
20 TRILLION IN DEBT.

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:36.900
WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU ANY

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:37.501
MORE MONEY.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:38.369
DO YOU HEAR WHAT WE ARE

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.304

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:41.238
IN RULES.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.173
NO MOSQUE, NO MORE MONEY FOR

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:43.440
YOU.

00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:44.441
HAVE YOU RUINED ALL YOUR

00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:45.376
CREDIBILITY.

00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:46.710
IT'S NOT THAT THE GOVERNMENT

00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:48.612
IS TOO BIG IT'S TOO DUMB TO

00:03:48.613 --> 00:03:49.713
SPEND OUR MONEY THE RIGHT

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:49.980
WAY.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:50.848
WE WILL KEEP IT NOW THANK

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.316
YOU VERY MUCH.

00:03:54.252 --> 00:03:55.252
IS THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY.

00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:56.553
THEY LOVE THE MESSAGE SHE IS

00:03:56.554 --> 00:03:58.222
TALKING WITH A LOT OF YOUNG

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.558
THAT?

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.459
THE BIG QUESTION AS WE ALL

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.293
ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:04.528
MORNING IS WHERE IS THAT

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:05.696
MONEY GOING TO COME FROM?

00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:07.631
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR

00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:07.898
IT?

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:08.966
CABOT PHILLIPS WHO IS ON OUR

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:09.800
SHOW ALL THE TIME HE GOES

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.735
OUT AND GETS AN IDEA OF HOW

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:13.270
PEOPLE ARE THINKING IN THIS

00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:13.604
COUNTRY.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:14.571
HE WENT TO COLLEGE CAMPUSES

00:04:14.572 --> 00:04:18.776
AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THESE

00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:19.143
POLICIES.

00:04:23.882 --> 00:04:25.682
ABOUT HOW GOING TO PAY FOR

00:04:25.683 --> 00:04:25.983
THIS.

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:27.551
&gt;&gt; HER PLATFORM INCLUDES

00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:30.821
FREE HEALTHCARE, FREE

00:04:30.822 --> 00:04:32.189
TUITION, LIVING MINIMUM WAGE

00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:34.892
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE

00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:36.226
PROVIDING FOR PEOPLE.

00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:36.693
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:37.494
&gt;&gt; 100 PERCENT.

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:38.429
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.563
SHOULD HAVE FREE EDUCATION

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:41.698
FOR THOSE?

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.800
&gt;&gt; OH, GOD.

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:44.268
I MEAN,.

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:44.868
&gt;&gt; US.

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:45.936
&gt;&gt; US, I GUESS.

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:47.738
&gt;&gt; WHO, IN YOUR MIND SHOULD

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.672
PAY FOR ALL OF THE FREE

00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:54.545
IT.

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:55.913
&gt;&gt; BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS

00:04:55.914 --> 00:04:56.513
FUNDED BY TAXES.

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:01.885
&gt;&gt; THAT LAST ANSWER WAS EPIC

00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:03.754
BECAUSE IT SUMS UP THE

00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:04.721
ENTIRE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:06.123
HOW FAR ARE WE GOING TO PAY

00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:06.490
FOR IT?

00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.624
BY TAXES BUT THEN THE

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:08.592
GOVERNMENT CAN PAY FOR THE

00:05:08.593 --> 00:05:10.160
REST AS IF THE GOVERNMENT

00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:11.295
HAS LIKE A MONEY FAIRY.

00:05:11.296 --> 00:05:12.796
LIKE THERE IS A MONEY FAIRY

00:05:12.797 --> 00:05:14.865
THAT SPRINKLES MONEY ALL

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:15.199
AROUND.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIKE THE

00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:18.368
BLACK HOLE OF

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:19.670
INTELLECTUALISM THE CURRENT

00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:20.904
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT LIVES

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:21.171
IN?

00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:21.839
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.741
IT REMINDS ME OF A MELTON

00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:26.510
FREIDMAN ANALOGY WHERE HE

00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:29.213
SAID THE GREAT MYTH OF

00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:30.147
PROGRESSIVISM YOU THINK YOUR

00:05:30.148 --> 00:05:31.315
NEIGHBOR IS PAYING FOR IT

00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:32.549
BUT YOUR NEIGHBOR SAYING THE

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.450
SAME THING.

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:35.152
THEY THINK YOU ARE PAYING

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:36.320
FOR IT THEY REALLY BELIEVE

00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.421
THERE IS A MONEY FAIRY OUT

00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:41.658
DOING THE HARD WORK.

00:05:45.163 --> 00:05:45.729
NICE JOB.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.463
I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE.

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:47.764
SHE IS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.

00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:48.866
SHE KNOWS VERY LITTLE ABOUT

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:49.967
WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:50.934
IF SHE IS GOING TO BE THE

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:51.935
FUTURE OF THE PARTY, SHE

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.447

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:10.521
