00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.103
WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO THE LATE
SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.104 align:start size:88% position:13%
COLBERT.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:09.743 size:88% position:44%
YOU KNOW, THANK YOU.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT
BECAUSE I NEED IT.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:18.985
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT TIME
HEALS ALL WOUNDS AND THEY ARE

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:19.619 align:start size:88% position:13%
WRONG.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.455
(LAUGHTER)
TIME CAN ALSO FESTER ALL WOUNDS.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.259
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO START
LOPPING STUFF OFF BEFORE IT

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.893 align:start size:88% position:13%
SPREADS.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:30.263
AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK IT'S
TIME TO REACH FOR THE BONE SAW

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.133
BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO STILL
BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP AT THIS

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.604
POINT IS GANGRENE ON THE BODY
POLITIC.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:42.542 align:start size:88% position:13%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOT TO GO, GOT TO GO FOR THE

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.545
REST OF THED ABOUTEE BUT DON'T
GIVE ME THE SAW BECAUSE I'M

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.479
FEELING A LITTLE SHAKY.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.385 size:88% position:56%
I'M ABOUT AS SHAKY AS I HAVE
FELT SINCE THE NIGHT HE WON.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.588
BACK THEN MY BIGGEST FEAR IS WE
HAD ELECTED AN ASSET OF THE

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.258 align:start size:88% position:13%
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD
SELL OUT AMERICA AT EVERY

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.761
OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SAVE HIS OWN
HIDE.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.431
MY BIGGEST FEAR NOW IS THAT I
WAS RIGHT.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
A LOT OF PEOPLE-- A LOT OF
PEOPLE--

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start size:88% position:13%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:20.547
UPSET SINCE HELSINKI WHERE
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT PUT AMERICA

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:20.747 align:start size:88% position:13%
FIRST.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.383 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE DID NOT SAY HEY, PUTIN, I
KNOW YOU MESSED WITH OUR

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.953
ELECTION AND IF YOU DO IT AGAIN
WE'RE GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:30.623
INSTEAD DONALD TRUMP BLAMED
AMERICA AND SUCKED UP TO PUTIN.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.760
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE CAME TO ME, DAN COATES
CAME TO ME AND SOME OTHERS.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEY SAID THEY THINK IT'S
RUSSIA.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.667
I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN, HE JUST
SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:45.305
I WILL SAY, THIS I DON'T SEE ANY
REASON WHY IT WOULD BE.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.773
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE
ARE UPSET.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.009
THAT'S LIKE PAUL REVERE SAYING
THE BRITISH ARE "COME FROM

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.811
AWAYING," THE BRITISH ARE
COMING, THIS WAY, BRITISH,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:02:04.991
FOLLOW ME, WE'LL GET THEM WHILE
THEY'RE SLEEPING, P-WE, P-WPE-W.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start size:88% position:13%
PE-W.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.131
AND AFTER GETTING CAUGHT
PUBLICLY BETRAYING THE COUNTRY

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:16.002
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF, YESTERDAY
DONALD TRUMP KUNNINGLY FIXED IT.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:22.208
&gt;&gt; THE KEY SENTENCE IN MY
REMARKS, I SAID THE WORD "WOULD"

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:22.942 size:88% position:44%
INSTEAD OF WOULDN'T.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:26.746
THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN I
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:31.151
WOULDN'T-- OR WHY IT WOULDN'T BE
RUSSIA.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.453 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ALL GOOD.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:41.828
I SEE NO REASON WHY YOU WOULD BE
A TRAITOR, I'M SORRY, I MEANT

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:42.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
WOULDN'T.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.963
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND REMEMBER CAN'T REMEMBER, NOW

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.565 size:78% position:39%
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:50.837 size:78% position:39%
ANYWAY, FIXED IT.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.274 align:end position:100%
BUT IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS
BECAUSE WE'RE NOTHING IF NOT

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.711 align:start size:88% position:13%
FAIR AT THE LATE SHOW--
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.514 align:end position:100%
AND I'M BLG TOLD WE'RE NOTHING,
ANYWAY, HERE'S WHAT IT WOULD

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:05.818
HAVE SOUNDED LIKE IF HE HAD SAID
WHAT HE CLAIMED HE MEANT.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.489 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; MY PEOPLE CAME TO ME, DAN
COATES CAME TO ME AND SOME

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:09.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
OTHERS.

THEY SAID THEY THINK IT'S
RUSSIA.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.994
I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.130
HE JUST SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.269
I WILL SAY, THIS I DON'T SEE ANY
REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T BE.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.438 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:31.945 size:75% position:38%
THAT FIXESxD IT.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.948
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; SMOOTH, THAT FIXES THE ONLY

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:38.117 size:88% position:56%
WORD HE CLAIMS HE GOT WRONG.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'M JUST CURIOUS, DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:46.626
&gt;&gt; HAVE I GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE BUT, I WILL

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:50.663
TELL THAT YOU PRESIDENT PUTIN
WAS EXTREMELY STRONG AND

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:55.201 align:end position:100%
POWERFUL IN HIS DENIAL TODAY AND
WHAT HE DID IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:55.568 align:start size:88% position:13%
OFFER.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.838
&gt;&gt; THAT IS PRETTY TERRIBLE.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE HE
MEANT TO SAY THIS.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.578
&gt;&gt; I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:11.117 align:start size:88% position:13%

PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.852
EXTREMELY-- WRONG AND BAD.

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.722
&gt;&gt; IN HIS DENIAL TODAY AND WHAT
HE DID WAS.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.624 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; GROUNDS FOR WAR.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.393
&gt;&gt; TRUMP DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES OF THE

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:22.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
POLITICAL SPECTRUM ARE
HORRIFIED.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:28.635
THIS MORNING HE TWEETED, SO MANY
PEOPLE AT THE HIGHER END OF

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:34.140
INTELLIGENCE LOVED MY PRESS
CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE IN

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.741 align:start size:88% position:13%
HELSINKI.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.544 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT I BELIEVE, I'M SURE THE
HIGHEST ENDS OF RUSSIAN

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:44.717
INTELLIGENCE LOVED IT.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:48.755
ABSOLUTELY, I GOT TO SAY, THEY
LOVED IT.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:55.461
I GREAT REVIEWS FROM THE BORE IS
AND NATASHA, KERI RUSSELL, EVEN

00:04:55.461 --> 00:05:00.266

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
LOVED IT.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:05.972
HE FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH WHILE
THE NATO MEETING IN BRUSSELS WAS

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.542
AN ACKNOWLEDGED TRIUMPH WITH
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE BEING

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:14.614
PUT UP BY MEMBERS OF COUNTRIES
AT A FASTER PACE, THE MEETING

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:20.219
WITH RUSSIA MAY PROVE TO BE IN
THE LONG RUN AN EVEN GREATER

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
SUCCESS.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:25.024
YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE
THE NATO MEETING AS A TRIUMPH?

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:25.558 align:start size:88% position:13%
NATO.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:31.331
(LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN'T DECLARE YOUR DISASTERS

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
SUCCESS
SUCCESSES.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.802
EVEN MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S
ADMINISTRATION DON'T THINK THIS

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:38.037
VERBAL TURD IS GOING TO FLUSH.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:41.074 size:88% position:56%
ONE OFFICIAL WARNED, PEOPLE
AREN'T GOING TO FORGET ABOUT

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:41.574 align:start size:88% position:13%
THIS.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:46.913
IT WILL BE IN THE TOP THREE
WORST MOMENTS OF HIS PRESIDENCY.

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.614 align:start size:88% position:13%
THREE?

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:53.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER)
THREE?

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:59.892 align:start size:88% position:13%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THREE.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.495
HOW-- HOW WOULD YOU EVEN CHOOSE?

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.197
(LAUGHTER)
I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE HOLDING IT

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.133
TO A BILLBOARD TOP 100.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:11.637
AND COMING IN AT NUMBER 47 BEV'S
GOT TRUMP THINKS FREDERICK

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:12.572
DOUGLASS IS STILL ALIVE.

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:17.510
AND THIS ONE, THIS ONE IS
DEDICATED TO LITTLE DYLAN

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
PICKLE.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO--
(LAUGHTER)

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.683
TRUMP'S WALK-BACK YESTERDAY WAS
MORE OF A SHAMBLE.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:27.120
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME
KIND OF IDIOT TO BUY IT JIMMY,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.055 size:75% position:38%
ROLL THE IDIOTS.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:32.592
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YESTERDAY WAS A
STEP FORWARD AND I'M GLAD THAT

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:33.493 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT OCCURRED.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:37.130
&gt;&gt; I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT
RETRACTED OR SORT OF CORRECTED

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
HIS STATEMENT.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.699
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GLAD HE CLARIFIED
IT.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE CLEANED IT UP
TODAY.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:46.105
&gt;&gt; I TAKE HIM AT HIS BOARD SNS
WHICH WORDS?

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.909
, WOULD OR WOULDN'T BECAUSE THE
PRESIDENT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE THE

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.244
PRESIDENT AT HIS WORD.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.914
BUT THERE IS A PERFECTLY
REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.383
REPUBLICAN LEADERS WON'T STICK
UP FOR DEMOCRACY.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEY'RE SCARED.

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:02.288
ACCORDING TO ONE GOP STRATEGIST,
I'M FURIOUS REPUBLICANS ARE

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.924 align:start size:88% position:13%
COULD WARDLY ABOUT TRUMP BUT
HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY IN

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.994
PRIVATE, TRUMP IS A DISGRACE, I
GIVE FIERY PRESS CONFERENCE

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.195
TOMORROW SAYING THAT.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.596 size:75% position:38%
NOTHING CHANGES.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:14.634
TRUMP REMAINS NUTS AND REMAINS
PRESIDENT, A NUT BEATS ME IN THE

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:15.201 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEXT PRIMARY.

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.172
SO HOW DOES MY POLITICAL SUICIDE
HELP?

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:23.543
IT REMINDED ME OF THE FAMOUS
MOVING SPEECH FROM BRAVEHEART,

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:27.647
THEY MAY TAKE OUR LIVES
BUT-- WAIT, THEY MAY TAKE OUR

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:28.014 align:start size:88% position:13%
LIVES?

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:29.282
THEN HOW DOES THAT HELP ANYBODY?

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.485 size:78% position:39%
LET'S BE ENGLISH.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER)
CHEERSZ

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:39.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR, NO

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.061
NOWHERE NEAR SCOTTISH.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.032
ONE POLITICAL ANALYST HAS A GRIM
PREDINGS FOR HOW THIS WILL ALL

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
END UP.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.335
MOST REPUBLICAN MEMBERS ARE
WILLING TO ADMIT THE PRESIDENT

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:53.506
DOESN'T OPERATE IN REALITY BUT
NO, WE'RE DOOMED IN THEIR NEXT

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.108
PRIMARY IF THEY SAY SO PUBLICLY.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:08:00.046
AS LONG AS THAT IS TRUE, WE'RE
HEADED FOR A WORLD WITH ZERO

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.647
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS ADORABLE.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:05.751
BUT HE THINKS WE'RE HEADED FOR
ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.019
WHAT OTHER HOT PREDICTIONS YOU
GOT.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:11.390
YOU THINK THE SMARTPHONES ARE
TBING TO CATCH ON?

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT ONE--
(LAUGHTER)

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:22.335
I'M HEARING GREAT THINGS ABOUT
PENCIL INBUT-- THANK YOU.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.303
PENICILLIN FANS HERE TONIGHT.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:28.107
BUT ONE REPUBLICAN DID QUESTION
TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:33.746
ILLINOIS CONGRESSMAN AND THE
NEXT BACHELOR ADAM KINZINGER.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.314
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.751 align:start size:88% position:13%
PUTIN, THAT IS OKAY AS TWO
LEADERS OF BIG COUNTRY.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:43.489 align:start size:88% position:13%
BUT TO HAVE A FRIENDSHIP, IS
DIFFERENT, I QUAIT THE

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:46.292
RELATIONSHIP TO LIKE A PRISON
GUARD FOR JEFFREY DAHMER, YOU

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.862
CAN HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH
JEFF YEE DAHMER AS HIS PRISON

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:54.600
GUARD BUT DON'T BE HIS FRIEND
BECAUSE HE'S A REALLY BAD GUY.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.967 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:59.071
TRUE, BUT IN THIS ANALOGY, TRUMP
DOESN'T WANT TO BE JEFFREY

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.006
DAHMER'S PRISON GUARD.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:05.144
