00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.000
It's an adrenaline rush.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.860
Because every day they're out there
trying to outsmart you, right?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.200
And when you catch them, it's like
yeah, that was a good day.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.260
They don't have nowhere to go.
Anywhere they can hide, they'll hide.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.920
But, they'll find them eventually, 
they'll find them.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.000
Here, because this is the border,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.080
there's always going to be illegal
crossings of some kind.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.540
How do you stop this here? 
What do you do?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.560
If you were looking for an ideal place to see the chaotic

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.020
and sometimes heartbreaking reality
of the U.S.-Mexico border,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.100
You'd want to ride along with the U.S. Border Patrol
 since they are the ones who are

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
paid to keep people and dope from
getting across it. And you'd want to do

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.540
it in Texas because Texas has far more
border land than any other state.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.260
And then you can make your way down to the Rio
Grande valley in the southern tip of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
Texas where there are more people
apprehended and more pounds of dope

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
seized than in any other area along the
texas-Mexico border.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.500
In the spring of 2016 The Texas Tribune went 
to the valley, to Roma, Texas

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.380
and its surroundings in rural Starr County

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.480
and found what looked and
felt like a smuggler's paradise

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.451
There are no man-made physical barriers
to speak of here.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
No big walls or fences. There are plenty
of river islands to stash humans and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.110
drugs. Lots of places to hide.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.810
plus they don't keep boats in the water
around the clock here.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.150
And just like they told us once those
 border patrol boats come off the river,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.730
the cat and mouse game begins. All you
have to do is listen to their radios

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.760
And it's like this every day, you know, so, it's busy.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.600
Our chief guide was Border
Patrol agent, José Perales.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.850
He's a 16-year veteran of the agency, a
lifer.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.450
You know that he sort of lives to show
the outside world what's happening down

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.130
here and you know why he picked Roma
Texas to do the show

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.760
The river is very close to Roma. So they
can actually just run like two blocks

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.580
and they're on 83.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
We have a lot of traffic that runs into
the Dollar General.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.980
See where the brush start right there?
That's the drop down to the river.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.400
So they run, how long will it take you to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.890
run from there to to those stores and
get lost in the public?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.200
It's maybe, what, a 15 second, 10 to 15
second run to the top?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.680
You come out here and you end up in vehicle pursuits.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.170
There's days that you get assaulted, you get
into fights.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.730
You go and you're chasing people, you're
running you trip over, you can easily fall.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.229
This is the area that they work, and they
know this area very well. They know

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.199
the terrain better than we do sometimes.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.400
The cartels have to move the
people and their narcotics, right?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.920
They have to come up with tactics and we
have to counter those tactics, and it's

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.770
it's a cat-and-mouse game all the time.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.980
It's always strategizing, always like how
we gonna do this? How we gonna catch

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.040
these guys? So sometimes you don't see
them but you know like

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.760
they gotta be around here.
But if you really slow down

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.910
you can actually, sometimes you can
even smell them.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.720
You can just smell somebody else's
sweat, right? And a lot of times these

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.120
people have been in stash houses on the
south side for days.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.740
So hence, they haven't taken a shower for
 days, so you can actually smell them.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.200
For the people who live along
the river's edge in Roma, dealing with

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.440
the constant flow of undocumented
immigrants has become a way of life.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.320
A while ago, we just saw two,  like five minutes ago before you'll got here,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.240
there was two running right over there
straight to the store.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.100
Activity everywhere. You can see it everywhere.
And Rio Grande's the same thing,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.520
You see people getting caught
all the side of the road.

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.770
They come in through all the sides of
the river. From here to Rio,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.290
you willl see them everywhere.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.580
Roma sits right across the river from
Ciudad Miguel Alemán.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.530
Where in recent years two rival mafias, The Gulf
Cartel and The Zetas, have fought

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.370
pitched battles for control of this
lucrative smuggling corridor for access

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.099
to the U.S. Drug and labor markets.

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.020
This is the other half of that smuggling
paradise we found in Roma. Only paradise

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.909
isn't a word you find yourself using in
the same sentence with Miguel Alemán or

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.520
the state it sits in, Tamaulipas.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.800
You can still see the scars of cartel
warfare, which can flare at any moment

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.660
and locals say the real bosses in Miguel Alemán
 are the drug lords, not the government.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.300
Only a river divides us from
Miguel Alemán, but Roma might as well be

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.060
on a different planet.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.760
It's easy to fear the border but then
you run across all these kids.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.000
Kids traveling alone. Kids fleeing lives of desperation.
Kids who are coming here to join their

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.800
undocumented parents.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.950
That's where the big numbers are down
here, it's the kids and the family units,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.180
as they're called. They are the ones who
are pushing up the apprehension figures

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.060
and they don't run they turn themselves in.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.480
They cross them, and then they tell them,
okay, just follow the road

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.000
all the way to the top.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.760
So here comes the family units just walking the road

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.050
Typically what we hear, you know, they're
fleeing away from violence or a certain

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.630
gang or it's mainly gangs that thy're fleeing from. 
So I get why they're leaving.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.230
I mean and we all understand it, but
you know at the end the day we still have

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.520
a job to do, you know, and all of them can
apply for asylum.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.500
It will be up to the immigration
judge to decide you know their fate know

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.320
where yes they stay or they have a
legitimate reason or they don't.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.880
So we don't have a say-so in that. 
Our job is to catch them, and

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.390
process them, and set them up to see
an immigration judge. And that's to the

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.510
extent, you know, that we're getting involved.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.820
We met a 14 year old girl from Guatemala.
Her name was alejandra. She traveled here

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.700
with her brother and cousin. They were forced to 
cross the river alone when their smuggler

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.280
abandoned them on the Mexican side.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.960
My cousin lives over there. This is the old
estate home my grandma used to live in there.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.980
Ruperto Escobar has been ranching along the Rio
Grande his whole life, just like his

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.240
parents and their ancestors, all the way
back to the mid-seventeen hundreds.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.170
Smugglers have used his land for years
to move people and product.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.870
he doesn't see that changing anytime
soon.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:18.050
It's mainly the disturbances at night, early hours
in the morning, that's when they do their stuff.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.200
Waking you up because you you hear the
sounds or the dogs are constantly

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.850
barking so you get up to see what's
going on, you know? I stopped fixing gates.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.750
I stop putting them up. I don't close
those main gates, as you come in,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.620
I don't close them. What for? They ram into them.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.240
So what do you do? Do I run to the police and tell them, "Hey,  go catch them, they're there."

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.760
Then what happens? What do you think will 
happen next?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.420
They're going to know who did it. And I
wouldn't put it past them to go in and

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.590
and do some harm to me the following day
or or next week or the following week so

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.670
we just, you know what? Let them be.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.400
We had to briefly stop the interview
with him while two "coyotes," slang for

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.120
smugglers, moved a load of undocumented
Mexican workers over his ranch.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.990
Mira. See that?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.940
You just have to swallow your pride sort of.
And say, okay, well you know what?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:49.180
Just don't bother us, just leave us alone,
and we'll leave you alone.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.080
Because at that moment they're going
to come and catch them.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.519
But then I have to live here the rest of
my life like my ancestors lived here all

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.420
their lives. Police are not going to come and stay
with me and take care of me after

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.080
I do something like that. And it's not just me. 
I mean, it happens to all of us

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.320
up and down the border here.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:18.220
It sounds not too brave but what do you do? 
You've got to survive.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.940
Oh
