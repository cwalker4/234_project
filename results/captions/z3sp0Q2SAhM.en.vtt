00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.749
At the start of Game of Thrones, we meet the
Stark family. There’s Ned, Catelyn, Robb

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:11.780
– and they all die. But we still got Sansa,
Arya, Bran, Rickon's alive in the books, and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.930
there's Jon, who’s secretly half-Targaryen,
at least in the show . We tend to see the

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.960
Starks as the good guys, but the Stark family
aren’t the Brady bunch – in Chapter 1,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.199
Ned beheads a guy, and makes his sons watch.
And the kids all get pets from a giant dead

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.000
wolf. It’s clear from the start that the
Starks are connected to harsh ancient customs

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.160
and mysterious magic . Bran becomes a psychic
tree god, Arya a Faceless assassin, and Jon

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.890
an undead prophetic warrior-king. The blood
of House Stark is tied to the ancient secrets

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.640
of Winterfell and the Wall, the Night’s
King and white walkers – which might hint

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.559
at the ending of Game of Thrones.
According to legend, House Stark began eight

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.930
thousand years ago – after the Long Night,
when the white walkers “came for the first

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.540
time” . The walkers were defeated by “the
last hero” with the children of the forest

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.350
, or by Azor Ahai with a flaming sword – there
are lots of different legends . But the walkers

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.710
went away, and Brandon the Builder raised
the Wall to keep them out. Brandon also built

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.770
the castle of Winterfell – and started House
Stark, who ruled as Kings of Winter for thousands

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.869
of years . Eventually, a people called the
Andals invaded Westeros from across the sea,

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.310
bringing a new religion and culture. Only
the Kings of Winter could resist them , and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.979
that’s why the north keeps the customs of
the First Men, worshiping the old gods – and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.259
remembering things that others forget . It
all ties back to the foundation of House Stark

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.090
in the fight against white walkers and winter.
The ancient words of House Stark are a warning

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.311
that “Winter is coming” . The castle of
Winterfell might be named for the place where

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:05.270
the white walkers were defeated – where
winter fell. Winterfell is built on hot springs

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.559
that keep it warm through winter . And the
crown of the Stark Kings was spiked with “iron”

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:16.549
– a metal of winter “to fight against
the cold” . In the Winterfell crypts, the

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.969
statues of dead Starks have swords of iron
– and it’s said that white walkers hate

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.650
iron . Winterfell might have magic defences
against white walkers. Cause the Wall and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.169
Storm’s End have protective spells , and
Brandon the Builder is sposed to have built

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:36.480
them both – maybe he gave Winterfell protective
spells as well. It’s said “There must

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.189
always be a Stark in Winterfell” , as though
the Starks have an ancient responsibility

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.480
to defend the north from winter and white
walkers.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.389
But the story goes deeper than that. Along
the Wall are nineteen castles, mostly abandoned

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.169
now. The oldest is the Nightfort – a dark
and “sinister” place that’s connected

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.129
to the white walkers. There are stories of
a “thing that came in the night” , that

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.870
killed people then brought them back as “shambling”
slaves , like wights. There’s a tale of

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.199
a knight with eyes like blue stars , like
a white walker. And the oldest Nightfort legend

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:20.870
tells of the Night’s King. In the TV show,
the leader of the white walkers is called

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.769
the Night King, but he seems to be a different
character to this Night’s King. Cause the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.349
Night’s King was Lord Commander of the Night’s
Watch, and he met a woman with skin cold as

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.069
ice, and eyes like blue stars – which sounds
like she was a white walker. The Night’s

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.860
King made her his queen, and gave her his
seed and his soul. Together they ruled the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.579
Nightfort, and made sacrifices to the white
walkers. Which might mean that they gave their

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.859
children to the walkers – like how the wilding
Craster sacrifices his children. The Night’s

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.569
King and Queen ruled for thirteen years, until
they were cast down by the Stark king, Brandon

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.909
the Breaker. All records of the Night’s
King were destroyed, and his name was “forbidden”

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.760
– “wiped from the memory of man” . Why
was the name of the Night’s King so important?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.070
Well, Old Nan says that the Night’s King
was the brother of Brandon the Breaker – that

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.670
the Night’s King “was a Stark” .
So did an ancient Stark marry a white walker?

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.629
We can’t totally trust these old legends
– no one really knows what happened thousands

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:34.210
of years ago . But the stories are there to
give us hints, and there was obviously some

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.410
kinda white walker action at the Nightfort.
Which might have been the plan from the beginning.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.759
Cause in Book 3 we see the Black Gate, a “secret”
“hidden” “magic gate” at the Nightfort

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.040
that lets Watchmen through the Wall. It’s
made of a living weirwood face, at the bottom

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.251
of a deep dark well. It’s super creepy,
and looks like the sorta gate you’d use

00:04:57.251 --> 00:05:02.860
if you were secretly giving babies to white
walkers. And thing is, the Black Gate is “as

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.090
old as the Wall itself” , it was built into
the Nightfort from the start – was this

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.800
place designed for sacrifice to the white
walkers? The Nightfort was the “chief seat”

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.800
of the Night’s Watch for thousands of years
, it was the first castle on the Wall , possibly

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.139
built by Brandon the Builder, founder of House
Stark. So why do its oldest legends point

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.490
to sacrifice and marriage to the white walkers?
One popular theory is that the walkers weren’t

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.870
just defeated in the Long Night – there
was actually a peace agreement. We know that

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.330
lots of wars in the north ended with the Starks
marrying a daughter of their enemy – so

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.340
maybe the Long Night ended with the Stark
Night’s King marrying a white walker. We

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.659
know that Craster makes peace with the walkers
by sacrificing his children – so maybe sacrifice

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.180
at the Nightfort was part of this white walker
peace deal. We also know that humans once

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.400
made a pact with the children of the forest
– and this was done before a grove of weirwood

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.909
trees. Maybe the weirwood Black Gate represents
a similar pact between white walkers and the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:15.150
Starks. Maybe an marriage alliance with the
white walkers is how the Starks become the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.819
Kings of Winter, and built the icy Wall. Maybe
the phrase “There must always be a Stark

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.009
in Winterfell” was part of this agreement.
This is just speculation. If there ever was

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.160
a peace with the walkers, it’s now forgotten.
But the Starks might still be connected to

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.789
the walkers by their blood – there’s a
theory that the Starks are descended from

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:44.000
the Night’s King and his icy Night’s Queen
. Game of Thrones is full of symbolic repetitions

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.310
and parallels [show Ned behead, Robb behead,
Jon behead] – it’s like poetry, it rhymes.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.300
And one of the stories that’s repeated is
of a baby boy with a secret special bloodline

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.780
being raised as a Stark at Winterfell. For
example, Jon Snow is secretly the son of Rhaegar

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.050
Targaryen, but Jon is raised as Ned Stark’s
son at Winterfell. Another example is the

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:10.550
story of Bael the Bard – where the son of
a wildling was raised as a Stark at Winterfell.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.660
And there’s a similar story with Gilly’s
baby. Remember that Gilly is one of the wives

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.780
of Craster, who gives his sons to the white
walkers. When Gilly gives birth to a son,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:27.639
she and Sam run south to save the baby – passing
through the Black Gate at the Nightfort. The

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.740
plan is to raise Gilly’s baby as Sam’s
bastard – and Jon considers raising the

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.419
boy at Winterfell . So over and over there’s
a story of a baby boy with a secret bloodline

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.789
being rescued and raised at Winterfell. Maybe
the same thing happened with a child of the

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:50.020
Night’s King. Like, we’re told that Brandon
the Breaker cast down his brother the Night’s

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.420
King. What if Brandon found one of the Night’s
King’s children at the Nightfort? Would

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.960
Brandon murder his own baby nephew, when kinslaying
is such a crime in the north ? Or would Brandon

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.300
take his brother’s baby to Winterfell and
raise him as his own – just like Ned raised

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.610
Jon, and the Starks raised Bael’s son. The
story of Bael reveals that the Starks have

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.919
wildling blood. Maybe the story of the Night’s
King reveals that the Starks have the blood

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.349
of the Night’s Queen – the blood of white
walkers.

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:24.870
We are told that the Starks are “not like
other men” – that they’re “made of

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.690
ice” , and “made for the cold” . Old
Stark kings included Brandon “Ice Eyes”

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.250
, and Edrick “Snowbeard” . They named
their sword Ice – just like white walkers

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:41.089
use swords of ice. Maybe to the ancient Kings
of Winter, the words “Winter is coming”

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:47.040
was a boast, and a threat. Cause the ancient
Starks didn’t accidentally take over the

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.160
north. They conquered it, kingdom by kingdom
– slaughtering men, stealing wives, wiping

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.370
out entire houses . These Starks were bad
guys who did “terrible things” . Maybe

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:04.149
in this brutal past the Starks embraced their
white walker blood, just as the Targaryens

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:09.260
embrace their blood of the dragon in their
conquests. There’s a great symmetry in the

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.790
Targaryens having fiery dragon blood , if
the Starks have icy white walker blood. But

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.260
being related to ice demons musta gone out
of fashion, because now the Starks seem to

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.620
wanna to deny their white walker heritage.
Like that’d be why they hide the Stark name

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.410
of the Night’s King. And these iron swords
in the crypts – we’re told that they keep

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.029
“the spirits of the dead locked [in] their
tombs” . Why do the Starks need to lock

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:41.880
away their own ancestors? Maybe cause their
ancestors are part white walker. Maybe the

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.779
Starks started using these iron swords to
lock away their icy heritage. Maybe the iron

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:52.839
in the crown of the Kings of Winter is there
to suppress the white walker in the mind of

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:58.339
each Stark. Maybe Winterfell isn’t built
just to keep walkers out – it’s built

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:03.280
to keep white walkers in.
This whole thing could be very Lovecraftian.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.949
H. P. Lovecraft was a horror writer who influenced
Game of Thrones author George Martin – there

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:14.440
are Lovecraft references all over the world
of Thrones, go watch our East video. And one

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.361
of Lovecraft’s recurring ideas is the fear
of something terrible in your ancestry. In

00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:24.790
one story, called The Shadow over Innsmouth,
the narrator finds out that he’s descended

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:30.410
from evil fish gods called Deep Ones. He tries
to resist the Deep Ones, but ends up joining

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.160
them in the sea. Maybe, similarly, the Starks
will discover to their horror they’re descended

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.589
from white walkers – but will have no choice
but to join them. Remember that Gilly’s

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:47.820
baby was meant to be sacrificed to the white
walkers – apparently to be transformed into

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.529
one. So when Gilly and Sam take the baby south
instead, the white walkers come after them

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:59.449
– to take back the baby that was promised
. Maybe that’s what’s happening with the

00:10:59.449 --> 00:11:03.970
Starks. Like, if the Starks are all descended
from a baby of the Night’s King who was

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:09.350
meant to be sacrificed, maybe the walkers
are now coming south to take back what’s

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:16.030
owed – to take the Starks as their own.
Jon Snow is set up as the guy to beat the

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.060
white walkers. But surely the story won’t
end with just like a sword fight with the

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.759
Night King. Author George Martin says that
Game of Thrones isn’t about good guys fighting

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:31.870
bad guys , it’s about conflicts within the
human heart , like love versus duty, survival

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:37.959
versus sacrifice . And that’s what Jon’s
story’s all about. He sacrifices his honour,

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:44.279
his love, his own life. Maybe now he’ll
have sacrifice himself to the white walkers.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:49.671
He is “the Prince That Was Promised” – in
more ways than one . Maybe he’ll represent

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:55.510
the Stark blood promised to the white walkers.
Jon makes peace with the wildlings. Maybe

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.019
he’ll make peace with the white walkers.
It could be another marriage pact – Jon

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:05.389
could become the new Night’s King. There
are lines in the books about Jon having armor

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:11.470
made of ice , and his skin growing pale and
cold . The tragedy here would be that Jon

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.899
has just fallen in love with Daenerys. So
again he’ll have to choose between love

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:22.500
and duty, between fire and ice – between
banging his aunt, and becoming a popsicle

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.180
king to save the world. It’s fantasy and
it’s human drama and it’s bittersweet

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:35.810
– this could be the ending of Game of Thrones.
