00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.959
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new documentary is reigniting
questions about the life and legacy of pop

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.160
icon Michael Jackson.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.730
John Yang has the story.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.110
And we want to warn you that some may find
the details disturbing.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.290
JOHN YANG: Nearly a decade after his death,
multiple Grammy winner Michael Jackson's music

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.340
and showmanship can still cast a magical spell.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.030
But questions about his private life can still
cast a dark shadow.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:41.030
In 1994, Jackson paid more than $20 million
to settle a lawsuit alleging he sexually molested

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.030
a 13-year-old boy.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.210
And, in 2005, he was acquitted on 10 counts
of child molestation, serving alcohol to a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.400
minor, conspiracy and kidnapping.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.050
Now accusations of inappropriate conduct are
back in the headlines with "Leaving Neverland"

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.990
a two-part four-hour documentary to be broadcast
Sunday and Monday on HBO.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.960
The film tells the stories of James Safechuck
and Wade Robson.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.889
Robson, a dance teacher who did choreography
for NSYNC and Britney Spears, says Jackson

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:19.219
initiated him to sex when he was 7 years old,
and the pop star was 31.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.240
He alleges the behavior continued for seven
years.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.689
WADE ROBSON, Michael Jackson Accuser: And
he started talking about how much he loves

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.170
me.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.829
What this is, is us, and how we show our love
for each other, that other people are ignorant,

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.069
and they're stupid, and they'd never understand.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:42.159
If they ever found out what they were doing
about this sexual stuff, that he and I would

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.799
be pulled apart and we would never be able
to see each other again, and that he and I

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.609
would go to jail for the rest of our lives.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.789
JOHN YANG: Safechuck, a former child actor
who appeared with Jackson in a Pepsi commercial,

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.770
says Jackson abused him over six years, beginning
when he was 10.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.182
JAMES SAFECHUCK, Michael Jackson Accuser:
Secrets will eat you up.

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:06.182
You feel so alone.

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:10.500
JOHN YANG: Their families tell how Jackson
won their trust.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.519
WOMAN: He just came across as a loving, caring,
kind soul.

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.890
It was easy to believe that he was just that.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.260
JOHN YANG: And how they feel about him now.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.540
LAURA SAFECHUCK, Wife of James Safechuck:
Michael's gone, but it doesn't change the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.560
fact that he destroyed these people, and that
the world still goes on loving him.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.090
JOHN YANG: On "CBS This Morning" this week,
Jackson's family launched a preemptive strike

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.090
against the film and the accusers.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.430
MAN: We know our brother.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.450
And Michael wouldn't do anything like that.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.710
And then he waits until after the passing
of Michael, 10 years later, just to come out

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.920
and to state his?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.130
And he's -- they're still in court with -- with
the estate, suing them for hundreds of millions

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.130
of dollars.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.579
JOHN YANG: Jackson's estate is suing HBO for
$100 million.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:58.020
It claims the film violates a non-disparagement
clause in a deal the network made in 1992

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.040
to broadcast a Jackson concert.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.650
In a statement, HBO said: "Despite the desperate
lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.140
remain the same."

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.530
To discuss the film, the director, Dan Reed,
the director, joins us now.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.690
Dan, thanks so much for your time.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.780
What was your intent?

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.450
Why did you want to tell this story?

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.170
DAN REED, Director, "Leaving Neverland": The
intent rose out of an opportunity, which was

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.220
my accidental discovery of Wade and James,
Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who I read

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.849
about as the plaintiffs in a civil suit against
the Jackson estate.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.030
So here were two young men who claimed that,
as children, they had been sexually molested

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.049
by the singer.

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.799
It seemed to me here was an opportunity to
try and find out if these guys had something

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.990
true to say, whether they were genuine.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.660
And, if they were genuine, perhaps there was
a way to finally delve a bit deeper into this

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.849
controversy that had lasted for so long.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.480
JOHN YANG: How did you determine or how did
you satisfy yourself that they were genuine

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
now?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.150
DAN REED: Well, the reason why Wade in particular,
because Wade was an adult when he testified

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.370
in Jackson's favor in 2005 during the criminal
trial, the reason why Wade changed his story

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.540
-- and that's what it looks like, and I can
understand why people query that -- that story

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.000
of Wade's awakening is the story of the film.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.600
That's -- you know, it takes four hours to
unpack that.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.610
And when you reduce it to its simplest, Wade,
as a child and as a victim of Michael Jackson,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.020
formed a deep attachment to his abuser.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.680
He fell in love with Michael, and that relationship
shaped his teenage years and his adult life,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.350
up to, you know, until his mid-20s.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.590
So he's 22.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.200
He stands up in court, and he knocks it out
of the park in defense of Michael.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.850
And he is defense witness number one, and
probably one of the important reasons why

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.010
Michael was acquitted of the child sex abuse
charges of the 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.670
So, why did he change his mind?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.010
Well, he didn't want his mentor, his -- the
man that he had been in a sexual relationship

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.660
with, his idol, the man he really admired,
he didn't want him to go to jail.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.470
And so he lied.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.670
And then it wasn't until a few years later
that he had a child of his own, he had a young

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.710
son, and he describes the moment when he looks
at his son, and he imagines Michael doing

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.150
to his son the things that Michael did to
him, to Wade, as a 7-year-old, and becomes

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.920
enraged, and can't stand the thought.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.810
And then that -- that prompts him to look
deeper into the way he thought about his own

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.810
relationship with Michael.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.260
And that's when he started beginning to consider
it as abuse, because, up to that point, it

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.640
was just like a special relationship with
Michael that had a sexual component, but was

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.420
also about a bunch of other things and was
deep emotional attachment.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.370
JOHN YANG: We mentioned the lawsuit from the
Jackson estate against HBO.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.230
The Jackson estate also complains that you
didn't go to them to get their side of the

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.050
story for any sort of response.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.520
What's your response to that?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.200
DAN REED: Well, let's think about this for
more than a second.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.160
I don't make any allegations about the Michael
Jackson estate in my film.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.170
They're barely mentioned.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.530
I don't say that they molested children.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.440
So, why would I go to them for comment?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.990
They don't know anything of any use about
what happened behind a locked bedroom door

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.740
between, let's say, Wade Robson at the age
of 7 and Michael Jackson.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.090
What the Jackson family do admit is that Michael
spent many nights, many, many nights, in bed

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.790
in the company of little boys.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.640
You know, they have never really disputed
that.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:51.050
And so -- and they have not disputed that
Wade and James had long acquaintance -- acquaintances

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.850
or friendships, if you like, with Michael.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.390
So, there are many, many facts about this
story that are easily corroborated.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.280
But the central fact is the question of what
happened behind those closed doors.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.180
That's the central question of the film.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.050
And I don't think that the family or the estate
have anything useful to say about that.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.880
And they also have a massive interest and
a big financial vested interest in trying

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
to cover it up.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.080
So, they certainly weren't credible or impartial
witnesses in the story.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.700
JOHN YANG: So much of the reason for all this
attention to the film is Michael Jackson.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.780
But, as a viewer, I found most affecting the
story of these two young men and the effect

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.610
that this had on them and their families.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.050
And I would like to play a little bit of James
Safechuck talking about the effect it had

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.150
on him as an adult.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.800
JAMES SAFECHUCK: One of the weird things is
not liking yourself and not knowing why.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:57.020
Like, I didn't know why I had these problems
or felt these ways, constant anxiety and depression,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.660
and not knowing why you are like that.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.940
JOHN YANG: Now, he could be talking about
the effects of something at the hands of a

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.080
priest, a teacher, a coach.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.250
It doesn't have to be a celebrity.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.680
Talk a little bit about that part of the film.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:24.270
DAN REED: Well, what this film is really about
is two families coming to terms with the disclosure

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.710
of a long-held and very dark secret, which
is there -- the sexual abuse of their sons

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.290
at the hands of Michael Jackson.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.560
Now, it's not about Michael, it's not about
-- it doesn't really matter that this was

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.560
a pop star.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.170
I mean, I guess of course it matters, because
this is a story that now is important and

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.070
significant because of because of Michael's
magnitude in our culture.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:50.360
But this could easily have been a story about
an uncle or a priest or any trusted figure,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.690
any figure of authority that a mother or father
might trust to spend time with their child.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.560
And that's how I want people to see this film.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.311
I think it's a -- it's a valuable document
which chronicles, over two decades, the story

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:09.560
of a family's entanglement with a predatory
pedophile.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.440
And that pedophile, as I say, could be anybody.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.240
And I think that's what I want people to take
away from this film, like, this could be anybody,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.270
and this is how it happens.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.460
They don't grab you.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.580
It's not a guy in a dirty trench coat waiting
at the school gates who bundles the child

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.380
into a van or an alley.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.120
It's your -- it's the man or the woman that
you trust with your child.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.500
One of the things you need to watch out for
as a parent is anybody who takes -- who pays

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.860
more attention to your child than you would
normally do, and anyone who takes -- who seems

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.670
to have more care about your child than is
normal.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.120
And he said, that's a real telltale sign.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.050
So I would like people to watch this film
and kind of be educated about how child sexual

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.290
abuse and grooming really happens.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.570
JOHN YANG: Dan Reed, director of "Leaving
Neverland," which is on Sunday and Monday

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.250
night on HBO, thanks a lot, Dan.
