00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:04.030
(energetic blues music)

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.720
- It's oh-dark-thirty and
we're already on the road

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.090
heading to a place north of here

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.680
by about 2 and a half hours,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.210
where a gentleman's got
buildings full of cars

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.360
that are unbelievable.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.937
He said, "I bought them
'cause I loved them,

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:18.470
"not 'cause they were
gonna go up in value."

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.130
Well they all went up in value

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.917
and so now we've been invited to see

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:25.440
buildings full of cars that he restored

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.340
20, 30, 40 years ago

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.650
and now they're sitting
in those buildings,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.100
kind of unrestoring themselves.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.360
It's a pretty sad sight
but the cars are amazing

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.710
so come along for the ride.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.450
So whats a Barn Find guy doing flowers?

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.800
Well I like flowers, okay?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.070
Actually, we're going
to see a guy named Billy

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.630
who's got an amazing selection of cars

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.690
and he happened to tell me that today

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.280
is his wife Carolee's birthday

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.270
so bought Carolee some flowers.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.570
This is what you do to be a
successful barn find hunter.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.920
Sometimes it takes buying
a bouquet of flowers.

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:07.550
Remember what I told you in
the past about dead end roads?

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.400
These are the roads that
contain the treasures that

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.690
nobody wants to go down a dead end road.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.600
Well, this is where the treasures are, so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.020
this is the perfect case-in-point

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.520
for going down dead end roads.

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:26.920
Look at these, here we go.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.380
Building's full of this.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.253
Here we go, Billy and Carolee.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.570
This is the ladies love me.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:41.850
- Oh my, thank you, they're beautiful!

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.331
- Happy birthday, Carolee.

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:44.380
- Thank you very much.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940
- [Tom] So Billy, what's your dad's name?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.620
- Walter "Bicket" Eubanks.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.840
- [Tom] Walter, okay.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.110
- Just call him Bicket.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.340
- [Tom] Nice to meet you, Bicket.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.970
And thanks for teaching
this guy about car stuff.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.300
Where do we start, which
room do we start in,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.090
over here, over here?

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.170
- Well, uh, probably since
we're in here and it's raining,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.550
let's look at the--

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.810
- [Tom] Okay.
- You wanna look at

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.960
the Lincoln and the Stutz?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.400
Now they're dirty, I
ain't cleaned them up.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.980
- Good, we don't want 'em clean.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.400
- [Billy] Had a lot of fast cars and, uh,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.270
and drove fast a lot but
I never had a ticket.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.103
- [Tom] Never got a ticket?

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.137
- [Billy] Never had a ticket.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:18.970
- [Tom] Man...

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.660
And this is a 1929 Stutz,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.740
overhead cam shaft vertical engine.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.140
And how long have you
had something like this?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.600
- [Billy] It's been several years.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.230
This is oh-40, that's a 1940.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.290
- [Tom] 1940 Lincoln Continental?

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.290
- [Billy] Yeah, the 41,
they had two-piece fenders

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.430
but the 41's were two-pieces stamped out.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.532
The 40's, the back half of
that fender was handmade.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.920
- [Tom] Handmade.
- [Billy] Was six slits

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.270
in the back fender to make that turn.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.110
- [ Tom] Oh man.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.950
- [Billy] When I first
cleaned the paint off,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.217
I says, "well somebody homemade
a fender on this thing.

00:02:58.217 --> 00:02:59.970
"It's torn to pieces".

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.682
Well, I went to the show, when
I went and got that Lincoln

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.160
Ford Motor Company trophy, they said that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.340
Lincoln handmade those fenders

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.848
and I had the only Lincoln
there, there were six Lincolns,

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:14.741
maybe four, four or
six, 40's there to show.

00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.090
And I was the only one that had

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.910
the homemade fenders skirts on it.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.010
- And this was basically a handmade car?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.940
- [Billy] Yeah.
- Wow.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.330
- That whole back end is handmade.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.620
- Are there cars back here too?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.161
- [Billy] The cars are
in there, the other side

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:31.912
(energetic blues music)

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:35.160
- [Tom] Oh, now we're getting
to some stuff here, wow.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.250
Alright, so even though you're a Mopar guy

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.950
and a Hudson guy, I mean,
you've got Chevrolets.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.170
Do you remember any stories
about any of these cars?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.210
About who you got them from or anything?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.310
- I was working at the
Chevrolet dealership

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.376
and this car got traded in.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.820
It got stolen one time, you
know they got a switch on this.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.824
Mama drove it to work one night and they,

00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:00.440
she didn't get the switch cut off right

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.690
and somebody stole it.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.190
It upset me so bad that
I prayed to the Lord

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.960
that he'd give it back
to me by the weekend

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.930
or he'd either give me the understanding

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.200
to handle that problem, my
faith worried me to death.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.200
But that Friday night, the
law the from nearby town

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.230
said he had a Corvette racer.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.210
Didn't need it, we could come get it.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.950
They had got it out in the woods

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.360
and it won't hurt except
to say it didn't half run.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.570
Well what the people had
done, they jerked it so hard

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.700
they pulled three spark
plug wires off the left side

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.340
when it broke the motor mount.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.340
- [Tom] Oh, doing a burnout?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.430
- [Billy] Yeah.
- [Tom] Oh!

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.230
- So I went down and got it and

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.723
drove it home on five cylinders.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.790
I didn't know why it was running bad,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.260
I was just tickled to get it back.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.203
- [Tom] Now that's an
intriguing car right there.

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:53.330
A Daytona, what's the story with that car?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.250
- If you do look back into
history of these Dodges

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.880
when they started building them,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.530
they had a wide wing on the back.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.160
I don't know if you ever
seen a picture of one

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.140
with a wider wing.
- [Tom] A wider one?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.069
- A wider wing, I might have one.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.600
I have got one somewhere, but anyway,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.320
there's a set of holes in
this car right out here.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.900
You can see on the inside.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.570
Feel it where they welded them up.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.820
They put the regular wing back on

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.692
but they did some testing
with 'em on the outside,

00:05:20.692 --> 00:05:24.140
with the wing out flush
and this was that car.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.890
I joined the Daytona Superbird Club

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.290
and not many of them
had clear lenses in 'em.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.330
This one's got all clear glass in it.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.683
No power steering, no power brakes.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.290
It was a 440 four-speed.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.210
- [Tom] So 440 four-speed,
single four-barrel?

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.540
- [Billy] Yep, well
it's got two on it now.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.560
It has two on it when I got it but

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.200
it didn't come that way, I don't think.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.210
- [Tom] And did you drive this car much?

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.260
- [Billy] I have driven
it, yeah, I've driven it.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.870
- [Tom] It really had
no value then, did it?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.800
- [Billy] No.
- [Tom] What did you,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.240
do you remember what you paid for it?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.300
- [Billy] No.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.240
- [Tom] Now here's a 440 six-pack Charger.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.470
- [Billy] It's the RT but I
painted to take the decals off.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.683
- [Tom] Uh huh and
that's an automatic car.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.010
Boy, look at that air cleaner, whoa.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.873
So you got three two-barrels
underneath there.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.325
You do nice paint jobs,
I gotta tell you that.

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:21.658
(energetic blues music)

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.960
So what cars are interesting in here?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.680
Alright, so here we have two rare Fords.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.030
That's a Torino Talladega.
- [Billy] Yep.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.870
- [Tom] Is that a 70 or 69?
- [Billy] 69.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.350
- [Tom] Now some of these had big motors.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.183
Does this have a 429?

00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:38.870
- Well they had the same motor in 'em.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.943
This is a 428.
- A 428 Cobra Jet?

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.358
So that's a single four-barrel 428?

00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:49.900
- [Billy] Yeah.
Need to oil that hood.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.820
- See this was an extended nose

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.850
that Ford put on a standard Torino.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.007
It's about three inches longer
or maybe longer than that.

00:06:57.007 --> 00:06:59.630
Holman and Moody and Ford
Motor Company got together

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.870
and designed a car with
Snoopy nose, a sloopy nose

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.230
to keep it down at tracks like Talladega

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.100
so that the front end
wouldn't come up in the air.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.300
Okay, Mercury Cyclone, that's
the Dan Gurney special.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.980
The Mercury was tagged
"Dan Gurney Special".

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.210
- [Billy] The Mercury's a lot
rarer than the Ford to me.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.553
700 Fords, they claimed
to make 500 Mercuries,

00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:21.920
but I think they made about 275.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.640
- [Tom] No kidding.
Is that an automatic car?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.720
- [Billy] Yeah.
- This is a 302 in here?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.793
- [Billy] No, it's a 351 I think.

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.080
- [Tom] What an intriguing
package deal here

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.690
are these two cars, wow, nice.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.300
- [Billy] That's a 57 Chevy Nomad.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.230
- [Tom] Mm hmm, 57 Chevy.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.800
Now anything usual about
this engine, is it 283?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.170
- [Billy] Yeah but it's just a Nomad.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.716
- [Tom] So no fuel injection
or anything like that?

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:49.799
- [Billy] No.

00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:54.290
- [Tom] That's a manual
gear box, three on the tree.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.100
That's a Mark two, that
was the most expensive car.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.280
In effect, Ford charged
so much money and yet

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.030
they still lost money in every car.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.600
So it's a Hudson Hornet Coupe.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.980
Oh, you have a Rolls Royce.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.463
It's a special car.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.373
Oh, here we have another Chrysler 300?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.660
Another big Hemi with two four-barrels.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.450
Boy, that's some rare stuff here.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.773
427 Chevy Impala convertible.

00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:23.080
It's automatic console, bucket seats.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.910
I can't imagine the
torque that that car has.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.450
58 Chrysler Imperial and so did you,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.898
did you drive this car to high school?

00:08:29.898 --> 00:08:31.040
- [Billy] I drove it to high school, yes.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.223
- [Tom] This was your
high school car, wow.

00:08:46.587 --> 00:08:48.087
So a 55 four-door.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.620
- It's got 30, 36,000 miles on it.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.763
- [Tom] No kidding.

00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:07.220
More cars, how do you like that?

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.630
This is amazing that we're walking by cars

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.520
that on a normal episode,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.590
we would spend a half
hour looking at that car,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.150
salivating over it if we found it in

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.380
Northern California or Texas.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.310
Wow, look at that 55, it's great.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.463
But here, there's so many
other cars that are around

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:28.100
that I feel guilty about
not paying attention

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.700
and giving credit to these cars.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.483
Oh, nice Jaguar.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.012
Well you didn't know you'd be
pressed into service today.

00:09:48.012 --> 00:09:50.810
- No, I didn't, no I didn't.
(laughter)

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.710
- On your birthday, no less.
- Right.

00:09:53.574 --> 00:09:56.380
(chuckles)

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.880
- [Tom] Now Billy's knee has taken him

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.680
out of service for a little
while, he's got a bad knee.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.990
So Carolee, on her
birthday, has volunteered to

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.580
walk us through these buildings.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.903
- [Carolee] Volunteered
might be a little of--

00:10:06.903 --> 00:10:08.098
(laughter)

00:10:08.098 --> 00:10:10.470
- So here you've got
turbo jet 360 horsepower.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.900
That's a big block, you can
tell by the valve covers.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.700
That's a factory big block 427,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.240
so we've seen two of those so far.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.850
Red convertible and this,
I guess it's a black

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.540
or dark blue convertible.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.043
Have you, uh, maybe you'll find
cars you never knew you had?

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.960
- It's very possible.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.130
We have over 100.
- [Tom] No kidding.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.190
- [Carolee] My grandchildren went around

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.290
and counted them one
day and we've got about,

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.996
they're not all fixed up
but the woods are full.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:41.340
It's been quite his life work.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.930
- [Tom] Yeah, isn't that wonderful?

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.470
So this is a Z28.
- [Carolee] Yeah.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.120
[Tom] So, I don't know,
it's probably a 70.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.792
So this is a Chrysler,

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:54.467
probably a 57 Chrysler
I'm guessing by the--

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:57.910
[Carolee] He liked the
Chryslers and he liked,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.890
he really liked the old
cars that every year

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.760
got real excited about
the models coming out.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.430
- [Tom] Now this I know
is a Lincoln Cosmopolitan.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.890
To my knowledge, the Continental

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.250
was not a Lincoln Continental,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.970
it was a Continental made by Lincoln.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.740
But this is a Lincoln Cosmopolitan

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.020
so it's got both names on the fender.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.510
And I think this was the
lower priced Lincoln,

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.343
if I'm not mistaken.

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:26.343
It was based on kind
of a Mercury-sized car.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.590
- [Carolee] Well when Billy
first started collecting,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.452
he was more into the old Lincolns.

00:11:31.452 --> 00:11:33.830
He liked the old Lincolns.
- [Tom] Mm hmm.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.730
- [Carolee] When we first got married,

00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:40.120
he only had a car or two.
(laughter)

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.450
And then after our daughter was born,

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.567
I was in the hospital
and he came and he said,

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:47.360
"get up and look out the window."

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.530
He was just really weird, I thought,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.390
"he's so happy about our little girl."

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.610
But he bought another car.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.350
He had it parked outside the hospital

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:55.370
and wanted me to see it.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.565
And my life has been
like that forever more.

00:11:57.565 --> 00:11:59.830
(raucous laughter)

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.739
- [Tom] Oh man, you can't make that up.

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:05.072
(energetic blues music)

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.997
- [Carolee] This is the car he
wanted me to tell you about.

00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:12.310
- [Tom] Oh, okay.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.430
- [Carolee] This was a
car that he restored.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.990
We have showed a few cars,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.640
but Billy doesn't do with fixing them.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.413
He's not that much into competing.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.020
But we went to Gatlinburg,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.610
we hauled this one to Gatlinburg

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.700
when my daughter, older
daughter was about 15.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.780
Billy registered the car in her name

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.900
'cause he didn't want
to go to the banquette.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.820
He wanted to stay out and swap car parts

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.630
with all the other nuts.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.993
So Tammy and I went into the banquette.

00:12:40.168 --> 00:12:42.010
You know, they gave out
all the little trophies

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.530
and Tammy was kind of disappointed.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.650
She thought her daddy'd like a trophy.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.050
And then they got to this big one

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.170
and they said, "Tommy Eubanks".

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.160
Well, it was Tammy Eubanks
and that child got up

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.910
and got that trophy so fast I
couldn't even get a picture.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.743
- Isn't that something?

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:57.745
- She was up and back at her seat

00:12:57.745 --> 00:12:59.740
and wanting to run out and tell her daddy.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.980
- So this won Best of Show.
- Yeah, it did.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.580
And it was still a bargain.
- [Tom] Oh, here he is.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.743
We're hearing all the stories here.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.340
Here we have a Studebaker.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.860
So here's the supercharger's
belt-driven off the crankshaft

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.453
and drives air through that
hose and down the carburetor,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.260
the carburetor being in here.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.833
So it's a blow-through supercharger.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.600
So look at this, you have an alternator,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.850
you've got the supercharger
here driven by the belt

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.423
and spring-loaded so it's got tension.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.820
You see that arm moves back and forth.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.730
Here's an alternator.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.260
It probably would've been a
generator on here originally.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.630
And then here's an air-conditioning unit.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.130
A lot going on with belts here.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.630
This was a 289 engine,
it was a 289 cubic inches

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.040
Studebaker motor, not a Ford engine.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.510
So here's another Dodge Daytona.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.290
Most of these street cars were purchased.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.840
Again, we'll bring up
the word homologation.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.760
Chrysler had to build a
certain number of cars,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.250
whether it was a Dodge or a Plymouth,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.400
to qualify the car
homologated for NASCAR racing.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.617
Bill France wouldn't allow
someone to build a custom car

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:13.030
and bring it on the track.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.800
Remember, these were called stock cars.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.150
They're supposed to represent what

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.630
people drove on the street.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:22.630
So Chrysler came out with
a limited-production car

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.960
that people could buy but they weren't

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.930
necessarily modified very much.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.150
They had a 440, lots
of 'em had automatics.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.890
They had this wing and they had a nose,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.700
a sloopy nose on there,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.210
but they weren't really modified cars.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.740
But some people took those
cars and modified them

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.820
and this is one of those cars.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.100
These cars either came,
mostly came with 440s in them.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.330
I think some had maybe 383s.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.670
I don't know what this car had in it.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.095
Probably a 440 originally but this one now

00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:52.960
has a 426 Hemi in it.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.170
It's got really huge wheels
and tires in the back

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.870
and skinnier ones in
the front, so I take it,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.693
this was a drag car at one time.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.190
Billy told us that the
previous owner of this car

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.410
had brought it to a test
track, Chrysler Proving Ground,

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.430
I think in Highland Park or something,

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.200
and ran it and this car
went to 190 miles an hour.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.590
That's for a street-driven
car, which is amazing.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.163
It's got a four-speed pistol-grip shifter.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.750
You know, a couple of gauges were added,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.470
a, uh, oil pressure gauge, a Suntec.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.430
But the real modifications
are up in the front here.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.150
This car most likely came with a 440

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.700
but this one has a 426 Hemi
engine and two four-barrels

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.110
on a high rise intake manifold

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.090
and has a big hole cut in the hood here.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.990
So let me just put this hood down

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.233
for half a second if we can.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.870
As you can see, those carburetors

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.850
are gonna come right out the top.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.730
So this was a very
modified car and I take it

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.650
that this car was a drag
car that probably was

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.563
drag raced back in the day.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.850
Very modified, who knows what the

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.980
horsepower's on that thing,
probably, y'know, 600.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.500
Who knows, maybe more.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.380
We don't know if it's bored in stroke.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.550
NASCAR wouldn't allow a high
rise manifold like that.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.690
You had to have the
carburetors under the hood.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.120
So that's why I say this
is either a street car,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.170
a street race car, or a drag car.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.470
Here we are in rural
North Carolina looking at

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.563
a pretty substantial
piece of history here.

00:16:28.563 --> 00:16:33.220
A 1970 Plymouth Superbird,
the 43rd Superbird made,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.830
same number as Richard
Petty's famous race number.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.860
I just want to let you
know the value of this.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.160
I'm going through the Hagerty Price Guide

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.250
and in number four condition,
this has a value of $91,000.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.260
The average condition or one
in good condition is $124,000.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.220
If it were excellent, it'd be $169,000

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.650
and in concours condition, $216,000.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.090
Well, what condition is this in?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.580
It hasn't started in a long time.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.930
It's dirty but I guarantee
that this car would drive,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.930
run in drive and be cleaned up to probably

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.770
something of concours
condition or greater because

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.160
it's better than concours condition.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.410
It's got original paint,
never been repainted.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.620
It's got the original interior.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.444
It's got the original drivetrain
and it's the 43rd made so

00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:27.860
this car has a value well into
$200,000 range I would say,

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.164
according to the history
of these cars being sold.

00:17:31.164 --> 00:17:34.497
(energetic blues music)

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.510
Well, another Hudson Hornet.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.180
Now that's a significant car, 59 Cadillac.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.292
This is a Biarritz Eldorado.

00:17:46.292 --> 00:17:47.900
- [Caralee] I think it's
a Biarritz Eldorado.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.993
- Yeah, I can't imagine what
a car like this is worth.

00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:54.148
(door slams)

00:17:54.148 --> 00:17:57.280
Box is blocking the way but
just look at the size of this.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.800
The weight's probably
gotta be 5, 6000 pounds.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.890
I mean this is the most obscene
taillight ever known to man.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.910
It was 1959 Cadillac came out with

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.773
the fin and the tail lights.

00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:12.853
Just amazing piece of artwork.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.550
- [Caralee] Wanna see the Godfather?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.390
- Oh yeah, this is it right here.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.020
Huh, okay, another piece of history here.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.120
41 Lincoln Continental.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.200
This car appeared in the Godfather movie

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.700
and you can see it's got
bullet holes throughout.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.959
This was an actual movie car.

00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:30.923
Wow, look at this, there's a sign.

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:37.887
"Actual 45 caliber bullets
were fired into this

00:18:37.887 --> 00:18:41.507
"special effects car from
a Thompson machine gun

00:18:41.507 --> 00:18:45.501
"from the death scene in
the movie 'The Godfather'".

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:48.830
(bullets firing)

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.880
So this is a Hollywood star of sorts.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.040
But this car here,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.040
we should look at this
car for a little bit.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.140
It's not even really a car,
it's not really a truck.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.660
It's called a Ute and
you spell that U-T-E.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.290
Made in Australia by
Chrysler the car company.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.810
I think it's a Plymouth
if I'm not mistaken.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.587
So this is probably a 56,
57 with the big fin here.

00:19:11.587 --> 00:19:16.410
Wayfarer Chrysler, so it
usually has a tailgate.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.190
And I'm not sure if they were built

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.040
in Australia for tax reasons.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.670
I don't know why they were built but

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.950
they were still building Utes until just

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.100
not too many years ago.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.920
The Airflow Chrysler,
you know, I love them

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.770
but apparently they didn't sell very well.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.900
If you look at this 35 and any
other car, Chevrolet or Ford,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.700
they were so much more primitive.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.110
If you look at this car,
it's got aerodynamics.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.090
The headlights are built into the body,

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.830
not separate, sitting up here.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.560
And it was designed with the idea

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.150
of getting better fuel economy

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.440
and speed from a car that
was designed differently

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.697
than the normal car of the day was.

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:01.560
And it never caught on and
it didn't sell very well.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.620
Now this is the car
I've been dying to see.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.389
So this was a, what year was it?

00:20:05.389 --> 00:20:07.840
- [Billy] 57.
- [Tom] D500.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.663
Tell us, Billy, this is a
car you've had since new?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.430
- [Billy] Daddy bought it new

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.507
and I've traded back for it a time or two

00:20:14.507 --> 00:20:16.135
but I'm gonna keep it this time.

00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:18.178
(laughter)

00:20:18.178 --> 00:20:21.520
- [Tom] So this was a Dodge that came--

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.800
- [Billy] With a Hemi engine.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.870
- [Tom] Equipped like you
would build like a NASCAR,

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.810
stock car out of back in the
day when they were stock cars.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.530
It's got a Hemi engine with
a four-barrel carburetor.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.957
Did you drive this to high school, Billy?

00:20:33.957 --> 00:20:37.883
- Yeah.
- [Tom] So is that like a 274?

00:20:37.883 --> 00:20:40.920
- No, it's a three-something, 315 maybe.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.170
- [Tom] 315 so smaller
engine than a Chrysler had.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.730
Dodges had smaller engines.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.170
- But it was still a Hemi.
- Still a Hemi, right.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.120
And it had a manual transmission?

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.350
- [Billy] Yeah, pretty car,
I love the chrome on it.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.740
- [Tom] Boy, and you
bought this new, whoa.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.580
- So you told me you ordered
it once and it came in wrong?

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.360
- [Billy] Yeah and it
was just like he ordered.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.190
The colors were reversed,
it had an automatic in it

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.940
with the two four-barrels.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.084
- [Tom] So his dad ordered
one from the local dealer.

00:21:09.084 --> 00:21:09.990
- [Billy] It came wrong.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.020
- [Tom] It had two four-barrels and a Hemi

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.560
but it had an automatic and
his dad wanted a standard.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.577
So they went to another dealership

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:20.310
and ordered one with
a manual transmission.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.222
It came with one four-barrel,
which is fine I guess.

00:21:23.222 --> 00:21:25.940
- [Billy] It would fly.
- [Tom] Yeah, I bet, wow.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.617
How fast have you had
this up to, do you know?

00:21:27.617 --> 00:21:29.990
- [Billy] It didn't have the speed but

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.780
it didn't seem like it wanted to run fast

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.510
as that Imperial over there.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.520
- [Tom] Is that right?

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.800
- [Billy] But that Imperial,
that's a 392 in it.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.280
But this would turn
tight, it just wouldn't--

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.483
- [Tom] Is this original paint on here?

00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:44.520
- [Billy] No, that's all my work.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.530
- [Tom] And those are the
original hubcaps on there.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.879
- [Billy] Yeah.

00:21:47.879 --> 00:21:50.610
- [Tom] And that was a very
limited production car, I bet.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.657
- [Billy] Yeah but they had one
one a little rarer than that

00:21:53.657 --> 00:21:55.020
and we didn't know about it,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.124
but you could get it with the 392 in it.

00:21:58.124 --> 00:22:01.410
- Wow, that's a rare car, boy.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.720
That's a beauty too.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.310
- [Billy] Let's walk out
this door right here,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.550
some more down there.
(laughter)

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.731
You like junk?
- [Tom] Oh I love junk.

00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:12.064
(energetic blues music)

00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:20.540
You know, I see a couple
of iconic 1960s cars.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.260
Olds Tornado and a Buick
Riviera and both cars

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.650
are now seen as classics,
American classic cars

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.070
because they were so breathtaking,

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.040
cutting edge in their
styling and in this case,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.030
front wheel drive,
like, who heard of that?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.730
Front wheel drive at that point was Saabs.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.830
And Oldsmobile did it with a huge Tornado.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.783
Aha!
(garage door clacks)

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.750
Wow
- Open the door,

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.110
then just look inside at how nice it is.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.547
It's got 49,000 actual miles.
- How many?

00:22:55.547 --> 00:22:57.547
- [Billy] 49.
- 49 miles?

00:22:58.453 --> 00:22:59.286
- [Billy] 49,000.
- Oh 49,000, right.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.400
Wow, it's beautiful, so there's a 318?

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.120
Look how clean the fender
walls are, the fire wall.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.480
That could be a nice car, boy, ooh.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.263
- I got two old Chevrolets in here.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.990
- [Tom] Oh another, two more Nomads.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.403
Oh, ha, jeez, too many toys.

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:30.350
Okay, so this is the car
that Billy told us about.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.640
This is a rare, rare car.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.020
A 1968 Corvette 427 435 horsepower,

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.170
so it was the highest
horsepower Corvette, tri-power.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.130
Okay, that's a rare
option it itself, okay?

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:47.790
Four speed, air-conditioning,
power steering, power brakes,

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.403
side exhaust, original from the factory.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.860
It's gotta be one of the
rarest Corvettes of this era.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.330
It's metallic blue with, it looks like,

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.593
dark brown or maybe black interior.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.590
So this was the highest horsepower car

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.183
with all the options you
could get, so somebody was,

00:24:08.183 --> 00:24:10.490
you know, a well heeled
person who bought this car.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.530
They wanted power but they wanted luxury.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.660
Factory Air, amazing.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.793
Have you ever seen another
one optioned like this?

00:24:17.793 --> 00:24:20.570
- [Billy] No, have you?
- No.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.630
Power steering, power
brakes, air-conditioning,

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.280
side exhaust, high horsepower.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.414
- [Billy] Well it's a 400 horse.

00:24:27.414 --> 00:24:29.632
- 400 okay, so it's not 435, okay.

00:24:29.632 --> 00:24:31.600
- [Billy] No, they
didn't make it that way.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.870
- Ah, okay.
- [Billy] Yeah you either,

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.320
you could either have 435

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.240
or you could have air-conditioning.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.440
But it was different cams.
- [Tom] Got it.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.220
Okay, got it.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.650
How you can have cars like this

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.803
and never having had a speeding
ticket, I have no idea.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.490
Alright so here's a
sweetheart, a 57 Corvette.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.393
So that's a four-speed car, 283.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.500
Is this the one you'd like to

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.110
put the fuel injection on maybe?

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.040
- [Billy] Maybe.
- [Tom] Yeah.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.120
Okay and here have another wing
car, another Dodge Daytona.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.790
- [Billy] That's got the fast front on it

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.302
So it's a real Daytona, it's
got the double-x serial number.

00:25:08.302 --> 00:25:11.710
That's why they had to
put, you know, all those

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.200
templates on the cars
now before they race it.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.180
I got that front end
and I put the hood on it

00:25:19.621 --> 00:25:23.310
the thing was 3/4 of an
inch long on the right side.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.800
- [Tom] On purpose?
- [Billy] Yeah.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.450
- Oh, alright so what Billy's telling us,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.890
this is the era when NASCAR
started to require templates

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.330
before cars to go through tech inspection

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.640
because they were being built strangely

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.510
and Billy said the right side of this car

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.620
is 3/4 of an inch longer
than the left side

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.940
and he knows that because he
had to do front end repairs.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.470
- [Billy] I had to do
rush the hood over it.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.410
- So this nose was actually
purchased from Harry Hyde

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.140
and this was on an actual NASCAR race car

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.140
that Bobby Isaac drove.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.940
What motor's in this?

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.573
- [Billy] It has got a red hot 440 in it.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.980
It has to, it's got so much cam,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.313
the power brakes don't work.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.740
- So that's not really a street car.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.470
There's no headlights, right?
- [Billy] No.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.420
- X-X the first two numbers in the VIN

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.510
indicate that it's a genuine Daytona.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.760
What year is it, 69?

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.470
- [Billy] Yeah.
- Mm hmm.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.970
So all Superbirds are 70s and
all Daytonas are 69s, okay.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.250
So it's got an automatic.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.940
I wonder how many miles are on this thing.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.773
73,206 miles.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.800
So you got this whole nose from Harry?

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.620
- [Billy] Yeah.
- So this is--

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.040
- [Billy] Except for the hood.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.310
- Okay, so I wonder what
was here when this plated.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.010
- [Billy] I think they had a
place that could a hole in it.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.870
- [Tom] Oh yeah, they
had the overflow tanks

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.292
or the sump tanks here I
guess, huh, pretty neat.

00:26:56.292 --> 00:26:59.625
(energetic blues music)

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.483
We have a Super Bee and let's
see what's under the hood.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.540
426 Hemi, ha ha, okay,
this is a hot rod then.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.103
Bring that flashlight up again.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.390
426 Hemi head, who knows
what the horsepower is in

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.593
that thing, probably at least 500.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.840
This had to have been restored.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.613
I mean the paint under
this hood is just perfect.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.563
So this car has Super Bee on it,

00:27:34.563 --> 00:27:37.600
but it wasn't born as a Super
Bee, it was born as a Coronet.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.490
And it was born with a
318 cubic inch engine,

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.260
now it has a Hemi, so
it's a bit of a hot rod.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.300
It's got low mileage, only 47,000 miles.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.900
What's it worth, it's
probably worth in the,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.710
I don't know, I'd say in
the 40's maybe because

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.980
for all practical purposes,
it is a Super Bee,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.630
but it was just born a Coronet.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.930
Any car, and it shows me that, you know,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.730
Billy's into hot rodding
because, most likely,

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.190
he built this because he was able to find

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.430
a really solid Coronet and it
was hard to find a Super Bee.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.496
Alright now we're in the
downstairs of this building.

00:28:09.496 --> 00:28:11.746
(laughter)

00:28:18.366 --> 00:28:22.540
So just more cars of
Billy's eclectic taste.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.053
Another Chrysler 300
next to a Jaguar XJ12L.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.240
58 Chevys, you know for a long time,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.237
I walked past 58 Chevys
looking for 57 Chevys

00:28:34.237 --> 00:28:39.237
and 55 Chevys, 56
Chevys, but now 58 Chevys

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.050
have kind of come onto their own.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.320
Oh boy, fun never stops.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.410
This is your Ford building?

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.040
I got a Corvette, Corvette, Corvette.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.600
Nah, it's not all Fords.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.620
Okay, so we have three 57 Thunderbirds,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.850
which all three of them
have chrome wire wheels,

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.150
which was an option.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.980
Now this is the rare one
of the three, the red one.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.650
And Billy told me it's
got two four-barrels,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.540
factory two four, so
this is called an E Code.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.433
This is a T-Bird with an E
Code motor, two four-barrels.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.540
Also, very unusual for a
T-Bird, is that it's got a

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.120
manual transmission, a
three-speed on the floor.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.920
Oh, plus overdrive, okay,
three-speed plus overdrive.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.753
White interior, white top, red body,

00:29:24.753 --> 00:29:28.570
chrome wire wheels, big
motor, standard transmission.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.233
Nice, nice little package here.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.860
54 Corvette, now if you
know about Corvettes,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.220
if you don't, I'll tell you about it.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.460
53 first year of the Corvette,
fiberglass body and 54.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.460
Those two years, it was
called a Blue Flame six.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.210
You couldn't get a V8 in
a Corvette in those days

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.890
and the reason they
developed a car like this

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.100
is because Jaguar was the
sportiest car of the day.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.260
And Jaguars had a six cylinder motor

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.240
and they handled well
and they performed well

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.539
and they raced well and
Corvette came out with

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:07.800
their own version of a Jaguar,
which was the Corvette.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.780
Instead of a steel body,
it had a fiberglass body.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.250
But the problem was they used
production parts they had

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.290
for sedans and so it didn't quite have

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.910
the same lineage as Jaguar did.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.470
So it had a six cylinder
overhead valve motor

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.990
with three carburetors on it

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.380
because Jaguars also had
multiple carburetors.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.410
This had three Rochester
side drafts I think.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.510
Also for the first two years,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.430
you couldn't get a standard transmission.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.243
It was only available in
a Powerglide automatic.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.771
Some of these were raced,
some were road raced.

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:43.380
Not a lot of them and they
didn't do particularly well.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.430
But over the next couple years,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.630
Corvettes started to come on their own.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:51.700
They added a three-speed and
a four-speed and a V8 engine.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.430
And ultimately when you got to

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.833
a Stingray, independent suspension.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.020
But this is where it
started and thankfully,

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.960
they didn't end production on the Corvette

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.580
because as we know, it's one of the most

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.463
successful sports cars in the world.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.470
We've seen a couple of Corvettes already.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.280
This is, I think, the
fourth that we've seen.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.720
This one's been off the road since 1988.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.640
In 67, the highest
horsepower car you could get

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.840
was an L-88 427 but they're
rarer than hen's teeth.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.880
They only made a few of them.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.810
So this was the highest horsepower

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.830
production car you could really get.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.702
This car's got a big block with
three two-barrels tri-power.

00:31:28.702 --> 00:31:30.920
It's got side exhaust.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.340
It's a four-speed and it's a sweet car.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.060
I mean I can't imagine how
good this car would sound

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.620
if started up, my goodness.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.990
So this is a 1980 Corvette
that Billy bought new.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.080
He had to order it,
took a long time to get.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.160
It had angle port heads.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.840
It had a four-bolt main

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.580
so even though it wasn't high horsepower,

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.520
because back in 80, you know,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.610
cars didn't have a lot
of horsepower back then,

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.510
this was a pretty special car.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.600
He's still got plastic on the seats.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.410
Man, look at that.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:04.010
It's an automatic, let's see
what the mileage is on this.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.993
Whoa, is that the real mileage?

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.370
Nine point two miles.
(laughter)

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.823
Wow, man.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.140
So how's it run?
(laughter)

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.760
You know, think about that car next to us,

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.770
which is before the pollution
standards were put in place,

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.740
435 horsepower probably underrated,

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.440
probably 500 horsepower okay,
for insurance reasons 435.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.440
That 67 to 1980, 220 horsepower.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.550
I drive a Mini Cooper
that's got 210 horsepower

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.520
so it doesn't seem fair that a Corvette

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.953
only had that much
horsepower but, you know,

00:32:46.953 --> 00:32:49.350
they were a comfortable, nice-driving car

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.273
and they just didn't have

00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:52.400
a lot of horsepower at the time but it was

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.950
the best car you could get
in America in that time.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.860
And now we're coming to
probably the last car.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.810
Pantera was build by De
Tomaso with a Ford motor

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.270
and it was a car that you could
buy at a Lincoln dealership.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.520
Ford at the time had lots
of high performance cars.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.230
Boss 429s and Boss 302s and they had just

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.940
come through the Cobra era.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.090
This was one chance that Mercury had to

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.472
get in the high performance
sports car business as well.

00:33:18.472 --> 00:33:23.180
The Pantera was sold through
Lincoln dealerships in the day.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.771
It had a 351 Cleveland motor but this was

00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:29.770
the original Pantera which
had the small fenders,

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.160
not those big flairs and wings.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.217
This was a pure sports car.

00:33:34.217 --> 00:33:35.440
I wonder how many miles are on this.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.900
Probably not a lot, huh?

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.610
14,532 miles, wow.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.470
Alright, so we've seen
building on top of building,

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.852
car on top of car.

00:33:45.852 --> 00:33:48.710
I thought I'd see all the cars.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.360
I've found my favorite car
of the whole collection.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.360
It's a Jaguary XK120 Coupe and
you can't really see it here,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.940
but it's dark blue and
it's got brown interior

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.370
and as Billy told me, the interior's,

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.730
except for this one seat
bottom, the interior's original.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.300
What a beautiful, beautiful car.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.640
We saw an XK140 earlier,
which as a longer roof and,

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.830
for a guy like me, better leg room,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.300
but this is the more pure design

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.940
with the short roof and the long hood.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.439
So if Billy said take one home,
that would be it right here.

00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:22.772
(energetic blues music)

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.913
Follow this man.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.270
Oh, we haven't seen all the buildings yet.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.520
Alright, this is gonna
be the most mammoth,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.290
impressive car you've ever seen.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.440
59 Cadillac Eldorado
Biarritz, my goodness.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.940
Factory bucket seats.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.910
I didn't know there was
bucket seats in 59, man.

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:57.512
And tri-power.
Is that a 472 or something?

00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.973
- [Billy] I can't remember what it is.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.700
- What a mammoth car, my goodness.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.740
We looked this car up on
the Hagerty Price Guide

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.636
and it's unbelievable.

00:35:07.636 --> 00:35:12.636
In fair condition, which is
number four condition, $101,000.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.070
In good condition, which is what

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.750
most of them are, is $133,000.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.630
In excellent condition 180 grand

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.640
and in concours condition $260,000.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.870
So we're looking at a car here that

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.770
has a value greater than
the Superbirds we saw

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:30.920
in the other buildings.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.070
You know what, cleaned up, I'd say this is

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:35.790
probably a concours car so
we're looking at a car worth

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:39.245
a quarter of a million
dollars, just amazing.

00:35:39.245 --> 00:35:41.910
We've been here for
hours and hours and hours

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.145
looking at what I think is
probably the finest collection of

00:35:46.145 --> 00:35:50.410
unknown cars that I've
ever seen in my life.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:55.410
And just when we thought there
was no more buildings to see,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.460
Billy invites us inside to see,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.710
oh there's another building here,

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.570
and there's a 59 Cadillac
Biarritz convertible

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.083
that's, like, a piece of sculpture.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.310
Bright red, something that
Elvis Presley would've driven

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.146
or Lucile Ball or somebody like that.

00:36:12.146 --> 00:36:16.883
It's been an amazing
day here in the woods.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:18.970
I'm glad we were able to share it with you

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.660
because it's a very private collection and

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.850
not too many people know about this but

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.410
we were given permission
by the owner to come here

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.470
respectfully and tour it.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.333
Nothing's for sale so
don't even bother asking.

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:38.710
It's just one special
man who has collected

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.513
a series of special cars during his life.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.100
He bought them when they were cheap

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.300
and kept 'em because he loved 'em,

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.720
not because they were
worth a lot of money.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.620
And now they are worth a lot of money.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.663
Happy hunting.

00:36:57.006 --> 00:37:00.506
(indistinct conversation)

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.310
So, 59 Ford convertible, 58
Chevy Impala two-door hard top.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.153
A Studebaker, oh a custom
Studebaker, look at that, ha.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.307
A couple Eldorados.
