00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.040
Certain structures, megaliths, and buried
items defy explanation, but there are some

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.520
crazy theories about them.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.360
Let's take a look at some historical artifacts
that continue to baffle experts to this day.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.759
You might think that real-life archaeology
is nothing like what you see in the movies

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.160
with its treasure maps with spots marked by
an X.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.540
"And X never, ever marks the spot."

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.740
But not so fast!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.060
The Copper Scroll is an honest-to-goodness
treasure map.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.610
It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, and
it tells the story of exactly how to find

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.760
major ancient treasures … sort of.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.260
According to the text, 64 treasure hoards
were scattered across Jerusalem and the Judean

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.910
desert, and they were used to hide the most
valuable treasure in the world from invaders.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.530
That treasure includes not just religious
artifacts but also a huge amount of gold,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.560
silver, and coins.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.280
The pieces of archaic text that have been
translated give rather precise directions.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.080
The problem is that the directions are a little
too precise and refer to things like water

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.480
tanks, reservoirs, and underground passages
that we have no way of tracing now.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.760
Some think the whole thing is fiction anyway.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.880
But another school of thought believes the
Copper Scroll was a record of the actions

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.600
of a religious sect living in the city of
Qumran who were responsible for safekeeping

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.460
Jewish treasure.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.080
Scattered across four different sites in the
Costa Rican jungles are the remains of a civilization

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.160
that date to between 500 and 1500 AD.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.760
In addition to the regular sort of archaeological
remains, they also contain around 300 stone

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.320
spheres, known as "Las Bolas".

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.240
They're close to perfectly shaped spheres
and are all different sizes.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.160
Some could fit in your pocket, and others
are estimated to weigh somewhere around 15

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.660
tons.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.100
For hundreds of years, they were buried under
dirt, mud and sediment, and that's kept them

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.240
safe from all kinds of unsavory characters.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.280
That hasn't helped experts figure out much
about them, though, and we thus have no clue

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.940
who made them, when they were made, or what
they possibly could've been for.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.100
There's no apparent rhyme or reason to the
placement of the spheres, most of which are

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.300
in residential locations.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.300
One of the sites has a set arranged in a linear
pattern, another has an abnormally large sphere,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.640
and a sadly large number have been looted,
destroyed, or moved.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.620
And that means we don't even know how many
there really were.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.900
They can't be carbon-dated, but based on the
layers of sediment they were buried in, it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.880
looks like someone was carving them over a
period of about 1,800 years.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.040
Lore says that the gods used them to control
the weather, but maybe they were just a sort

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.220
of divine bocce set.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.660
Sometime incredible discoveries get incredibly
boring names like "The Big Circles."

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.651
Made out of stone, and dating from sometime
between 2000 and 4500 BC, The Big Circles

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:43.370
were first spotted in 1920, but it wasn't
until 2014 that archaeologists discovered

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.480
how weird they are.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.680
So far, 12 have been found scattered across
Jordan along with one in Syria.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.700
They range between 720 and 1,460 feet in diameter
with a rough average height of three feet.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.660
What's weird is that they're pretty perfectly
round and that there's no entrance to any

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.180
of them.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.040
The fact that there's no entrance puts an
end to most of the theories about what they

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.080
might've been used for.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.520
There's no practical reason that you're going
to, for example, keep a herd of cattle in

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.900
an enclosure you'd have to lift them in and
out of.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.060
The sheer distance between each of the sites
is also confusing.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.180
It is known, at least, that some of them have
been destroyed.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.960
The one in Syria was all but demolished by
expanding towns, but that hasn't gotten us

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.140
any closer to figuring out what they were
built for.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.420
In 2016, archaeologists from the University
of Glasgow unearthed a prehistoric site that

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.020
had already been discovered once.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
After the Cochno Stone was thoroughly documented
in the 1960s, it was then re-buried to protect

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.280
it from vandalism.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.700
Dated to around 3000 BC, the stone sits next
to a housing estate and is said to have some

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.320
of the best depictions of Neolithic and Bronze
Age carvings ever discovered.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.440
But we don't know why people went to all the
trouble of carving the exquisite markings

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.700
into relatively soft stone, or what any of
it means.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.849
The surface of the stone was already mapped
before it was defaced by graffiti and people's

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.360
boots.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.180
The goal of the 2016 excavation was to map
it more extensively, with 3D scanning technology

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.280
that would allow archaeologists to get a look
at the stone as it was originally intended.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.650
While we doubt that this is the case, we would
love the irony if the carvings turned out

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.460
to be graffiti from prehistoric hoodlums.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.820
How do you say "Eat at Joe's" in Neolithic?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.360
Judaculla Rock is named for the Cherokee legend
that Judaculla, an ancient giant, was the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.660
one who left the markings on the boulder's
surface.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.780
The tale says that he was jumping from mountain
to mountain when he pressed his hand into

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.620
the stone and left the imprint of his seven
fingers.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.580
But aside from that, no one's really sure
what the deal is about the North Carolina

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.560
stone with the prehistoric petroglyphs.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.780
Strangely, some of the best images we have
of the rock come from the 1930s, when archaeologists

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.920
filled in the carvings with chalk to show
where the markings were.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.520
In the decades since, weather has taken its
toll on the soapstone boulder, and it's inevitable

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.480
that at some point, the carvings are going
to wear away completely.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.700
They've already been dated to be between 2,000
and 3,000 years old.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.680
Not only do we not know what the carvings
mean, we're not sure who made them, either.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.800
Even stranger, there's supposedly two other
similar stones in the area, but no one can

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.840
find them anymore.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.540
Theories about the rock suggest that it's
an ancient peace treaty, religious marker,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.820
or even something like the Rosetta Stone,
giving us the key to unlocking other languages.

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:23.240
Unfortunately, whatever it's unlocking has
been so lost to time that we have no idea

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.360
where to even start, and it might just disappear
anyway before we're able figure it out.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.500
"It's a form of communication … in some
ways.. so What are they trying to tell?"

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.220
Miami, Florida is probably the last place
you'd expect to find an ancient stone circle

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.200
that's reminiscent of sites like Stonehenge.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.400
But in 1998, construction crews were tearing
down six blocks of housing to clear space

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.680
for a few new skyscrapers.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.380
In the process, they uncovered a circle of
24 large holes and limestone.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.559
Some more digging uncovered a perfect circle
that was 38 feet in diameter, dated to around

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.840
2,000 years ago, and littered with all kinds
of ancient artifacts.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.380
Along with animal bones and shark teeth, archaeologists
found tools and ax heads made from basalt.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.179
That's significant, because the closest place
to get basalt is hundreds of miles away in

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:12.499
what's now Georgia.

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:16.699
Further digging led archaeologists to conclude
that the site was left behind by the Tequesta

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.880
Native American tribe, one of the most mysterious
peoples to settle in the southern United States.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.340
They were a largely nomadic group that managed
to survive into the 18th century.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.800
There's a lot we don't know about them, including
what the deal is with this ancient circle.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.860
The site is still being studied, and it's
also now preserved by state authorities.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.949
If you ever find yourself in Miami anytime
soon, you now know you have somewhere cool

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.520
to visit besides the beach.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.189
In 1957, an amateur archaeologist found a
small coin in what he thought was a purely

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.980
Native American site at Naskeag Point in Brooklin,
Maine.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.919
Then in 1974, experts visiting the Maine State
Museum announced that it was a Norse coin,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.129
and it took another four years to date it
to between 1065 and 1080 AD.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.380
The site itself was dated to just after that,
when the coin would've logically been in circulation.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.360
But the question of just how it ended up in
Maine has been hugely debated.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.180
Some people insist it's proof of Norse contact
with Maine, but since it's the only Norse

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.120
artifact that's been found there, others say
it's a hoax.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.740
Still others suggest it might have been carried
there as a part of some 12th-century trade

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.240
network.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.639
The coin has a mark that's led some to suggest
it had been made into a pendant, and was brought

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.740
to the New World that way.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.659
If that's true, there's something oddly comforting
about the idea that even hundreds of years

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.580
ago, we were picking up souvenirs, turning
them into jewelry, and then losing them.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.520
The eerily named Starving of Saqqara is a
2-foot-tall limestone statue that now resides

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.640
at Concordia University in Montreal.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.280
It came to the university from a collection
of Mediterranean antiquities.

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:51.680
But no one has the faintest idea about the
statue's origins or what it's supposed to

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.760
be, even though there's no shortage of experts
that have been consulted.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.419
Saqqara is the name of an ancient Egyptian
burial ground, but no one knows just how the

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.420
statue came by that name or if the two are
really related.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.590
Even stranger, a mysterious script was etched
into the statute, and no one's been able to

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.760
even come close to identifying that either.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.240
If it's a fake, someone went to a lot of trouble
to make up something that's not recognizable

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.380
as anything of importance.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.260
And if it's not fake, then we have a lot to
learn.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.320
Some places aren't typically on anyone's travel
plans.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.059
One of those is surely a remote corner of
the Southeast Asian country of Laos about

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.200
250 miles outside the capital city of Vientiane.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.920
But if you head out into the literal middle
of nowhere, you'll discover the Plain of Jars.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.220
The sprawling site of hundreds of square miles
is filled with thousands of these stone containers.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.880
They're in random places, some alone, some
in groups, with some up to 9 feet tall.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.420
Some have lids, some don't.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.240
Some are decorated with carvings, others aren't.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.579
At this point, you can probably guess that
no one has the slightest idea what the jars

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.240
were for.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.840
One theory says that they were burial sites,
or that they were urns for placing a body

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.800
in to allow it to decompose before the rest
of the burial rites were performed.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.160
Others say that they're kilns and were used
to make building materials.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.560
Still others suggest that they were used for
brewing rice wine, and that's probably our

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.340
favorite theory.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.420
We're thinking it's either that, or the beer
pong of the gods.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.340
In 1986, construction workers near Chengdu,
China uncovered something bizarre: an ancient

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.740
cache of artifacts that included animal bones
and elephant tusks, along with around 200

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.980
jade figures, massive bronze artworks, and
a life-size statue.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.580
Most of the Sanxingdui artifacts appeared
to have been damaged, dumped into the massive

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580
pits, and buried.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.360
Further investigation dated them to around
1200 BC and discovered that they were cast

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.520
with technology that wasn't thought to have
existed at the time.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.180
No one's sure how they were made.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.680
No forges or foundries were ever found, no
tools were uncovered, and in fact, until the

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.930
discovery, it was thought that Chinese civilization
was busy growing up elsewhere.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.560
Nor does anyone know why the figures were
broken and buried.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.600
Traces of similar artwork were found at the
nearby Jinsha site, which dates to about 500

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.060
years after the burial of the Sanxingdui horde.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.480
But still, no one's quite sure exactly what
the story is.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.250
The pieces have a sort of unearthly, supernatural
look to them, with exaggerated features and

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.560
almost wing-like ears.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.850
It could be the work of ancient aliens, or
maybe it's just proof that there's a huge

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.980
amount we don't know about our own collective
history.
