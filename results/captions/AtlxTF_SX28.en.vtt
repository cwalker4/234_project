00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.980
SHANE SMITH: When I was a kid,
I always want to take the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.950
Trans-Siberian because it
seemed so far away, and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.760
romantic, and freaky.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.250
I imagined Tartars and
Mongolians cooking in their

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.640
cabins and trading with Turkmen
and Uyghurs for rare

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.480
and delicate silks.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960
But instead what I got was
trees, lots of trees,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.640
interspersed with rotten
industrial wastelands and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.350
peppered with some failed
Stalinist industry--

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.960
and then, of course, more
and more trees.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.760
It ended up being stultifyingly
boring.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.490

romantic.

past day and a half.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.200
It's very smelly.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.930
Now the problem with these
impossibly long distances in

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.920
Siberia is that there's
nothing to do on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.760
the train but drink.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.220
But your sleeping compartment
is so fucking hot that you

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340
have to drink in
the dining car.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240
This dining car-- this was how
the dining cars were in the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.180
'50s, and '30s, and '40s on the
Trans-Siberian Express.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.240
It's pretty great.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.110
First of all, you come
into the oasis.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.300
You've got some 3D, holographic
unicorns.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.220
We've got a rearing stallion--

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.639
quite virile.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.250
And over here you're
got vodka.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.650
This is just booze, basically.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.880

to drink with us.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.730
He's a good vibe.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.340
Look who's come?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.720
We're in luck.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.640
This is our translator.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.610
He was born here in Russia.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.990
They lived in North Korea
until his mom

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.940
said, this is terrible--

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.530
came back to Russia.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.480
He's been living in
Russia ever since.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.690
He's going to translate
for us.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.860
And then hopefully we'll
get it all right.

on the Trans-Siberian.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.050

Russians there getting
