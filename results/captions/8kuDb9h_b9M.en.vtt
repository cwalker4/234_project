1920'S MUSIC PLAYS

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.520
In Britain in the 1920s and 30s, a revolution took place

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.560
that would change forever our perspective on the world.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.360
Driven by a spirit of Modernism and adventure, dashing pilots and daring

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.320
socialites took to the air, pushed back boundaries and forged new links across the globe.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680
Air travel was born.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.120
It was clearly the mode of travel of the future.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.240
It was bright, fast, sophisticated... It had all kinds

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.960
of allure attached to it that was extraneous to the idea of flight.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.280
Caught in the grip of the Great Depression, life on the ground was bleak,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.960
but in the air, the first passenger flights gave birth

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.520
to a decadent high-life that flew in the face of economic adversity.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.320
For two glorious decades, Britain ruled the sky and ruled it in style.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.600
When you look through diaries and autobiographies and photograph albums

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.400
of the most affluent people from the 1930s, travel is dominant.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.640
It was all so new that people expected the kind of experience you'd get in the Ritz.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.440
They expected it to be as they imagined a luxurious experience would be,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.640
partly because they paid so much to do it,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.360
but partly also because it was so new and exciting. 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.600
This was a time where flying was a passport to fantasy and adventure

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.000
for the wealthy passengers and pioneering pilots

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.160
who soared above the clouds, a world away from the low-budget, no-frills airlines of today.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.360
This is the story of the golden age of British aviation, and of how

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.120
the original jet set shaped air travel for generations to come.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.160
When the First World War began, planes had been in the sky for just 11 years.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.000
Once scoffed at by generals, by the end of the war,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.120
they were offering different and exciting opportunities.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.640
Just before the end of the First World War,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.480
there is a whole series of questions asked about what is British aviation

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480
going to look like at the end of the First World War?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000
Can we use the surplus aircraft and the skills of aircrews

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.160
to create a Civil Aviation Organisation?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.480
By February 1919, Britain's first Department of Civil Aviation was formed

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.320
to oversee a burgeoning new industry,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.800
as the first independent airlines started to transport cargo across Europe.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.520
But soon these flights were to carry passengers as well

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.480
and first on board in July 1919 was a Lancashire businessman, Colonel William Pilkington.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.360
The very first commercial flight was a businessman,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.440
a man from Pilkington Glass, no less, who had read in the newspapers

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
that it was going to be possible to fly to Paris.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
So he phoned up Air Transport and Travel and said,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.120
"Can I have an airplane to take me to Paris?"

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.400
And they said, "Well, I suppose so."

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.840
Anyway, Mr Pilkington turned up at Hounslow, had a wonderful trip to Paris.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.840
The pilot stayed overnight with them, and he flew back the next day.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.120
Six weeks later, in August 1919,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.840
the world's first scheduled international service was launched,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.280
between Hounslow Heath and Paris.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.920
On board were several brace of grouse, some Devonshire clotted cream

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.080
and one paying passenger.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.640
But in these so-called stick and string planes, built for fighting,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.240
there was little in the way of creature comforts.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.800
The earliest planes, despite at the time

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.320
seeming like something from the future, were actually very primitive.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.720
I mean, they had three or four controls.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.720
They had to fly blind a lot of the time.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.240
Ventilation was through holes in the cabin, effectively.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.520
And the seats were just the sort of seats you might have at home.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.440
So they were very primitive.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.000
Toilet facilities were really just a bucket with a curtain round it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.400
It wasn't terribly private, but it was at the back of the aircraft

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.320
and all the other people were looking forwards,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.120
and there was so much engine noise and vibration that nobody would

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.640
hear anything unless you had a particularly upset stomach.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.880
But by the mid-1920s, developments in aircraft design and technology,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.080
much of it spearheaded by British companies such as Handley Page,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.400
de Havilland and Armstrong Whitworth, were to produce

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.720
both beautiful and innovative aeroplanes.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.800
In 1923, the Government decided to merge four

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.000
small struggling companies into one major subsidised airline.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.960
Imperial Airways was to be Britain's official air link with the rest of the world.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.040
Getting Britain into the air and showing that Britain was abreast

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.280
of modern technology was a statement about modernity. It was a statement about technological prowess.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.880
And that was really important cos the Dutch were starting to do this,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.520
the Americans were doing this, the Germans were getting in on the act.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.040
So Britain really had to do it in a sense, in order to hold her head high.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.440
Imperial Airways, really they were pioneers, like the pilots who worked for them.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.440
And I think, to some extent, they really didn't know.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.880
It was like space travel in the 1950s and 60s.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.880
It was all so new, they had to work it out as they went along.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.160
You can tell, too, from the name - Imperial Airways -

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.080
they felt that this was a way to make the Empire, which still existed, smaller.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.320
Diplomats could travel around,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.640
so it was part of that move

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.920
to ensure that the empire remained stable.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.200
Most of the people who travelled were diplomats and government people. No-one else could afford it.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.960
As Britain's ambassador in the air, Imperial Airways was set for its maiden flight to Paris

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.200
on the auspicious and the unfortunate date of April 1st, 1924.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.120
In true British style,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.240
the pilots all decided to go on strike,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.640
so Imperial Airways didn't actually get itself into the air

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.480
for a little while after the date of its formation,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.960
but if you're going to do something properly, start with a damn good strike, you know, it's very British.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.920
On 24th April 1924, Imperial Airways finally took off

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.880
as it made its first flight to Paris.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:52.120
Within a year, the airline was also operating services to Basil, Brussels and Cologne, from its new

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.920
base in Croydon, where a small grass airfield had been transformed

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.600
into Britain's major airport.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.960
After the horrors of the First World War, life was moving to a different

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.880
beat for the bright young things of the roaring '20s.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.880
And they were quick to see the attractions of air travel,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.280
despite the limitations of the early passenger planes.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.840
This was an airliner of the period, lumbering to our eyes, but astonishingly efficient.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.800
Already we had airports.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.560
This was Croydon, bright, gleaming new field for London.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.560
The tower, the passenger reception, customs area, control,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.800
weather section... Yes, the pattern was already there,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.320
and it was all working as smoothly and safely as taking a bus.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.040
# Happy feet I've got those happy feet... #

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.440
Not only did the high flyers wish to travel to exciting locations,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.440
they wanted to do so at a pace that suited their modern lifestyle.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.960
# When they hear a tune

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.160
# I can't control the dancing, dear, To save my soul... #

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.880
This quickening of the pace, which is metaphorical as well as

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.680
actual, is one of the interesting things about the inter-war era.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.520
The kind of platinum shinyness of life, the rapidity,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.280
the idea of going places very fast.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.200
# Cos I've got those hap-hap-happy Ba-da-da-da! #

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.760
Speed was an essential part of it.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.720
Chroniclers of the time make the point that the moneyed

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.880
young man or woman about town lived life in a kind of perpetual transit.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.320
If you went out to dinner, you didn't just do it at one restaurant -

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.320
you trailed around the West End by taxi from one to another,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.240
and then back to somewhere else to finish the evening off.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:05.360
Air travel, newly arrived on the social scene, was an essential extension of this,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.320
in that if you could get to Paris in a couple of hours

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.840
to sort of extend your social life over there,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.840
this was immensely congenial to the young person with

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.240
too much money and not enough to do with their spare time.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.200
But for the young and wealthy, speed was not the only requirement for modern travel.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.640
If they were to go by plane, they had to do so in the comfort

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.360
and style to which they had become accustomed,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.640
on five-star ocean liners.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.680
Ocean travel was one of the most luxurious things

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.120
that man could be exposed to.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.920
It set new standards for catering, accommodation and entertainment.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:58.800
People were expecting to have this level of comfort and luxury,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.840
and so, gradually, Imperial Airways

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.240
began to realise that they could court more custom

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.720
by offering the trappings of comfort.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.240
These people are boarding an airliner, to be the first ever to view a motion picture in mid-air.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.080
To compete with the luxury liners, Imperial Airways experimented

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.080
with ways of entertaining their passengers.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.280
And in 1925, even introduced the world's first in-flight movie.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.800
Two years later, the airline launched its Silver Wing service to Paris.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.240
Expensive and exclusive, this was the original first class air travel.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.560
Flying today is about moving maximum numbers of people for minimal cost.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.360
During the 1920s, it was the exact opposite.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.600
Travelling by air wasn't just about getting from A to B as fast

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.280
and as painlessly as possible -

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.080
the process was part of the pleasure because it was so luxurious.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.400
# It don't mean a thing If it ain't got that swing... #

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.680
When you were planning to fly, you notified

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.920
the airline when you wanted to fly,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.400
they sent you a ticket and they would usually send a limousine

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.520
to come and collect you from your home.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.280
And then you would go into the departure shed,

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.640
and there, certainly to begin with, it was essential that

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.520
the aircraft wasn't too heavy,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.200
so they weighed your baggage and they also weighed you.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.160
Baggage allowance was 30lbs - less than most airlines permit today -

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.120
but additional luggage could be sent ahead on a separate flight.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.160
Everything was geared towards giving passengers a first-class service, including a stress-free check-in.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.600
From getting out of your car to getting on to the aircraft

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.240
was no more than eight or nine minutes.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.320
For £11, an average monthly wage, the wealthy got to enjoy luxury travel to Paris

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.160
on a state-of-the-art, three-engined airliner,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.960
whilst revelling in the new experience of taking to the sky.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.480
And people would begin to look out and see the countryside going past.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.960
And they'd say, "My God, I'm flying."

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.680
And there was the sense of being like a bird.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.600
It was a wonderful, exciting, euphoric experience to go and fly.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.800
And it was a euphoria in considerable style.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.880
With its Silver Wing service, Imperial Airways offered all

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.320
the trappings of the luxury ocean liner,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.600
including the first airline steward.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.640
For the steward, it was gloves, a white jacket. They represented the airline,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.320
and they represented this luxurious experience,

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.520
so they had to look the part. I mean, they had to be immaculate.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.560
The steward on board would set up a table,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.200
or part of the chair in front as the table, with a tablecloth,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.920
a full complementary set of cutlery,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.520
matching glasses and napkins, possibly even a rose in a vase.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.840
The food was predominantly kept warm.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.280
It had been pre-cooked, either at the airport or had come from some rather stylish restaurants,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.200
but it still had to be served in a manner. So meat would be plattered.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.720
Vegetables would go into tureens, and it would be spoon and fork service the whole way through.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.840
You would expect the same service on Silver Wing as you would perhaps get at Claridges.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.480
Most of the stewards had all served apprenticeships as waiters.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.920
And waiters then knew everything about food.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.960
They could describe a dish.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.600
And if they were wine waiters, they could describe the wine.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.680
And it was a profession.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.920
And everything in those days was all silver and all bone china.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.480
It was really something.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.360
The main course sometimes consisted of a rib of beef.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.640
And it used to go on to the trolley, and you used to carve it.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.040
Put it onto the plate, with the vegetables.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.200
That was it. Sweet was exactly the same.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.280
It was served sweet with whatever you wanted, champagne and everything else.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.680
And cheese and biscuits. And eventually coffee and liqueurs.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.840
That was a first-class meal service.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.160
Although the dining service was first class, in other respects, the flights were still basic.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.600
The planes could only fly during the day, and still didn't have any seat belts.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.480
And one particularly important in-flight facility was in desperate need of an upgrade.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.120
Toilets started out being rather primitive,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.680
but they did become an essential feature

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.240
of the airliner quite early on.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.200
And they were made rather primitive right up until 1930,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.680
with the introduction of the big H.P.42 biplanes.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.840
They did have proper washrooms with water and a basin

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.720
where you could wash your hands.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.200
The Handley Page 42 represented a huge step forward in civil aviation.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:53.000
Not only did it provide a proper washroom - it had the interior of a first class rail carriage.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.840
The H.P.42 also became renowned for its remarkable safety record.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.080
In doing so, it helped restore the faith in commercial aviation after an Imperial Airways plane

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.120
had ditched into the English Channel in 1929, claiming the lives of seven passengers

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.640
and prompting calls in the press for flying to be restricted to adventurers and fighter pilots.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.280
I mean, these planes had to be wrestled through the air.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.160
None of the controls... were power controls.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.440
It was all manual,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.440
so it was difficult, it was hard work.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.800
And it was dangerous. The planes weren't as good as they are now,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.960
but the pilots were amazing. There should've been far more crashes than there were.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.600
The first men to fly commercial airplanes were fighter pilots from World War 1.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.800
But over time, many of them were replaced by a new generation of flyers - men whose style and grace

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.760
created the iconic image of the dashing airline captain.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.240
One such pilot was Ron Valentine, from Plymouth.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.920
In an illustrious career,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.880
he was to break several aviation speed records,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.000
and fly VIPs, from the Queen to Charles de Gaulle, around the world.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.320
My husband was taken up as a small boy by his father.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.720
And he said that from that minute onward,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.640
he was absolutely sold on the idea of flying.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.120
The first flying he did was the Silver Wing service

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.920
to Paris, and...

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.800
they had some very interesting passengers,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.240
because it was very much a luxury flight then.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.560
Oh, people like the Aga Khan, and minor royalty and so on.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.400
And he said the stewards all loved the Aga Khan

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.560
cos he used to give them racing tips!

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.640
I think as a young man it was very exciting to meet all these people.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.040
And they also, they made a big fuss of the captains, you see,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.840
cos they were rather thin on the ground in those days.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.320
So they were very chuffed when the VIPs...

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.640
And they always used to go back and socialise and talk to the passengers.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.280
They weren't just the driver, you know.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.240
They were in command, they had to look after the passengers in every sense.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.840
# Every time

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.280
# We say goodbye, I die... #

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.160
In these early ones, he doesn't have a moustache.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.960
And then he grew a moustache,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.240
cos he said he thought it made him look older.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.160
Because I think he was only 22 or something when he got his command.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.200
# I wonder why a little... #

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.240
He was always impeccably dressed except, as my family said,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.520
when he was gardening, when he was incredibly scruffy.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.040
He wore all his old clothes.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.800
And very fussy, always fastidious about his clothes, his appearance.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.880
Pilots like Ron enjoyed a glamorous lifestyle to rival that of their passengers.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.880
They too were part of the early jet set.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.800
He would have three days in a Rome,

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.240
three days in Beirut, three days or four or five days in Hong Kong.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.880
And so he had friends all over the world.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.040
So they became my friends too.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.160
# There's no love song finer... #

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:41.440
When Cherie met Ron at the age of 22, she was swept off her feet by the handsome young pilot.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.680
But standing in the way of true love

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.080
was one particular clause in Ron's contract with Imperial Airways.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.080
# We say goodbye... #

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.680
"Clause 19 lays down special regulations concerning the marriage of a captain.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.080
"This is necessary because the operations of the company

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.480
"necessitate a considerable proportion of its flying personnel

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.440
"remaining unmarried."

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.880
What it meant for me was that when we wanted to get married,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.920
we had to go to the station manager, who was Robert,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.320
later Sir Robert Maxwell, who very kindly took us out

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.640
to lunch and inspected me, and gave us permission.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.760
And remained a friend for life.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.640
# Every time

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.600
# We say goodbye... #

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.240
For millions of ordinary British people,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.920
life was extraordinarily grim at the beginning of the 1930s.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.720
As the Great Depression overwhelmed the country, industries collapsed

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.600
and unemployment soared, leaving over two and a half million people jobless.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.640
In sharp contrast, those who were immune to such economic hardships

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.760
continued to gather at Croydon Airport,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.960
their glamorous gateway to the high life.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.640
- TV BROADCAST: 
- 'The huge Imperial Airways plane Syrinx descends at Croydon coming to rest

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.840
'like some giant liner pulling into dock, Lady Willingdon on board.'

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.040
It very much was the haves and have-nots.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.000
Margaret Fontaine, Lord Astor, these sorts of people were travelling.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.440
The super-rich - the Vanderbilts from America. Not Joe Bloggs.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.240
Croydon was a little spectacle, a little theatre of Imperial endeavour.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.680
The cameras were here. I've got a feeling that Imperial, if not Imperial possibly Croydon itself,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.320
had the equivalent of the Heathrow photographer, who was a celebrity spotter.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.160
And the Imperial News Magazine is filled with photographs of eminent

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.160
people arriving and departing from this airport over a ten-year period.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.440
While Croydon was the way out of Britain, for the fashionable high-flyers in pursuit of style,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.880
glamour and perhaps a little romance, one destination above all was to be an irresistible magnet.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.400
During the 1920s and '30s, Paris was absolutely indisputably the cultural centre of the world.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.920
It was a centre of design, of painting and also the centre

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.560
of the most luxurious haute couture fashion.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.160
Wealthy women had travelled to Paris to buy clothes during the 1910s and 1920s,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.480
but what was so significant about the 1930s is that, rather than it taking days,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.200
they could fly to Paris in just over three hours to buy clothes and come home again.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.280
There are two words that come to mind when we think about flying.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.960
One is glamour and one is luxury.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.880
And we see those come together in the most exclusive fashion magazines

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.280
such as Vogue, which features airplanes in 1937 on its cover.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.440
Air travel at that time really was an elitist thing.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.920
You needed money and you needed lots of it.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:43.760
Not only for the flying, but for every inch of gorgeous fabric she is wearing.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.840
This is a gorgeous English dress...

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.680
..most definitely cut off the bias,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.920
care of our designer V&amp;A in Paris.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.960
It has got a great fluidity in its movement,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.280
as you can see when Jane swings a bit, the movement of the dress.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.000
Large over-sized pearls,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.080
red lips. That was the look. That was it - fast, racy and fun.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.360
This epitomises that time completely.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.920
It encompasses the body consciousness of the time,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.360
and the freedom and sauciness that the ladies were feeling at the time.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.560
And this bias cut around the bottom

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.000
just compels you to twizzle and become a flapper.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.840
Just imagine how exciting it was to go on a plane for the first time.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.800
The whole world was open to you and it was just a whole feeling of freedom, I think,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.640
and I think this dress just epitomises that.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.280
While some women were in search of style and glamour, others saw

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.280
aviation as a way to make their mark on history,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.840
despite condescending labels such as "petticoat pilots".

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.680
I think it's not surprising that women are involved in aviation,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.120
just as they were involved in motor racing and that kind of thing.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.680
Although, in one sense, the world was opening up and horizons were becoming

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.560
greater, in another sense what they were allowed to was fairly limiting.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.720
So when something new came along where there weren't any really any parameters,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.160
where nobody had laid down the law about what you did or didn't do, and no particular

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.560
educational qualifications needed, then I think this was something that a number of them grasped at.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.000
It was there and it could be done, and it was somewhere where you could compete with men

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.080
and perhaps even be superior to them, and nobody was going to get in your way.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.840
Some women did take to the air to compete with men.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.240
However, they were not entitled to call themselves pilots.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.680
"Aviatrix" is the term that was used to describe women pilots in the 1930s.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.280
In recent years, especially women's historians

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.360
have said, "Why weren't they simply called pilots?"

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.680
Because until that time, people really didn't believe that women could

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:11.280
undertake work that was dangerous, risky, competitive, and also was technologically challenging.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:17.760
And women pilots proved them wrong. They won the races on equal terms and they were excellent pilots.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.960
# Anything goes... #

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.280
Britain's most celebrated female pilot was Amy Johnson from Hull.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.040
Consumed by a passion for flying, she had qualified as a pilot

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.400
in the late 1920s, but could only find work as a ground engineer.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.000
However, fixing planes for men to fly was never going to satisfy Amy Johnson.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
She was young, she was attractive.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.560
- She was vibrant. 
- Yes.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.720
She was doing the most amazing things in an impossible world really.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.760
She was passionate, passionate about flying. Passionate.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.480
She wanted to be a pilot.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.600
And she felt she had to prove herself basically, I suppose because she was female.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.280
To prove herself, Amy took on the ultimate aviation challenge, to break the record

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.520
of 16 days for a solo flight of 11,000 miles to Australia.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.400
But as Amy took off in her Gypsy Moth called Jason

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.320
in May 1930, only a handful of people turned out to see her.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.680
She started off from Croydon.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.640
Nobody knew who she was, and I think there was one reporter there.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.040
# Forget your troubles and just be happy

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.480
# Forget your troubles and just be gay... #

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.240
Jason was an open cockpit plane.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.920
It had about four instruments.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:55.240
A modern car has got more instruments than Jason actually had.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.600
She had very little maps.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.080
She took a school atlas with her.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.640
# Forget your troubles and just be happy

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.880
# Forget your troubles and just be gay... #

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.560
Despite her basic navigational tools, Amy set off on her arduous

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.440
flight to Australia, stopping in 11 countries along the way.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.160
# Hallelujah... #

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.800
19 days later, three days outside the record, she arrived in Darwin.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.400
But despite her failure to break the record,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.080
and her inauspicious landing...

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.920
..Amy had captured the hearts of the public across the world.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.320
- It was a bit of a romantic thing to do, wasn't it? 
- Mmm.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.640
And it captured people's imaginations.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.720
She was in the thick of it.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.600
Her departure had gone almost unnoticed,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.920
but an estimated one million people lined the streets

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.360
to greet her on her return.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.400
AIRPLANE ENGINE

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.120
CROWD CHEERS

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.840
We started off and nobody was really in the least bit bothered.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.440
They thought you were crazy.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.000
And suddenly the whole world was at your feet.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.560
And this of course led to an enormous amount of fan mail

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.720
that just poured into the family home back in Yorkshire.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.480
And a lot of them were, of course, addressed to Miss Amy Johnson.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.960
Or some went care of her mother, this sort of thing.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:43.280
But this is one of the most amazing ones. Just her Christian name - Amy.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.240
No address except the country she came from - England.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.840
And it got there!

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.720
CHEERING

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.040
Amy Johnson had become a public figure in high demand.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.920
And she used her newly found fame to champion a new and exciting future

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.960
for a country in the clutch of Depression.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.560
If we are going to accomplish the ideal of making England

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.640
the tip-top country in the world,

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.080
we've got to get England in the air.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.120
And just remember, take to the air,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.160
and take to it actively and seriously.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.000
While Amy Johnson had connected with the public,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.880
flying was still the preserve of the wealthy,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.000
and of adventurers like herself.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.960
But for ordinary people, the dream of flight came a little closer

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.040
with the arrival of a new British phenomenon, the flying circus.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.240
The most celebrated of these was the brainchild of a First World War

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.880
fighter pilot, Sir Alan Cobham.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.520
By 1932, he had put together Cobham's Flying Circus,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.560
which cashed in on the public's growing fascination with flight,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.880
and gave the masses their first opportunity to take to the air.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.000
Parents took their children for this incredible experience.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.200
You paid and got 10 minutes of flying.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.440
Actually, I think lots of people didn't think it was possible

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.920
until they turned up at the field where Sir Alan Cobham was saying,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.520
"Just get in and you can see it's going to happen."

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.880
He would go round the various towns of England,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.200
like any circus would, really.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.640
And he would get crowds and crowds of people to these air shows.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.320
Once they had experienced that, they couldn't let it go.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.360
I mean, so many boys who had that experience wanted to become pilots.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.200
And those who didn't become pilots wanted to work in any capacity

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.680
for this new, exciting way of travelling.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.120
And, so many people,

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.800
even to this day, say,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.040
"Oh, my father, my grandfather had the very first flight

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.640
"with Alan Cobham."

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.520
So many people say that.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.200
So I think...

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.720
thousands and thousands of people must have had

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.400
their first flight in that way.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.120
While the flying circus gave ordinary people

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.120
the chance to share in the adventure of flying,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.720
the introduction of tea flights in 1933 gave the middle classes

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.320
an opportunity to sample the luxury of flying.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.800
The only catch was that these flights didn't actually go anywhere.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.880
These flights have been innovated by Imperial Airways

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.680
to show what London looks like from the air.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.120
Imperial Airways introduced its superb tea flights,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.600
where you could go for a flight over London if you wanted to, while drinking

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.680
and enjoying tea and cakes from a table,

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:27.360
with a tablecloth, silver service and a vase of flowers.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.840
Is that the Crystal Palace?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.160
Yes, oh, yes, doesn't it look lovely?

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.080
Lovely and clear.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.840
THE COUPLE CHATTER

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.240
A tea flight sounds an incredibly camp thing,

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.360
especially if it's a silver service, white-gloved thing,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.520
and I'm going to get my selection of sandwiches, cream cakes, fruit cake, possibly even a high tea.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.280
I would do it at the drop of a hat. And I am sure my friends would love it.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.000
I'd have a decadent day out methinks.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.640
For their decadent day out and a bird's-eye view of London,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.200
passengers paid £2, an average week's wages at the time.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.720
But while it was cake in the sky for the lucky few,

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.400
it was soup kitchens on the ground for many others.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.960
Although the Depression continued to ravage life in 1930s Britain,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.760
it appeared that the aviation industry would continue to fly high.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.640
Air travel was always going to be recession-proof, I think,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.880
because it was so obviously, not only of its age,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.880
but it was of the age that was coming as well.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.560
All the projections of the bright technological future had a place for air travel in them.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.560
It was clearly the mode of travel of the future. It was bright, it was fast, it was sophisticated.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.680
It had all kinds of allure attached to it that was extraneous

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.760
to the idea of flight, you know,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.160
the way it was sold to the public in those days.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.280
It was the kind of thing that would always prosper, however badly the stocks and shares were doing.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.240
In fact, the period of the Great Depression

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.600
was also the time of greatest expansion for Imperial Airways.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.200
Subsidised by the Government to carry British diplomats

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.400
and royal mail throughout the Empire,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.440
it was able to spread its wings

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.040
and fly free of the economic hardships on the ground.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.640
But while the aviation industry appeared financially immune to the ravages of the Depression,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.160
maintaining a regular service to the farthest corners of the Empire

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.200
was still a daunting prospect.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.200
If we can think about the sky as being a literal frontier.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.080
Places like the Sahara

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.520
in central Africa, in the Middle East, in India, the element,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.360
the sky was a completely unknown phenomenon.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.080
It was a major challenge.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.560
To help them meet that challenge, the airline had turned to former fighter pilot

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.200
and flying circus entrepreneur, the irrepressible Sir Alan Cobham.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.640
He blazed a trail across the sky as a pathfinder for Imperial Airways

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.200
as it sought new routes around the globe.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.000
He surveyed the routes,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.280
found out places where airfields could be built.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.120
And, of course, a landing strip was needed.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.280
Not just personnel there, but he had to have fuel supplies,

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.320
engineers, this, that and the other.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.240
So setting up the infrastructure for an airline was quite a big job.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.800
A passionate aviator, Cobham worked tirelessly to make flying popular.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.000
And was driven by his own personal dream that one day,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.920
there would be a landing ground in every major town.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.680
He was a celebrated figure, who really did chart the new British earth,

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.400
which Imperial Airways was to follow on its commercial flights in the 1930s.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.320
Well, I suppose that captures the adventure in the man.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.520
He does look like an adventurer there, doesn't he?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.720
Yes, he'd be doing meticulous planning.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.280
He was...he was an avid map reader,

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.640
so I am not surprised that every trip was successful.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:51.480
He understood his aeroplane. He knew exactly what he could do.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.480
When I think back on him doing those...those long flights

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.080
and the confinement of those primitive aircraft in those days,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.720
it is inconceivable that anybody could want to do it,

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.440
let alone enjoy it.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.400
Somebody had to go ahead and pioneer the air routes of the world.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:24.200
We just didn't get there without these amazing people showing us the way.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.120
A central hub in Imperial Airways' navigation of the Empire was Egypt.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.880
By the 1930s, Cairo had become the gateway to British territories,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.640
linking regular flights between London and such destinations as

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.040
Nairobi, Johannesburg, Delhi and Singapore.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.600
One young man who, in the 1930s,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.240
was attracted to working in such exotic locations was Ross Stainton

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.640
from Whitstable in Kent.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.160
I joined as a trainee at the age of 19 with Imperial Airways.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.440
I was posted overseas

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.160
for a number of years running the little stations that we had.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.640
The company...

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.520
was given the duty, as a private company,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.560
to develop the Imperial air routes,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.040
especially those to the East

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.880
and to South Africa.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.400
It was one of the most delightful places to be stationed,

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.080
because there were people of all nations,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.600
and there were a lot of other Brits as well as us.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.520
And the social life was splendid.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.600
I look back on those days with great envy now.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.360
For passengers luxuriating in this world of original first class flying,

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.440
overnight stops meant staying in some of world's most exclusive hotels

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.360
and partying in the most fashionable nightspots.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.240
For the high flyers,

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.280
this was a world where glamour and adventure met.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.040
Some of them, when they got as far as Alexandria

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.440
where I was stationed for quite a while,

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.960
they were very impressed with the nightclubs in Alexandria.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.160
And it was a matter of considerable practice and speed

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.040
to get them ready for departure, which was at 4am

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.560
from a place about 15 miles outside Alexandria.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.080
I used to have to go round the nightclubs and say,

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.440
"Oi, come on, time!" And get them on board some old bus.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.120
The passengers' fares on these flights covered all major costs,

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.120
such as their stopovers at luxury hotels.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.760
And for some gentlemen,

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.640
an all-inclusive flight meant just that.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600
In order to overcome the difficulty

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.400
of currency exchanges, they gave people coupons.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.800
So you exchanged your coupon for coffee or for a meal,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.720
or for the bus ride, whatever the case may be.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.040
And there is a story of the Imperial Airways bus,

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.600
I think it was in Cairo,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.920
travelling on a slightly different schedule in the mornings,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.520
going round to not just hotels

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.560
to pick up gentlemen for the early flight, early morning departure,

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.200
but also to sundry premises of Madam,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.960
where she would present the coupons for encashment...

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.520
in the morning!

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.840
# It's too darn hot

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.200
# It's too darn hot

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.400
# I'd like to sup with my baby tonight... #

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.000
Although international flights gave passengers the opportunity

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.680
to travel the world much quicker than ever before,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.000
several refuelling stops and overnight breaks were needed.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.600
But the airline was not about to expose its wealthy clientele

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.080
to the hardships of life in remote locations in central Africa or Asia.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.200
Instead, it created what become known as Little Englands,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.120
small corners of western world,

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.280
where passengers could expect nothing but the very best of British.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.080
# But sister, you fight my baby tonight

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.560
# Cos it's too darn hot

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.280
# It's too darn hot... #

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.320
They didn't eat local food. I suppose,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.480
like the British throughout the Empire,

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.360
they tried to keep up the traditions of being British.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.120
# Cos it's too, too, too darn hot... #

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.040
Wherever the crew and the passengers stayed,

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:02.720
the idea, to some extent, was to protect them from local food

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.440
which might kill them, local water which might poison them, and local influences.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.200
It was as if there had to be this is little protected pocket

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.640
that was jumping across these dangerous places.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.240
Flying down Africa over a period of eight days or so,

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.000
as it was in the mid-1930s, would mean an opportunity

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.760
to encounter wilderness, to encounter strange people.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.000
Landing in the bush and seeing eyes appearing,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.640
and men rushing out with assegais held high.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.000
And being scared.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.360
And some of the passengers had those kind of experiences.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.360
The first commercial flight from London to South Africa

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.800
had taken place in April 1932.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.440
But the logistics of these 8,000-mile flights,

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.400
with 11 different stopovers for re-fuelling, presented a particular problem.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.080
If you are going down through Africa in stages,

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.040
it is very expensive to build runways every few hundred miles.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.360
But there were lakes they could use.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.480
Taking advantage of these lakes,

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.800
the airline introduced the Empire Flying-Boat to its South African service.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.440
Now it could bring passengers to stopovers with proper facilities,

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.920
rather than remote landing strips in the bush.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.880
And while Croydon Airport continued to service European routes,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.080
the arrival of the flying-boat would make Southampton the gateway to Africa

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.600
and the furthest corners of the Empire.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.080
This is the flight deck of the aircraft.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.720
A pilot would sit here, with the co-pilot there.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.600
Standard array of instruments

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.800
that you find on any aircraft of the period.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.680
These pilots are largely regarded as pioneers of long-haul flight.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.600
They had to develop skills to fly all the way across continents, they are flying very hands-on.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.680
There's no automatic pilot.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.520
They have to keep control of the controls all the time.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.840
These are big, big levers here.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.600
Four big throttles,

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.080
and they are directly linked to the engines.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.880
You need about a mile of water for the aircraft to accelerate.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.200
So you need a lot of space and a lot of power

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.680
to pull this big bird off the water.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.680
There was something beautiful

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.080
about a flying-boat.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.800
Not only because of its size, it was because of its hull.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.160
It had this great big bow, and then it came down the hull,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.760
and the step there, and the tail going up.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.800
It was just a beautiful-looking thing. And it was big.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.360
And all you saw was this massive spray,

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.800
then suddenly, out of this massive spray came this flying-boat.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.040
And it would gradually get higher and higher in the water,

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.400
so in the end, it just lifted off the water.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.520
I used to think this was absolutely marvellous.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.480
You could almost feel yourself...

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.280
you wanted to cheer it had taken off.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.560
Once again, the airline took inspiration

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.560
from the luxurious ocean liners

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.960
to create a first-class service on the new flying-boats.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.080
Large and spacious,

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.680
but carrying no more than 40 passengers,

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.760
these half-planes-half-boats

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.760
provided the ultimate experience in comfort and elegance

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.840
during long-distance flights.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.400
Once the flying-boats came along, everything changed.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.640
There were libraries, there was an upstairs, a downstairs.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.400
There was a prom deck where you could walk up and down.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.040
There are wonderful stories of people flying down across Africa.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.000
They would stand, they would promenade on the prom deck,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.320
and watch below the enormous herds of antelope

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.480
moving away from the shadow of the plane.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.160
You could never do that now.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.760
# When I go a-dreaming

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.600
# I go with you... #

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.440
Flying-boats now carried a new breed of passenger on these flights to South Africa.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.000
Tycoons in search of fresh opportunities,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.440
and big game hunters in pursuit of adventure.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.520
But passengers still insisted on travelling in style.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.600
# You are delightful

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.520
# To me... #

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.280
Luxury, that's the only way you could describe it.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.800
They took off in the morning,

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.760
had lunch on the boat, morning coffee, lunch,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.160
sometimes afternoon tea. If not, they were landing in the afternoon.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.560
Went to the lovely hotels,

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.000
stayed the night, had dinner and everything.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.480
Next morning, took off again.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.800
# When I go a-dreaming with you. #

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.000
This is one of the passenger cabins.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.720
When you look at it, it's more like a railway carriage than an airline.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.560
You've got plenty of leg room.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.480
Huge great windows for this wonderful view, you can look out there.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.520
I have heard one account of people travelling down through Egypt,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.080
flying over the pyramids,

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.920
and the pilot actually turning the aircraft around

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.920
and flying over the pyramids in a different direction,

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:02.880
just to make sure all the passengers could see and get a good view of the pyramids, which was wonderful.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.160
Not the kind of thing you'd get from a modern airliner at all.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.560
While flying-boats were now able to take passengers as far as South Africa,

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.560
Australia was still considered beyond the reach of commercial airlines.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.200
In 1933, Imperial Airways set out to change all that

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.600
when it despatched a small crew on a survey flight,

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.080
from Croydon to Melbourne,

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.480
to chart the route for a new passenger service.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.880
Among them was Cecil Griffiths from London

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.480
who took photographs along the way.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.720
One of these fellows was the ground engineer, and one was a wireless operator.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.680
There was my father in middle, he was a flight engineer.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.080
Um...

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.960
It starts off here. "To Australia Per Astra."

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.120
He has taken a photo everywhere where he landed, basically.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.240
Bathurst Island,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.800
Rangoon. Bangkok.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.040
Basra. Another one of Bangkok.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.960
And as he has gone down the route,

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.800
Mount Isa, Gaza, Jodhpur, Gwadar. Bathurst.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:16.280
All corners of the Empire had to be surveyed from an aerial point of view

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.760
to make sure that, in the future,

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:23.320
aircraft could go and land there and operate a passenger service.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.200
Laurie Griffith's father arrived in Australia

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.520
after plotting an epic 13,000-mile flight

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:35.080
that took 12 days - 30 days less than the alternative journey by boat.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.400
In those days, there was no electric starter motors on the aircraft.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.280
And he called it the "If It" starting system.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.520
I remember him talking about this.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.760
The reason they called it the "If It" starting system is,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.240
you used to pull the propeller down with a pole,

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.520
and if it goes, it goes, and if it doesn't, it doesn't!

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.560
That was the reason for that, you see.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.560
This is a photo of the cockpit facing forward.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.360
And he has written underneath, "The office,"

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.240
because that's where he worked.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.840
People that fly down there now

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.880
owe a certain amount of debt to this particular flight, really.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.800
Two years after Cecil Griffiths and his colleagues tested the route,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.960
Imperial Airways introduced passenger flights to Australia.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.040
The airline had achieved its ambition

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.960
of taking passengers to the furthest corner of the Empire.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.560
But there remained just one more significant challenge -

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:41.000
to conquer the expanse of the Atlantic Ocean

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.840
and introduce a passenger service to the most glamorous destination of all,

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.480
New York.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.400
However, within days of achieving this, in August 1939,

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.400
world events brought developments in commercial flight to an abrupt end.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.520
At the end of August 1939, all civil flying ceased.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.480
Three days later, war broke out.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.760
The Second World War really did close down a chapter -

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.480
the first chapter -

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.640
of organised civil aviation,

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.360
which, many people look back nostalgically

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.480
and say was by far the best and the most interesting.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.680
And it's the golden age of aviation which was very summarily closed by war.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.720
Just as the availability of surplus planes and pilots

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.160
after the First World War had fuelled early developments in civil aviation,

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.360
now the process went into reverse.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:49.160
Passenger planes were quickly taken into military service to support the war effort.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:54.760
As was Britain's most celebrated female pilot, Amy Johnson.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:58.400
But in 1941, as she flew through heavy fog

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.200
to deliver a plane to an RAF base,

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.920
Amy crashed into the Thames Estuary.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.960
Her body was never found,

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.000
and to this day,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.960
uncertainty surrounds the circumstances of her death.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.000
In a way,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.240
I think that Amy is a bit of a mystery.

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.920
She was quite young when she died,

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.720
and it was quite tragic.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.960
- But she was flying. 
- Yes.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.640
She was flying and she was serving her country in the war.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.280
Plus, if she had to go, maybe that was the way...

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.520
- she would choose. 
- Yes. Yes.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.040
Amy Johnson's death symbolised the end of an era.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.480
The golden age of flight with all its glamour, style and adventure

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.400
had gone forever.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.760
But those bright young things who took to the sky between the wars

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.880
defined an industry that has spanned the generations

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.560
and changed how we live and travel today.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.760
After the war, commercial air travel was to change forever.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.680
Planes would no longer be the preserve of the rich and famous.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.880
That era was to give way to the modern age of air travel,

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.520
when flight would become available to the masses,

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.760
but lose some of the romance and allure treasured by people

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.240
like Cherie Ballantine and her husband Ron.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.200
# Every time

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.800
# We say goodbye

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.160
# I'd die a little... #

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:51.520

- 'All flights then were timed for day flying.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.960
'So there were many occasions when we were scheduled

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.640
'to spend a night in Paris

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.920
'or some of the other European resorts.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.280
'For me, Paris was fun...'

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.880
Ron Ballantine died in 2003,

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.400
after more than 60 years of marriage to Cherie,

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.800
and a life as one of Britain's most celebrated pilots.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.200
He was best known for flying the new Queen Elizabeth

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.880
back from Africa to London in 1952,

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.160
following the death of her father, King George VI.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.720
We played it all once quite soon after he'd died.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.400
This is the first time I have played it again.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.840
It's rather heartbreaking.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.200
When he was still flying, and after he retired,

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.120
if he saw somebody flying up in a small... He would say,

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.200
"Oh, lucky chap to be up there."

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.040
Not everybody had a job as a steward

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.600
on an aircraft flying on to different parts of the world.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.120
It was a glamorous life.

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.360
It was a very glamorous life.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.200
# There's

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:20.520
# No love song finer

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.520
# But how strange

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.840
# The change

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.760
# From major to minor

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:41.520
# Every time

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:46.080
# We say goodbye

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.720
# Every time... #
