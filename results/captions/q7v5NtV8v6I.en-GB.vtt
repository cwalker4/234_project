00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.770
We like to start
here very often.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.096
I don't know whether to reassure
you or to disconcert you.

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:17.470
But this is one of the most
popular sayings about quantum

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.690
mechanics from Richard
Feynman, who said,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.660
I think I can safely
say that nobody

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.190
understands quantum mechanics.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.290
Now he said this in 1965,
and that was the year

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.730
that he shared the Nobel
Prize in physics for his work

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.990
on quantum mechanics.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.030
So at that point, no one alive
knew more than Richard Feynman

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.130
about quantum mechanics.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.380
What hope is there,
then, for the rest of us?

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.740
Well, quantum mechanics
has this reputation

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.900
for being impossibly hard.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.982
But it's not the mathematics
that's the problem.

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:53.440
And here's some of
the mathematics,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.290
and it doesn't look
particularly easy to grasp.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.250
But actually, Feynman
was fine with that.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.190
He could do the
mathematics just fine.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.170
The trouble was,
that's all he could do.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.700
What he couldn't
understand is what

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.920
the math meant, what it tells us
about the nature of the world.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.200
And Feynman himself didn't
seem too troubled by that.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.450
He said, well, we've got a
theory that works and makes

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.190
amazingly accurate predictions
about how stuff will behave.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.790
What more do you want
from a theory than that?

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.860
Some scientists feel
that same way today,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.170
but usually we do want more.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.440
We want to know what
scientific theories tell us

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.450
about what the world is like.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.060
And it wasn't clear
then quite what

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.540
quantum mechanics was telling us
about what the world was like.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.940
And it's still not clear now.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.700
But I want to suggest
that we can do better

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.940
than Feynman's admission
of bafflement, or defeat,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.244
some might say.

00:01:49.244 --> 00:01:50.910
We don't have all the
answers about what

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.620
quantum mechanics means, but
we do have better questions.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.180
We know we have a clearer
sense than we did in the 1960s,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.930
or even in the 1980s, of what's
important and what isn't.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.360
And I want to try to give
you some sense of what

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.950
I think that is.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.780
And let me start with
some of the things

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.480
that everyone knows
about quantum mechanics.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.960
And when I say everyone, I mean
everyone in inverted commas.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.900
So if you haven't seen these
things before, don't worry.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.470
All I mean is that once
you start finding out

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.730
more about this topic,
perhaps by reading

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.730
popular accounts of it, then
pretty soon these are notions

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.980
that you will encounter.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.530
And the first of them is that
quantum mechanics is weird.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.670
And I want to show you what
some of those weirdnesses are.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.830
First one is that
quantum objects can

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.150
be both waves and particles.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.710
And this is called
wave particle duality.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.510
The second is that
quantum objects

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.260
can be in more than one state
at once, or more than one place

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.760
at once.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.890
They can be both here and there.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.670
And these are known as
quantum superpositions.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.490
Then we hear that you can't
simultaneously know exactly two

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.800
properties of a quantum object.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.760
And this is Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.910
Quantum objects can affect
each other instantly

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.080
over huge distances.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.350
This is so-called spooky
action at a distance.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.360
And we'll hear more
about it shortly.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.380
And it arises from a
phenomenon called entanglement.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340
You can't measure anything
without disturbing it.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.660
And so the human observer can't
be extracted from the theory.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.020
It becomes unavoidably
subjective.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.000
And then everything that can
possibly happen does happen.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.480
There are two reasons
why this is often said.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.940
One of them comes from
Feynman's work itself,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.110
which seems to say that quantum
paths take all possible routes

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.470
through space.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.910
The other comes from the
controversial many worlds

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.010
interpretation of
quantum mechanics, which

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.610
says that every time a quantum
system faces a choice of what

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.150
to do, it takes both choices.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.830
OK, now here's the thing.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.665
Quantum mechanics says
none of these things.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.440
They're attempts to
explain or to articulate

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.180
what quantum mechanics means.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.640
Some of them are misleading.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.770
Others I think are
just plain wrong.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.410
Others are just unproven
interpretations or assumptions.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.780
I'm saying that we need to
change the record when we

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.100
talk about quantum mechanics.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.300
We need to stop falling back
on these tired old cliches

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.510
and metaphors and look
more closely at what

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.764
quantum mechanics does and
doesn't permit us to say.

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:48.930
And the first point to
realise is that there's a big

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.150
difference between
quantum theory,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.460
the mathematics and the
mechanics that you just

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.330
glimpsed, which scientists
use daily to make predictions

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.140
to predict stuff that allows
them to build things like this

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.960
laptop.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.010
So this is stuff
that really works.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.900
There's a big
difference between fact

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.800
and the interpretation
of the theory.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.470
And this is what's so hard to
grasp about quantum mechanics

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.810
because normally the
interpretation of a theory

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.730
is kind of obvious.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.490
Newtonian mechanics.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.260
This is the old
classical mechanics

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.040
that tells us how everyday
objects move about and behave.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.100
So it tells us how things like
tennis balls and spaceships

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.260
move.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.950
The interpretation
here isn't difficult.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.120
Newtonian mechanics
tells us what

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.370
paths objects take through
space as forces act on them.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.030
And we don't have to ask
what do you mean by path?

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.200
What do you mean by object?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.870
What do you mean by force?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.240
It's kind of obvious.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.760
Well that's not so
for quantum mechanics.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.010
And let me give you
a glimpse of why.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.470
To predict what a
quantum object will

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.510
do, in place of Newton's
equations of motion,

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.170
scientists generally
use the equation

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.320
devised by Erwin
Schrodinger in 1925

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.260
to describe the idea that
quantum particles might

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.570
act as if they were waves.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.460
This is the
Schrodinger equation,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.630
and it doesn't tell us what the
trajectory of a particle is.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.250
Instead, it gives us something
called a wave function.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.640
And the wave
function can be used

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.610
to figure out where we
might find an object

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.100
and what properties
it might have,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.900
an object like an electron, say.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.270
So the typical shape
of a wave function

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.400
of a particle like
an electron in space

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.370
might look something like this.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.942
OK, so what does this mean?

00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:41.400
Well, it's often
said what it means

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.150
is that the particle is
somehow smeared out over space.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.190
And it does kind of look
that way, doesn't it?

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.840
But this isn't
showing the density

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.270
of the particle or the space.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.210
This wave function is a
purely mathematical thing.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.550
And what the wave
function lets us deduce

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.670
is all the possible
outcomes of measurements

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.950
that we might make on the
particle's properties,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.270
such as its position, along
with the relative probability

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.720
that we'll get that
particular result when we make

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.470
the measurement.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.240
So to find out
the position where

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.080
we would observe this particle,
we simply calculate some number

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.170
from the wave function, the
value of the wave function

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.850
at that point in space.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.680
And that gives us
the probability

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.780
that we will see the particle
there if we make a measurement.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.780
So the wave function
doesn't tell us

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.690
where we will find
this particle.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.690
It tells us the chance
that we might find it

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.100
at a particular
position if we look.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.210
And this is what's so odd
about quantum mechanics,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.000
because it seems to point
in the wrong direction,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.900
not down towards the thing that
we're supposed to be studying,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.770
but up towards our
experience of it.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.360
It says nothing, or
perhaps we should

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.450
say it says nothing obvious,
about what the quantum

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.520
system itself is like.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.890
In other words,
the wave function

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.070
is not a description
of the quantum object.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.940
It's a prescription for
what to expect when we make

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.389
measurements on the object.

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:12.930
But it's even more
peculiar than that

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.150
because the wave
function doesn't tell us

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.540
where the particle is likely to
be at any instant, which we can

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.242
then try to verify by looking.

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:24.200
Rather, what the wave
function tells us-- well,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.340
it tells us nothing about
where the particle is

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.950
until we make a measurement.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.890
Strictly speaking, we
shouldn't talk about where

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.062
the particle is at all.

00:08:35.062 --> 00:08:36.770
We shouldn't talk
about a particle at all

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.080
except in terms of
the measurements

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.760
that we make on it.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.620
Now this account of
quantum mechanics

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.730
is more or less the one given by
the Danish physicist Niels Bohr

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.390
and his collaborators
such as Heisenberg.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.490
And it's known today as the
Copenhagen interpretation.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.740
Copenhagen was when
Niels Bohr was based.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.780
Now I'm not saying that
this interpretation

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.250
is the right one.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.320
But what's valuable,
I think, about it

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.250
is that it tells us where
our confidence about meaning

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.960
has to stop.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.850
As it stands, quantum
mechanics doesn't

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.910
permit us to say
anything with confidence

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.630
about reality beyond what
we can measure of it.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.270
And here's what I mean by that.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.390
One way of speaking about
this measurement of a quantum

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.600
particle says that
before the measurement,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.420
the wave function might be
this typical sort of broad,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.890
spread out thing.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:33.050
But when we make a
measurement on the particle,

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.850
suddenly it collapses into this
spike at one particular place

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.460
because we know, having
made the measurement, where

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.310
the particle is.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.950
Now this is generally
called, for obvious reasons,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.630
collapse of the wave function.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.860
The problem is that there's
no real physical prescription

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.290
for what's going on here
within quantum theory.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.520
You have to sort of put
in this collapse by hand.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.790
So that's a problem.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.350
But wave function
collapse doesn't

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.200
mean that the particle goes
from being sort of smeared out

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.890
before we make a measurement
to being sharply defined

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.510
when we make it.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.540
All it says is that before
we make the measurement,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.820
there were various
different probabilities

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.646
that a measurement might
reveal it at particular place,

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.020
whereas after the
measurement, we

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.970
know for sure that it's there.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.280
What's changed is our knowledge.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.510
And some researchers
think that this is really

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.900
what quantum mechanics is,
that it's a theory describing

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.900
how our knowledge
of the world changes

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.780
when we intervene in it.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.100
And we can't deduce
anything from that

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.670
about what the world was
really like before we

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.910
had that knowledge about it.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.850
So you see, it's
misleading to talk

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.600
in this situation about the
particle being in many places

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.170
at once.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.870
The situation tells us only
about the possible outcomes

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.370
of measurements.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.850
It's the same thing, the
same story with this notion

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.930
of quantum superpositions.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.580
Now it's often said that the odd
thing about quantum mechanics

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.500
is not just that they can
be in two places at once,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.250
but they can be in
two states at once.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.666
And I want to
illustrate what that

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:19.140
means by referring to a property
that quantum particles have

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.490
called spin.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.860
And you don't need
to know anything

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.060
about exactly what this means
except that for some particles,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.350
for an electron, say, the
spin can have two values.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.540
And you could think of
them as spin being up

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.980
or spin being down.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.280
And if you make a measurement on
the particle, on the electron,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.540
then you'll find
one or the other.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.410
So it's a binary
property, really.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.380
And for that reason,
spins like this

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.290
can be used to encode
binary information.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.140
So you could say
the spin up is a one

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.180
and the spin down is a zero.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.390
And that's the basis of
the quantum information

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.550
technologies that we're
starting to hear about,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.210
like quantum computers, in
which spins or other quantum

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.430
states act as quantum bits,
or qubits, as they're called.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:13.740
But spins can be not just up or
down, a qubit of one or zero.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.320
They can be in a superposition
of up and down states.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.610
So what does that mean?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.920
Well, it's often said
that what it means

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.830
is that the particle,
the electron

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.490
is both up and down at
once, at the same time.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.510
But that's not right.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.820
Remember that the wave
function tells us only

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.680
what to expect when
we make a measurement.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.650
And so in this case,
what it's saying

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.240
is that in a
superposition state,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.410
a measurement might give
us an up or a down spin.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.140
And in fact, those are
the only possible outcomes

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.310
of a measurement.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.630
But what's the qubit like before
we make that measurement, when

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.610
it's in the superposition?

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.110
Quantum mechanics doesn't
really tell us that.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.220
Well, you see, now I'm
not talking any longer

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.750
about smeared out particles
or collapsing waves, but about

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.290
information, and how information
can be encoded in quantum

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.480
systems, and how we can read
it here by making measurements.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.240
This is the perspective that's
offered by so-called quantum

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.470
information theory, which is
not just a basis for making

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.470
these amazing quantum
technologies like quantum

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.610
computers or quantum
cryptography,

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.330
which is a way of
encrypting information

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.260
that it's impossible to
tamper with, to eavesdrop on,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.730
without being detected.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.660
It's not just that.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.890
It's really also a new way of
talking about quantum mechanics

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.540
itself.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.700
Talking about quantum mechanics
in terms of information

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.900
allows us to see past all the
old-style paraphernalia of wave

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.650
functions and Schrodinger
equations and quantum jumps,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.010
and, I think, to get closer
to the core of what the theory

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.940
seems to be telling us.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.690
And I want to tell you
a story about that,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.250
and I've got some
props here to help me.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.080
Now I hope it will
be illuminating,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.850
but at the very
least, I'm fairly

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.950
sure that it's the
first time that you

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.110
will have seen quantum
mechanics discussed

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.287
with the help of sylvanians.

00:14:12.287 --> 00:14:12.870
Here they are.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.994
So I have two boxes here, A
and B. One belongs to Alice,

00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:18.160
one belongs to Bob, and
I'll leave you to figure out

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.270
which is which.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:26.560
And they are boxes in which they
produce one of these cute toys,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.170
either a rabbit or a dog,
when we put coins in.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.320
And they will take
either a two-pound coin

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.370
or a one-pound coin.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.910
So we put coin in and we
get one of these toys out.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.130
And there are rules
for how that works.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.530
And I'm just going to stipulate
what some of the rules

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.210
are that these boxes
are going to work by.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.530
First of all, here's the boxes.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.880
So this is what's going on.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.490
And I'm going to say first
of all that rule number

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.480
one, if Alice puts a
one-pound coin into her box,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.240
it will produce a rabbit.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.690
Now I'm going to
add two other rules.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.780
If Alice and Bob both put
in two-pound coins, then

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.124
the boxes between them will
deliver one rabbit and one dog.

00:15:12.124 --> 00:15:14.040
Doesn't specify which
way round that would be,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.610
but we'll just get
that combination.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.300
Any other combination of coins
than both putting in two pounds

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.710
will produce either two
rabbits or two dogs.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.460
I'm just stipulating
these rules.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.510
Now I want to find out what
do the inputs and outputs have

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.310
to be in order to satisfy them?

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.211
A pound in Alice's
produces a rabbit.

00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:33.710
OK.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.190
A pound in Bob's produces what?

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.530
Well, let's think about that.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.710
In fact, we kind of have a
lot of these answers already.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:46.850
So we already know a pound in
Alice's box produces a rabbit.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.840
OK.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.700
Well, when you
think about it, that

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.970
means that whatever Bob puts
in, pound or a two-pound

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.050
has to produce a rabbit
because it could only

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.940
produce a dog in the case
where both put in two pounds.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.000
That's one of our rules.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.890
That's the second rule.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.920
So we've almost got
all the rules already.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.860
All we need to know
now is what happens

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.270
when Alice puts in two pounds.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:12.770
OK.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:20.910
Well, we know that if
Alice puts in two pounds

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.310
and Bob puts in two pounds.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.370
We know we have to get
a dog and a rabbit, OK?

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.480
That's our third rule.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.720
So that means if Alice
puts in two pounds,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.970
Bob puts in two
pounds, we get a dog.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.216
But that means also that we
get a dog in this case as well.

00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:38.090
Alice puts in two pounds,
it gives you a dog.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.720
OK.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.410
The trouble here is that this
doesn't work because we're not

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.224
going to get a dog and a
rabbit in this top case,

00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:49.640
only in the bottom case where
they both put in two pounds.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.070
So that one is wrong.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.130
Now so what it
means is we can only

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.670
satisfy those rules
three times out of four.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.270
We get 75% success rate.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.349
Maybe we can do better.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.650
Well, no matter how you try and
juggle it to see if there are

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.960
any other combinations that
work, you'll find it won't.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.400
This is the best you can do.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.500
You can only satisfy these
rules three times out of four.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.780
OK, but what if
Alice's and Bob's boxes

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.450
could switch their
output depending

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.670
on what the other one put in?

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.589
Then it's a different matter.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.780
You know, then we could
say, maybe, Alice's box

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.300
gives a dog when Bob
puts in two pounds,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.290
but a rabbit when Bob
puts in one pound.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.020
OK, well that might work.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.720
The thing is, then
we have to know

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.124
what one has put in before
the other box decides

00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:44.290
what it's going to give out.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.411
So we need to have
some communication

00:17:46.411 --> 00:17:47.160
between the boxes.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.570
So we need to wipe
them together,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.620
and they'll send a
signal between them.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.930
And then we can do better.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.120
Well, OK, that's
fine, but this signal

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.700
has to travel down the
wire, and it can only

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.040
do that at the speed of light.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.290
That's fine if they're here.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.990
That takes no time
at all virtually,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.430
but it takes some time.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.280
And in fact, even at
the speed of light,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.080
if Alice's box is here
and Bob's box is in,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080
let's say, Fiji, on the
other side of the world,

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.680
it takes tenths of a second
for the signal to travel there.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.030
So we have to wait that long
before Bob puts in his coin,

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.840
before Alice puts in her coin,
whichever way round we do it.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.940
So we can't do any better
than this instantaneously,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.340
if Bob and Alice put in
their coins instantaneously.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.920
So we're kind of stuck.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.740
This communication
won't work if we're

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.430
looking at how to solve this
problem instantaneously.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.830
However, these are
classical boxes.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.470
Now what happens if
they're quantum boxes?

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.400
Well, then we can do
better because it turns out

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.170
that the rules of
quantum mechanics

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.520
permit us what looks like
a kind of communication

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.420
between the boxes that
happens instantly,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.010
and which would allow
the boxes to share

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.660
some information between them
without any physical connection

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.050
between them.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.280
I'm going to say some more
about this quantum effect that

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.390
allows us to do this.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.590
Just take my word
for it at the moment

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.070
that quantum mechanics
allows us to do it.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.500
Well, then we can do better.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.030
Then what Bob puts into
his box can instantaneously

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.400
seem to affect what
Alice puts into her box,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.300
and then we can do better.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.690
So does that mean, then, that
we can satisfy these rules

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.470
all the time?

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.080
Well, actually we can calculate,
using quantum mechanics,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.310
how well we can do in that case.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.240
And it turns out that if
they're quantum boxes,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.210
we can't quite get
100% success rate.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.120
We can get precisely-- well,
not precisely, roughly--

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.210
85% success rate
using this quantum

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.990
what seems like communication
between the boxes.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.350
Now what I just told you about,
this mysterious quantum link,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.960
is the quantum phenomenon
called entanglement.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.780
And I wanted to do
that without any math,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.730
without any Schrodinger equation
of wave particle duality,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.830
even with anti-particles,
just with sylvanians.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.515
Hang on, though.

00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:09.390
What's going on here?

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.530
Because doesn't Einstein's
theory of special relativity

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:18.390
say you can't send any
signals faster than light?

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.640
The speed of light is the
ultimate cosmic speed limit.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.470
Well, that's true.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.360
But you see, what's
going on here

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.550
is that Alice and
Bob can't actually

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.760
verify that they've
got this 85% success

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.760
rate without swapping
information about what

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.890
their boxes produced.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.270
And the only way
they can do that

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.880
is by communicating with each
other in some normal way,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.690
by email, by carrier
pigeon, by letter, whatever.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.630
However they do it, they
can't do it faster than light.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.310
And it turns out
that actually this

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.660
is what special
relativity forbids,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.550
that you can't verify that
you've got this success

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.260
rate faster than light.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.880
And what that
effectively means is

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.890
that Alice and Bob can't use
this quantum entanglement

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:12.120
to send any information to
each other faster than light.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.200
And that, it turns out, is
fine with special relativity.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.520
Well, entanglement
was discovered in 1935

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.910
by Albert Einstein and by
two younger colleagues called

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.240
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen,
who were, perhaps ironically,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.240
trying to show that quantum
mechanics, in their view,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.630
had a shortcoming.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.450
And so Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.340
came up with a
thought experiment

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.712
that they believed
revealed a deep paradox

00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:39.420
at the heart of quantum
theory, and which

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.940
could only be resolved by
adding something more to it.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.080
And this thought experiment
was later put in a clearer form

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.700
by the physicist David
Bohm, and that's the form

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.180
I'm going to talk about now.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.510
And what Bohm envisaged
was something like this.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.180
You have a box
that spits out two

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.810
particles in
opposite directions,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.950
and they are entangled together.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.200
The way they're produced
means that they're entangled.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.240
And what that
means is that there

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.594
is some relation between
the properties of one

00:22:07.594 --> 00:22:08.760
and the properties of other.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.050
And let's think about
it in terms of spins.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.030
So you can entangle
them in such a way

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.910
that if the spin of one
of these particles is up,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.470
the other one has to be down.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.420
So then if we make a
measurement on one of them

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.380
and we see it has a spin up,
we know that the other one

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.970
will have a spin down.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.850
So they're correlated.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.820
Now perhaps you
can see that this

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.360
is a little bit like these two
boxes here, but in the sense

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.270
that the measurement here
is playing the same role

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.350
as me putting coins in.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.550
And what we see,
spin up or spin down,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.930
is a binary choice, just like
getting a rabbit and a dog.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.570
So this was really an
entanglement experiment.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.435
Now actually, this correlation
might sound unremarkable to you

00:22:56.435 --> 00:22:58.310
because you might say,
well, we could do this

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.909
with a pair of gloves, let's
say, a left-handed glove

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:01.950
and a right-handed glove.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.640
We could send one to Alice
in Melbourne or something,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.340
and one to Bob in
Shepherd's Bush.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.040
And then as soon as
Bob opens his parcel

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.080
and sees that he's got
a left-handed glove,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.860
he knows instantly that Alice
has got a right-handed glove.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.590
Instantly he knows that must be
true because they started off

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.230
as a pair.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.670
So what's the big deal?

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.220
Well, here's the big deal.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.310
According to the
Copenhagen interpretation,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.280
the direction of
these spins up or down

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.410
for these two
entangled particles,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.770
unlike the handedness
of those two gloves,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.940
isn't actually determined
until we observe them,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.520
until we make a measurement.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.010
And if that's so,
then this experiment

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.740
by Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen seemed

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.020
to be saying that making a
measurement on one particle

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.690
somehow instantly
fixes the other, as

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.640
if the result of
that measurement

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.810
is being spookily communicated
to the other particle

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.490
instantly.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.510
This is what Einstein called
spooky action at a distance.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.200
And again, he said
it can't be right

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.360
because special relativity
seems to forbid it.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.160
Well, for a long time
no one knew quite

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.950
how to sort of resolve
this paradox, what

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.210
the flaw in the reasoning
or what the problem was.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.487
Or maybe Einstein and
Podolsky and Rosen were right.

00:24:16.487 --> 00:24:18.070
No one knew what to
do with it, and it

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.170
was brushed under the carpet.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.530
That changed in 1964,
when an Irish physicist

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.815
named John Bell, whose job--

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:28.690
sort of like John's, I
guess-- was a particle

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.280
physicist at CERN in Geneva.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.320
But in his spare time, he turned
quantum mechanics on its head,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.800
and he reformulated the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.350
experiment in a
way that showed how

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.110
you could make a measurement
to try to figure out

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.180
what was going on here.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.096
And in fact, what he's
drawn on the blackboard

00:24:47.096 --> 00:24:49.439
there is basically a
diagram of the experiment

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:50.230
that he thought of.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.660
And this experiment,
this procedure,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.400
it's kind of slightly analogous
to these black boxes here

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.720
because what John Bell basically
showed was that if you make

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.780
some measurements and you find
that there's a certain amount

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.870
of correlation-- in fact, in his
case, again, 75% correlation,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.520
so the rules seem to be
obeyed 75% of the time--

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.030
then it shows that
you've got something

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.590
like classical
physics, or in fact,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.290
something like what Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen thought

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.650
was going on, which was
basically saying those spins

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.790
must have been fixed all along
somehow by some variable that

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.880
is hidden, that we can't
see and can't measure.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.870
But if you get a better
correlation between the two

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.230
spins, if you get this 85% that
quantum mechanics predicts,

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.590
then Einstein's
picture doesn't hold.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.150
Quantum mechanics must be right.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.930
You must get this strange
what looks like communication.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.240
And when these
experiments were done--

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.890
they were first
done in the 1970s,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.120
they were first done kind of
more rigorously in the 1980s,

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.010
have been done
countless times since--

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.680
every time they've shown
the same clear result,

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.480
that quantum mechanics is right.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.840
You get a better
correlation than any kind

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.470
of classical physics or any
kind of Einstein-like hidden

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.600
variables picture can give you.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.060
So entanglement really happens.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.570
But what was wrong, then,
with Einstein's reasoning

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.810
in this experiment?

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.590
Well, he made the perfectly
reasonable assumption--

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.530
so reasonable we didn't even
realise it was an assumption--

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.350
that we can call
locality, that the idea

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.760
that the properties of a
particle, of an object,

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.335
are located on that object.

00:26:34.335 --> 00:26:35.710
I mean, it just
stands to reason.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.130
This box's blackness
is in the box.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.600
What would it
possibly mean to say

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.860
this box's blackness is also
kind of partly in this box?

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.900
But in quantum mechanics, we do
seem to say things like that.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.820
It seems that
properties of objects,

00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:00.350
of quantum objects, when they're
entangled, can be non-local.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:05.217
And it's only if we make
this assumption of locality--

00:27:05.217 --> 00:27:06.800
that everything to
do with this object

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.100
is fixed here in this location--
it's only in that assumption

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.320
that we have to start
thinking about spooky action

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.410
at a distance and this kind
of affecting this instantly

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.450
through space.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.340
What quantum
mechanics really tells

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.370
us is that there's something
else, this thing that

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.450
is just vaguely called quantum
non-locality, which means

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.710
that there's a kind of mixing
of these two things that is very

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.140
hard to put into
words, but it means

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.980
that there's a non-local
influence that means,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.220
in effect, we can no longer
think of these two boxes

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.140
as separate objects.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.610
That's what entanglement means.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.540
They've somehow become part
of the same quantum entity.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.890
So quantum non-locality isn't
spooky action at a distance.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.470
It's the alternative to
spooky action at a distance.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.860
Now Erwin Schrodinger,
when he saw what Einstein,

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.480
Podolsky and Rosen had said, he
recognised that this phenomenon

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.110
of entanglement actually was
pretty central to what quantum

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.040
mechanics was really about.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.890
And in fact,
entanglement is what

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:16.240
happens all the time when any
quantum particle interacts

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.350
with any other.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.970
They have to become entangled.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.660
That is the only
thing that can happen,

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.580
according to quantum physics.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:30.780
And what this means is that
as a quantum object starts

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.800
to interact with its
environment, its quantumness,

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.577
you could say--

00:28:35.577 --> 00:28:37.410
or you could say if
it's in a superposition,

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:42.500
its superposition starts to
spread into the environment.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.110
And it becomes harder
to see the quantumness,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.740
that superposition, in the
original object itself.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.220
It's sort of spread out like
an ink drop spreading in water.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.510
And so what that
effectively means

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.270
is that the quantumness
starts to get washed away.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.540
This entanglement
leads to a loss.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.300
Technically the word
is a decoherence

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.950
of quantum properties.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.340
And it seems to
be that ultimately

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.770
leads to quantum objects
behaving like classical objects

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.660
as they start to interact
with their environment.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.040
So what that's really telling
us, and what we can now say,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.830
is that there isn't some
strange situation in which

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.680
little things like atoms
obey quantum rules, and then,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.950
for some reason, big things
like us obey classical rules,

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.600
and they're just
different things.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.210
Actually, we can
now say that this

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.430
is what quantum mechanics
looks like when you're

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.660
six feet tall, that the
weirdness that we talk about

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.200
in quantum mechanics is just
the way the world works.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.540
And in fact, it's
kind of us that

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.260
are weird because by the time
quantum mechanics has become

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.020
this scale, it kind of
looks different to how

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.340
it does when you're talking
about photons and electrons.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.040
Why, though, does
quantum mechanics only

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.550
allow us 85% success?

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.090
Why doesn't it allow us 100%?

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.040
Well, it turns out that
the answer, really,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.340
is about how efficiently
these boxes can share

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.590
that information about,
in this case, what

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.700
coin was put into them.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.420
It's about the efficiency
of information sharing.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.720
If we can make use of
quantum entanglement,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.120
then we can improve
the efficiency

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.820
with which information
is shared between quantum

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.190
objects like qubits.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:37.130
And this is really how quantum
computing gets its power,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.920
by more efficiently
sharing the information

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.850
among the different
bits of the system

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.380
than we can use when
we're using classical bits

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.280
like little
transistors in laptops.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.320
And what it also
tells us is that

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.744
what makes quantum
mechanics quantum at root

00:30:53.744 --> 00:30:55.160
doesn't really
have anything to do

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.940
with notions of wave functions
and collapse and wave particle

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.870
duality.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.890
It's really about what can and
can't be done with information.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:08.180
And let me give you a sense
of where that's leading us

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.710
because it's meant that some
researchers feel that we might

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.690
be able to reconstruct quantum
mechanics from scratch, getting

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.330
rid of things like the
Schrodinger equation of waves

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.700
and particles, but just using
some simple axioms about what

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.520
is and what isn't
permitted with information,

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.210
how it can be encoded and
transferred and shared

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.950
and read out.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.840
And I want to give you just a
flavour of one of these what

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.480
are now called quantum
reconstructions.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.790
This is one-- there are
many-- this is one suggested

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:46.600
in 2009 by Borjvoje
Dakic and Caslav Brukner

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.200
at the University of Vienna.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.080
And they proposed
three what they said

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.060
were reasonable
axioms from which we

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.070
might try and construct
quantum mechanics.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.520
And here they are.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.350
They probably don't look
that reasonable, or even

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.974
that, necessarily,
intelligible to you,

00:31:58.974 --> 00:32:01.190
but I'll just briefly
say what they mean.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.019
Information capacity
was the first one.

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:04.810
They said, let's assume
that all the stuff,

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.940
all the basic entities,
whatever they are,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.400
that make up the
world can encode

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.659
just one bit of information.

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:13.700
They're like those spins.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.980
They can just be up
or down and that's it.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.010
That's all they can hold.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.275
Now they call this
assumption locality.

00:32:21.275 --> 00:32:23.150
Is a bit confusing
because I've just told you

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.470
about quantum non-locality.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.070
But the locality, in this case,
means kind of something a bit

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.570
different.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.060
All it really means
is that there's

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.710
nothing hidden behind the
scenes that's allowing stuff

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:34.920
to be done with information.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.320
There's no secret
device underneath here

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.610
that's allowing these
boxes to communicate.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.060
And lastly, this idea
of reversibility.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.150
They said let's assume
that these bits that

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.640
can hold just one
bit of information,

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.540
they can be
converted reversibly.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.930
You can go from a one to
zero, from a spin up to a spin

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.100
down and back again.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.760
OK.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.400
They said, and they showed,
that with just these three

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.820
rules about what can be
done with information,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.190
you get two possible types
of physics out of them.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.900
One is classical physics
and one is quantum physics,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.650
with just these rules.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.460
What's more, if you tweak
this third axiom a little bit

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.180
to say that let's
assume that in order

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.360
to do this reversible
sort of flipping of spins,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:25.160
that let's assume that you
can do it continuously.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.760
You can continuously sort of
rotate a spin up to a spin

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.930
down.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.290
If you assume that,
you get quantum rules.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.740
If you assume it has to
be just one or the other

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.290
without this sort of
continuous rotation--

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.690
so like a flipping a
coin, heads or tails.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.270
Once it's down there, it
goes to heads or tails

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:49.690
and you can't interconvert them,
then you get classical rules.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.420
Well, I find that
kind of extraordinary.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.500
You can get so much out of
what seems like so little.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.840
And the point about these
axioms, about information,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.529
is that they can, by themselves,
lead to what looks like quantum

00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:02.820
behaviour, and all the stuff
that we get out of quantum

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.040
mechanics like superpositions
and entanglement.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.489
And some researchers think that
these reconstructions might

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.679
lead us to a completely
different perspective

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.889
on quantum theory, perhaps one
in which the physical meaning

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:18.030
of all this seemingly
strange behaviour is clear.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.480
Well, that remains to be seen.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.000
But what's already
illuminating is

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.360
how they focus on this
question of information,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.480
on how answers, or
measurement outcomes,

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.320
are contingent on the
questions we ask just

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.350
as the outcome of these boxes,
what comes out of these boxes,

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.850
is contingent on what we put
in, a one-pound or a two-pound.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.500
And I think this is
the most productive way

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.940
to think about
quantum mechanics.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.290
And there's a very nice metaphor
for this perspective that

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.929
was suggested by John Wheeler.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.139
Now John Wheeler, he
studied under Bohm,

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:54.630
and he actually had
Feynman as his student.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.460
And he had this
wonderful metaphor

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.120
for how our answers
about reality

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.210
can emerge from the
questions that we ask,

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.460
in a way that is
perfectly consistent

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.060
and rule-bound and
non-random, without requiring

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.660
any preexisting truth
about how things were.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.700
And this is how it goes.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.720
It's based on the
game of 20 Questions.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.240
So this is this game I'm sure
you all know, where everyone

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.959
chooses, let's say, a person.

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:27.000
One person goes out of
the room and everyone else

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.050
chooses a person.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.140
And then this one person has
to come back in and find out

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.810
who that person is
by asking questions.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.960
And they have to be questions
that only have a yes

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.570
or no answer, binary questions.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.281
As you can see, this is
actually a quantum game.

00:35:42.281 --> 00:35:42.780
OK.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.410
So let's say we
play it like this.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.180
Person goes outside.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.950
We all decide on a person.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.170
Well, we all do our
thing, and then the person

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.260
comes back and starts
asking questions.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:03.000
And on this occasion, the
person who's come back in,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.740
she starts off in
the normal way.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.590
She says is this
person alive or dead?

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.470
Well, no, what I should
say, is this person dead?

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.790
And the answer's yes.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:13.290
.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.270
Is this person male?

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.260
Yes.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.120
OK.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.767
And so it goes on, except
that the questioner finds

00:36:21.767 --> 00:36:23.475
that as she asks more
and more questions,

00:36:23.475 --> 00:36:26.040
it takes longer for
the answer to come.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.920
The person she asks sort of has
to think about it for a while

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.380
before giving the answer, which
is kind of odd because you

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.870
know, surely it's either
one thing or the other.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.720
Why do you have
to think about it?

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.000
Anyway, the game goes
on, and eventually she

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.030
thinks she's narrowing
in on who it is.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.855
And eventually she says, I know.

00:36:40.855 --> 00:36:41.730
It's Richard Feynman.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.740
And everyone says, yes, it's
Richard Feynman, and everyone

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.260
laughs, and the game is over.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.051
But then she says,
well, what was going on?

00:36:47.051 --> 00:36:49.080
Why did it take you
so long each time,

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.089
when I was asking more
and questions, to answer?

00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:55.380
And everyone explains that
they'd played the game a bit

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.050
differently.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.600
They decided that they weren't
going to decide on a person.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.880
They were simply
going to make sure

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.910
that whatever answer
each individual gave

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.730
when they were asked
was consistent with all

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:13.380
the other answers in applying,
at least, to someone,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.450
ideally someone famous.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:20.570
So as soon as the first
question, is this person dead,

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.969
was answered yes, all the
other people's answers

00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:25.260
had to be consistent with that.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.550
Had to be a dead person
that they were thinking of.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.924
Then it had to be a dead male
that they were thinking of,

00:37:29.924 --> 00:37:31.320
and so on.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.290
But the first person
could just equally well

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.630
have said no to
that first question,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.690
and then they would have
converged on someone else, not

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.080
Richard Feynman.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.300
So the options become
more and more constrained

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.590
as the questions proceed.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.470
And it took longer to figure
out who still is going to work?

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.290
Who's going to be consistent
with all these answers so far?

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:55.130
And everyone was forced by
the nature of the questions

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.960
to converge on the same person.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.617
If you had asked
different questions,

00:37:58.617 --> 00:38:00.450
you'd have ended up
with a different answer.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.450
So context mattered.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.570
There never was a
preordained answer.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.640
You brought it into
being, and in a way

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.360
that was fully consistent with
all the questions you'd asked.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.930
What's more, the very notion
of there being an answer

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.170
only makes sense when
you play the game.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.690
It's meaningless to
ask who the chosen

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:24.230
person is in that
situation without asking

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.090
the questions about them.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.730
And quantum mechanics
is a theory a bit

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.940
like this, I think, of what
is and what isn't knowable,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.400
and how those
knowns are related,

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.460
and how they emerge from
the questions we ask.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.170
And I like to think
of this in terms

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.620
of a distinction between
a theory of isness

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.020
and a theory of ifness.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.930
Quantum mechanics doesn't
tell us how a thing is.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.920
It tells us what it
could be along with--

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.320
and this is crucial--

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.070
along with a logic
of the relationships

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.680
between those coulds
and the probability

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.180
that it could be this.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.890
So if this, then that.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.250
And what this means is
that to truly describe

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:05.720
the features of
quantum mechanics,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.970
as far as that's
possible at the moment,

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.850
I think we should replace
all the conventional isms

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.610
of quantum mechanics that I kind
of started off at the beginning

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.690
with ifms.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.840
For example, we couldn't
say here it is a particle,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.681
there it is a wave.

00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:22.430
Rather, we should say
if we measure things

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.970
like this, then the quantum
object behaves in a manner

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.080
that we associate
with particles,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.310
but if we measure it like
that, behaves in a manner that

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:32.840
is like a wave.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.320
We shouldn't say the particle
is in two places at once.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.570
We should say if we measure it--

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:39.920
if we measure it--

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.760
we will detect this state with
probability x and this state

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.160
with probability y.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.442
Now this ifness is
kind of perplexing

00:39:48.442 --> 00:39:50.900
because it's not what we've
come to associate with science.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.760
We're used to science
telling us how things are.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.820
And if there are
ifs that arise, it's

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.040
simply because we
don't know enough.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.040
We're partly ignorant
about those how things are.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.720
But in quantum
mechanics, it seems

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.520
like those ifs are fundamental.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.920
Well, OK, but what's the stuff
that this ifness is all about?

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.320
Quantum mechanics doesn't,
obviously, tell us

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.020
anything about that, and
all we have right now are

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.300
hints and guesses.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.500
And to try to bring
them into sharper focus

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.430
is a tricky business,
which I think

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.790
means we have to use sometimes
an almost poetic level

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.470
of expression, the
kind of thing that

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.900
will send a lot of physicists
scurrying for cover.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.110
Take this attempt, for example,
by the physicist Chris Fuchs.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.890
He says "Perhaps the world
is sensitive to our touch.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:42.310
It has a kind of zing that makes
it fly off in ways that were

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.260
not imaginable classically.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.170
The whole structure of quantum
mechanics maybe nothing

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.590
more than the optimal method
of reasoning and processing

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.480
information in the light of
such a fundamental, wonderful

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.090
sensitivity."

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:00.970
And what Fuchs means here
is not the mundane truism

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.340
that the human observer
disturbs the world.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.700
Rather, he's saying quantum
mechanics may be the machinery

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:11.320
that we humans need, at
a scale pitched midway

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.820
between the subatomic
and the galactic,

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:21.580
to try to compile and quantify
information about a world that

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.490
has this incredibly
sensitive character

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.700
so it embodies what
we've learned about how

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.920
to navigate in such a place.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.990
Well, at any rate,
I think it's vital

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.280
that we understand that
this ifness doesn't imply

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.050
that the world, our
world, our home,

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.550
is holding anything
back from us.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.790
It's just that classical
physics has primed

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.990
us to expect too much from it.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.130
We've just become accustomed
to asking questions and getting

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.140
answers, getting
definite answers--

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.370
what colour is it?

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.330
How heavy is it?

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.250
How fast is it moving?--

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.890
forgetting the almost
ludicrous amount

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:06.620
that we don't know about most
things around us in detail.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.860
We figure that we could
just go on forever asking

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.840
questions and being answered
at ever smaller scales.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.510
When we discovered
that we can't, we

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.920
felt shortchanged by nature,
and we pronounced it weird.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.230
Well, that won't do anymore.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.240
Nature does its
best, and we need

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.590
to adjust our expectations.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.570
We need to go beyond weird.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:31.730
Thank you.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.580
[APPLAUSE]
