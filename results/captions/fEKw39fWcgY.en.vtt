you guys think you're funny.

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:28.637
That's funny.

&gt;&gt; All right, sit.

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:29.728

&gt;&gt; Good, how are you?

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:31.495
&gt;&gt; I'm good.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.122
Okay, leave the money in your pocket.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:36.096
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, do you know these guys?

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:36.959
You know their movies?

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:37.503
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.417
&gt;&gt; What movies do you know?

00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:40.598
&gt;&gt; I know Daddy's Home, I know Elf.

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:41.370
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.666
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I know-

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.738
&gt;&gt; Boogie Nights?

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:46.790
&gt;&gt; Boogie Nights?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.558

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that one.

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:51.370
No, I don't, I don't know that one.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.417
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You sure?

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:53.475
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No, that's all I know.

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:54.346
&gt;&gt; All right, well, that's all right.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.006
And do think you're gonna win?

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:56.430
You think you're smarter than them?

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.971
Okay.

00:00:57.971 --> 00:00:59.109
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.750
&gt;&gt; You look smarter than us,
that's for sure.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.107
&gt;&gt; How do you do in school, pretty well?
&gt;&gt; I do pretty well, yeah.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:03.742
I'm a straight-A student.

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:04.806
&gt;&gt; Good, that's good.

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:08.939
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right,

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.899
you can get behind your podiums-
&gt;&gt; There we go, okay.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:13.572
&gt;&gt; And I will ask the questions.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.445
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, now,

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:20.506
you can see you might have to
write something down, you may not.

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:23.212
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, that's your department.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:25.807
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; I won't be buzzing anything.

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:28.500
&gt;&gt; Two of the biggest stars on
the planet are Will and Mark.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.949
What is the seventh planet from the sun?

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:32.745
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Yes, Zachary?

&gt;&gt; Yes, it is!

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.616
&gt;&gt; Hey, yours.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:42.565
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.245
&gt;&gt; You hear what he said about you?

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.838
He said up your anus.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:48.104
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Man, this kid is a.

00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:49.458

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:50.300
Here we go.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.196
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:53.502

&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; How many legs does a butterfly have?

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:02.335
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the question?

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.945
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You know, when I hit a shot and

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.971
it lands real soft on the green,
just a little spin back,

00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:08.679
I say it landed like
a butterfly with sore feet.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.737
&gt;&gt; How many-
&gt;&gt; Four.

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:11.330

&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:16.639
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.083
&gt;&gt; Yeah, keep that fired up.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:19.710
&gt;&gt; Are you looking stuff up?

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.766
&gt;&gt; I'm asking Siri a couple of questions.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.485
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see if Siri is as fast.

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:23.755
Here we go.

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:27.064
A heptagon is a shape with how many sides?

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.049
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Seven.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:29.983

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Yes, you got a heptagon!

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:35.856
&gt;&gt; Enjoy it while you can,
that's the only one you get.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.667
&gt;&gt; Hey, we got a heptagon, boy.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:38.393
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:39.529
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Boy.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:40.101
&gt;&gt; Zachary's getting cocky.

00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:41.177
&gt;&gt; You got a heptagon?

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:42.191
&gt;&gt; You got a heptagon?

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.904
&gt;&gt; I got one!

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:45.441
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna turn you into
a heptagon after this is over.

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.907
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; How many bones are in a typical adult

00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:51.125
human's body?

&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.743
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.726
&gt;&gt; As Gwen Stefani once said,

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:03.273
this blank is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:04.637
[SOUND].

00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:05.463
So spell bananas backwards.

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:08.268
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I thought you said the word [BLEEP].

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.500
&gt;&gt; That's the lyrics to the song.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.383
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I didn't want to say
[BLEEP] cuz there's a kid here.

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:15.969
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; But you just said [BLEEP].

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:16.804
&gt;&gt; You said [BLEEP].
&gt;&gt; You said [BLEEP].

00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:17.573
&gt;&gt; I said [BLEEP].
&gt;&gt; Now you said [BLEEP] how many times?

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:18.548
Four.

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:21.858
&gt;&gt; My mom talks like a truck driver and
I have a 15-year-old sister.

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:23.508
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:24.975

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:31.598
&gt;&gt; Aerospace engineers are foul-mouthed.

00:03:31.598 --> 00:03:34.922
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Write it out, then, just so they know.

00:03:34.922 --> 00:03:37.176
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

&gt;&gt; All right, here we go.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.195
&gt;&gt; Here we go.
&gt;&gt; We're back on track.
