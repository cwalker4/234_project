00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:02.804
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:04.606
ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME.

00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:07.175
JOINING US NOW, A MAN WHO

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.011
DESERVED A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:10.012
THIS MOMENT, SENATOR LINDSAY

00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:11.980
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:14.516
SENATOR, I’M HAPPY --

00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:15.451
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:16.585
&gt;&gt; Sean: I’M HAPPY ABOUT THE

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:17.853
SUCCESS THE COUNTRY HAS HAD.

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:20.756
YOU TOLD ME WHEN I SAW YOU IN

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:22.224
WASHINGTON, I SAID, WHAT’S SUSAN

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:22.958
COLLINS LIKE, I SKPT YOU THE

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:26.628
QUESTION.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.230
YOU SAID SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.633
WILL SWAY HER, AND SHE WILL

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:31.967
WILL LOOK AT EVERY FACT, NOBODY

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:33.235
DECIDE, I THINK THAT WAS THE

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:34.570
MOST POWERFUL SPEECH I’VE SEEN

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:35.871
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:38.574
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT’S HISTORIC.

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:39.975
IT CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.710
WHERE WE’RE HEADED IN THE SENATE

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.212
IN TERMS OF CONFIRMING JUDGES.

00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:45.114
SHE ADOPTED THE RULE OF LAW,

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.716
REJECTED THE RULE OF THE MOB.

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:49.752
IF I HAD TO TELL?

00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:52.188
A GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:53.222
KAVANAUGH, I WOULD ASK THEM TO

00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:54.824
LOOK AT SUSAN’S SPEECH.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.760
IT WAS INCREDIBLE IN DETAIL.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.195
FORCEFULLY DELIVERED.

00:00:59.196 --> 00:00:59.929
SHE DIDN’T LOOK LIKE SHE WAS

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.863
PAINED.

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:02.832
SHE HATED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.400
PROCESS BUT SHE WAS CONFIDENT

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.635
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS THE

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.971
RIGHT GUY AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:10.173
I THINK SHE SAVED THE SENATE AND

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.174
THE ABYSS.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:12.508
THE JUDICIARY FROM SLIDING INTO

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.344
&gt;&gt; Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.446
ARGUE I DON’T THINK WE WOULD BE

00:01:16.447 --> 00:01:17.847
HERE WITHOUT YOUR COURAGE.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:18.815
BUT, NO, I’VE KNOWN YOU A LONG

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:20.817
TIME.

00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:21.217
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:22.786
WE’VE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:24.854
&gt;&gt; I’M SURE WE WILL AGAIN.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.356
&gt;&gt; Sean: THANKS, SENATOR.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.258
I CAN’T WAIT FOR THE NEXT

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:28.591
BATTLE.

00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:30.226
&gt;&gt; ME, TOO I’M GETTING TIRED OF

00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.829
THE LOVEFEST CRAP.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.196
[LAUGHING]

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:34.598
&gt;&gt; Sean: THERE’S A LOT MORE ON

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.933
THE BALLOT IN 32 DAYS.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:37.601
AM I WRONG?

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:41.371
I’M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I’VE BEEN

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:41.771
WITNESSING.

00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:43.673
&gt;&gt; THERE’S TWO CHOICES, THE

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:44.574
SUSAN COLLINS WAY OR THE

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:45.942
PROTESTER WAY.

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:47.844
WHO DO YOU WANT TO RUN THE

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:48.545
GOVERNMENT?

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:49.913
CONSERVATIVES ALIGNED WITH

00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:52.316
SENATOR COLLINS, TRYING TO WORK

00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:54.451
TOWARD EMPOWERING PEOPLE, MAKING

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:56.520
POCKET.

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.754
OR DO YOU WANT TO TURN YOUR

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:59.089
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.524
JUST YELL AND SPIT ON YOU.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.926
TO ME, THIS IS A REALLY

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:03.594
IMPORTANT TIME IN AMERICAN

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.262
HISTORY.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:07.264
IT’S NOW ALL ABOUT KAVANAUGH.

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:07.965
BEFORE IT WAS ABOUT A LOT OF

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.066
THINGS.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:10.401
NOW IT’S PRETTY SIMPLE.

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:12.136
IF YOU VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:13.370
PARTY YOU’RE TURNING YOUR

00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:15.439
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.107

TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU F YOU KEEP
FOLLOW YOU AROUND, SPIT ON YOU,

TRY TO INTIMIDATE YOU F YOU KEEP

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:20.778
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN PLACE,

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.813
THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE AN

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:24.348
ALLIANCE BETWEEN SUSAN COLLINS

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.217
AND OTHERS TO KEEP US SAFE AND

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:27.551
MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER.

00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:29.253
PRETTY SIMPLE CHOICE.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:31.656
&gt;&gt; Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:33.024
REALLY BELIEVE THIS, AFTER WHAT

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:34.625
WE’VE WITNESSED NOW, AND THIS

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:35.927
HAS BEEN BUILDING.

00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:39.730
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THE

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:40.565
HALLS, WHERE YOUR OFFICES ARE.

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:43.067
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:44.235
&gt;&gt; Sean: I HONESTLY FEAR

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.303
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT

00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:45.603
HERE.

00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:46.637
&gt;&gt; ME TOO.

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:48.239
I’VE NEVER, YOU KNOW, WE’VE

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.074
BEEN, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.276
LIKE ABOUT SENATOR COLLINS, IF

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:52.277
YOU THINK CAN YOU CHANGE HER

00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:53.478
MIND BY YELLING AT HER AND

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.412
SHOWING UP AT HER HOUSE YOU’RE

00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:56.347
DEAD WRONG.

00:02:56.348 --> 00:02:57.749
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.317
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,

00:02:59.318 --> 00:03:01.519
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.653
THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.356
IN MY LIFETIME, THAT A MAN IS

00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:07.158
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT,

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.494
FACTS DON’T MATTER, SMEARING HIM

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:10.061
EQUATES TO HIM BEING

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.463
DISQUALIFIED.

00:03:11.464 --> 00:03:12.130
SHE STOOD TALL.

00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.298
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.233
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.367
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.068
TO COME TO HIS AID.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.837
THE AID OF AN INDEPENDENT

00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:19.871
THAT’S EXACTLY -- SUSAN CAME TO

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:21.673
JUDICIARY TONIGHT.

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:23.108
&gt;&gt; Sean: IS IT TRUE THAT SENATOR

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.476
DAINS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:25.911
MAKE IT TO WALK HIS DAUGHTER

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:27.446
DOWN THE AISLE, YOU WORKED THAT

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:27.713
OUT?

00:03:27.714 --> 00:03:28.447
&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY HAVE WORKED IT

00:03:28.448 --> 00:03:29.281
OUT.

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:30.682
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:32.584
BOTH.

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:33.585
BUT WE’RE HUMAN BEINGS IS THE

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:34.586
POINT.

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:36.188
WE’RE NOT PERFECT.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.022
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A HUMAN

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:38.257
BEING.

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:40.192
AND IT’S ALL GOING TO TURN OUT

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.027
WELL, GOD BLESS SUSAN COLLINS

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:43.729
AND JEFF FLAKE.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.197
&gt;&gt; Sean: HONESTLY, THOSE THAT

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:47.599
FOOD UP FOR DUE PROCESS, THOSE

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.335
THAT STOOD UP FOR THE

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:50.836
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, I

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:51.637
THOUGHT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE

00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:54.174
ALL AGREE AND APPARENTLY THIS IS
