00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.120
At the start of Game of Thrones, Jaime Lannister
is like an R-rated version of Shrek’s Prince

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
Charming – he’s an arrogant, selfish,
violent knight, who roots his sister, and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.900
tries to murder a child.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.090
Jaime’s a bad guy, and it looks like author
George Martin originally planned to keep him

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.280
that way.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.990
In an old outline of the series, written before
the first book, Martin says that Jaime would

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.000
become king – taking the Throne by murdering
everyone in his way . It also says that Sansa

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.540
would have a child with Joffrey, Tyrion would
fall in love with Arya, and that Catelyn would

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.910
be killed by white walkers.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.080
So the actual story turned out very different
to this outline.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.180
Because Martin doesn’t like to stick to
a plan when he writes.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.470
He says he writes not like an architect, but
like a gardener – he lets his characters

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.660
gradually develop and grow, and he follows
where they lead.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.899
Which means sometimes his characters surprise
him – and become something he didn’t expect.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.040
Jaime is a great example of this – cause
over five books and seven seasons, he grows

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.340
into someone much more complex than even the
author imagined.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.780
In the first couple books, Jaime really is
just awful.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.320
He’s arrogant and vain , wearing glittering
gilded armour . He’s impulsive, reckless,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.690
and violent – willing to kill anyone who
gets in his way . He tries to kill Bran for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.170
seeing him with Cersei.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.690
He kills three Stark men to intimidate Ned
. He implies he’d have hurt or killed Arya

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.400
if he’d caught her . And he uses cruel words
to hurt people . Apart from his twin sister

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.479
Cersei, his brother Tyrion, and his father
Tywin, Jaime doesn’t seem to care about

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.400
anyone , or anything . He doesn’t believe
in anything.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.119
He thinks that knights and the Kingsguard
are corrupt , that gods and religion are bullshit

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.490
. When confronted with the evils of the world,
Jaime just laughs . Catelyn thinks Jaime is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.610
“vile” . “There is nothing here but
arrogance and pride” – “If there was

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.979
ever a spark of honor in him, it is long dead”
. Jaime seems irredeemable, but in Book 3,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.270
we start to learn why Jaime is the way he
is.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.639
Jaime was born the son and heir of the rich
and powerful Lord Tywin Lannister.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:25.609
Jaime grew tall and beautiful , with golden
hair, like his twin Cersei – who he had

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.489
an incestuous relationship with from a young
age . Jaime’s other love was the sword – he

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.870
was a highly skilled fighter , and dreamed
of being a great warrior . When he was fifteen,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.640
he fought outlaws alongside the famous Arthur
Dayne, and was knighted on the battlefield

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.450
. Later, he joined the Kingsguard, a famed
brotherhood sworn to protect the king.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.480
Kingsguard can’t marry or hold land – so
Jaime gave up his claim as heir to Casterly

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
Rock.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.269
But Jaime had never wanted to rule . He wanted
“Honor and glory” as a brother of the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.739
Kingsguard – and he wanted to be close to
Cersei at King’s Landing . So at fifteen,

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.909
the Kingsguard seemed like everything Jaime
had ever wanted – but it soon soured . It

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.569
turned out that the king, Aerys Targaryen,
only took Jaime into the Kingsguard to piss

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.120
off Tywin and to use Jaime as a sort of a
hostage – ““He’ll win no glory here,”

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.559
the king had said” . Tywin got mad and left
the capital with Cersei – separating Jaime

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.819
from his twin and lover who he joined the
guard for in the first place.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.079
So Jaime got no Cersei, and no glory – and
was stuck serving a mad king.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.989
Aerys grew more and more violent and cruel
– he liked to burn men alive, and he attacked

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.590
his wife Rhaella . And since Jaime had sworn
to obey, he could only stand and watch – trying

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.819
to “look without seeing” the burning men
that would haunt him all his life . Eventually,

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.109
the kingdoms rose against Aerys, in Robert’s
Rebellion.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.519
And near the end of the war, Jaime killed
Aerys – the king he’d sworn to protect.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:11.159
Westerosi society takes sacred oaths seriously
– so forever after, Jaime is hated as the

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.709
Kingslayer, an oathbreaker, “A man with
shit for honor” .

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.940
The irony is that people hate Jaime for best
thing he ever did . We learn in Book 3 that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.960
the reason why Jaime killed Aerys was that
Aerys planned to burn down King’s Landing

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.070
– to kill thousands of innocent people with
wildfire . Jaime killed the king to save the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.380
city – but no one knows this.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.180
Cause after Jaime killed Aerys, Eddard Stark
arrived and looked at Jaime with cold eyes

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.110
“full of judgement” . Ned didn’t wanna
hear Jaime’s explanations – “He only

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.750
had to look at [him] to judge [him] guilty”
. So it seems that Jaime felt he couldn’t

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.060
explain the wildfire plot to people – that
no one would listen, or believe him.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.520
But what really gets to Jaime is the judgement.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.000
Jaime is haunted by memories of Ned Stark,
Prince Rhaegar, the Kingsguard.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.860
They represent Jaime’s failures – his
broken oaths, the blood on his hands – not

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.090
only of Aerys, but of Rhaegar’s family,
who died under Jaime’s watch . Deep down,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.800
Jaime’s ashamed at the man he became . And
the way he deals with this is to hide his

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.520
insecurities, and laugh at everything , and
pretend he doesn’t care . People say he’s

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.060
a bad knight and a bad Kingsguard – so Jaime
mocks knighthood and Kingsguard, says it’s

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.411
all corrupt anyway . People say the gods will
punish him, so Jaime says gods aren’t real

00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:41.660
. All his cynicism, sarcasm, nihilism are
defence mechanisms to protect him from criticism.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.000
It’s kinda like what Tyrion says, to wear
your identity like armour . Tyrion plays the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.320
Imp, Sandor plays the Hound, and Jaime plays
the callous uncaring Kingslayer.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.550
It’s easier to play a villain than to face
the pain of old trauma, to grapple with grey

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.140
morality and the shame and guilt of failure.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.050
Jaime distracts himself with the two things
he’s good at – fighting with swords, and

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.210
sex with Cersei . Cause in combat and sex,
you don’t have to think about the past or

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.500
the future, you live only in the moment – Jaime
says time sleeps when swords wake . But in

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.640
Book 3, Jaime loses these distractions, and
is forced to face his past and his future.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.670
Jaime is captured by Robb Stark, then he’s
freed by Catelyn on the promise that he’ll

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.020
return Sansa and Arya to the Starks . So Jaime
travels to King’s Landing with Brienne.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.910
But along the way, they’re captured by the
Brave Companions, or Locke in the show, who

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.701
suddenly, brutally, cut off Jaime’s hand
– his sword hand, the part of him that him

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:53.200
that makes him who his is . It’s the hand
Jaime used to kill Aerys, to cripple Bran,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.330
to love Cersei . He loses “his glory and
his shame, both at once.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.620
Leaving what?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.660
Who am I now?”

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.550
Jaime asks . Proud Jaime Lannister is devastated,
brought low , he almost just gives up and

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.230
dies – but he’s urged to live by Brienne.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.870
Brienne and Jaime have a complex relationship.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.710
At first, they hate each other.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.220
Jaime calls Brienne “wench” , and thinks
she’s a “stupid” “ugly” “freak”.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.680
Brienne calls Jaime Kingslayer, and thinks
he’s a “monster” for his crimes . But

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.380
Jaime and Brienne have some things in common.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.639
They’re both outsiders in society – Jaime
as the Kingslayer, and Brienne as a misfit

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.139
female warrior.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:40.600
Eventually, they start to respect each other
– not as Kingslayer and wench, but as Jaime

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.000
and Brienne.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.550
They learn from each other.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.870
Jaime shows Brienne that doing the right thing
can be more complicated than she thought.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:55.520
And Brienne shows Jaime that even in cruel
complex world, a true knight persists.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.419
Even when she fails, even when no one believes
in her – Brienne keeps her word, and defends

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.690
the weak, and does what’s right . And so
should Jaime.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.070
So Jaime learns from Brienne’s example.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.100
He heroically rescues Brienne from a bear,
and later he gives her a priceless Valyrian

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.310
sword called Oathkeeper – so Brienne can
keep Jaime’s oath to return Sansa to the

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.310
Starks.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.160
“[Sansa] is my last chance for honor”,
Jaime says.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.850
So Brienne looks for her – for Catelyn’s
sake, and for Jaime’s .

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.520
Jaime returns to King’s Landing a changed
man . He’s gone through hell, he’s lost

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.229
his hand, and he has no more patience for
lies and schemes . Which frustrates his lying

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.939
scheming family.

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:43.639
Tywin wants Jaime to leave the Kingsguard,
and get married and rule the Rock – Jaime

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:48.139
refuses, so Tywin disowns him , and is later
killed by Tyrion.

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.860
Jaime saves Tyrion from execution, but in
the books the brothers have a falling-out

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:58.459
when Jaime reveals he lied about Tyrion’s
first wife Tysha . And from Tyrion, Jaime

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:00.870
learns of Cersei’s infidelity.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:07.000
He increasingly sees her as a lying , manipulative
, fool . And Cersei rejects this changed Jaime

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.910
. So gradually, the lifelong lovers begin
to break up.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:17.769
By the end of Book 3, Jaime feels he’s lost
everything – his sister and lover, his brother,

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:23.639
his father, and his hand . Everything that
makes him who is his, everything that he loved,

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.970
is gone.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:30.579
All he has left is the Kingsguard – so Jaime
turns to the White Book.

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:34.570
The White Book records the history of each
member of the Kingsguard.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.279
There’re all these great heroes, like Arthur
Dayne, with all these great deeds written

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:40.600
in their pages.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.370
Jaime’s page doesn’t say much apart from
his killing King Aerys.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.951
But there’s still lots of blank space there
– Jaime realises he can fill his page, write

00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.999
his future, with “Whatever he [chooses]”.

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:58.009
In the show, Jaime chooses to stand by Cersei
for three more seasons.

00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:00.050
But the books are different.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.470
In Book 4, Jaime travels the riverlands, mopping
up the last of the war.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.019
And he starts to build a new identity as a
more honourable man.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:14.140
He’s sick of people hating him for being
an oathbreaker , so he tries to keep his promises

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.069
to Catelyn – not only by sending Brienne
after Sansa, but by ending the Siege of Riverrun

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:23.920
without fighting Tullys, which was another
of the oaths Jaime made . He starts taking

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.329
his Kingsguard and knights’ vows more seriously
. He protects innocent people like Pia , and

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:33.649
gets mad when the Mountain kills an innocent
boy – when Jaime himself had once tried

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:35.160
to kill an innocent boy.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.300
Jaime does justice – executing criminals,
and sorting out conflict between Loras and

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300
Brienne.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:46.220
Jaime’s still often rude and aggressive
. But he is less reckless and less arrogant

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.509
– at one point he refuses to wear his gold
prosthetic hand.

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:52.490
“Let them see the cripple”, Jaime thinks.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:58.449
He “would not show the crowds a golden lie”
. Jaime even starts being nice to people sometimes

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:02.829
– he’s kind to Pia , and Jeyne Westerling
, and lets Lord Blackwood keep his daughter

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:07.689
. Jaime even decides to take an interest in
his children, Myrcella and Tommen.

00:11:07.689 --> 00:11:12.350
He used to think of his kids as “no more
… than a squirt of seed in Cersei’s cunt”

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.480
. But now he decides he wants to help them
grow up right, even to tell Myrcella that

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.660
he’s her father.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:23.190
He also decides to help fix the politics in
King’s Landing . So Jaime is trying to build

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.490
a better legacy for himself – he hopes to
be known not as the Kingslayer, but maybe

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.440
as “Goldenhand the Just” . But some people
aren’t convinced.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.339
Edmure and Brynden stand against Jaime, showing
that for all his thoughts of reform, Jaime’s

00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:44.699
still the Kingslayer in their eyes . Like,
sure, Jaime technically keeps his word to

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:49.829
the Tullys at Riverrun, but he still hands
their castle to the Freys as reward for betrayal

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:55.029
and slaughter at the Red Wedding – an atrocity
plotted by Tywin, who Jaime emulates with

00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:00.639
his trebuchet threat . Ultimately, Jaime’s
still serving the brutal regime that killed

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:05.639
King Robert, crowned a bastard, savaged the
riverlands – fought a terrible war that

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:10.079
all started with Jaime’s incest and the
crippling of Bran.

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:15.470
If Jaime really wants to be a better person,
if he wants redemption – surely he must

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.720
somehow answer for his crimes.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.619
How else can he escape the judgement and trauma
that haunts him?

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:28.220
If Jaime’s to have a brighter future, he
must face his past.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.389
Catelyn Stark is murdered at the Red Wedding.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:37.179
In the books, she’s then resurrected as
Lady Stoneheart – transformed into a terrible

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:38.990
vengeful spirit.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.689
She takes over the brotherhood without banners,
and leads them to hunt down and kill everyone

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:45.579
involved in the Red Wedding.

00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:50.709
In Book 4, Stoneheart captures Brienne, and
threatens to kill her – unless Brienne brings

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:52.139
her Jaime.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:57.550
In Book 5, it looks like Brienne does – taking
Jaime to Stoneheart somewhere in the riverlands

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:03.810
. You can see Stoneheart as a symbol of the
evil in Jaime’s past – a monument to all

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.399
his sins.

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:09.930
Catelyn is the mother of the boy Jaime crippled
to cover up incest.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.839
Catelyn is the wife of Ned Stark, whose judgement
haunts Jaime as Kingslayer.

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:19.300
Catelyn is the woman Jaime promised he’d
save Sansa and Arya – who still aren’t

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.660
home in the books.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.740
And Catelyn’s a Stark, the family that Jaime’s
family all but destroyed.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.440
So Stoneheart could represent Jaime’s guilt
and regret.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.550
But unlike the Kingsguard, and Rhaegar, and
Ned, Stoneheart lives, in the flesh.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.199
There is no ignoring her, no more excuses
or distractions.

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:43.869
This could be the big confrontation between
Jaime and his past.

00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:47.740
Will he be consumed by the dark, and hanged
with Stoneheart’s other victims?

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.629
Or will he make peace with his demons and
rise up a better man – not just someone

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:56.629
who talks about honour and justice, but someone
who rights his wrongs.

00:13:56.629 --> 00:14:01.699
There are all sorts of possibilities – Jaime
could join the brotherhood for Red Wedding

00:14:01.699 --> 00:14:05.310
revenge, maybe finally find Sansa or Arya.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.779
Or maybe it’ll be more about putting Stoneheart
to rest, with the help of Brienne.

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:12.589
We won’t know til the next book comes out.

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:18.699
But Jaime probably will survive Stoneheart
– cause his destiny is with Cersei.

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:21.739
Jaime has loved Cersei all his life.

00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:26.110
He joined the Kingsguard for her, fathered
bastards with her, tried to kill kids for

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.110
her.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:32.209
Cersei brings out the worst in Jaime – all
his vanity, violence, cruelty.

00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:38.899
If Jaime’s to be a better person, he needs
to face his twin . And thing is, Cersei is

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:42.529
obsessed with a prophecy that says she’ll
be killed by her brother.

00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:46.920
She thinks this means Tyrion, but fans suspect
that it means Jaime.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.389
Remember in the show, Cersei blows up the
Great Sept with wildfire.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:55.269
There are hints she’ll use wildfire in the
books as well – but she won’t just blow

00:14:55.269 --> 00:15:01.569
up the Great Sept . Fans believe that Cersei
may try to burn the whole city of King’s

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:06.999
Landing – just like Aerys tried to do years
ago . Jaime may have to save the city again

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.499
by killing his sister.

00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:11.689
That would fulfil the valonqar prophecy.

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:16.110
And it could represent Jaime finally defeating
his darker half.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.029
It could also mean Jaime’s death – cause
the twins both believe that just as they were

00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:26.939
born together – they will die together . This
could be self-sacrifice by Jaime – heroically,

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:30.399
tragically, dying with his lover in fire.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:36.449
The twins came into the world so similar – but
they’ll die so different.

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:43.290
Cersei dies consumed with fear and hate , but
Jaime could die a hero – finally a knight

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.290
worthy of the White Book.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.009
And Jaime might have an even higher destiny.

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:55.549
Some people argue that Jaime may be Azor Ahai,
the hero prophesied to save the world from

00:15:55.549 --> 00:16:00.009
the white walkers, using a burning sword called
Lightbringer.

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:05.209
Jaime does have a mystical dream of “doom”
where he wields a flaming sword that pushes

00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:10.029
back darkness . And there are some weird connections
in the Valyrian language invented for the

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:15.780
show – the words for gold and hand are similar
to the words for lord and light – the god

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.110
connected to Azor Ahai.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.029
And Jaime’s arc could loosely fit the story
of the forging of Lightbringer – tempering

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:28.879
his swords first in water, then in the heart
of a lion , then in his beloved wife.

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:31.310
Cersei could be the sacrifice.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:37.290
And if Jaime dies with her, he could then
be reborn amidst smoke and salt as Azor Ahai,

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.850
his hand transformed into a burning weapon
– Lightbringer.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:47.220
So this is sorta plausible – if you fudge
some other bits of the prophecy, and believe

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.630
Jaime is secretly Aerys’ son – but overall,
it doesn’t seem likely.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.739
Because Jaime’s story isn’t about the
mystical fight of ice and fire – leave that

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:00.759
stuff to Jon and Daenerys.

00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:04.800
Jaime may play some role in the fight against
the walkers – that’s where he’s going

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.810
in the show, with his black cloak and Valyrian
sword.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:15.010
But Jaime’s real war is in his heart – trying
to define his identity in a dark and complex

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.010
world.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.710
And that’s not about white walkers.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:24.420
That’s between Jaime and Aerys and Brienne
and Stoneheart and Cersei.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.670
Thanks for watching.
