00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:30.569
10 World Cities That Will Completely Disappear
by 2100

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:53.089
10.

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.179
San Francisco, USA

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.030
Most people realize the earthquake danger
in San Francisco, yet the enormity of the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.320
potential devastation is almost beyond comprehension.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.990
According to the University of California,
research forecasts a 75% probability that

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.670
an earthquake of a 7 or greater magnitude
will occur by 2086.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.119
Will the survivors elect to re-build the majestic
city?

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.119
Will they be able to?

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.290
Prior to Katrina, the population of New Orleans
was close to 500,000.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.630
Afterwards, the population shrunk by about
half.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.610
It’s rising again, but the demographics
are still far lower than they were pre-Katrina.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.250
The population of San Francisco is about 900,000.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.560
Tall structures abound and there’s no such
thing as a completely earthquake proof structure.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.600
In fact, the population of San Francisco is
shrinking.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.469
Not only is the city pricey, but many are
wondering where they or their relatives may

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.619
end up with the city’s hazardous coastline
and predicted disasters!

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.619
9.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.399
Venice, Italy

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.420
One of the world’s most romantic cities
has been sinking for about a millennium.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.960
The pace has increased rapidly over the last
100 years, with the soil level sinking about

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.280
24 centimeters.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
Venice’s vulnerability to sea and groundwater
level change is extremely serious.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.030
For example, 100 years ago St. Mark’s Square
flooded around nine time per year, and now

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.860
it’s inundated with water 100 times per
year.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.520
The government has been working on plans to
protect Venice, but will they work?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.610
No one knows.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.280
Preserving Venice has been a priority of the
Italian Government for about 30 years.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.570
Several billion euros have been dedicated
to a major flood defense system, called the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.570
MOSE Project.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.940
Proposed since the 1970s, it’s basically
a series of floodgates to stretch across three

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.940
openings that connect the Venetian Lagoon
with the Adriatic Sea.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.570
However, the progress of the project has been
checkered with stops and starts, new completion

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.911
dates and now possible illegality.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.340
In June the Mayor and other top officials
were arrested on corruption charges involving

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.340
MOSE.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.450
It’s been suggested that the City be moved
to higher land altogether to protect its population

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.790
and precious art and frescoes.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.790
8.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.860
Detroit, USA

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.890
“Motor City” may become “Abandoned City”
as the population of Detroit continues to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.890
decline.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.030
If these trends keep up, Detroit will be changed
beyond recognition by 2100.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.450
The culprits include major economic and demographic
decline, including moves to the suburbs.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:18.540
At its peak in 1950 the population was 1,850,000,
compared with its present 701,000.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.970
Global competition in the automobile industry,
significant unemployment, crime rates and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.800
severe urban decay have rocked the city.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.970
In 2013, Detroit filed the largest municipal
bankruptcy case in American history.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.910
The unemployment rate is 23.1%, and one-third
are living below the poverty level.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.090
Parts of the city are already ghost towns
as urban decay has set into once thriving

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.090
communities.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.880
Some areas look completely wild.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.230
Detroit also has some of the highest crime
rates in the United States — in 2012 their

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.360
murder rate was 53 per 100,000, ten times
that of New York City.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.390
A 2012 Forbes report named Detroit the most
dangerous city in the United States for the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.150
fourth year in a row.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.081
In 2010, Mayor Bing put forth a plan to bulldoze
one fourth of the city and concentrate the

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.670
population into certain areas to improve the
delivery of essential city services.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.070
In February 2013 the Detroit Free Press reported
the Mayor’s plan to accelerate the program

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.769
and desire for federal funding to tackle Detroit’s
problems in order to “right size the city’s

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.109
resources to reflect its smaller population.”

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.109
7.

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:24.659
Ivanovo, Russia

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:30.220
This district capital and administrative center
of Ivanovo Oblast is in serious decline.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.620
Once a major textile center, the city attracted
women seeking work.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.460
This created a significant gender imbalance
that gave it the nickname “The City of Brides.”

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.250
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, 60%
of the population had to live on food they

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.479
grew, a survival strategy known as the “dachma
movement.”

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.180
Growing textile competition from China and
other emerging economies also eroded the economy.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.449
The combination of a low birthrate, high poverty,
crime, drug and alcohol abuse, high mortality

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.789
rates, poor quality of dwellings, and “grey”
businesses have all but destroyed the once

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.479
thriving city as its youth are leaving to
seek an education and re-settle somewhere

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.060
with modern industry.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.070
6.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.300
Mexico City, Mexico

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.330
Mexico City began as the home of an ancient
empire and grew into one of the world’s

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.440
largest cities, with more than 20 million
people living in this modern metropolis.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.249
It’s built on top of the Aztec capital,
Tenochtitlan.

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:27.190
It was here where, in 1519, Cortes allegedly
met Montezuma, the Aztec emperor.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.520
After conquering the Aztecs, Cortes, in Spanish
tradition, placed the square at the heart

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720
of the city, surrounding it by buildings representing
the church and the government.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.919
Yet the city, home to Diego Rivera murals,
cathedrals and palaces, is literally sinking.

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.460
The problem is its base.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.879
A dried lake bed makes a poor foundation.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.699
According to government officials, Mexico
City is sinking at a rate of four inches a

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.280
year and has sunk 10 meters in the past sixty
years.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.150
So be prepared to walk carefully when you
visit.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.150
5.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.509
Banjul, Gambia

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.860
The small West African nation of Gambia may
lose its capital due to a combination of the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.000
rising ocean and erosion.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.129
Banjul is at risk of going underwater as sea
levels rise by one meter as a result of climate

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.129
change.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.539
Settlements will be eroded, and over half
of the country’s mangrove forests and a

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.650
fifth of its rice fields will be lost.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.040
The decrease in rice production would be disastrous,
as would other environmental changes including

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.949
droughts, floods and storms.

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.310
As tourist attractions and fisheries are located
in the coastal zones, the economy would be

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.789
critically affected.

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.129
The government is trying to improve coastal
defenses, but whether they can save the city

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.160
and the coast is unknown.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160
4.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.969
Timbuktu, Mali

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.259
When sand dunes advance on fertile land, desertification
is a problem.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.960
The city in southern Africa facing the greatest
danger was a center of Islamic education during

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.969
the 15th and 16th centuries.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.439
Timbuktu is over over 1,000 years old and
is known for its tourist attractions, which

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.560
include beautiful beaches with turquoise reefs
and many historical sights.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.199
Sadly, your grandchildren may have to find
other exotic locations to go snorkeling, as

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.949
some parts are already half buried in sand
despite several projects to re-green the area.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:10.949
3.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.559
Naples, Italy

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:18.080
Naples is the magnificent capital of the Italian
region Campania and the third-largest municipality

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.189
in the country.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:26.270
As of 2012, the population was around 960,000
with an urban area of about 3.5 million, making

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.020
it one of the largest metropolises on the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.550
One of the oldest continuously inhabited cities
in the world, Naples’ historic city center

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.040
is the largest in Europe and is listed by
UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.849
Naples has long been a major cultural center
with a global sphere of influence, particularly

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.629
during the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:51.110
Visitors are treated to historically significant
sites, including the Palace of Caserta and

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.309
the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:58.900
Its nemesis has been the time-bomb, Mount
Vesuvius, located in the Bay of Naples.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.080
The volcano that destroyed Pompeii in 79 BC
erupts about every 100 years, with the last

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.800
eruption coming in 1944.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.650
It’s expected to do its damage once again
in the mid-2000s, putting the city and half

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.809
a million people in the “red zone” if
they’re not evacuated in time.

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:15.809
2.

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.610
Bangkok, Thailand

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.650
Bangkok is in trouble.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.560
The city is sinking, while sea levels are
rising.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.419
Building foundations are being pushed into
the muddy soil and underground aquifers are

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.500
being drained for drinking water.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.150
Rising sea levels are the real problem, though,
with estimates giving the city no more than

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.940
a century until the streets become canals.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.750
While scientists agree that the problem needs
to be addressed they disagree on the best

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.710
solution, while the government doesn’t appear
to be looking for any solution at all.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.460
The city won’t flood overnight, but if you
want to check out its awesome robot building

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.930
it may be better to go sooner rather than
later.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.080
1.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.100
Other American Cities in Jeopardy

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.730
Rising seas and global warming have put U.S.
coastal cities at risk.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:00.530
Residents should consider either seeking higher
ground or avoiding any long-term investments.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.830
Since 1889, global sea levels have raised
about eight inches, and they’re still climbing.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.150
Rising seas dramatically increase the odds
of damaging floods from storm surges.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:15.770
One analysis found the odds of floods occurring
by 2030 are on track to double or worse.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.950
Nearly five million Americans live less than
four feet above high tide.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.150
In decades, New York City, New Orleans, Boston,
Washington D.C., and southeast Florida may

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.600
be overcome by flood conditions made worse
by climate changes.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.240
Other cities that could be affected include
Baltimore, Charleston, Houston, Galveston,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.280
Los Angeles, Long Island, Sacramento, Philadelphia,
Delaware, Portland, Providence, San Diego,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.500
Savannah, Seattle, Tacoma, Virginia Beach
and Norfolk.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.150
That pretty much just leaves Kansas, but then
you run into the tornado problem.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:10:06.510
And you’d have to live 

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:18.780
in Kansas.
