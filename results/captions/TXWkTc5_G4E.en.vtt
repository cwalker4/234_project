&gt;&gt; SOMEONE WAS REALLY POSITIVE.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.617
THEY SAID, "LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,
YOU'RE HARDER TO KIDNAP.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.930

EXCELLENT HEALTH, 6'3", 239

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.937 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO MIGHT THE
DOCTOR SAY ABOUT YOU?

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.440
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A PHYSICAL EVERY YEAR
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.642
I MEAN, I HAVE EVERYTHING NOW.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.146

YEAH.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:30.750
AND THEY SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SLIGHTLY-- A LITTLE BIT

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
OVERWEIGHT."

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.819
AND THEY'RE DOING IT NICELY, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.822
AND THEY G, SO WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?"

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.993
AND I SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:40.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.127 size:84% position:42%
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR."

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:45.431
IF I TAKE MY CAR TO THE
MECHANICAC AND HE GOES, "IT'S

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:45.665 align:start size:88% position:13%
BROKEN.

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO."

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.701
YOU'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.170
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.273
IF DONALD TRUMP IS HEALTHY, I'M
HEALTHY.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:57.177
HE'S LIKE MY CANARY IN THE MINE.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.679 size:88% position:56%
THERE WAS A STORY IN ENGLAND
ABOUT A GUY WHO WENT TO THE

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.314 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOCTOR BECAUSE HE WAS OUT OF
BREATH.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.684 align:end position:100%
AND IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO
CONSTIPATED THAT IT WAS PUSHING

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.786 size:88% position:44%
HIS LUNGS UP, RIGHT.

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:11.257
SO I'M-- IF I DID THAT, I'D SAY,
"I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO THE

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.960 align:start size:88% position:13%
TOILET NOW."

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.830
I'D SAY, "YOU'RE THE DOCTOR, GET
IN THERE WITH A SPOON.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.698 align:start size:88% position:13%
GET IT OUT.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
SORT ME OUT.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.836 align:end position:100%
I'M NOT GONNA--" AT THAT POINT,
I THINK I'D HAVE A CESAREAN.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:29.709
I WOULDN'T-- I WOULDN'T-- I
WOULDN'T GO THROUGH THE PAIN.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.911 align:start size:88% position:13%
SO, YEAH --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN FIT,

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:32.278 align:start size:88% position:13%
THOUGH.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.715 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAVEN'T WE HAD "FIT RICKY?"
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN FIT.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:39.786
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IN YOUR FAMOUS
PROFESSIONAL CAREER, YOU'VE HAD

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:40.386 size:78% position:39%
WAVES OF FITNESS.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.855
&gt;&gt; I WAS FIT FOR THE FIRST 28
YEARS, I'D SAY.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:48.394
AND THEN I GOT-- I THINK I GOT
FATTER AND FATTER OVER 20 YEARS,

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:48.861 align:start size:88% position:13%
RIGHT.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:53.433
AND I REACHED MY SORT OF PEAK OF
SORT OF UNWELLNESS AND

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.267 size:88% position:44%
BLOBBINESS ABOUT 48.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:57.737
I WAS LYING AT HOME ON THE
FLOOR, RIGHT, AND I WAS SAYING

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.174 align:start size:88% position:13%
TO JANE, "I'M HAVING A HEART
ATTACK."

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:07.213
AND I FELT SORT-- HOT AND CLAMMY
BECAUSE I'D EATEN 11 SAUSAGES,

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:07.413 align:start size:88% position:13%
RIGHT?

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
<i>( LAUGHTER )
AND I WASN'T HAVING A HEART</i>

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.284
ATTACK, BUT JANE SAID, "YOU HAVE
TO GET FIT."

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.654
SO I SORT OF GOT FIT BUT IT'S
CREEPING BACK ON.

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.122
I DID IT BY WORKING OUT.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.359
I WORKED OUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
EVERY DAY LIKE ROCKY SO I COULD

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.863
GO HOME AND EAT PIZZA AND DRINK
BEER EVERY NIGHT.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.467
AND I STILL DO THAT AND I'M
GOING TO GET FATTER AND FATTER

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.835
AND I'M GOING TO DIE.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.504
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO IT HAS A HAPPY
ENDING.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.473
&gt;&gt; YEAH, EVERYONE DOES DIE.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:37.110

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS BROUGHT THE TONE
DOWN A BIT.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen: A LITTLE BIT.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
A LITTLE BIT.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:46.019
YOU MADE QUITE A SPLASH OVER THE
YEARS HOSTING THE GOLDEN GLOBES.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.419 size:78% position:39%
HOW MANY TIMESES?

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; FOUR.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.321 size:88% position:56%

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:51.958
THIS YEAR WAS KIND OF--
<i>( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.559
THEY'RE APPLAUDING THE NUMBER
FOUR.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.027 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.763
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND THIS YEAR WAS
A VERY PROMINENT YEAR FOR THE

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:57.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
GOLDEN GLOBES.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.832
I THINK SETH DID A REALLY LOVELY
JOB.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:00.133 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.169
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT A LOT OF
PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WRITING

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.474
ABOUT IT GIVEN THE #METOO, OR
THE "TIME'S UP" MOVEMENT, THANK

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.276
GOD RICKY GERVAIS DIDN'T HOST IT
THIS YEAR.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.212 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO
IRREVERENT.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:18.551
OR, "I WISH HE HAD BECAUSE WE
WOULD HAVE SEEN MORE

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:18.985 align:start size:88% position:13%
IRREVERENCE."

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:19.552
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:22.455
&gt;&gt; I WAS JEALOUS OF SETH.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:23.756
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.892
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF MY
CAREER.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:26.793
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT WE ALL DIE.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.629
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, IT DOESN'T MATTER, I'M
GOING TO DIE SOON.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.496 size:88% position:56%
HONESTLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:36.102
I THINK THAT'S WHY I'VE DONE THE
BEST STAND-UP EVER BECAUSE I'M

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.405
SO CLOSE TO DEATH THAT I THINK
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:40.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
TO ME?

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:43.543
I MEAN, SOMEONE BEING OFFENDED
NOW IS NOTHING.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:44.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
"SO WHAT?

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.845 size:81% position:41%
I'M GOING TO DIE."

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.815
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WERE THERE THINGS
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT-- IT'S

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.817
A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT.

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:52.819 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; THE MORE SENSITIVE, THE
BETTER.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.591
THAT'S THE FUN FOR ME, TALKING
ABOUT IRREVERENT AND SENSITIVE

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.393 size:84% position:42%
AND TABOO SUBJECTS.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.995
THERE'S NO SUBJECT YOU SHOULDN'T
JOKE ABOUT.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.031
IT DEPENDS ON THE ALL JOKE AND
TARGET.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.201 align:end position:100%
AND PEOPLE GET OFFENDED WHEN
THEY MISTAKE THE SUBJECT OF JOKE

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:12.071
AND THE ALL TARGET AND THEY'RE
NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME.

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.439
SOME PEOPLE ARE OFFENDED FINE.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.175 size:88% position:56%
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE OFFENDED
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.878 align:start size:88% position:13%
SOME PEOPLE ARE OFFENDED BY
EQUALITY.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.080
YOUR PRESIDENT, HE'S OFFENDED BY
EQUALITY.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.282
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S RIGHT.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:23.783
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:30.056
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE-- THIS-- I
HAVE TO ASK, YOU'RE WEARING ALL

BLACK.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.657
THAT'S VERY WOKE OF YOU.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:34.494
IS THAT-- IS THAT IN SOLIDARITY
WITH ANYONE?

I WAS-- ONE LITTLE GIRL SAID,
"ARE YOU MARRIED?

AND I SAID, "SORT OF.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.917
I'VE BEEN WITH THE SAME
GIRLFRIEND FOR OVER 30 YEARS."

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.754 align:start size:88% position:13%

PROPOSE TO HER, THEN?"

GIVING ME A HARD TIME.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:13.326

WORLDS, I CAN HAVE FUN WITH

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.740
THEM, GET THEM RILED UP, TEASE
THEM, LAUGH, AND THEN I SAY,

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.943
"THEY'RE NOT MINE," AND GO TO
THE PUB.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.845

&gt;&gt; THEY GET TOUGHER.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.892

THE ADULT DOESN'T KNOW,

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.226
SOMETHING ABOUT DISNEY.
