00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.201
-Let's get to the news.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.337
White House press secretary,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.774
held a press briefing today
for the first time in six weeks.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.676
And I think it'll be the last
one for a while,

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.146
cause she ended with
"happy holidays."

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.248
[ Laughter ]

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.051
President Trump
spent the weekend

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.520
at his Mar-a-Lago resort
in Florida.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.956
By the way, that sentence
was written two years ago,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.824
and yet it still works
every Monday.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.927
[ Laughter ]

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.863
According to a new survey,
Senator Bernie Sanders

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:33.866
is polling just two points
behind former Vice President

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.769
Joe Biden in Iowa,
which makes sense when you see

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.271
the poll question.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.807
[ Laughter ]

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.444
According to Axios, former Vice
President Joe Biden is expected

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.846
to announce whether he'll run
for President within days,

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:49.983
and the suspense
is killing nobody.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:53.853
Of course --
of course he's running.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.623
They probably have to strap him
down Hannibal Lecter style

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.824
to keep him from announcing.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.793
The only way he's not running
for President

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:05.531
is if Obama invites him to go on
a four-year road trip.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.633
Ahh!

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.070
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.209
President Trump today denied
that he mistakenly referred

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.679
to Apple CEO Tim Cook
as Tim Apple.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.383
and claimed he was just trying
to, "Save time and words."

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:25.551
You?

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.487
You were trying to save words?

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:31.491
I'm pretty sure you're the
reason words need rescuing.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.158
[ Laughter ]

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.328
An increasing number of
Democrats have begun calling

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:37.363
for the party to consider
expanding the number

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.998
of justices
on the Supreme Court.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:42.569
Said Brett Kavanaugh,
"but there's already 18."

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.371
[ Laughter ]

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.344
Indiana mayor and Democratic
presidential hopeful,

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.914
Pete Buttigieg yesterday
called President Trump's

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.650
term in office a,
"Porn star presidency."

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.153
And that's an apt description,
because I enjoyed it

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:03.890
for about five minutes,
and I've felt weird ever since.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.958
[ Laughter ]

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.428
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.399
It's been announced there will
be a new emoji

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.201
to represent
interracial couples.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.203
It's just like
the old couples emoji,

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.505
but with a bunch
of white people staring.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.841
[ Laughter ]

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.212
The Chicago Symphony Orchestra
went on strike today,

00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:29.349
or as they call it, rest.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.385
[ Laughter ]

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.953
Yeah.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.122
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.028
Yeah, we did a smart joke!

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.529
Yeah, you said we couldn't.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.998
We did one!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.732
[ Laughter ]

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:49.869
A Florida man was recently
sentenced to 60 days in jail

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.972
after he grabbed a McDonald's
employee by their shirt collar

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.874
because he couldn't
find a straw.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.375
I mean, that is insane.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.911
Someone in Florida
was wearing a shirt?

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.446
[ Laughter ]

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.482
[ Audience groans ]

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.151
[ Laughter ]

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.986
We did a symphony joke, too.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.987
[ Laughter ]

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:11.690
According to a new report,
the average city bus

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.927
in New York travels
just 6.4 miles per hour,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:16.962
which transit researchers
have pointed out

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:21.401
is nearly 2 miles per hour
slower than a rat can sprint.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.869
[ Laughter ]

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.407
So next time you're being chased
by a rat, don't take the bus!

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.642
[ Laughter ]

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.410
Go faster!

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.613
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.953
And finally, a Vermont town
recently elected a

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:44.524
three-year-old goat
to be its mayor,

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:47.560
which was pretty embarrassing
for the guy who ran against him.
