5 Mysteries Science Can’t Explain

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.740
Science is dedicated to solving riddles, answering
questions and generally demystifying the vast

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.740
universe.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.680
So far, we managed to explain and understand
a lot of things.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.880
We’ve peered into the furthest reaches of
the universe and delved into the exciting

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.699
world of atoms.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.910
We managed to understand the basic building
blocks of life while building a civilization

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
capable of learning about uninhabited planets.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.670
The last few centuries have been especially
good for science.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.480
In the 17th century, Isaac Newton solved the
ancient controversy over the nature of forces

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.110
and motion with his three laws.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.719
In the 18th, Ben Franklin figured out a lot
about electricity.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.969
In the 19th, Darwin explained the diversity
of species, Maxwell revealed the physics of

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.860
light, and Mendeleyev defined the families
of chemical elements.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.369
Finally, in the 20th century, we had Einstein,
who figured out all sorts of stuff, including

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.549
gravity.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.620
Still, there is a long way ahead of us and
a lot of mysteries left for the 21st century

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.950
to solve.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.950
Hi!

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.740
I am Mister Mysterious, and in this video,
we will be taking a look at some of the still-unsolved

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:38.369
scientific mysteries that are forcing us to
settle with mere speculations as this moment.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.590
The Taos Hum

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.719
The town of Taos, located in the north-central
New Mexico, is a small laid-back artsy community.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.029
However, there is a very strange phenomenon
happening here that is connecting this place

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.770
with a handful of places around the world.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.179
The so-called Taos Hum is a low-pitched noise
that has been keeping scientists busy for

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.389
more than 20 years now.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:11.000
The hum seems to have first been reported
in the early 1990s when Joe Mullins, a professor

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.739
emeritus of engineering at the University
of New Mexico, conducted research into the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.720
Taos Hum.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.830
Based on a survey of residents, about two
percent of the general population was believed

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.840
to be “hearers”, those who claimed to
detect the hum.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.439
In addition, the sound was most noticeable
to hearers between 8 PM and 9 AM, and most

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.240
people plagued by this phenomenon heard the
noise at least once a week.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.299
Sensitive equipment was set up in the homes
of several of the “hearers”, measuring

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.349
sounds and vibrations.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.980
After extensive testing, nothing unusual was
detected.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.431
However, the research revealed that there
was not a single identifiable Taos Hum, but

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:07.860
instead several different ones that people
reported; some describe it as a whir, hum,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.459
or buzz.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.120
This prompted scientists to believe that the
Taos Hum might be a result of subjective experiences

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.580
instead of objective sounds.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.280
Interestingly, Taos is not the only place
plagued by unknown noises.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.380
There are dozens of other cities in which
some residents claim to hear something strange.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.890
Still, most of those cases get solved at one
point.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.849
However, this is the first time that science
wasn’t even able to prove that the strange

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.670
sounds are real.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.450
Several studies of this phenomenon concluded
that the answer to the Taos Hum mystery may

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.939
be found in the inner world of personal experience.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.110
Even though we don’t notice it, our ears
sometimes create their own noises.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.450
We don’t get to hear them until it’s very
quiet.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.749
This phenomenon, called spontaneous otoacoustic
emissions, is different than auditory disorders

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:22.460
such as tinnitus, which causes a ringing in
the ears.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.580
The Taos Hum was first reported more than
20 years ago, and it seems like this is going

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.780
to remain a mystery for a lot longer.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.500
The Mummies

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.340
In 1992, a group of German scientists were
investigating Egyptian mummies and discovered

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:51.229
remnants of hashish, tobacco, and cocaine
in their hair, skin, and bones.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.389
The discovery of hashish wasn’t as surprising
since it could be easily concluded that Egyptians

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.890
were in contact with nations living in Asia,
which is where hashish came from.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.020
Tobacco and cocaine were strictly New World
plants at the time of the mummification.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.490
This led to speculations that Ancient Egyptians
may have traveled to the New World, which

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.720
is a completely new theory that goes against
everything we know about this ancient civilization.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.860
The tests were first thought to be contaminated.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.250
Later, it was believed that the mummies were
fakes from where the king of Bavaria originally

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.310
bought them.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.770
But after authentication and similar results
with other specimens, it was determined that

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.229
the unexplainable had to be the truth.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:48.210
In 2011, a series of discoveries on a stretch
of the Red Sea coast once again proved the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.020
Egyptian’s seafaring abilities.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.229
Archaeologists found traces of an ancient
harbor that once launched early voyages onto

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.160
the open ocean.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:06.990
Inside a series of man-made caves, they found
timber, rigging, limestone anchors, steering

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.280
oars, reed mats, and cedar planks.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.570
Today, this is the strongest verified proof
of the Egyptians’ nautical roots.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.440
Further evidence of an Egyptian journey to
the Americas comes from an intriguing discovery

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.100
in the Marble Region of the Grand Canyon.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:33.349
According to the Arizona Gazette, on April
5th, 1909, the Smithsonian-funded explorers

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:40.099
found a variety of Egyptian-like artifacts
including stone tablets with hieroglyphs.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:46.099
Still, the Smithsonian Institute has no current
records of the finding.

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:52.190
Perhaps it would be too inconvenient to rewrite
the history books and alter long-held traditions

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.900
such as the Columbus Day celebrations.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.550
Silence Zone, Mexico

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.569
There is an area in northern Mexico where
radio signals don’t work, and compasses

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.789
spin out of control when placed near stones
on the ground.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:19.349
It is located four kilometers from San Ignacio,
and it is known as the “Trino Vertex”.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:27.139
However, this area is also known as the Silent
Zone or Zona del Silencio.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:33.229
Frequently compared to the Bermuda Triangle
(both are located between parallels 26 and

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:39.910
28 and have similar legends), the legends
say that radio waves cannot be transmitted

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.900
through this area due to local magnetic fields.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.569
Perhaps the best-known incident connected
to the Silent Zone happened in 1970 when a

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:56.699
rocket used by the US Air Force lost control
and invaded Mexican airspace.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:03.539
Since the rocket was carrying two small containers
of Cobalt 57, which is a radioactive element,

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:08.860
a team of covert specialists was employed
to find the missing rocket.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.449
The aerial search extended over three weeks,
but the rocket was finally returned to the

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:15.789
U.S.

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:21.069
What is interesting is that throughout the
20th century, large meteorites landed numerous

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:28.699
times across the Silent Zone, with two even
falling on the same ranch – one in 1938,

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:31.080
and another in 1954.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:40.120
However, the Silent Zone became known by its
name in 1966 when Pemex, the national oil

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.280
company, sent an expedition to explore the
area.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.690
The lead of the expedition was frustrated
by the problems he was having with his radio,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.500
so he christened it the Zone of Silence.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.311
Even though many believe that nothing strange
is happening in the Mexican Silent Zone, there

00:08:58.311 --> 00:09:03.520
are too many strange events connected to this
area.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.560
Groups of scientists are still occasionally
visiting the Silent Zone, but just like with

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.260
the Bermuda Triangle, any rational piece of
evidence is missing.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.570
In the meantime, people come from all over
to experience the area and see for themselves

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:27.420
if numerous legends are true.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.970
Stone Spheres of Costa Rica

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:36.260
Still considered a great unsolved archaeological
mystery, the near perfect ancient stone spheres

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.620
of Costa Rica were first found near the southern
Caribbean in the Diquis Delta, and hundreds

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.670
more have been found all over the country.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:52.800
Since the 1930s, hundreds of stone spheres
have been documented, ranging in size from

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.170
a few centimeters to over two meters in diameter.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:05.170
Some weigh 16 tons, and almost all of them
are made of granodiorite – a hard, igneous

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.290
stone.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.960
These objects are monolithic sculptures made
by human hands.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.840
Archaeologists and sciences were able to figure
out how these spheres were made.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.420
It is believed that they were made by reducing
round boulders to a spherical shape through

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.220
a combination of controlled fracture, pecking,
and grinding.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.120
Furthermore, the balls could have been roughed
out through the application of heat and cold.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.650
Finally, this process would end with the spheres
being polished to a high luster.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:45.370
What is interesting is that there are no traces
of metal tools, even though metal tools were

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.350
available at the time these spheres were created.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:56.570
The biggest mystery that surrounds these strange-looking
objects is that no one knows their true purpose.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:02.151
Many of them were found to be in alignments,
consisting of straight and curved lines, as

00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:06.630
well as triangles and parallelograms.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:13.380
One group of four balls was found to be arranged
in a line oriented to magnetic north.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.170
This has led to speculation that the spheres
may have been arranged by people familiar

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.980
with the use of magnetic compasses, or astronomical
alignments.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:28.670
It seems like we’ll never get to know the
real truth behind these stone spheres since

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.580
almost all of them have been moved from their
original locations.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.730
Many of the balls have been blown up by local
treasure hunters who believed that the balls

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.920
contain gold.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.430
Balls have been rolled into gullies and ravines,
or even into underwater marine locations.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:53.530
Dozens of these objects have been transported
far from their zone of origin, separating

00:11:53.530 --> 00:12:02.590
them even further from the consciousness of
the descendants of the people who made them.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.800
The Placebo Effect

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:12.470
Imagine the following scenario: Several times
a day, for several days, you induce pain in

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.470
someone.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.800
You control the pain with morphine until the
final day of the experiment, when you replace

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.880
the morphine (which is a powerful pain medication)
with saline solution (which is a mixture of

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.200
salt and water).

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.960
This happens without the patient being aware
that all of a sudden, saline solution is being

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.480
used.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.400
Can you guess what happens?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.770
The saline takes the pain away.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.280
This phenomenon is known as the placebo effect.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:51.210
Somehow, sometimes, a whole lot of nothing
can be very powerful.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.170
Suddenly, the saline solution seems as powerful
as morphine.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:03.040
A scientist named Fabrizio Benedetti of the
University of Turin in Italy carried out the

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:11.060
previously explained experiment, but he added
a final twist of adding naloxone, a drug that

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.190
blocks the effects of morphine.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.300
The shocking result?

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.280
The pain-relieving power of saline solution
disappeared.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.320
So, what is going on here?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.770
Doctors have known about the placebo effect
for decades, but the experiment conducted

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.690
by Fabrizio Benedetti showed that the placebo
effect is somehow biochemical.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.000
Apart from that, we simply don’t know anything
else.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.480
Benedetti has since shown that a saline placebo
can reduce tremors and muscle stiffness in

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.480
people with Parkinson’s disease.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.770
In other words, he was helping those who were
suffering from serious and damaging illnesses

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.290
using saline solution instead of using drugs.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.620
As Benedetti says, we have a lot to learn
about what is happening here.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:09.170
One thing is clear: the mind has the ability
to affect the body’s biochemistry.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.220
Researchers now need to identify when and
where placebo works.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.970
There may be some diseases in which it has
no effect.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.900
As yet, we just don’t know.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.730
Tell me in the comments section, what do you
think about these unexplained scientific mysteries?

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.040
Do you believe that there are some areas on
our planet that are influenced by mysterious

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.150
natural forces, and do you think that the
history books are telling the truth about

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.730
out past?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.040
