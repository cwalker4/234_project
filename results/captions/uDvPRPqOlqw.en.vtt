00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:09.670
If the #MeToo movement has taught us anything,
it’s that perverts are everywhere.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.450
The pages of history are no exception.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.140
Below are 10 historically notable perverts,
who run the gamut from “midly kinky” to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.150
“extreme sexual predator.”

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.730
There is always difficulty in applying modern
standards to actions of the past, but these

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.289
10 men all engaged in sexual behavior that
was (or would have been) considered outside

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.450
the norm, even in their own times.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.780
10.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.540
CS Lewis was into spanking, and an older woman
he called “mother”

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.350
Author CS Lewis wrote extensively on Christianity,
though he is perhaps best-known for the seven

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.960
children’s books he authored, which make
upThe Chronicles of Narnia.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.230
But before he wrote beloved classics like
The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Lewis

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.080
also wrote (in letters to a friend) about
his sadistic desires.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.850
He dubbed himself “Philomastix,” meaning
“lover of the whip” in Greek, and wrote

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.390
to his friend, Arthur Greeves, detailing women
he thought would be “a suitable subject

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.310
for the lash,” including Greeves’ own
sister.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.090
In another letter he also confides that, “There’s
no special virtue in a whip—hundreds of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.000
other methods of mild torture are just as
good.”

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420
And it wasn’t just women that Lewis wanted
to whip.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.000
While visiting Exeter, Lewis was kicked out
by the Dean for getting “royally drunk”

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.030
and “imploring everyone to let me whip them
for the sum of 1s. a lash!”

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.460
Another odd quirk of Lewis’ life is his
relationship with Jane King Moore.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.920
While being trained for the Army, Lewis made
a pact with his roommate Edward Moore to take

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.290
care of the other’s family, if either was
killed in the war.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.780
Sadly, Moore died in action, and 18-year-old
Lewis formed a special bond with 45-year-old

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.600
Jane King Moore while recovering from his
own wounds, eventually moving in with her

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
and her family.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.370
Lewis called Moore “mother,” but many
have suggested the relationship went well

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.180
beyond a familial bond.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.870
A long-time friend of Lewis’ wrote of the
pair, “After conversations with Mrs. Moore’s

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.630
daughter, Maureen, and a consideration of
the way their bedrooms were arranged…

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.490
I am quite certain they were lovers.”

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.490
9.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.950
Joseph Smith Jr. had up to 40 wives, some
in their teens

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.330
Joseph Smith Jr., the founder and prophet
of Mormonism, believed that polygamy was divinely

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.330
commanded.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.610
Despite the on-and-off disapproval of his
first wife, Emma, Joseph Smith married a number

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.720
of additional wives—the Mormon church estimates
30-40 women were “sealed” to Joseph Smith.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.980
Some of these marriages were unconsummated,
representing an eternal union of souls, while

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.560
some included all the earthly pleasures of
marriage.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.540
Some were to single women, while others were
to women who already had husbands.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.990
Smith’s youngest bride, Helen Mar Kimball,
was only 14 at the time of her marriage to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.990
him.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.730
While she initially found the idea of plural
marriage “improper and unnatural,” Kimball

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.890
was talked into the marriage by her father,
and by Smith.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.450
In Kimball’s retelling, Smith persuaded
her to agree with the promise of heaven, recalling,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.319
“[Smith] said to me, ‘If you will take
this step, it will ensure your salvation &amp; exhaltation

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.380
&amp; that of your father’s household &amp; all
of your kindred.’

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.140
This promise was so great that I willingly
gave myself to purchase so glorious a reward.”

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.650
It is unclear whether Kimball and Smith’s
marriage was merely “celestial” or was

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.650
consummated.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.930
What is clear is that Kimball was one of four
teenage brides Smith married in a single month—May

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.129
1843.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.330
8.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.450
Hans Christian Andersen wasn’t into sex,
but he liked to visit brothels and kept a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.970
log of his masturbation sessions

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.630
Hans Christian Andersen may be best known
for his beloved children’s literature, including

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.500
such tales as The Little Mermaid and The Emperor’s
New Clothes.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.500
However, in person, the Danish author was
not the jovial, grandfatherly figure many

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500
might imagine.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.920
Rather, he was awkward and neurotic.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.290
Some of his quirks included dramatic behavior
when confronting rejection (he threw himself

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.231
facedown on Charles Dickens’ lawn and bawled
after reading a negative review) and some

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.900
phobias around death (when sleeping, he would
put up a note to indicate that he was sleeping

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.190
and not dead).

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.060
Some of Andersen’s oddest behavior had to
do with sex.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.340
He visited brothels on numerous occasions,
but professed that he never had sex with the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.740
women there, just looked and talked to them.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.370
While visiting Paris, he noted in his journal
that the 18-year-old prostitute he engaged,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.870
“undressed completely and seemed surprised
that I only looked at her.”

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.610
Andersen’s journals also contain detailed
records of his masturbatory sessions, indicating

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.909
what inspired them.

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.039
Particularly good sessions were marked “++”
and he even included such information as “penis

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.039
sore.”

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.659
Andersen’s sessions were inspired by both
men and women, and his letters show infatuations

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.469
with individuals of both sexes, though there
is no evidence that he ever consummated any

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:46.810
of his love affairs.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.810
7.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.059
Henry VIII needed a lot of women to keep him
happy, and the Pope wasn’t going to stand

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.229
in his way

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.949
Henry VIII is perhaps best known for his string
of wives—6 in total—and the way the unions

00:04:58.949 --> 00:04:59.949
ended.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.020
Two marriages ended in annulments, two ended
when Henry had his wives beheaded, one ended

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.759
when the wife died of natural causes, and
the last ended when Henry himself died.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.800
However, even 6 wives weren’t enough to
keep the king satisfied.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.870
He also had a string of mistresses, two of
whom bore him children.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.839
One of the mistresses, Mary Boleyn, was the
sister of Anne Boleyn, who would become Henry’s

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.180
wife before being executed for adultery.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.930
In order to land Anne Boleyn, Henry first
had to figure out a way to be rid of his first

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.729
wife, Catherine of Aragon (Catherine was also
keeping it in the family, having previously

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.629
been married to Henry’s brother, though
the marriage was never consummated).

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:39.039
Not only was Henry desperate to bed Anne Boleyn,
he was also seeking a healthy male heir, which

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.319
Catherine, who was pushing 40, had been unable
to produce.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.710
When the Pope declined to annul the marriage,
Henry declared himself the head of the Church

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.560
of England and forever separated it from Papal
authority.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.599
Henry VIII grew disenchanted with Anne Boleyn
and had her and several men of his court sentenced

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.729
to death for adultery (in the case of the
men, the charge was treason).

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.189
In the run-up to Boleyn’s execution, Henry
embarked on the party circuit, determined

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:08.059
to find a new bride and expressing his mood
as one of a man who ditches “a thin old

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.439
vicious hack in the hope of getting soon a
fine horse to ride.”

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.770
The new horse was Jane Seymour, and he married
her less than two weeks after Anne Boleyn’s

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.770
death.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.639
Despite being prone to obesity himself, Henry
was picky about the appearance of his women.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.539
When Anne of Cleves (his 4th wife) proved
to be less attractive than her portrait had

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.639
suggested, Henry couldn’t perform in the
marital bed, calling her body “disordered”

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.229
and saying “he could never in her company
be provoked and steered to know her carnally.”

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.990
The marriage was eventually annulled.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.430
By the time he had beheaded wife #5 for behaving
like a “common harlot,” Henry’s sex

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.050
drive seemed to be on the wane.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.059
Young women were reluctant to marry a king
who kept beheading his wives and Henry was

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:51.300
nursing a painful jousting injury, so he finally
settled down with a two-time widow who he

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.930
viewed as “a nursemaid rather than a bedmate.”

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.930
6.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.050
Charlie Chaplin was into underage girls

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.039
Charlie Chaplin has been called “the first
global celebrity,” rising to fame through

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.280
his comic portrayal of “The Little Tramp,”
an Everyman character he embodied in more

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.429
than 80 films.

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:12.169
Known for the outsized pants and shoes and
signature moustache of the character he portrayed,

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.409
Chaplin was famous all over the world.

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:19.759
He was also known in a lot of women’s bedrooms,
once claiming to have slept with over 2,000

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.759
women.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.699
At least some of the many women Chaplin bedded
were underage.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.379
Three of his four wives were teenagers when
he married them; the other was in her 20s,

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.849
though she had claimed to be younger when
she met Chaplin.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.449
Charlie’s first wife, Mildred Harris, was
a child star who was 15 when Chaplin met her,

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.429
and 16 when he married her, believing that
she was pregnant.

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.779
They divorced acrimoniously 2 years later.

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.800
Chaplin’s second wife, Lita Grey, was also
underage, just 15 when she became pregnant

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.369
with his child, and 16 at the time of their
marriage.

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:49.949
The marriage, which took place in Mexico,
came about when Grey refused his offers of

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.710
money and demands that she get an abortion,
and after her shotgun-wielding uncle reminded

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.179
Chaplin that Grey’s age would support charges
of statutory rape.

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:02.249
Grey, who has said of Chaplin, “He enjoyed
being the first person in a girl’s life,”

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:06.330
claimed that on their honeymoon, Chaplin told
her that marrying her was better than going

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.330
to prison.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.339
Unsurprisingly, though it produced two children,
the marriage did not last, ending in a nasty

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:16.339
and public divorce, in which Grey accused
Chaplin of infidelity and “degenerate sexual

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:19.520
desires, too revolting… to set forth in
this complaint.”

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.370
Grey, who called Chaplin “a destroyer of
girls,” garnered a settlement of over $800,000,

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.280
the largest in US history at the time.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.969
Charlie’s fourth marriage, when he was 54,
was also to a teenager—Oona O’Neil, who

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:32.969
was 18 at the time.

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:37.280
While the marriage took place over the objections
of O’Neil’s father, it was Chaplin’s

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.710
final marriage, enduring until his death in
1977.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.710
5.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.680
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wanted to be punished
like a little boy

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.210
Rousseau is credited with seminal contributions
to the development modern political thought;

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.440
his philosophy influenced the Enlightenment
and the French Revolution.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.690
However, in addition to exploring the importance
of civil society and reason in human development,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:05.000
Rousseau’s writings touch on another theme—his
enthusiasm for spanking and being dominated.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.030
This fetish dates to being spanked by his
guardian when he was 11, an experience where,

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.180
“a degree of sensuality had mingled with
the smart and shame, which left more of a

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.500
desire than a fear of repetition.”

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.280
Rousseau was also into submission, writing,
“To fall at the feet of an imperious mistress,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.490
obey her mandates, or implore pardon were
for me the most exquisite of enjoyments.”

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.750
Taking this fetish to the extreme, he called
an older woman with whom he had a long-term

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.970
affair “Maman” (“Mother”), and she
called him “petit” (“little one”).

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.160
Rousseau was also an exhibitionist, exposing
his bare butt to strangers, behavior that

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.280
was greeted with laughter and screams.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280
4.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.500
King Edward VII earned the nicknames “Edward
the Caresser” and “Dirty Bertie”

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.870
Edward VII was 59 when he finally became the
King of England.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.990
He used the long wait to engage in all kinds
of debauchery.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.360
Edward’s long string of scandals began with
an affair with a prostitute when he was 19.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.960
Edward’s parents, Queen Victoria and Prince
Albert, were horrified, and Albert chewed

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.380
Edward out during a long walk in the rain.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.410
Shortly after this altercation, Albert came
down with typhoid and died.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.370
Victoria, who never really liked her son,
blamed Edward’s inability to keep it in

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.460
his pants for his father’s death.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.260
Albert’s death and Edward’s marriage did
nothing to curb the future king’s sexual

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260
drive.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.700
He often attended country house parties where
“corridor creeping” was a central activity.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.000
Edward also kept an apartment in Paris, and
worked his way through the city’s brothels.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.330
He was also an avid patron of the city’s
bars and restaurants and his expanding girth

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:40.260
(another of his nicknames was “Tum-Tum”)
began to constrain his sexual escapades.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.260
Rather than give up either appetite, Edward
commissioned a special sex chair that supported

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.140
his weight and allowed him to receive the
“royal treatment” from two women at once.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.460
When he was finally named king, Edward designated
a pew at Westminster for his “special ladies.”

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.740
Even on his deathbed, one woman wasn’t enough
to please Edward.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.480
In addition to his wife, his mistress was
present, and Edward even requested the two

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.600
women kiss before his long-suffering wife
ordered the mistress removed.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600
3.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.540
Caligula was into absolute power… and maybe
his sisters

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.910
Caligula ruled as Roman emperor for only four
years, from AD 37 to AD 41, but managed to

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:22.610
spark an astounding array of rumors during
that short time, before he was assassinated

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.780
by members of the Praetorian guard.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.530
Reports of his initial rule, which included
elaborate public spectacles, including gladiatorial

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.640
games, were largely positive.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.780
However, after recovering from an illness
(or perhaps a failed poisoning), Caligula’s

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.780
behavior changed dramatically.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.640
He took on wasteful and pointless construction
projects, eliminated his political enemies,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.320
and sought to be worshiped as a god.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.810
Contemporaneous Roman historians, including
Seneca the younger, suggest he was a man prone

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.680
to many vices, with a vicious temper and a
penchant for cruelty.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.820
Seneca describes how Caligula bedded another
man’s wife and then publicly, “at the

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.630
top of his voice, reproached this man with
the way his wife behaved in bed.”

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.690
However, the most extreme charges about Caligula’s
behavior were leveled by two Roman historians

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.900
who were born after Caligula’s death, Cassius
Dio and Suetonius.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.700
The passage of time suggests these salacious
accounts may not be entirely accurate, but

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.300
they do show the depths of perversion with
which Caligula is associated.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.050
Cassius Dio accuses Caligula of incest with
his sisters, saying that, “after ravishing

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.540
them all, he confined two of them to an island,
the third having already died.”

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.480
Suetonius accuses him of “unnatural relations”
with several men, including “certain hostages.”

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.780
He also accuses Caligula of “habitual incest
with all his sisters,” forcing them to engage

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.400
in threesomes with himself and his wife at
banquets.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.010
Suetonius further notes that the incestuous
behavior with one sister began when Caligula

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.180
was a minor, and continued through her marriage
until her death.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.810
According to Suetonius, “The rest of his
sisters he did not love with so great affection,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.780
nor honor so highly, but often prostituted
to his favorites.”

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.060
2.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.870
Grover Cleveland married a woman he had practically
raised and fathered an illegitimate child

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.920
(allegedly through rape)

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.870
When you think of US Presidential sex scandals,
Grover Cleveland may not be the first name

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.420
that comes to mind.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.440
Nonetheless, his questionable relationships
with women suggest he may have been the country’s

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.180
most perverted president.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.920
Cleveland’s sex scandal, which emerged in
1884, but took place 10 years prior, involved

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.820
accusations that he had fathered an illegitimate
child with Maria Halpin.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.300
And it gets worse.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.990
According to the affidavit she signed, Halpin
had been hounded by Cleveland (who was single

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.730
at the time) until she agreed to go to dinner
with him.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.380
Afterward, Halpin claimed, the future President
walked her home and violently raped her, threatening

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.110
to ruin her if she told anyone.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.670
Unfortunately, Halpin’s ordeal was far from
over.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.450
Weeks later, she learned she was pregnant
and sought Cleveland’s help.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.700
Instead of assisting Halpin, Cleveland arranged
for the baby, a son, to be taken from her

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.970
and adopted after it was born and for Halpin
to be committed to a mental asylum.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.710
When the news of Cleveland’s involvement
in the incident emerged in the press, he launched

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:03.250
a smear campaign, admitting the two had been
involved (consensually, in his account), and

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.160
suggesting that he hadn’t been involved
in the life of his son because of “doubts

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.620
about his fatherhood.”

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.460
While the news that Cleveland had fathered
a child out of wedlock, and was likely a rapist,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.830
briefly threatened to derail his Presidential
ambitions, Cleveland was still elected to

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.280
the White House in 1884.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.870
Soon his love life would be in the papers
again, this time with his marriage to Francis

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.760
Folsom, who at 21 was 28 years younger than
Cleveland and would become the nation’s

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.100
youngest First Lady.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.430
While the age difference is a big one, the
truly sketchy aspect of their relationship

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.810
was that Cleveland, initially known to Francis
as “Uncle Cleve,” had known his bride

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:43.720
since she was born, even serving as a quasi-guardian
after her father, Cleveland’s close friend,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.940
died when she was 11.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.430
Cleveland reportedly mentioned that he was
going to marry her when she was 8 and sitting

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.730
on his lap, and when asked by friends why
he was still a bachelor, responded, “I’m

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.420
waiting for my bride to grow up.”

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.820
They probably thought he was speaking in jest
(albeit somewhat creepily), but pervy Uncle

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.340
Cleve followed through, making the woman for
whom he had once purchased a pram his wife.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.340
1.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.660
The Marquis de Sade

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.260
Unlike the other men on the list, who are
famous primarily for other reasons and just

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.880
happen to also be perverts, the Marquis de
Sade is known primarily because he was a pervert;

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.100
or more accurately, a sexual predator.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.150
“Sadism,” the word for the tendency to
derive pleasure from the pain of others, comes

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.180
from his name.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.750
He literally wrote the book (or rather, books)
on it, penning dark pornography themed around

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.710
torture and depravity that was considered
so dangerous that France criminalized publication

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.880
of several of his works until the 1950s.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.810
Unfortunately, Sade’s twisted fantasies
were not contained merely in his books.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.560
He spent much of his life in prison or mental
hospitals for his various sexual crimes.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.740
His first serious conviction was for tying
up a chambermaid, cutting her, and dripping

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.590
hot wax in her wounds.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:54.440
The next was for, on a trip with his manservant,
poisoning several prostitutes (2 of whom nearly

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.890
died) with chocolates laced with aphrodisiacs
to make them more amenable to his deviant

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.890
sexual desires.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.080
After escaping from prison, Sade brought his
wife into the act.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.370
The pair recruited some young (15-years-old,
or so) servants and those “Five young females

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.910
and one male were trapped in the chateau for
six weeks of depredations, orchestrated in

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.040
theatrical fashion by Sade under the indulgent
eyes of his wife.”

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.180
This was the last straw for Sade’s mother-in-law,
who had a royal warrant issued for his indefinite

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:56.800
incarceration.
