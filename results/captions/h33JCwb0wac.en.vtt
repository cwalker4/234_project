00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.369
- I am a terrible speaker,
and I've reread this thing

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.338
a million times, but I wanted
to be here tonight

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:09.476
to celebrate with my hero.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.778
We hear the word "icon" used
a lot these days describing

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.149
people like me, but as far
as I'm concerned,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.418
a true icon is the woman
being honored here tonight.

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.455
- [cheering and applause]

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.757
- Since the day our founding
fathers signed

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.793
the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.362
our country has been run
almost exclusively

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.130
by old white men.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.300
Thankfully, because of Nancy
and other strong women,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.935
this is changing.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.737
Nancy's a fighter.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.739
She won't back down,
she muscled through

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.308
the Affordable Health Care Act
and she isn't afraid

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.978
to go toe-to-toe with a bully
and beat him in his own game.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:50.083
- [cheering and applause]

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.285
- When I see Trump spew
his hatred

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.654
and tell his gazillion lies,

00:00:54.754 --> 00:01:00.226
I get pissed off,
but I also feel really uneasy.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.396
Then I see Nancy come on TV
and I think,

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:06.599
"It's all good,
Nancy's in the House."

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.169
- [cheering and applause]

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.471
- Nancy has dedicated
her career to being

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.209
a fierce advocate
for the underdog, for women,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:19.946
for the LGBTQ community
and for the poor.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.449
She's the highest-ranking woman
ever in American Politics

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.719
and because of her
and other strong women like her,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.021
soon there'll be
a woman president.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.657
- [cheering and applause]

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.794
- She gives me hope and courage,
she is elegant and formidable,

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.898
and when I grow up,
I wanna be just like her.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.066
- [laughter]

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.768
- Madam Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.534 line:0%
- [cheering and applause]
