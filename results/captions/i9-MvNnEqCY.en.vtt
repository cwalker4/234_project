5 Times Human Race Came Close to Extinction

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.070
Today, we dream about launching into space
to get enough room for our collective population.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.910
As we don’t have fears from common illnesses,
and as many of us don’t have to worry about

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.990
food, shelter, or water, it seems like nothing
can stop us.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.230
However, we weren’t always so robust and
safe.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.160
There were several times in history during
which humans nearly went extinct.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160
Hi!

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.250
I am Mister Mysterious, and I will be guiding
you through events that caused our civilization

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.560
to chance its course.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.710
Here are five of the closest calls we had
to human extinction.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.369
Five: The Toba Super-Eruption

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:03.930
The Toba supereruption was a supervolcanic
eruption that occurred 75,000 years ago; Believed

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.780
to be one of the Earth’s largest known eruptions.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.280
As such, this event changed the course of
human history by severely reducing the human

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.470
population.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.770
The Toba eruption occurred at the present
location of Lake Toba, in Indonesia.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.700
Today, there is a scenic landscape with a
picturesque lake at its center where locals

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.570
can still feel occasional slight tremors that
hint at the violence simmering below.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.130
Numerous scientific theories suggest that
the Toba volcanic eruption plunged the planet

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.000
into a 6 to 10-year volcanic winter that endangered
the world’s human population, reducing it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.290
to 10,000 surviving individuals.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.690
This long winter period largely destroyed
the food sources of humans, and also destroyed

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.210
vegetation in the tropical rainforest belt
and in monsoonal regions.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.110
However, the exact geographic distribution
of human populations at the time of the eruption

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.319
is not known, and surviving populations may
have lived in Africa before migrating to other

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.130
parts of the world.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.720
In fact, there are indications that the major
migration from Africa happened close to 75,000

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.250
years ago, which is consistent with the dating
of the Toba eruption, and which is why scientists

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.060
believe that these events are connected.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.550
An international research team, led by Oxford
University, tried to discover more about this

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.940
event.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.680
The seven-year project examined the environment
around the volcano where humans had lived,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.630
their stone tools and animal bones of the
time.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.990
The team suggests that a mosaic of ecological
settings was present, as well as that some

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.420
areas around the volcano experienced a relatively
rapid recovery after the event.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.540
Still, we may never exactly know what exactly
happened 75,000 years ago, and if our civilization

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.910
was really in danger.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.489
However, this is a reminder that a worldwide
environmental catastrophe could change our

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.800
course in an instant.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Four: Spanish Flu Pandemic

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.981
Almost a hundred years ago, in the little
town of Brevig Mission (Alaska), a deadly

00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:36.760
new virus struck quickly and brutally.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.980
It killed 90 percent of the town’s Inuit
population, leaving a large number of corpses

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.959
that few survivors were willing to touch.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.770
The Alaskan territorial government hired gold
miners to travel to flu-ravaged towns and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.990
bury the dead.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.800
Little did they know that those bodies will
be used throughout the next century in an

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.990
effort to study one of the deadliest influenza
pandemics, today known as the Spanish Flu.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.950
The Spanish flu first appeared in 1918 and
took up to 100 million lives in just two years.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.209
It is believed that up to 40 percent of the
world’s population was stricken with this

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.479
flu.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.159
Unusually for this kind of virus, the pandemic
afflicted young people, who were healthy previously.

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:30.610
Today, we know that the disease triggered
an overreaction by the immune system, thus

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.289
turning a young person’s immune system against
itself.

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:42.180
Victim’s lungs overflowed with fluid, while
their skin became mottled and discolored.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.839
Those who weren’t able to recover drowned
in their own bodily fluids.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:53.360
Even in areas where mortality was low, people
were very afraid.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.879
Numerous communities closed all stores, and
numerous health-care workers declined to tend

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.879
the sick.

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.069
The gravediggers didn’t want to bury the
dead, which is why mass graves were dug by

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.960
steam shovels and bodies were buried without
coffins in many cases.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.090
Horrifying as the flu was, its reign of terror
was brief.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.520
In less than two years, the disease had largely
disappeared.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.389
However, its survivors and their children
often experienced lifelong health problems.

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.339
In addition to that, the Spanish flu came
right after the World War I, which took the

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.589
lives of over 17 million individuals.

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:43.759
To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized
early reports of the Spanish flue in countries

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.499
like Germany, Britain, France, and the United
States.

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:56.719
Still, newspapers were free to report the
pandemic’s effects in neutral Spain, creating

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.259
a false impression that this flu originates
from Spain.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.229
The truth is that we still don’t know much
about the origins of the Spanish flu, and

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:14.059
there are many reports that mention France,
Austria, and even China.

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.969
Three: Norwegian Rocket Incident

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.430
The Norwegian Rocket Incident occurred when
a team of Norwegian and American scientists

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.229
launched a scientific rocket from the Andøya
Rocket Range in 1995.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:38.949
This rocket carried equipment used to study
the Aurora Borealis over Svalbard in Norway

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.449
and flew on a high northbound trajectory,
which included an air corridor that stretches

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.349
from nuclear missile silos in North Dakota,
all the way to the Russian capital city of

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:51.099
Moscow.

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:56.999
During its flight, the scientific rocket reached
an altitude of more than 900 miles, which

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.669
forced Russian nuclear forces to react.

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.240
This incident occurred in the post-Cold War
era when many Russians were very suspicious

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.479
of the United States and NATO.

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.460
The Russian military received readings from
an early warning radar station in Murmansk

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.969
Oblast and believed that the rocket’s trajectory
is a possible attack by missiles from the

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.080
U.S. submarines.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.599
This event resulted in a full alert being
passed up through the military chain of command

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.839
all the way to President Boris Yeltsin.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:34.289
The “nuclear briefcase” was used to authorize
nuclear launch, and Yeltsin activated his

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.690
“nuclear keys” for the first time.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.280
After a while, Russian observers were able
to determine that the rocket was heading away

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.659
from Russian airspace and was not a threat.

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:51.589
The rocket fell back to the ground as planned,
24 minutes after launch.

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:57.300
Prior to this event, the Norwegian and American
scientists had notified numerous countries

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:03.770
(including Russia) of their intention to launch
a high-altitude scientific experiment aboard

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:10.749
a rocket; However, the information was not
passed to the Russian radar technicians.

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:19.520
As a result, notification and disclosure protocols
have been re-evaluated and redesigned.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.080
Two: Cuban Missile Crisis

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.260
In October 1962, an American U-2 spy plane
secretly photographed nuclear missile sites

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.950
being built by the Soviet Union on the island
of Cuba.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:44.140
This forced President John F. Kennedy to place
a naval blockade, or a ring of ships, around

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.700
Cuba in an effort to prevent the Soviets from
bringing in more military supplies.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.430
The U.S. President demanded the removal of
the missiles already there and the destruction

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.360
of the sites.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.810
This was a 13-day confrontation between the
United States and the Soviet Union that was

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:07.780
the closest the Cold War came to escalating
into a full-scale nuclear war.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.440
This event was connected to the failed Bay
of Pigs invasion of 1961, and the presence

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.850
of American ballistic missiles in Italy and
Turkey.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.050
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to
agree to Cuba’s request to place nuclear

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.220
missiles on this island to deter future harassment
of Cuba.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:35.000
In July 1962, Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel
Castro held a secret meeting and made an agreement

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.910
on building a number of missile launch facilities.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.600
During those 13 days, the world was separated
into two alliances.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.910
China announced that 650 million Chinese men
and women were standing by the Cuban people,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.610
while West Germany and France supported the
United States.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.480
In addition, John F. Kennedy believed that
only an invasion would remove the missiles

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.630
from Cuba, which is why the United States
were ready to start a war.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:11.990
On October 27, after much deliberation between
the Soviet Union and Kennedy’s cabinet,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:17.660
the U.S. President agreed to remove all missiles
set in Italy and Turkey.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.790
In return, Khrushchev agreed on removing all
missiles in Cuba.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:28.570
Speaking about this event, President Kennedy
told the following to Americans in June 1633:

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:44.920
“For, in the final analysis, our most basic
common link is that we all inhabit this small

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.320
planet.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.513
We all breathe the same air.

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:51.513
We all cherish our children’s future, and
we are all mortal”.

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.070
One: The Black Death

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:59.410
Coming out of the East, the Black Death reached
the shores of Italy in the spring of 1348,

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:05.430
unleashing a rampage of death across Europe
unprecedented in recorded history.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:11.730
By the time the epidemic played itself out
three years later, anywhere from 30-60% of

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.480
Europe’s population had fallen victim to
the pestilence.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.570
In total, the plague may have reduced the
world population from an estimated 450 million

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.000
down to 350 million in the 14th century.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.910
It is believed that the Black Death came from
Central Asia, as well as that it found its

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.860
way to Europe through the Silk Road.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:42.000
Italy was the first country to face this plague,
followed by France, Spain, Portugal, and England.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.930
In less than one year, the plague reached
Germany and Scandinavia.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:51.650
The plague presented itself in several forms.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:56.840
The bubonic variant brought swellings that
appeared on a victim’s neck, armpits or

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.900
groin.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.700
These tumors could range in size from that
of an egg to that of an apple.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.330
The manifestation of these symptoms signaled
that the victim had a life expectancy of up

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.240
to one week.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.370
The pneumonic plague attacked the respiratory
system and was more virulent.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.040
Life expectancy was measured in one or two
days.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.660
Even though the Black Death took hundreds
of millions of lives, the plague-haunted Europe

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.600
and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th
to the 17th century.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.370
It was reported that the plague was present
somewhere in Europe in every year between

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.790
1346 and 1671.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.590
During those years, especially while the Black
Death haunted Europe, people were in a panic.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:52.490
Doctors refused to see patients; Priests refused
to administer last rites; Shopkeepers closed

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:57.150
stores, and many people fled the cities to
the countryside.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:03.680
Desperate to run away, many people abandoned
their sick and dying loved ones.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.160
Feel free to add any kind of information about
other cases that might have endangered our

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.210
civilization.
