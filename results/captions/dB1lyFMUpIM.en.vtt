00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.950
- [Interviewer] David,
we're here in Venice,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.130
you live in an RV with your daughter.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.695
Tell me about it.

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:06.710
- Okay.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.550
Well, this RV thing started
before we actually got this RV,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.780
about I'm a say nine months ago now.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.110
We were living in our car,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.250
before that we were living in apartments.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.680
Now, my daughter had an
apartment with her boyfriend,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.910
I was rooming with someone else,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.360
and consequently, the long story short

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.790
is that we end up both
being out on the street

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.110
at the same time.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.700
I had a vehicle, she had a vehicle,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.960
so we started sleeping in the vehicles.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.990
We do have a dog and two cats,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.730
so that was also a difficulty
in getting housing.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.070
Housing also wanted a 700 credit score,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880
upwards of three, $4000 to move in,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.590
counting first, last month's rent

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.480
with the pet deposits, et cetera.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.480
So, my story is that to
facilitate not being in the car

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.530
and being in between that gap

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.420
of not being able to
find affordable housing,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.010
we decided to spend that money on an RV

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.160
so we would have some place to sleep.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.570
- [Interviewer] Now, while
all this is going on,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.620
you both are working.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.150
You have full time jobs.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.130
- That is correct.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.419
My daughter's actually worked two jobs,

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:23.350
I've actually worked two jobs as well,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.350
but this job I have right
now was been semi-full time.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.668
I'll say that.

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:30.670
The hours fluctuate.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.668
- [Interviewer] But you're working.

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:32.501
- Yes, definitely working.
- Even when you're living

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:33.840
in your cars, you're working.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.830
- Exactly.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.700
- [Interviewer] But you just
couldn't afford an apartment.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.533
- That is correct.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.530
It's very difficult to stack three, $4000

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.280
when you're trying to eat
and you're trying to bathe

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.420
and care for each other
and to other things,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.210
like I have a medical
situation going on right now

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.220
that's taken all the money
that I just worked for

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.880
last week out of my
pocket and I don't know

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.380
where the next money's coming from

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.440
and I still don't have a place to live

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.453
except for this RV.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.050
- [Interviewer] Now, you're telling me

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.680
living in an RV is like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.090
- Yeah, all that, that thing.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.970
Living in an RV to me
seems, and I try to do this,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.030
I try to laugh at it humorously,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.960
but it's like living in a spaceship,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.240
like the movie Lost in Space or Star Trek

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.680
where you get into your
ship and you fuel up

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.670
and you say, oh, I wanna
go to the next adventure,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.070
I wanna go to some land
where it's peaceful

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.650
where they'll let me be me,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.680
and then you pull in to wherever it is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.020
and undoubtedly, in nine months I've seen

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.040
a lot of different reactions,
most of them being negative.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.510
Some people are okay with it,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.210
but a lot of them are
like, hey, get out of here.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.263
You can't be here.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.920
And then, they have no answers as to where

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.020
you're supposed to go.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.610
If you have anything
over a 22 foot trailer,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.200
then that also makes more
parking restrictions,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.773
so again, you don't have a place to go.

00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:53.390
It's interesting because
sometimes it's actually like

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.912
when you park somewhere and you get out

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:57.050
and you plant and you think,
this must be friendly,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.720
there might be somebody in another RV

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.090
that comes out and says,
hey, there's too many

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.880
of them here, they're gonna run us off,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.610
so it really is kinda like
being the Lost in Space,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.353
and then, you know, people
steal stuff off our your ship.

00:03:08.698 --> 00:03:10.170
- [Interviewer] It's
dangerous wherever you go,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.003
that new planet.
- It's dangerous.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.300
- [Interviewer] Or that new parking spot.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.690
- And the parking enforcement
is brutal over here.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.160
In fact, today my
daughter just got a ticket

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.481
while she was standing there.

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.725
Her car was parked in the red about six,

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:26.620
maybe to eight inches, and
the parking enforcement lady

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.020
got out and wrote her a ticket

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.070
while she was yet standing there,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.293
saying I'm gonna move my car,

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:34.900
but those tickets add up and we've got...

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.550
In fact, that's why I
don't have my Jeep anymore

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.130
because I got parking
tickets trying to sleep

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.930
in places that I thought
were gonna be cool to sleep

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.870
and they gave me a lot of
- Oh, my gosh.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.877
- Yeah, so that's actually
why I'm doing bicycles.

00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:46.370
That's my hobby now.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.520
That's because I don't have a car anymore

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.470
and that was my house.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.130
That literally was my
house when I took that.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.075
I watched them boot it and
take it two days later.

00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:55.870
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.870
- [Interviewer] Now, the
hardest part of mobile homeless

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.680
is finding a safe place to park

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.900
and you've been out here nine months.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.733
- Indeed.

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:09.140
- [Interviewer] That must be crazy.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.454
Tell me about it.

00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:13.580
- Yeah, well when I
first purchased this RV,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.160
I guess about nine months ago,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.130
we looked and saw where were
all the other RVs were parked

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.280
in this area, in the Venice area,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.400
and there were a lot of 'em
parked on Venice Boulevard

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.500
west of four oh five, all
the way down to Lincoln.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.640
Okay, so we went over there first

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.780
and we parked there and we were there

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.250
about two hours and I
turned everything off,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.875
it was like our first
day, and then I got ready

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:41.530
to step outside and there was a manager

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.950
of a department building and he came out

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.420
and he said, you can't be here.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.280
And I said, okay, you gotta
explain a little bit more.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.560
What do you mean?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.190
You're gonna be here four, five days,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.023
you're gonna be here a week.

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:53.680
And I said, sir, I just pulled up here.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.910
How do you know that I'm
gonna be here any days?

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.520
Everybody says that and they stay.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.870
So, my daughter popped out and she said,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.703
well, what's the problem?

00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:02.010
You just don't want us to be here, right?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.630
And he said, yes, that's the problem.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.620
My tenants don't wanna be
here, they don't wanna see you.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.150
- [Interviewer] But you don't
have any other place to go.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.467
- Well, at that time I definitely didn't

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.250
because I had a charging problem

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.410
and I couldn't start the vehicle,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.930
so I spent the next two
hours racking my brain,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.530
trying to figure out how to
get that vehicle out of there

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.100
because that was my first experience.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.320
Now since then, I've gotten
my charging situation

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.360
a bit better and I've kinda figured out

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.330
that if you're not around
a business or a residence,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.593
they don't bother you too much,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.520
but I've been at this kinda
spot here, this spot here,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.610
for about two months and they've tried

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.060
to ticket me four times.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.190
In fact, I just was
literally on the front,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.290
wiping the window, and
the lady was behind me

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.940
writing a ticket and my daughter
said, oh, here she comes,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.770
and I jumped in and
took off with everything

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.980
still wrapped up on it, so it's difficult

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.270
and it takes money out of your pocket

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.843
and it takes time and
it's stressful and yeah.

00:05:59.843 --> 00:06:02.590
- [Interviewer] So,
this is no way to live.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.820
- No, it isn't and I think we
want what everybody else wants

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.940
and that's just a couple
of walls and a mirror

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.540
and a bathroom where
you can do your things

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.010
that you need to do in private,
bathe yourself, whatever,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.943
medicate yourself, get your med

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:17.945
- [Interviewer] Have some privacy

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:22.513
- Have some privacy, some
place to cook your meals.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.290
Yeah, so we're not asking
too much more than that,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.040
but what I am really asking
is can we make it affordable?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.480
Can we make housing, just as
simple as housing, affordable?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
If you have a job and you're
not able to afford a car

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.810
and a place to live, then it
becomes a little bit futile

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.960
and then it becomes depressing

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.170
and that's why people
fall into these holes

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.330
they can't get out and
they're stuck with a basket,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.680
pushing it down the street.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.520
I will say this: my daughter's
story is slightly different.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.760
My daughter's an
entertainer and her decision

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.960
was if I have to sleep in this RV

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.550
to make my dream come true, I will.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.810
So, she's done some stuff.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.290
She's been able to do
some things like that,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.810
some really great feats because of that,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.217
and so we're out here surviving.

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:13.905
- [Interviewer] But she's also working.

00:07:13.905 --> 00:07:15.206
We were talking about
her job up in Hollywood.

00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:16.190
- She's working two jobs, yes.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.750
- [Interviewer] And
she's working two jobs.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.782
- Yes.

00:07:18.782 --> 00:07:21.570
- [Interviewer] Trying to make
her dreams, but it's still...

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.870
I mean, my goodness.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.790
This is...

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.500
I can't...

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.810
I really can't imagine living like this

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.810
and you guys really break the
stereotypes of homelessness.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.630
I mean, I know there's more and more

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.560
working homeless out here.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.380
You guys are working, you're trying,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.890
you just can't afford a place to live.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.967
- Yeah, that's the bottom line
and we know we're not alone.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.750
I've kinda kept an eye on what's going on

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.488
near Anaheim Stadium.

00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:56.440
I think they maybe tallied
up about 400 people

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.610
that were in tents out there.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.360
They also did a study
that said about 40 to 50%

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.380
of those people had jobs.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.100
So that means that they
were coming out of a tent,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.099
which we have done before,
coming out of a tent

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.310
and going to work.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.440
I did that.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.770
This is not my first time, in fact.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.240
I did that six years ago, I think.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.600
I was working at a hotel in downtown

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.520
and I had a tent in my
grandmother's backyard.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.340
That was the best I could do at that time.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.173
- Wow.
- Yeah,

00:08:24.173 --> 00:08:26.470
so it's an upward climb,

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.810
but we do just simply
want affordable housing.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.880
We don't want anything fancy,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.590
just what everybody else wants.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.980
- [Interviewer] What's your future like?

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.495
- My future is like...

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:41.680
Right now, it's funny
because the necessities

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.230
is the mother of invention
and my daughter and I

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.910
have had this, but she's a
girl, and it's closing in on us,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.900
so we're either talking
about going bigger,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.790
getting something bigger
so that we can still

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.790
not have to pay this rent.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.480
She's trying to get her credit together

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.640
so that she can go into a
place without all the hassles

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.950
that she had last time, and for me,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.559
the future lies in simply going to work

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:09.200
and hoping that the
powers that be understand

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.890
what's going on out here and
the people that are working

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.380
are trying to get affordable housing.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.630
I hope they do build MTA.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.267
I hope they build
whatever they need to do,

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:19.650
build something at the MTA.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.650
I hope they build whatever they do

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.400
to help whoever needs to be.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.375
I'm not necessarily sleeping
on the street, per se,

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.000
but it is a big responsibility being here.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.190
This takes money, this takes
gas every week to move it.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.960
They make me move it every week.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.900
If they don't, I'm gonna
get $100 ticket, at least.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.900
So, food is very expensive,
especially on Venice.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.360
So, we're working.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.170
A lot of people think,
well if you've got an RV,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.310
you don't have to pay anything.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
That's not true.

00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:48.976
We go through water.

00:09:48.976 --> 00:09:52.040
We buy a lot of water,
supplies, medical supplies,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.550
dog food, cat food, et cetera.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.383
- [Interviewer] It's work.

00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:59.360
You don't just go to the
kitchen and turn on the faucet.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.370
- Yes.
- You know?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.210
- An it rained for two days the other day

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.440
and I have a couple of leaks up there,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.220
so I had to put up tarps and all that

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.510
while I had a hurt hand and all that,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.090
so yeah, it's tough out here.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.460
It's tough.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.510
- [Interviewer] If you had three wishes,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.090
what would they be?

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.293
- Three wishes.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.580
One, concerning this particular issues,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.763
more attention to it, more
serious attention to it.

00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:28.540
A personal wish would
obviously to be more resources.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.840
More resources is what I need.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.600
I don't necessarily need
more money or more cars,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.400
but more resources, more places
to do what I needed to do.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.020
I need, in my future, I see
myself sitting in a living room,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.110
watching my television,
cooking some dinner,

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.520
and having some family or friends around

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.670
and stuff like that because
that's what I'm used to doing.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.530
That's what we all like to do.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.020
Nobody likes to be out here.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.210
Please, don't make that mistake and think

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.550
that anybody wants to be
out here on the street.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.750
- [Interviewer] All right.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.656
- Three wishes.
- I think there

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:56.661
was one more though.

00:10:56.661 --> 00:10:58.311
- Yeah, one more wish would be...

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.690
I wish people would be more human.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.620
I wish they would just see the people

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.570
that are on the street, or anywhere,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.230
and not assume that they're okay

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.210
'cause sometimes they're not.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.508
Sometimes they need a hug,
sometimes they need resources,

00:11:21.508 --> 00:11:22.830
and you never know.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.480
- [Interviewer] Love your neighbor.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.526
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:27.953
I would wish that, I would hope that,

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.540
that people would pay attention to it.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.950
- [Interviewer] Great wishes.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.665
Well, thank you very
much for talking to me.

00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:33.498
- Thank you.

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:37.511
(chill music)
