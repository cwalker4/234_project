AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.333 line:92%
PREGNANT BY.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.633 line:92%
I DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.700 line:92%
THINKING ABOUT IT BETWEEN THE

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.033 line:92%
AND HE AGREED.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.466 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I HAD A STRONG SUSPICION THAT

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.133 line:92%
MY DAD WASN'T MY BIOLOGICAL

WAS MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.400 line:92%
AND I WAS THINKING, HOW WOULD I

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600 line:92%

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.066 line:92%
CURIOUS ABOUT HIS OWN ANCESTRY

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.033 line:92%
AND WAS IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE HE

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.400 line:92%
HAD TAKEN A DNA TEST PRIOR.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400 line:92%
