00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.880
We would be honored, if you would join us.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:29.340
After this scene, Anakin goes to inform the Jedi Council of Palpatine's commitments to being a Sith lord.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.840
So Anakin went to whoever was the highest in command at the Jedi Temple, which as we know was Mace Windu.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.579
But what if in this alternate universe Yoda told Mace to go to Kashyyyk while he stayed at the temple himself?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.419
Let's disregard the fact that Yoda said he had good relations with the Wookiees to further our analysis in this story.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.739
Everything changes. Let's dive into it when Anakin told Mace Windu that Palpatine was the Sith lord as we see in this scene here;

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.049
"I think chancellor Palpatine is a sith Lord."(Anakin)

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.559
Mace does something that [I] don't think any other Jedi would have done.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.989
He irrationally decides to rush the chancellor in the most arrogant way possible. Now

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.709
we can see where his darkside powers played with his confidence and brash decisions as we have seen all darksiders fall prey to.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.750
He essentially tells Anakin "Great news boy! Sit back while I and the other worthy Jedi Masters

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.809
take care of this new threat that you've just told me about I'll handle this myself." and we all know how that ended....

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.459
I understand Anakin was conflicted and Mace was trying to do the right thing, but he was too confident in his abilities rightly

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.620
so, because he was powerful enough to back it up.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.310
BUT, he did not make the right choice the right choice a real Jedi master would make a Grand Master Jedi

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.450
like Yoda. if Yoda was on the temple grounds while Mace was on Kashyyyk

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.820
And Obi-Wan was on (Cant find spelling of this planet sry:C)ower then anakin would definitely have gone to master yoda for Guidance on the matter

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.300
He was the only Jedi he spoke [to] about visions of Patmos death while keeping her identity out of it

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.200
He trusted yoda's knowledge and guidance on something so personal that he didn't share with windu or obi-wan even it was a known fact

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.220
Windu didn't like anakin and anakin didn't like windu for always being so hard on him and untrusting of his actions not to mention

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.929
Denying him the rank of Jedi Master going to yoda with this new News of Ocs

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.199
Yoda would have not rushed palpatine with the crew of the other Jedi he would have meditated on the matter and seeked guidance of the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.660
entire council as a whole we must note that if it was enough of a topic for all [Jedi] masters to have a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.679
Conference on the topic of Anakin being appointed as palpatine's representative

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.850
Then it would definitely have called for a meeting at the unveiling of the sith Lord that they've been searching for since episode [1] after

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.919
[calling] his council meeting yoda would have obi-wan and mace windu finished their dealings on their missions and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.399
Returned back to [Korra] [sent] at the [Jedi] Temple since anakin told palpatine that he was going to turn him to the Jedi Council

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.269
Yoda would foresee this as a problem until the other Jedi masters arrived back he would send anakin to further

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.709
Spy on palpatine to pretend to learn his teachings. This is something and it can secretly wanted to do more than anything

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.829
Remember he never wanted to join sidious

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.289
He never cared for the sith or even the Jedi

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.179
He just wanted to save his wife from dying and to become the strongest and most respected

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.479
Force user in the Galaxy you'd return back to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.270
Dean's Office

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.179
And tell him he's changed his mind [and] would like to learn more about his teachings to decide whether the Jedi way was right for

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.780
him or not

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.789
This would by yoda and the others time to meet together and then confront

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.530
Palpatine now while anakin went to palpatine he would be told further about Darth Plagueis and his ability to cheat death and all ancient

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.530
sith who returned as a Force ghost

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.329
Opening his eyes to all aspects of the force just [as] city has told him as he would leave the chancellor's office

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.269
he would tell him he'd be back the next day to learn more from him and make his final decision to Join the sith or

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.989
Stay with the Jedi order

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.999
Waiting on this and needing assistance to fulfill Darth bane's rule of two

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.970
Palpatine would wait for Anakin's return the following day during

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.779
[this] time obi-wan would have finished his mission and mace windu would have arrived from his long travels on Kashyyyk back to coarsened to meet

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.700
with yoda and discuss their plan yoda would tell them that the three of them would go to the chancellor's office and

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.279
Question him on what anakin told them doing

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.369
So the three Jedi Masters would enter the chancellor's office along with [fists] [O] tin and coal are

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.640
The six Jedi Masters would overwhelm sidious

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.110
He would have no choice

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.150
But to either back down or fight

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.150
Sidious being who he is would undoubtedly fight knowing the charade was often enough republic

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.699
Igniting his lightsaber he would charge it to me for knowing

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.659
They were the weakest of the lot killing them in a blur of bread standing his ground

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.279
He would swiftly move over mace and shock yoda with lightning sending him into the wall as he slashed his saber across sisto's abdomen killing

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.839
Him with remarkable speed all that was left was obi-wan Kenobi mace windu and master yoda who was getting back up in the attack?

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.689
Obi-wan broke the Silence give up Chancellor

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.799
It's over we have the high ground as he stood atop the steps next to window

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.490
Yoda joined the battle now

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.549
Furious at the Loss of his council members flipping and jumping over sidious leaping onto walls and desks

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.350
He was so much faster than obi-wan

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.510
He couldn't even keep track of him with his eyes as mason obi-wan joined in Palpatine was overmatched

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.189
As ObI-wan distracted the chancellor with an attack both mace and yoda

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.090
Blasted the sith Lord with a combined effort of force push sending him so hard into the [wall] that he left a gargantuan

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.520
Imprint of his back as he fell to the floor

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.109
Whimpering in pain yoda and mace took one step closer to him as they lowered their lightsabers to his throat green and purple

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.460
Illuminating each side of his cheeks vowing to kill him right there as mace told yoda he's too dangerous to be left alive

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.960
oh

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.960
God give me

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.530
Agreeing yoda and obi-wan watched as mace raised his lightsaber to strike down the evil sith Lord that had been causing so much

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.630
Turmoil within the Galaxy

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.989
when they heard a voice from behind them I

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.070
Need him it was anakin he had come to stop them from killing his only lead to the dark side and possibly saving padme life

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.559
After all palpatine was his friend still someone who he looked up to as a father over the years

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.360
Yodas idea of telling anakin to stall palpatine by asking him [for] more information on the powers [of] the dark side was dangerous and this

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.189
Was why anakin was too curious and now could not let his only lead?

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.630
Palpatine to die telling them to stop and that he must be tried in the galactic court of justice that this isn't the Jedi way

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.109
Yoda began to frown telling windu that to kill was wrong obi-wan spoke to anakin in defiance

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.609
Where anakin would tell him that from his point of [view] the Jedi were evil as palpatine looked up?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.770
He would see the Jedi all turned sideways

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.650
Focusing their attention on anakin the time to strike

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.890
was now he had all the footage on camera that he needed the three most powerful Jedi Masters coming to his office and trying to

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.099
kill him while his hero anakin came to his rescue

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:21.419
He jumped backwards from the ground summoning the second spare lightsaber from resting place in the vaz in his office now wielding two

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.459
Identical Red Lightsabers he would raise them in his defense against the Jedi who were sandwiched by him

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.900
And anakin as anakin walked towards them he ignited his lightsaber again

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.530
Telling them to arrest him yoda shook his head at this betrayal

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.739
Yoda sent a surge of the force push anakin back into the wall and through the door knocking him unconscious as

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.570
Windu smirked at his master

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.929
They continued to corner palpatine who was backed into the corner like a dog

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.390
throwing one of his lightsabers at them using

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.790
to twirl it around

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:56.439
Creating a force field and a barrier between them while pointing the [others] straight ahead in case they were to attack he reached into his

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.770
cloak and contacted commander cody execute order 66

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.680
and ordering immediate aid at his office within moments nearly fifty clone troopers patrolling the chancellor's building showed up to draw their weapons on the

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.650
Jedi Began to deflect the attacks you with precision as

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:18.789
Master as yoda ran through them his short stature proving helpful in taking out all of their ankles using this advantage

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.720
Palpatine cut a hole in the wall

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.340
Using his saber and jumped through it taking the elevator to the rooftop and boarding the ship that awaited for him with the clones inside

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:34.090
Ordering them to kill all the Jedi and bring anakin Skywalker to him this would not [be] done as obi-wan yoda and mace windu were

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.270
far too powerful to be killed by mere clone Troopers

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.870
Just like the battle of geonosis

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.600
Where they had each other's backs and protected one another killing every clone that came for them

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.929
Sounding the alarm at the temple for all the Jedi to return to the ground immediately

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:53.830
Sending a beacon out regarding order 66. They would check [to] capture Anakin when they saw he was nowhere to be found

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.000
He had escaped and most likely with the chancellor

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:04.120
Attempting to take padme with him who refused after she saw who he was turning into would escape to the Jedi temple

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.229
Betraying anakin and his quest for power and domination anakin would join the emperor now feeling empty and betrayed

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.359
Hating the Jedi for stealing padme even more now this avoided him losing any of his limbs

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.510
Ultimately making him more powerful than ever before as the machine to Darth vader and now reaching his potential

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.530
as Darth vader the human sith Lord Capable of Force Lightning and

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:33.699
masterful combat acrobatics all the while strengthening his bond with the force through his natural limbs the clones would be hunted down by all the

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.850
Jedi in the Galaxy

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.420
Losing some but most would survive the betrayal

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.929
Palpatine would move to construct the death star as he had already planned

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.220
Further training vader in the dark side of the Force just as he had with Maul

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.629
But this time better as time would pass and padma's pregnancy would evolve

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:56.679
She would give birth to Luke and Leia at the care of yoda mace and Obi one they would train the Skywalker children from birth

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:03.939
Developing and mastering their gifts and natural talents creating the most powerful beings in the Galaxy next to the shaman of the [wills]

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.260
all the while

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:13.119
And it can would train every single day as he grew [older] stronger and more full of hatred he would own his skills and techniques

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:20.080
growing more powerful in the emperor and knowing he could overthrow him any day now his lust for power had grown so full that he

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:26.350
Had no more things to take for his own the emperor knew this he could feel this he knew it was only a matter of

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:32.290
Time until anakin killed him thinking a padme [everyday] and of his children that he never got to meet he longed for the day

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:39.849
He would return to the temple [so] powerful. He would make the Jedi masters who refused to make him a master bow before his feet

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.110
that day

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.110
was today

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.249
