00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.879
For nine days in the spring of 1940. This beach was the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of British soldiers

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.489
Trapped by Hitler's forces and bombed by German aircraft there seemed no escape

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.909
Out that nobody's gonna get out of this they can't get the download of us

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.679
Offshore the Royal Navy and a flotilla of little ships would pull off the most audacious rescue in British history

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:48.279
But while the little ships passed into legend the RAF were cast as villains

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.288
At Dunkirk the RAF was absolutely detested by the Army and the Navy

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.169
Britain's fighter pilots were accused of failing in their duty Dunkirk was seen as the RAF spora Stour

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.799
Some of the army were annoyed because there were no Spitfires and hurricanes around I can't say that I saw any other

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.059
Newly declassified wartime files are rewriting the history of Britain's miracle escape

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.818
For the first time since World War two, we're actually a lay off to see what's inside them

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.089
They overturn a long-standing slur on the RAF

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.879
Revealing a story of heroic sacrifice in the skies over dunker

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.970
This beach is a popular summer playground on the Belgian coast enjoyed by young families throughout the year

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.109
But today the police and the belgian army have created an exclusion zone that reaches far out to sea

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.819
And this is why they are here

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.409
- deadly Second World War shells will discover just a few feet beneath the sand

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
The discovery of wartime shells on this beach is far from unusual

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.359
Seven decades ago this stretch of sand witnessed intense air attacks on soldiers unable to defend themselves

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.739
The bomb squad carefully attached plastic explosives

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.430
The shells are every bit as lethal today as they were over 70 years ago

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.859
To limit the blast damage before detonation they ribÃ©ry the shells deep in the sand

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.750
Okay

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.239
But in the spring of 1940 this coastline was packed with men trapped on the evacuation beaches

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.358
This is a photograph taken at the time of soldiers under attack from German aircraft

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.029
Bullets bombs and shells were falling relentlessly on hundreds of thousands of British and French troops

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.370
The onslaught from the German air force the Luftwaffe seemed never-ending

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.049
They used to come over every half-hour during daylight your second watch today

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.229
How did the British find themselves in such a perilous position

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:29.479
When Germany invaded Poland in 1939 the British sent 150,000 troops into France

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.618
Called the British Expeditionary Force or BEF they were intended to act as a deterrent to further aggression

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:51.099
But on the 10th of May 1940 Hitler launched his blitzkrieg or lightning war

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.808
Hitler's troops supported by planes charged through Belgium and the Netherlands

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.309
As the British and French forces rushed to meet them head-on the German army took everyone by surprise

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.660
Using fast moving tanks supported by bombers

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.359
The Germans launched an even more powerful attack through the supposedly impenetrable Ardennes Forest

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.019
Pushing the British and French back toward the coast

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.060
When we got there the hole that dunker was on par with

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.589
This great all of smoke going up from the oil tanks

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.389
Our moment of walls were falling down

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.660
And to continual noise of the look off of loving the dogs we didn't hang about

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.650
Sartre seeing her

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.930
As the British army was retreating one Belgian civilian documented the chaos as the bombs fell around him

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.440
My uncle's father made these photographs in 1940 may 1940s

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.450
So he had his own camera and he was taking photographs all this was going on his camera or family

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.450
This have never been published before

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.300
Photographs from the Dunkirk evacuation are extremely rare

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:50.640
The thing that fascinates me is that these show the British Army in action. That was a knocked out truck

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.629
Historian Paul Reid has studied Dunkirk extensively

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.080
He's come to the home of Christoph to Kusum akka to see a collection of photos never seen before

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.549
Some of them taken moments after a Luftwaffe attack. I

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.170
Can see part of the windows blown out here and this is all damaged growth and this trucks partially destroyed

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.819
So this is obviously a really dangerous place to be and there's civilians moving around

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.920
There's some people just standing on the street corner here

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.279
it makes the hair stand up on the back of my leg to be honest with you and

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.830
Just amazing photographs

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.279
These show young men whose lives have been cut tragically short

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.599
Firm believer that people need to see these photographs and here these guys are just lying like broken toys

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.739
On the floor alongside their motorbike and some of their vehicles

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.500
I can remember for the first time smelling death

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:03.240
It was undescribable and it was this smell of rotting corpses

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.040
They had to walk through Dunkirk the smell or

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.970
Terrible, what was Pizza body's been laying there for some considerable time?

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.049
Well, that's a Tommy's helmet there, I think those two autonomous ailments

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.260
So it's a mixed grave of French and and British soldiers just buried in the sand quite close to the edge of the beach

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.250
And this marks the final resting place of the men trying to get off the beaches at Dunkirk

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.640
Journey down for these lights. Yep

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.440
With casualty numbers rising the troops were starting to wonder why they were left unprotected

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.029
They were kicking up how about where's our plane, you know when we were

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.560
under such

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.750
Terrible stress with the endless attacks. We were getting from the earth

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:14.169
Some of the army were annoyed because there were no Spitfires and hurricanes around I

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.520
Can't say that I saw any other

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.409
For the men on the ground death or capture seemed inevitable when something extraordinary happened

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.110
The Germans suddenly stopped

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:46.699
On the 23rd of May the German General von Rundstedt halted the Panzer divisions most of the generals under him

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.879
Really couldn't understand why he was doing that. They've made this

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.250
Incredible move towards the coast. I mean, it's absolutely unprecedented. They they've moved so fast

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.890
Historian Joshua Levine has spent years studying Dunkirk and particularly the halt order decision

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.309
He believes that it was made by Hitler and it was his deputy Hermann Goering --zz idea

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:21.590
Now Goering was a commander in chief of the Luftwaffe and what he said to Hitler don't leave this to the generals

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:27.140
Instead. Let me do it. Let the look far for do it. The Luftwaffe is Nazi

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.970
It supports you you will get the glory if we finish off the BEF

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:39.530
For a while Goering x' boasts that the Luftwaffe could finish off the british army looked as though it might succeed

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:50.449
You heard the aircraft come over and you saw them, I mean the the whole length of the beach was people on it

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:58.040
And though they were dive-bombing the kurma and they couldn't miss so there was some

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.339
Sacrifice every time there was an air ride

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.279
The Luftwaffe most feared weapon was the Stuka dive-bomber

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.010
At buzzer

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.200
noise Assad

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
I hated them

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:33.130
I used to make a terrible screeching noise coming out was a psychological loving detroit Ephraim. Knew who she did

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:43.450
Diving down with this awful to boiling Sun attached lease to decide sirens

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:52.309
They machined on the slot

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:58.988
You just thought well am I lucky I am I not nothing

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.230
It now appeared that the skies have been handed over to the stickers and the Messerschmitts

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.110
And the men in the firing line were beginning to ask

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.930
Where were the RAF I?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.620
Got so damn

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.040
Scared I suppose and fed up

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:25.629
I thought Alfred crocheted let the next one be mine because I can't stake us any longer and let's get it over and done

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.540
I'm not gonna get out of this because it seemed

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.379
inescapable and yet miraculously

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.749
Despite the apparent absence of the RAF men were escaping

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.860
Off shore and our murder of ships was gathering to come and save them

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.480
It was a desperate attempt to rescue at least some of the fleeing army

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:01.689
At the very beginning Churchill estimated that with luck something like 30,000 people would get off

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.449
Things didn't look good for the British Expeditionary Force things. Look very very bleak indeed

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.849
Day after day the bombardment continued while the soldiers made their escape

00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:25.508
But even when they did manage to get away catastrophe awaited me and for some there would be no going home

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.180
May 1940

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:52.180
The Royal Navy has sent a flotilla of ships from Britain to rescue the hundreds of thousands of troops trapped on the Dunkirk beaches

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:01.259
It will become known as the miracle of Dunkirk, aha

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:07.048
The feeling is indescribable. I don't Amitha. I'm gonna make it

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.999
But realizing an escape plan had been hatched

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:17.819
the Luftwaffe started bombing Dunkirk Harbor where the evacuation fleet was heading

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:28.558
So the troops were ordered to the beaches to the east of the town

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:36.209
But that left a major problem the gently shelving beaches were unsuitable for rescue

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.949
It was impossible for the big ships to reach the soldiers

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:48.058
There was only one way to get to the boats waiting offshore and it was fraught with danger

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:53.698
When we see the iconic images of men on beaches like this

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:59.729
We do see we're almost orderly queues of men going out to the ships going out to the point

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.920
They can swim out to a vessel and get away

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.240
The process of getting 500 men out to the waiting ships took up to eight hours

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.469
They desperately needed to speed things up

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.899
The roads to Dunkirk were littered with abandoned lorries now of no value to the army

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:28.929
However, when driven onto the sand at low tide they were to become priceless

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.459
So they came up with the idea of a lorry pier where they drive lorries onto the beach

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:40.659
And we've got a captured German photo here showing such a lorry pier

00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:46.899
They drive the lorries onto the beach line them up side by side front of the lorry here

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:49.839
Really lorry here and they put planking on the top

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:55.688
So the planking enabled them to walk across the ruse of the lorries get down there quickly a high tide

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:57.490
The water would be lapping up both sides

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.329
And there'll be lots little boats available

00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:04.659
To them ferry them from the far end of the lorry pier out to sea to the bigger boats

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.960
With the halt order over the German troops were once again on the advance

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.999
It would take them no more than a day and a half before they over round the beaches

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:27.110
The euro an hour till he had moved up man had started being out the drop shells on the beach

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320
That was a time to get out

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.970
All the while they were still being targeted from the air

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.660
it's just so allowing the same and

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.869
Pray, I don't think there were many atheists dunker the mark being ostrich

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:57.110
Offshore the Navy was fighting back, but they had to find a way of speeding up the evacuation

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.949
And a Dunkirk Harbor they found it

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.339
A mile long cause wave just one yard wide and never meant for mooring ships

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.849
It was called the Dunkirk move

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.979
And the idea would turn out to be a stroke of genius

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.509
Of all the snap decisions that were that were made on the spot for me

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:36.490
That is the greatest decision the idea to call this great big breakwater into service as something it was never meant to be

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:45.679
Very quickly, they were loading thousands of men onto the ship's now moored alongside the breakwater

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:54.889
One of the myths of Dunkirk was that most of the soldiers were taken off the beaches by the little ships when the reality was

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.380
2/3 escaped from the MOL

00:18:01.639 --> 00:18:09.459
Machine and gig and incursion and it didn't take long before the Luftwaffe realized what the British were up to

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.880
Once again and

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:20.549
Apparently unhindered by the RAF fighters the huncles and the stickers targeted the Dunkirk mo and the ships moored alongside it

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.659
But an escape from the mole was no guarantee of safety

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.250
12 miles into the English Channel

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.189
on the night of the 29th of May

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.899
The soldiers aboard the destroyer HMS wakeful thought they were safe

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.799
But the destroyers suffered one of the most prolonged aerial bombardments of the evacuation

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.459
Crippled by dioramas. She was eventually finished off by torpedoes

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.670
Just hours from home

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.250
over six hundred men were to perish

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.459
And wait for was basically broken in half three. She broke into two pieces and

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:12.259
What you were left with had you been there what you would have seen were two ends of the ship poking out of the water

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:22.730
The upshot of that was that when the ship went down these people basically didn't have a chance and they drowned almost immediately

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.660
It was one soldier who'd been on deck having a cigarette he got away all the rest would drown

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.550
One of the reasons that the evacuation of Dunkirk has resonated down the decades

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.960
Is that the Navy rescue was joined by a flotilla of privately owned vessels?

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.929
The so called little ships

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.670
Manned by civilian sailors desperate to do their bit

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.699
These are the last survivors of the 700 little ships which helped in the evacuation

00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:06.459
For many they're a poignant reminder of the Dunkirk miracle

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.340
But not all the civilian vessels did make it back home and

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.789
Today at very low tides. It is still possible to find evidence of one ships tragic story

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.380
So the captain brought it in he actually beached it yeah and so this is where it's sat ever since then yes

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.870
Joshua Levine is with local historian, Johan salmon

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.719
Winter storms and unusually low spring tides have revealed evidence of the bravery of the little ships

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.610
This is all that's left of the Thames paddle steamer the crested eagle

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:13.299
So this is the Bell this is the very front the very front this this here is what would have broken the water here

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:15.299
Yeah, Rob Lord, I see

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:24.120
Before the war the crested eagle took day-trippers from Tower Bridge in London to Southend pier on the Essex coast

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.960
She was used to carrying a full complement of passengers

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:45.500
So is it unusual then to get this view of it? Yeah that's abnormal today. So this is as clear as it is

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:51.379
On the 29th of May 1940

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:53.610
It was not day trippers

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:59.959
But exhausted british soldiers that the crested eagles captain picked up from the MOL at Dunkirk a few miles away

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:06.349
At about 6 o'clock in the evening it left them all

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:14.759
Very much, you know, we're not far from home. That's the point, you know these ships

00:22:15.489 --> 00:22:20.009
Were not far away from getting all the troops back to places like Dover and Ramsgate

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.880
Every inch of the paddle steamer was packed with men, but her journey was to be short-lived

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.969
With no apparent air cover the crested eagle was easy prey for the Stuka dive-bombers

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.689
They came down almost vertically

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.859
And then they let go of their bomb and had a very low altitude

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.809
And bear in mind that a ship like crested eagle left a very large weight

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.209
It was a very clear obvious target for the stupid

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.820
And they hit it

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.060
At least four bombs hit him

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:21.909
And there's an account from a sailor who was on board and

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:25.419
This sailor talks about a blazing Inferno

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.570
He said he saw our people

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:34.330
Walking up and down and their faces have been blasted off and their faces were melting and their arms were melting

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.330
he said he saw a

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:42.790
Left tenant and the only way you could recognize this man was was from the emblem on his steel helmet

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.010
And

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.040
From that moment on it was clear that

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:54.969
Crested eagle wasn't going to survive but what the captain managed to do amazingly was to bring it into Shore and Annie beached it

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.030
which is why we still have it here and on an

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.319
Extraordinary day like today when we have this spring tide we can see so much of it

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.139
These pictures of the crested eagle were taken by a German photographer in 1940

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.069
They show the devastating results of the Luftwaffe attack

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.000
It is thought that 300 men died on the paddle steamer that day

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.259
The Allies would lose over 230 ships at Dunkirk

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.799
Many of the wrecks littering the beaches bore the deep scars inflicted by the German bombers

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.979
It seemed that Goering Luftwaffe was doing its job

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.030
And the men on the beaches were still asking where were the RAF

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.859
At Dunkirk the RAF was

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.400
Absolutely detested by the Army and the Navy and the reason it was detested was because there was this idea

00:25:23.039 --> 00:25:29.839
From both that the RAF had simply not been there to defend them from the Luftwaffe because lift-off are attacking

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.360
constantly and it seemed

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.590
To the soldiers and sailors, but the RAF was doing nothing to defend them

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.360
But newly released files tell a different story

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:51.369
Far from being absent unseen from the beaches the RAF were laying the foundations for the Dunkirk miracle

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.719
As the Navy and the little ships were evacuating soldiers from Dunkirk

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:13.029
Questions were asked of the RAF. Where were they? Why had they abandon the men to the Luftwaffe?

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:16.659
Resentment soon turned to anger

00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:24.249
Wireless operator Arthur Taylor was told to get out of his RAF uniform if he wanted to escape

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:33.850
This left Herman came up to me and he said right tell your shoes off put some gum boots on

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.269
Take your jacket off and put this black Mackintosh on

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.959
Take your hat off and put a 10 out. I

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:48.729
Don't want you to be recognized as our as our RAF

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.720
And that's how I got on the boat

00:26:55.049 --> 00:27:00.229
The allegations that the RAF had played no part in the evacuation have never really gone away

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:07.669
But is it justified

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:14.599
While we're searching his book Joshua Levine has discovered a remarkable recording made by a Dunkirk fighter pilot

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.900
accession number 106

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:29.359
The recording was made by Squadron Leader Tony Barclay who recalls the ill feeling against him and his fellow Airmen

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
British soldiers were very

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:37.519
antagonistic towards the Air Force

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.329
Not me personally, but I heard about it. I

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.799
Mean nobody out arrow said you son of a bitch, you know

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.710
whether his bloody wings fuller you let us down at danke, but it was it was a very

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.639
common experience with pilot pilot

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.100
Squadron Leader Bartlett died in 2001

00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:11.539
So Joshua has come to the RAF Club in London to meet his widow Vicky who still has her husband's letters and logbook from Dunkirk

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.480
Hello

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.669
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you great to see you thank you very much for coming all this way

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.149
Like most RAF fighter pilots at the time

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.149
May 1940 was the first occasion the 21 year old Tony Bartley had been in action

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:39.020
He had talked to be about Dunkirk and he had mentioned how they were in

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.020
you know really bad odor with the

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.799
army, and

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:46.459
What do you think he meant by that was what was he?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.520
what was he trying to explain what he was trying to explain that the

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:55.819
Army, thought that the RAF hadn't done anything and weren't there for them and weren't protecting them

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.350
Viki Barclay has brought along a letter written by her husband

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.809
Which shows the true extent of the animosity between the troops and his fellow pilots at the time?

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.440
We heard from Pete Cazenove

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:17.569
One of our squadron who was shot down and captured at Dunkirk. He tried to get on three destroyers, but was turned off each one

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:23.929
The Navy said that all accommodation was reserved for the army and that the Air Force could go F themselves

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.689
Then there's another bit about Ireland dear who was another one who was shot down that day

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.010
another friend of mine

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.010
Was in the same predicament

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.419
But he knocked out the Navy a man who tried to stop him and got himself aboard

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:48.080
He was middleweight champion of the RAF a New Zealander and I guess the others thought it best to leave him alone

00:29:49.649 --> 00:29:56.239
This is extraordinary, I mean it is astonishing I mean that is daddy's is a crime actually to do that

00:29:58.049 --> 00:30:00.049
But Tony Bartley's logbook

00:30:00.419 --> 00:30:04.219
Detailing the very first day 92 squadron went into action over France

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.309
Suggests the RAF were in the thick of it

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.539
So this is written by your judgement by him

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:17.929
Yes in his notebook and it's on the 23rd of May. Mm-hmm, and it says patrol

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.789
Encountered 12 any one? Oh nine ten shot down

00:30:23.429 --> 00:30:28.699
By squadron fat Liam and killed patrol encountered about 50m

00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:31.440
e1s

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.440
bombers

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.720
So many bullets flying around

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:41.809
Hello sky was just bullets flying everywhere. I don't hardly be shot out in the damage

00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:43.879
You just went on until you ran out of ammunition

00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:51.619
Missing butl Gilles clich paddy wounded

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.659
Cazenove missing

00:30:54.659 --> 00:30:59.479
patrol encountered dawnia's 17 shot down in

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.750
scene one parachute escape I

00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:09.799
Mean that was all that day. I got hit 18 times in the morning to have times near afternoon

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:11.799
But I thought this is par for the course

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.419
The losses suffered by Bartley's squadron that day were high

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:25.669
Shows anything it's that the RAF was in the thick of the fight, but they were they were absolutely

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:34.459
Tony Barclays vivid accounts fly in the face of the soldiers claims that the RAF were absent at Dunkirk

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.879
Now at the National Archives in London

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:47.959
RAF files kept closed for seven decades have just been released and they seemed to support Barclays claims

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.950
They paint the most accurate picture yet of what was happening in the skies over Dunkirk

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:01.219
There are roughly 200 files that cover the Dunkirk period

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:07.969
From 26th of May II to the 2nd of June. So the main period of lifting men off the beaches

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:17.840
The Dunkirk casualty files are part of a larger group of RAF records opened each time an airman failed to return from a mission

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.489
Historian Simon Perry has studied the documents in forensic detail

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.540
and

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.429
He's been left in no doubt that the soldiers had simply got it wrong

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.909
The RAF were given a hard time immediately after Dunkirk

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.490
But it's completely

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.880
Unjustified. It's really a few of

00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:45.549
The poor sods are on the beach

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.280
waiting to be lifted off and

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:55.630
It was a view born more of ignorance. They before they could even reach the soldiers on the beaches and

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.270
There was another reason

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.459
The battles were being fought at great height

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:11.919
At four or five miles above them and there's no way that the troops on the beach could see what the RAF were doing

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:20.889
Simon's research from the files also reveals that huge numbers of RAF planes were being lost out at sea

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.699
As pilots tried to stop the Luftwaffe bombing the ships and the beaches

00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:33.478
The fact that the soldiers didn't see the Spitfires and hurricanes whizzing around their heads

00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:41.279
Is immaterial but nevertheless they had a view I didn't see them. They weren't in my eye sight

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:47.129
And so you have these attacks on them saying well, where was the bloody RAF?

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.339
The files show that of the start of the Blitzkrieg

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:59.499
The RAF was suffering unsustainable losses in their attempts to hold back the German army

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:09.399
Then something remarkable happened somehow the RAF turned the tide

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:19.259
A clue to this dramatic transformation can be found in the casualty file belonging to Squadron Leader Jeffrey Stevenson

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:27.840
Remarkably Stevenson squadron of just twelve RAF fighters sawed off an attack force of fifty German aircraft

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:37.429
The reason behind this outstanding performance was the aircraft Stephenson was flying that day

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.609
the Marquand Supermarine Spitfire

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:50.189
This was the first time the Spitfire had faced the Luftwaffe and it would go on to change the course of the Second World War

00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.769
Unlike the hurricane which had been in France since the start of the conflict in May 1940. The Spitfire was completely untested

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:13.540
Stevenson Spitfire was eventually shot down over France, but Dunkirk was not to be its final resting place

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800
Hello John don't pretend you're working

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:24.609
Steve Vizard and John remain have both spent a lifetime restoring second world war fighter planes

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:38.560
It was from duxford aerodrome in Cambridgeshire that Geoffrey Stephenson and his squadron of Spitfires were based in May 1940

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.789
And this is the very Spitfire he flew over Dunkirk

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.259
So here she Steve in three two, double like yeah

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:56.770
Jeffrey Stevenson fresh from Dunkirk fresh from Duncan and she's exactly the same markings nailers

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.729
Yeah, she was then was exactly there for the last detail

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:08.139
Squadron Leader Stevenson was in action near dunkirk on May the 26th 1940 when his Spitfire

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.800
N32, double-o was shot down in combat

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:19.770
And of course this airplane was lost with one bullet going through one of these pipes and

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:26.249
Cause and that was enough to overheat over heat and he then knew he wasn't going to get back to England

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.489
So that's why he belied the aeroplane down on the beach

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:37.859
Geoffrey Stephenson survived the crash and for a while in the summer of 1940 his Spitfire

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:42.749
Became something of a tourist attraction for the German soldiers now occupying France

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.739
It eventually disappeared beneath the sand and the sea

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800
In 1986

00:36:53.850 --> 00:37:00.499
Stephenson's aircraft was recovered, but it would take almost 30 years before the Spitfire was fully restored

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:06.080
Then you can actually see the guns the breech is up there current you. Yeah, you can't look in there there in that

00:37:12.549 --> 00:37:19.829
Armed with eight machine guns set in the Spitfires revolutionary elliptical wings the mark one was built for high-speed maneuvers

00:37:21.009 --> 00:37:24.178
Britain's newest fighter could out match any German plane

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.510
Especially when tweaked with a few personal touches

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.590
The early aeroplanes that they didn't have rearview mirrors at all

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.560
So once they started to get into combat

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:52.419
they realized that they needed a mirror and so before they could start putting them on the aeroplanes in production all the

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:59.530
Pilots started running around producing their own mirrors and this was Jeffrey's version of it, and it was the mirror from his mg

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:10.549
For the Spitfire pilots, like jeffrey stevenson and tony botti dunkirk was the first time they would go into battle

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:20.679
Here they would face german airman who already had combat experience in poland as well as spain

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:30.089
And from the start the Spitfire pilots began to make a difference you see what we did at danke we turned them back

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:37.589
Although we're only 12, you know, we used to molest them and they just turn around and then just take off

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.800
The Dunkirk miracle owed as much to the brilliance of the RAF as it did to the Navy and the little ships

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.580
But it was the Spitfire and it's untested pilots who really made it possible

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.179
The lessons they learned at Dunkirk would prove invaluable

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.010
Because the Germans were not about to stop at the English Channel and

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.659
The Spitfires would fly into legend

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:25.670
By the 4th of June 1940 the Dunkirk evacuation was over and for the soldiers of the BEF who had managed to get away

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.870
It was a short journey across the English Channel and a glorious homecoming

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.090
Could feel the boat going up and down with the waves I

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.240
Was so tired. I

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.580
fell asleep next

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.699
Thing I knew someone was shaking me saying wake up we're coming into Folkston

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:54.679
Over the course of nine days almost 340 thousand troops were safely evacuated from Dunkirk

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.150
Back in England, they were greeted with a hero's welcome

00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:05.309
Waitin on the case over all these

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.119
wvs

00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:11.429
with cakes and tea and that because well

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.859
I've been shot late all my battle dress

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:20.460
There was a bit blood stains and all these ladies made a grab for me to take care of their wounded hero

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.740
And it was him all dying from them ladies and any bloody cuts

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.220
Most would return to barracks

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.950
While the fortunate would go home to their families

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:36.689
they put me on a train Phil my father lived and

00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:43.019
I got under the gun trained and it gave me a salute see bridges

00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:50.578
And my usual ticket collector said welcome home, sir. We thought you was lost

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.620
I

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.809
Don't understand and they welcomed us as heroes

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:04.500
They capped us and cheered us. I simply didn't understand him. I

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.180
Mean the British can turn of the defeat into a victory

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.420
Winston Churchill described Dunkirk as a miracle of deliverance

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:23.038
He had expected to report the greatest military disaster in Britain's history

00:41:27.729 --> 00:41:33.299
At the beginning Churchill had estimated that as few as 20 thousand troops would get away

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.199
And yet in the end the Royal Navy would rescue over a third of a million soldiers

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.129
But many thousands would not make it home and

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.979
They are commemorated here at the British War Cemetery on the outskirts of Dunkirk. I

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:05.589
Think it's absolutely fair to say that Dunkirk was a miracle. It was a miracle of deliverance in the way Churchill spoke about it

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:15.010
Dunkirk is an incredibly important event because if the British Expeditionary Force had been taken prisoner

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:22.570
The likelihood is that Britain would have had to surrender if Britain had surrendered the war would have been over at that point

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:30.009
The pilots of RAF Fighter Command had played their part in keeping Britain in the war and the Luftwaffe knew it too

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.070
Kesselring the general in charge of the German air force at Dunkirk

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:43.000
Acknowledged that in the end. It was the Spitfire which enabled the British to evacuate across the water

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.829
Guren had halted the German advance for his bombers to finish off the British army

00:42:51.849 --> 00:42:53.849
But he hadn't reckoned on the Spitfire

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.169
The RAF lost 900 planes

00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:04.709
But 1400 Luftwaffe aircraft was stopped from reaching the beaches

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:12.000
Just as important the Spitfire pilots were learning valuable lessons

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:23.520
Oh god, it was important to get that experience and get that training to basically gear itself up for the fight. That was to come

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:30.480
Just six weeks after Dunkirk the Battle of Britain would transform the re s tarnished reputation

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:40.619
In the skies over southern England the pilots of Fighter Command went defeat the Luftwaffe and save Britain from invasion

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:45.539
But it was at Dunkirk that the RAF at first come of age

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.280
today

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.859
Squadron Leader, Jeffrey Stevenson's restored mark 1 Spitfire is on a special mission

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:04.919
For the first time in 77 years, it returns to the skies were he and his fellow pilots learned their trade

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.800
It was over the beaches of Dunkirk the pilots realized with the Spitfire they had a machine that could save the day

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.090
Who got the expeditionary force off the beachhead we did

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:32.550
One of those Spitfire pilots Tony Bartley who was in combat at Dunkirk was in no doubt as to who really did save the BEF

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.979
Who got him off fire command, let's not kid ourselves

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:52.940
Only now can we appreciate the crucial role this remarkable aircraft played in the evacuation of over 300,000 men

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:03.540
They call it the miracle of Dunkirk, yeah, it was a miracle and for those who did get home

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.240
the memories of that miracle

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640
Remain with them

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:15.389
You're thinking about it all the time day in day out Dunkirk

00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:22.109
He never goes away on

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.210
Her own

00:45:30.369 --> 00:45:37.679
And we came back. It was a miracle of Dunkirk. We rose again from the ashes

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:57.690
Starting next Saturday at 7:00 following the roots of legend britain's ancient tracks with Tony Robinson

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:06.119
Next night retracing the footsteps of the daring POWs who fled the camp's the freedom trails of world war ii 'the great escapes
