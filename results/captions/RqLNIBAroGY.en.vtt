00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.430
- Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd,
The Everyday Astronaut.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.250
We're at a really exciting time,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.090
where the number of crewed vehicles

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.930
going to the International Space Station

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.500
will go from just one to three.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.680
The Soyuz's eight year monopoly

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.520
for getting humans up to the
International Space Station

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.000
is finally coming to an end.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.810
So today we're gonna take a deep dive

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.240
on the two new spaceships that
are going to be responsible

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.410
for taking humans to and from

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.030
the International Space
Station from the United States.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.863
So we're gonna compare

00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:29.100
the Boeing Starliner,
riding an Atlas V rocket,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.647
to SpaceX's Crew Dragon
on their Falcon 9 Rocket.

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:33.480
And to see how we've progressed

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.680
in the world of human spaceflight,
we're also gonna compare

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.060
all of these systems alongside
Russia's Soyuz capsule

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.870
and the United States'
retired Space Shuttle,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330
in a side by side comparison.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.840
We'll take a look at the
designs, the rockets they ride,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.540
the dimensions, the cost,
the safety considerations,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.490
and any other unique feature
that each vehicle offers.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.360
Considering I've been
up close and personal

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.180
with SpaceX's Crew Dragon
Capsule and Boeing's Starliner,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.440
I think I've got some pretty
good insight on these vehicles.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.322
Let's get started!

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:00.438
- [Technician] Three, two, one.

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:01.271
And liftoff!

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.650
(upbeat rhythmic music)

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.973
- [Neil] That's one small step for man.

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:08.893
- [Technician] Let's clear
the traffic for the test one.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:09.726
(beeping)

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:10.620
- The International Space Station

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.020
is still one the greatest
feats of human engineering.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.150
I mean after all, it's
a football field-sized

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.850
floating laboratory traveling
10 times faster than a bullet,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.610
circling the Earth every 90 minutes.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.120
It's taken 33 launches to put
all of its pieces into orbit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.340
and has been home to over 230 people

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010
from almost 20 countries.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.210
The ISS typically has
six astronauts onboard.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.940
Crew are sent up in groups of three

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.920
and usually reside at the
station for six months.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.870
There is typically a three month overlap

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.600
for existing crew and newly arriving crew.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.720
But since the Space Shuttle
program ended in 2011,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.350
there's only been a
single ride to the ISS,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.170
that's Russia's Soyuz vehicle.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260
But we're coming up on
a really exciting time,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.820
as the United States prepares
to send U.S. astronauts

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.440
to the International Space
Station from U.S. soil

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.780
on two brand new spaceships!

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.050
And what I think is most exciting,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.390
is NASA has hired private companies

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.650
to do the development and the operations

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.320
in a new program called the
Commercial Crew Program.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.280
The two companies that won the contracts

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.150
are SpaceX and Boeing.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.230
I'm not really going to get into

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.290
how the Commercial Crew
Program got started

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.450
or has progressed in today's video,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570
I mostly want to talk about the hardware,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.070
starting off with Boeing
and their Starliner.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.680
Boeing started designing the Starliner,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.860
originally known as the CST-100, in 2010,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.200
after winning a contract from
NASA for the CCDev program.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.650
The Starliner is the traditional

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.520
truncated-cone capsule design,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.370
much like previous spacecraft
from the United States.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.070
It can carry up to seven
astronauts at a time,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.990
although NASA won't use more
than four seats at a time.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.410
The Starliner will be
the first orbital capsule

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.120
to land on solid ground
in the United States.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.700
Now this is similar to how
the Soyuz capsule lands,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.440
and also how Blue Origin's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.990
Suborbital New Shepard capsule lands.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930
There are five landing sites proposed

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.130
in the Western United States,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.470
but the two prime sites will be

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.910
the U.S's. Army's White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.720
and the Army's Dugway
Proving Grounds in Utah.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.500
Starliner will land using parachutes

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.210
and a set of large airbags.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.730
A pair of drogue chutes are deployed

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.700
at about nine kilometers in altitude,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.300
followed by a trio of main
chutes at 3.6 kilometers,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.250
and at 1.5 kilometers in altitude,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.300
the heat shield is ditched and
the six airbags are inflated.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.480
These airbags serve a dual purpose.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.900
In nominal cases, the airbags
will soften the landing

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.700
when landing on land,
and in off-nominal cases,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.010
like an abort or an emergency reentry,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.470
the airbags offer buoyancy and
balance for water landings.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.690
Touching down on land will
allow the Starliner an easy path

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.480
to refurbishment and reusability.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.280
Boeing is hoping to be
able to turn one around

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.750
in just six months and
reuse them up to 10 times!

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.930
That's definitely a good thing.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.380
Since the crew will land on solid ground,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.770
recovery of crew is quite
different than a splashdown.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.010
On the edge of the landing zone

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.850
there will be a Mobile Data
Tracking Vehicle, or MDTV,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.137
as well as a Mobile Landing
Control Center, or MLCC,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:06.440
and a host of other recovery
vehicles waiting to pounce.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.660
Once touchdown is confirmed,
a small army of vehicles

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.850
will race their way across the desert.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.320
Now I picture this pretty much

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.120
being like a real life Mad Max scenario,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.840
so Boeing, please send us videos of this.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.510
Upon arrival, a crew will check

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.100
and stabilize the hydrazine fuels

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.680
and then ground the vehicle
for static electricity.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.430
After that, an HVAC truck will roll up

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.900
and start to cool the spacecraft,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.670
including the crew and the fuels.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.760
Next up a Mobile Landing
Platform will pull up with stairs

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.700
and begin to evacuate the crew.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.900
Boeing has to pull crew
out within one hour

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.420
and cargo out within two.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.620
The person who actually extracts the crew

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.350
is a member of Boeing's
Fire and Rescue team,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.660
which I think is pretty cool.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.610
The crew is taken out

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.480
and then sent over to a
truck for medical check ups

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.380
and then whisked away
on a NASA helicopter.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.860
Eventually the capsule itself

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.760
will be loaded up with a small crane truck

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.750
and taken back to begin refurbishment.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.020
The cockpit of Starliner

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.970
takes a fairly conservative
and familiar approach.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.160
Although it's a lot less cluttery

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.930
than the Space Shuttle's cockpit,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.790
it still features familiar
and traditional controls,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.040
buttons and non-touch screens.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.970
The Starliner will dock
to the ISS and not berth.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.660
Docking is where the vehicle actually does

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.340
all the final maneuvering,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.430
until it connects itself
up with the docking port.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.700
Dragon 1 and Cygnus cargo vehicles

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970
both currently berth to the station,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.030
meaning they park and then
are grappled to the station

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.250
via the Canada Arm or Canadarm.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.450
Astronauts get in and out of
the side hatch when on Earth,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.670
but when docked, they'll
crawl through the top part

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.710
that connects to the
International Space Station

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.750
via the International
Docking Adapter on the ISS.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.270
Initially getting into
and out of the Starliner

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.770
is admittedly a bit cumbersome.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.630
Astronauts need to
shimmy into their seats,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.010
lying on their backs.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.180
The spacecraft is two main sections,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.460
the crew module and a service module.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.180
The crew module is, well
exactly what you'd think,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.380
it's where the crew goes.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.620
It's also the part that survives reentry.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.740
The service module houses propellant tanks

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.620
for orbital maneuvering, the
orbital maneuvering thrusters,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.830
the launch abort motors,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.740
which are on the bottom
in a pusher configuration,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.310
solar panels on the bottom,
and radiators on the sides,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.920
as well as a host of other things.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.130
The abort motors are four
Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-88 Bantams

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.620
modified to run on hypergolic fuels,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.850
to function as a launch abort motor.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.550
The first uncrewed test flight, OFT-1

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.970
will fly with the
qualification test motors,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.960
but they'll be inactive since
there will be no crew onboard.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.650
In the event of an issue with the booster,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.230
or a rapid unscheduled disassembly,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.910
these abort motors would be used

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.480
up until a few minutes into
flight, after which time

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.840
the vehicle would just use
the maneuvering thrusters.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.750
The Starliner offers a
full envelope abort window,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.100
meaning the astronauts can abort

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.110
at any time and remain safe.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.440
Boeing designed the Starliner

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.280
to be able to ride on
a variety of rockets,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.210
including the Atlas V, the
Delta IV, and the Falcon 9.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.100
They wound up selecting

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.270
United Launch Alliance's Atlas V for now,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.610
and eventually ULA's
upcoming Vulcan rocket

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.040
will likely fly Starliner.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.980
The exact Atlas V they selected is an N22.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.650
Now here's a quick
reminder of those numbers.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.450
The first part of the name
represents the fairing size,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.820
the options being four meters,
five meters, or N for none.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.370
The middle number is the amount
of strap-on rocket boosters

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.800
and can range from zero to five.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.390
The last number is the
number of RL-10 engines

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.200
on the centaur upper stage.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.270
The centaur can have one or two RL-10s.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.310
So putting this all together,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.220
the Atlas V that will launch the Starliner

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.370
will have no fairing, since
it has a Starliner on top,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.520
it will have two solid rocket boosters

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.520
and dual RL-10 engines on the
upper stage, hence the N22.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.260
When the Starliner launches,
it'll be the first time

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.670
ULA's actually used a dual
RL-10 centaur upper stage

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.590
on the Atlas V, however
the dual engine centaur

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.050
has been flying since 1962

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.120
and flew on the Atlas
III as recently as 2005!

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.530
So it's definitely not anything new.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.008
So why are Boeing and ULA
using a dual-engine centaur

00:07:58.008 --> 00:08:00.780
when the Starliner is relatively light?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.600
The RL-10 engine is crazy efficient,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.400
but one thing it's not is powerful.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.920
In order to allow for enough time

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.250
for a standard single engine

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.210
to push the upper stage and it's payload

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.400
into orbital velocities without
reentering the atmosphere,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.750
the first stage of the Atlas V

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.700
usually lofts itself into
an extra high altitude,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.530
allowing for more time for the upper stage

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.000
to do its circularization burn.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.030
This works great for standard payloads,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.390
but in the case of an abort,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.910
this trajectory is actually way too steep,

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.020
generating crazy high,
unsurvivable G forces

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.110
when it hits the atmosphere.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.000
So in order to maintain a
nice, safe, shallow profile

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.210
for the fragile and
precious humans onboard,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.350
the upper stage needed more oomph,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.210
and the solution to that
was the dual-engine centaur!

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.530
If you need more info on this
unique engineering solution,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.350
Scott Manley has an awesome video on it.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.100
Boeing and ULA will also be running

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.130
a secondary flight computer
that'll be running in parallel

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.100
to the primary flight computer
on the centaur upper stage.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.100
It'll catch any errors in the flight plan

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.150
faster than a human reaction time,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.400
shutting down the engines
and triggering an abort.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.700
Another design consideration

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.230
is due to the blunt nose of the Starliner.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.810
You'll see these little lattice structures

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.120
around the outside.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.240
The Starliner was designed

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.550
to be as stable as possible for reentry,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.370
which means having a
short and stout design.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.203
The lattice structure

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:16.180
helps diffuse the
airflow over the vehicle,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.060
helping to make sure
there are no shock waves

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.560
or inadvertent pressure areas

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.560
over the lower portion
of the vehicle on ascent,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.960
especially since the
rocket actually tapers down

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.000
to the skinny centaur upper stage.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.100
They also added an aerodynamic skirt

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.900
to ensure smooth airflow.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.800
Despite the Apollo Spacecraft
being a similar shape,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.620
the Saturn V it rode on top
of, kind of wedding caked out,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.220
tapering wider and wider,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.800
and therefore didn't have
those design considerations.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.480
Starliner Astronauts will take off

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.190
from ULA's launch pad SLC-41

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.820
at Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station in Florida.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.300
The pad has already been
fitted with the crew access arm

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.640
in preparations for the
first crew launches.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.040
This will be the first time

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.500
humans have launched from
this particular launch pad,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.690
which is awesome and also the first time

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.680
humans have launched from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.590
since Apollo 7 in 1968.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.760
We'll get into the dimensions,
the designs, prices, and more

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.154
when we do a side by side
comparison of all the vehicles.

00:10:11.154 --> 00:10:14.404
(upbeat melodic music)

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.640
Now onto the other new spaceship,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.860
SpaceX's Crew Dragon or Dragon 2.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.210
Dragon 2 is the follow up

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.760
to SpaceX's very successful Dragon capsule

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.300
that has flown cargo to and
from the ISS since 2012.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.610
The Dragon capsule was
originally called DragonRider

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.240
when it was initially proposed to NASA

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.785
for the CCDev program.

00:10:33.785 --> 00:10:36.520
SpaceX was not selected
for the first round,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.820
perhaps because the Dragon
capsule had noses all around it,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.390
but SpaceX was selected

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.040
during the second round of contracts.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.510
The original DragonRider capsule

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.560
was essentially just a crew rated version

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.930
of their Dragon Capsule,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.320
which at the time was getting ready

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.360
for its first test flights to orbit

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.280
and was already on contract
to resupply the ISS

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.000
which it would later do in 2012.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.910
In 2014, SpaceX revealed

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.010
the updated version of the Dragon capsule

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.970
which would carry astronauts
at their HQ in Hawthorne.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.160
The Dragon 2 was a massive redesign

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.700
of the original Dragon Capsule,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.420
including seating for
up to seven astronauts,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.810
although again, NASA won't be
using more than four at a time

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.090
for the Commercial Crew Program.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.500
Dragon 2 was originally planning

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.710
to also touch down back on
land using the abort motors,

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.770
assuming they weren't used for an abort,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.390
to come to a nice soft touchdown anywhere.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.300
However, due to a few reasons,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.300
SpaceX ditched propulsive landings

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.950
and will do a parachute recovery

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.430
and splashdown in the ocean,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.210
much like the current Dragon Capsule.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.890
If you need to know more about why SpaceX

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.570
canceled propulsively
landing their Dragon Capsule,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.530
I've already got you covered.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.440
The Crew Dragon's primary landing zone

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.620
is the Atlantic ocean,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.870
which is different from
the current Dragon Capsule

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.960
which has been splashing
down in the Pacific Ocean

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.410
since its first launch
and recovery in 2010.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.540
SpaceX also filed to
have the Gulf of Mexico

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.670
be a contingency landing site too,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.970
which I believe would be a first.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.520
SpaceX has a pair of ships,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.430
named Go Searcher and Go Navigator,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.500
that'll be in charge of crew recoveries.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.970
Go Searcher features a hoist

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.310
capable of lifting the
Dragon capsule onto the deck

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.860
and then offloading the crew.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.060
There's also communication relays

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.370
and a helicopter landing pad

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.300
to get the crew home after splashdown.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.820
Go Searcher has been part of
SpaceX's fleet for a while,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.860
aiding in the recovery efforts

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.460
of Falcon 9 drone ship landings,

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.420
as well as Dragon 1 recoveries.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.510
Despite the ocean landings,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.130
SpaceX does has refurbishment
and reuse plans for Dragon 2,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.520
although not quite like
you might be thinking.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.110
Refurbished Dragon 2's
won't carry humans again,

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.380
but they'll eventually be used

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.950
to carry cargo for CRS-2 missions.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.240
SpaceX already has experience

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.280
refurbishing splash
downed Dragon Capsules,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.320
and has reflown five
Dragon capsules to date,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.650
although according to Elon Musk in 2017,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.620
he mentions it's almost as expensive

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.750
to refurbish the splash downed Dragons

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.210
as it is to build new ones.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.150
But I'm sure since then

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.520
they've implemented streamlined processes

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.210
which have helped made
the efforts worthwhile.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.960
The design of the Crew Dragon capsule

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.080
is extremely minimalistic.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.180
It's easy to see that
the design was influenced

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.320
by Elon who likes things simple.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.970
The interior looks like the
Tesla Model 3 of spaceships

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.360
compared to Knight Rider's car, Kitt.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.910
Some unique features of the interior

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.710
are touchscreens and movable chairs.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.550
When Dragon 2 was first revealed,

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.240
Elon sat in a seat and pulled
the screen down to him,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.590
that's now reversed, as
the screens are stationary

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.370
and the seats move up to them.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.090
Again, just like the Starliner,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.820
the Dragon 2 is designed
to be fully autonomous

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.340
with manual overrides really
only there as contingencies.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.750
But the Dragon 2 does something

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.740
that the old Dragon 1
couldn't do, and that's dock.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.960
Getting into the Crew Dragon capsule

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.690
is done via the side hatch.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.740
Once you poke your head in,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.200
it's very spacious and minimalistic.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.010
It's easy to plop into
the seat and get comfy.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.300
I actually really think
this layout makes sense.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.180
Like the Starliner,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.800
the Dragon 2 is actually
two sections as well.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.830
There's the Crew Module and the Trunk.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.780
The crew module is again, the
part that holds the humans,

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.300
but it also has the
Super Draco abort motors

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.900
integrated onto it.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.370
Since this portion of the
spacecraft is recovered,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.800
the Super Draco motors
are also recovered, yay!

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.030
Just like the Starliner,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.100
the Super Dracos run on
hypergolic propellants

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.180
and offer a full envelope
abort window as well.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.050
The trunk is an unpressurized
section of the spacecraft,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.780
just like it is on Dragon 1.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.980
This allows for the ability
to take up larger components

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.890
that wouldn't fit
through the docking port,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.860
or items that are installed
on the outside of the station.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.840
Items that are inside
the trunk are retrieved

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.160
via the Canadarm2 or
another arm named Dextre.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.360
The trunk of the Dragon
2 offers a unique layout

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.840
with stationary solar panels

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.400
covering one side of the vehicle

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.640
and radiators on the other side.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.480
The old Dragon 1 had
extending solar panels.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.313
This makes sense

00:14:32.313 --> 00:14:34.650
because you want the solar
panels to be facing the sun,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.970
and you want the radiators
away from the sun.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.040
So, pretty cool design.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.620
The trunk also has some fins

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.110
to help stabilize the vehicle
in the event of an abort.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.010
And again, I already did
a video all about this,

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.400
so if you want to learn more
about the fins on the Dragon,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.320
and why they matter during an
abort, check out this video.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.370
The trunk is detached prior to reentry

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.770
and burns up due to a
lack of a heat shield.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.870
This allows for disposal of
some on station items as well.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.660
A very fiery garbage service.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.970
The Dragon 2 is designed to
exclusively fly on the Falcon 9,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.010
although there were plans

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.960
for it to fly on Falcon
Heavy at one point,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.880
but SpaceX no longer plans
to human-certify Falcon Heavy

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.870
and instead is focusing on Starship.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.920
In order for the Falcon
9 to be crew rated,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.610
NASA required a design freeze
of their Block 5 variant

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.140
since SpaceX tends to upgrade
their vehicles so frequently,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.440
they sometimes introduce
unintended consequences.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.470
Part of this design freeze
also required the use

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.833
of a new Composite Overwrapped
Pressure Vessel or COPV.

00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:32.540
A COPV failure was the root
cause of the AMOS-6 pad anomaly

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.620
and a COPV strut was the
cause of the CRS-7 failure.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.850
SpaceX started flying
a newly designed COPV

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.310
at the end of 2018.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.280
It's kind of unusual that
NASA required a design freeze.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.460
I mean considering NASA has
considered flying humans

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.070
on the 2nd launch of
SLS, or even more crazy,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.990
there's even been talks

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.870
of them putting humans on
the first flight of SLS.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.090
But SpaceX is known to
make changes, all the time,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.690
in the constant pursuit of improvement,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.490
so I think a safer, more
conservative approach,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.130
is a good idea when
human lives are involved.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.010
The Falcon 9's flight
profile with the crew

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.740
also had to be altered
compared to the cargo versions

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.770
to ensure the safest
profile in case of an abort.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.890
Due to the shallower, flatter profile,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.310
it also means the first
stage booster of the Falcon 9

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.960
will not do a return
to launch site landing

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.180
and will have to land
downrange on the drone ship.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.410
The upper stage of the Falcon 9

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.330
uses the Merlin 1D Vacuum engine

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.350
which is extremely powerful,
but not very efficient.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.410
It will have no problem
maintaining a shallow profile.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.170
Crew will climb on top
of a Block 5 Falcon 9

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.090
poised at Launch Complex 39A

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.870
at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.900
Now I have to say, not
that it's a contest,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.180
but SpaceX definitely does have
the coolest launch pad ever.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.220
I mean after all, this
is the same launch pad

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.640
that humans took off
from to go to the moon.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.410
Crew will go up the
Fixed Service Structure

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.510
that's a relic from the Space Shuttle era,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.130
although SpaceX has done a lot of work

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.480
to remove the rotating service
structure, repaint the tower,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.610
add cladding, and attach
their mobile access arm.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.230
One thing that SpaceX will be doing

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.170
that's completely new in the
world of human spaceflight

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.900
and actually took some convincing

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.100
to make NASA consider a valid option,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.600
is a load and go fueling procedure.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.400
Since SpaceX uses super
chilled propellants,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.830
they need to load them up into the vehicle

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.520
as late as possible so they
don't warm up and boil off

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.460
before the vehicle takes off.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.300
SpaceX actually continues
to fuel the rocket

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.130
up until just three
minutes before lift off.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.230
Now clearly three minutes

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.520
isn't nearly enough
time to get up the tower

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.330
and strap the crew into
the Dragon Capsule,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.640
and then leave the tower,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.000
so the crew will actually
enter before propellant load

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.960
and will remain onboard while
the vehicle is fueled up.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.000
I can clearly understand
how this is different,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.740
but I actually feel like
it's kind of a safer move.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.040
I mean this means the
astronaut and the ground crew

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.970
never need to approach a fully
loaded vehicle on the pad.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:47.970
Once fuel starts flowing,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.570
the crew is actually in the
safest place imaginable,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.420
a tightly sealed pressure vessel

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.650
armed with a powerful abort system.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.760
So despite the process of fueling up

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.430
being pretty risky, the crew
is in a very safe place.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.170
Can you imagine, this will
be the first time in history

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.750
a human ear will hear the
sound of cryogenic fuel

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.270
flowing into the vehicle.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.340
They'll hear all those creaks
and strains of the vehicle

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.340
as it comes to life.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.460
That's gonna be crazy!

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.680
Another fun fact is the crew
will arrive to the launch site

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.010
in Tesla Model Xs, of course!

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.470
Man, SpaceX will be putting on
a new show, that's for sure.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.280
Now lastly, before we get
to the direct comparisons,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.670
did you know both launch pads
have an amusement park ride?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.180
Well not quite, but each pad
does have an emergency zipline

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.300
capable of evacuating astronauts
and ground crew in a hurry

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.420
in the unlikely event
of say a leak or a fire.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.270
While I'm sure there's limited use cases

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.470
when these would be remotely useful,

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.520
it does look like it'd be pretty fun,

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.561
well, assuming you're not
being chased by a fireball.

00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:49.200
Okay, wow, enough of the rundown.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.430
It's time to compare these
vehicles side by side

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.200
and see how these new vehicles compare

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.806
to the Soyuz and the Space Shuttle.

00:18:54.806 --> 00:18:58.056
(upbeat melodic music)

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.180
So first off, let's just line
these vehicles up side by side

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.270
and compare their sizes.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.430
Yeah, the Space Shuttle Orbiter

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:12.430
clearly dwarfs these vehicles
in size, that thing is huge!

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.030
And because of its immense
size, we're gonna focus in

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.180
on just the crew module
portion of the Shuttle,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.090
so we can see these other vehicles.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.720
But don't forget about the rest of it,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.870
we'll still be talking
about the system as a whole,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.830
since the aft end is its service module

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.420
and the cargo bay is similar in nature

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.600
to the trunk of the Dragon
capsule, just way, way bigger.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.660
But notice how much bigger
the Starliner and Dragon are

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.830
compared to the Soyuz!

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.100
So let's run through their dimensions

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.520
starting with their height.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.240
The Starliner stands five meters tall

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.920
with the service module attached,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.720
the Crew Dragon is 8.1
meters tall with the trunk

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.350
and the Soyuz is 7.5 meters tall

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.120
with the orbital module and
service module attached.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.580
The Space Shuttle, we'll
show its length as height,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.140
because that's the way it stood
when was it was on the pad.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.650
It stood 37 meter tall from tail to nose.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.820
Next their width.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.170
The Starliner is 4.5 metes wide,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.210
the Dragon Capsule 3.7 meters
wide, the Soyuz 2.2 meters,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.480
and the Space Shuttle's crew
compartment and payload bay

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.500
were 4.6 meters wide,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.550
we'll ignore the wings
for this comparison.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.540
I feel like we're gonna
have a lot of asterisks

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.300
when we compare these
vehicles to the Space Shuttle,

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.630
because that thing was a
completely different beast.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.790
Next up, dry mass.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.790
Starliner is 13 tonnes,
Dragon is 9.5 tonnes,

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.460
the Soyuz capsule is
shockingly light at 7.1 tonnes,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.590
and the Space Shuttle,
yeah you can imagine,

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.280
this is quite a bit
heavier at 68.5 tonnes.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.113
As mentioned earlier,

00:20:33.113 --> 00:20:35.840
Crew capacity for both
Starliner and Dragon is seven,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.130
but again, NASA will only use four.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.020
The Soyuz Capsule can fit three, barely,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.720
and the Shuttle could fit up to eight,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.870
although seven was much more common.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.270
Now for volume, both
pressurized and unpressurized.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.770
Starliner has 11 cubic meters

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.290
of pressurized volume
and no unpressurized.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.960
Dragon 2 has 10 cubic
meters of pressurized volume

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.810
and 14 cubic meters of
unpressurized volume.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.410
Soyuz has 8.5 cubic meters of pressurized

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.015
and no unpressurized volume.

00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:03.950
The Space Shuttle is of course king here

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.550
with 74.3 cubic meters
of pressurized volume

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.300
and 300 cubic meters of
unpressurized volume.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.720
In other words, you could
almost fit all three spaceships

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.890
inside the payload bay of the Shuttle.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.090
So now, how long can these
vehicles stay in space?

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.490
The Starliner can go 60 hours on its own

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.870
and 210 days while docked,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.990
Crew Dragon can do one week on its own

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.350
and also 210 days when docked,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.240
the Soyuz can go 30 days on its own

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.210
and 180 days when docked,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.760
and the Space Shuttle couldn't
go much beyond 17 days

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.820
due to being powered by fuel cells.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.810
Next up, how about their abort systems?

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.100
The Starliner and Crew Dragon

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.990
both have a pusher-type
system that's full envelope,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.910
meaning they can abort safely
at any time during ascent,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.010
the Soyuz has a puller or tractor system

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.000
with an abort tower
and fairing motors too,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.320
which also offers a full
envelope escape, and of course,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.540
the Space Shuttle had no
mechanical abort systems.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.750
And a quick little note
here on abort systems,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.660
pushers push up from the bottom

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.170
or the middle of the spacecraft

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.430
and tractors or puller abort systems

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.210
pull from the top using a
tower or something like that.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.045
Now where do these all land?

00:22:10.045 --> 00:22:13.810
Starliner, Shuttle and
Soyuz all touchdown on land,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.930
while Crew Dragon splashes down.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.180
Now how about
reusability/refurbishment-ability?

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.620
The Starliner is capable
of up to 10 reuses,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.370
Crew Dragon is capable of reuse,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.520
but for now only as a cargo variant,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.450
Soyuz is expendable and the
Space Shuttle was also reusable.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.710
So now the launch vehicles

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.270
that gets these to space.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.320
Starliner will ride the Atlas V N22,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.810
Crew Dragon the Falcon 9,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.290
Soyuz the Soyuz FG rocket
and soon the Soyuz 2,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.110
and the Shuttle was part of the
space transportation system.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.390
While we have these rockets pulled up,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.540
I think it's important we take
a note on their reliability.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.050
We're gonna ignore partial failures

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.570
and only talk about mission success,

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.770
in which case the Atlas
V really comes up on top,

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.830
at 100% success in 79 flights.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:00.370
The Falcon 9 has had 69 missions
and has had two failures,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.960
one of them actually happening
before the launch occurred,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.100
giving it a 97.1% success rate.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.630
The Soyuz is complicated

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.950
because it's been flying since the 60s

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:14.517
in some form or another, so
in total it's 996 out of 1028

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.360
for a 96.9% success rate, but
its newest variant, the FG,

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.350
has only had one failure out of 66,

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.130
making it 98.5% successful.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.250
And the Shuttle had two
failures out of 135 launches,

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.820
also making it 98.5% successful.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.210
It should also be noted that
thanks to the abort system,

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:38.270
the one failure of the Soyuz
FG lead to no loss in life.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.220
And another quick note,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.000
this time about the use
of solid rocket boosters.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
The solid rocket booster

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.200
lead to the loss of
the Challenger vehicle,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.410
but that's not to say solids on their own

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.240
are inherently more dangerous per se.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.230
The mixture of a solid rocket booster

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.660
and the lack of a mechanical abort system,

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.340
is really what was dangerous.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.050
We've learned a lot
since the Space Shuttle,

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.890
and the Atlas V's use of
SRBs is considered very safe,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.723
and due to the fact

00:24:02.723 --> 00:24:05.330
that the Starliner does
have an abort system,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.950
if there was a failure,

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.950
the crew would be able to
get away from the rocket.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.600
So we really shouldn't compare
the Atlas's use of SRBs

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.700
to the Space Shuttle's use of SRBs.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.810
And now we're do all four
of these launch from?

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.410
Launch sites are SLC-41

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.700
at Cape Canaveral Air
Force Base for Starliner,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.640
right next door is the Falcon 9,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.940
which will launch from LC-39A
at Kennedy Space Center,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.080
the Soyuz launches from Baikonur LC-1/5,

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.080
and the Shuttle launched from
both LC-39A and LC-39B at KSC.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.560
And lastly we're gonna
talk about price per seat,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.250
and this one has a pretty
big asterisk as well.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.690
Both Starliner and Crew Dragon

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.880
have a price tag of $58 million per seat,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.380
the Soyuz Capsule is now
up to $82 million per seat,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.280
and the Shuttle, well, this is a hard one.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.760
On paper, the Shuttle would cost

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.200
around $214 million per seat,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.510
but don't forget the
Shuttle did a lot more

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.910
than just take crew up,

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.710
it often would carry an additional payload

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.130
of a dozen tonnes or more!

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.150
So maybe it's fair

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.670
to take that $214 million
dollars per seat per launch

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.960
and then take 80% off

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.270
because 80% of the volume of the vehicle

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.540
was dedicated to cargo.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.370
But maybe that's not fair either,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.560
so let's just say it's somewhere

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.990
between $43 million and $214 million.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.010
The last thing I want to mention,

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.050
but only for the
Starliner and Crew Dragon,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.130
is their cost of development.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.197
So the Starliner received $4.8 billion

00:25:29.197 --> 00:25:31.930
and SpaceX received 3.1 billion in total.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.630
But this includes two demo launches

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.220
and six operational
flights from each company.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.890
Now I really don't want to
get into a spitting match

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.990
over why each company got
paid such different amounts,

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.600
but it likely had to do with
each companies proposal.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.030
Perhaps after SpaceX flies
a few dozen astronauts,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.010
they can charge a little more

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.150
for increased confidence from NASA.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.110
Kind of like how they're
able to increase the price

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.810
of the cargo resupply missions

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.530
once they prove to be reliable,

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.130
and after they've gained a better sense

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.950
of the costs of running the program.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.360
So when it's all said and
done, here's my opinion.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.640
First off, I couldn't be more excited

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.020
to see an awesome pair of
exciting new rides to space.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.680
It's about time!

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.340
As solid and reliable
as the Soyuz has been,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.350
it's about time humans
have some other, newer,

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.080
and more comfortable options.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.620
As far as each system goes,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.940
I've got my opinions
and I'll keep 'em short,

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.080
because I already know the comment section

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.650
will have plenty of opinions to go around.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.290
The Starliner is an awesome spaceship.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.150
It's very well thought
out, and you can tell,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.500
human safety is very much on top of mind

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.420
for both Boeing and ULA.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.663
I'm glad to see their going
to be landing on land,

00:26:32.663 --> 00:26:33.960
because I think it's cool,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.560
and I'm glad to see they
can reuse the space craft.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.130
And I'm also happy the Atlas

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.640
will finally be carrying humans again

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.160
for the first time since Faith 7 launched

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.810
with Mercury-Atlas in 1963!

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.030
And as advanced as the Starliner is,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.140
I do wish Boeing had gone a
few steps more progressive.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.610
It feels like the spaceship
is just a little conservative,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.280
and you can tell they didn't
want to take any design risks

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.530
or really push any boundaries.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.990
And unfortunately, when I gotta sit in it,

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.630
it just feels a little stale and cold.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.770
However, aesthetics and ergonomics

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.750
are a very, very minor
part of the equation

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.110
when you're putting humans in space.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.103
So, now we come to SpaceX's
Crew Dragon Capsule.

00:27:12.103 --> 00:27:13.750
There's really no arguing

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.710
that SpaceX made the better looking

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.380
and down right sexy spaceship.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.340
It truly is stunning.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.840
And quite frankly, the radical
departure from the norm,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.490
really seems to have been
pulled off brilliantly.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.500
Just look at how easy it
is to get into this thing

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.878
compared to the Starliner.

00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:30.430
And I have no doubt
the Crew Dragon capsule

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.520
didn't cut any corners in safety,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.110
considering they had to answer to NASA

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.660
on every single millimeter of the thing,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.380
so when it comes to pure cool factor,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.130
I'm gonna have to give
the leg up to SpaceX.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.290
After hearing from a few people

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.960
who have used the touchscreens,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.080
we're talking about hardcore pilots here,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.450
they have voiced missing a more
traditional control scheme.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.750
Saying it does feel a
bit like flying an iPad.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.590
But lastly, seeing a Falcon 9 land

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.663
after delivering crew to the ISS,

00:27:55.663 --> 00:27:58.070
will be a nice cherry on top.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.660
And although of course it won't be landing

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.410
back at Kennedy Space Center,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.400
I never get tired of seeing this.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.190
So no matter how you cut
it, you can't go wrong.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.510
NASA hired two incredible companies

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.100
to come up with some truly
exciting new rides to space.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.180
NASA should be proud of this new program.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.570
It's saved them money, and now
offers a variety of options,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.270
so now they actually have
some overlap and redundancy

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.250
in humanities access to space.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.083
And although this video

00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:25.480
was intended to highlight
the Commercial Crew Program,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.630
to be perfectly honest,

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.530
I wound up really appreciating
the Space Shuttle more,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:30.890
after diving into this.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.260
That thing was something really special.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.480
I mean yes of course it had its flaws,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.230
and it didn't quite live up to the hype

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.030
of making space flight cheaper or safer,

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.800
but boy oh boy did it have
some unmatched capabilities.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.030
So great job NASA, Boeing and SpaceX!

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.730
I honestly couldn't be more excited

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.710
for this new chapter of spaceflight.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.330
And don't you all worry,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.380
I'll be doing my best to
bring it all to you guys!

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.740
I'm planning to try and make it down

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.360
to all the demo missions and
cover them live, in person!

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.470
If you want to help contribute

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.370

which I wrote the music to
the Falcon Heavy launch.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.070
That's right, when you watch that video,

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.940
you are watching the straight video

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.200
off of SpaceX's livestream.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.920
It has not been cut in any way.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.450
The music was written to all
of the events of the flight.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.340
So it's a fun new way to
experience the launch,

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.440
definitely check it out,
right here on YouTube.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.240
Thanks everybody, that's
gonna do it for me.

(energetic melodic music)
