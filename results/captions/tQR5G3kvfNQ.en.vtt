00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.437
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.808

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.509 size:78% position:39%
I HAVE BEEN FINE.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.612
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE AN
EXTRAORDINARY MAN.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:16.216 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'RE 93 YEARS OLD -- AM I
CORRECT AT 93?

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.183
&gt;&gt; GOING ON 94, YEAH.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GOING ON 94, OKAY.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.760
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU HAVE BEATEN CANCER AND YOU

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.230
ARE STILL -- YOU ARE STILL
WORKING TO MAKE THE WORLD A

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.100
BETTER PLACE THROUGH THE CARTER
CENTER AND THROUGH YOUR BOOKS.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'VE GOT A NEW ONE CALLED
"FAITH."

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.005 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; "FAITH."

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.543
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND A LOT OF
PEOPLE WILL RELEASE A BOOK AS A

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.380
TRIAL BALLOON BEFORE THEY RUN
FOR PRESIDENT.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.583
&gt;&gt; I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT, YEAH.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE ANY

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.488
CHANCE YOU'RE RUNNING IN 2020?

00:00:55.488 --> 00:01:01.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.264
WE COULD USE A NICE GUY IN THE
OVAL OFFICE.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.832
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:06.466
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE?

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.001
I THINK THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.205
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I KNOW IT'S 35 TO
GET IN, BUT I THINK YOU CAN GO

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.106 size:81% position:41%
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.575
&gt;&gt; I THINK 93'S THE AGE LIMIT.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.410 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, YOU ARE

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.713
KNOWN TO BE A NICE GUY, YOU'VE
CERTAINLY PROVEN IT.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:24.250
YOU WERE SORT OF THE FIRST
PRESIDENT OF THE 20th CENTURY

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.221
TO HAVE A CAREER AFTER THE WHITE
HOUSE WITH THE CARTER CENTER AND

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOUR WORK WITH HABITAT FOR
HUMANITY AND CERTAINLY

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.029
ERADICATING DISEASES AROUND THE
WORLD.

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.964 align:start size:88% position:13%
S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES --

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:45.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU WERE THE PRESIDENT AFTER

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:49.209
NIXON AND FORD AND AMERICA FELT
LIKE THEY WANTED A NICE GUY IN

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:57.383
NIXON SEEMED LIKE, PARDON THE
EXPRESSION, A SON OF A BITCH.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
WERE YOU TOO NICE TO BE

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRESIDENT?

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.423
PEOPLE CRITICIZED YOU FOR YOUR
DEMEANOR AND YOU MIGHT SAY THE

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.024
ENERGY BROUGHT TO THE JOB.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.760
DOES AMERICA WANT KIND OF A JERK
AS PRESIDENT?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.563
&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY FROM THE RECENT
ELECTION, YES.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.099
I NEVER KNEW IT BEFORE.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.567
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.103
IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT?

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.639
WHAT'S THE ONE -- THE ONE
QUALITY IT REQUIRES TO BE THE

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:19.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRESIDENT?

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:23.676 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I USED TO THINK IT WAS TO
TELL THE TRUTH.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.479
( LAUGHTER )
BUT I'VE CHANGED MY MIND LATELY.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:35.522
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT
YOU CRITICIZE -- YOU WERE

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.357
CRITICIZED FOR TELLING THE TRUTH
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:41.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I THINK I TOLD THE TRUTH
ALMOST ALL THE TIME.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.597
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN DID YOU NOT
TELL THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:44.998 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:48.334
&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER SAID I USED TO TELL
LITTLE WHITE LIES.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S WHAT HOPE
HICKS SAYS, TOO.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.372
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; ONE TIME SHE HAD AN INTERVIEW

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.643 align:end position:100%
AND A WOMAN CAME IN TO INTERVIEW
MOMMA, AND SHE SAID A LITTLE

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.844 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHITE LIES.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.280
SO JIMMY DOES TELL LITTLE WHITE
LIES.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT IS THAT?

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:06.152
SHE SAID WHEN YOU CAME IN THE
DOOR AND I SAID GLAD TO SEE YOU

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.154
AND YOU LOOK VERY NICE?

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:11.758
SO A LITTLE WHITE LIE EVERY NOW
AND THEN.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.160
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S THE LEVEL.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.765
AS AN EX-PRESIDENT, DO YOU SPEAK
TO THE OTHER EX-PRESIDENTS?

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:19.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.100 size:88% position:56%
I WILL BE WITH TWO TOMORROW.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.635 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO?

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.270 align:start size:88% position:13%
GEORGE W. BUSH AND BILL
CLINTON.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.907 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO ALL THE
EX-PRESIDENTS FEEL GOOD THAT

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:32.679
SINCE TRUMP IS IN OFFICE ALL OF
YOU HAVE GONE UP THE RANKS?

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.281
YOU'VE ALL JUST BEEN PUSHED UP
ONE LEVEL THERE?

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.083
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST
OF THEM.

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.751
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT YOU FEEL GOOD

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.522 align:start size:88% position:13%
ABOUT IT?

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
YOU PRAY A LOT.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.493
DO YOU PRAY FOR DONALD TRUMP?

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.697
&gt;&gt; I PRAY HE WILL BE A GOOD
PRESIDENT, KEEP OUR COUNTRY AT

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:55.034
PEACE, THAT HE WILL REFRAIN FROM
USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THAT

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.769
HE WILL PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.841
SO, YEAH, I PRAY FOR HIM.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.576
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.245
PRAYERS, FIRST OF ALL.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.080
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRAYERS.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.349 size:75% position:38%
WE DO NEED THEM.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.754
BUT DO YOU THINK YOUR PRAYERS
ARE BEING ANSWERED SO FAR?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:19.092
&gt;&gt; WELL, I USED TO HAVE A PASTOR
WHO WOULD SAY, WHEN YOU PRAY,

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.763
GOD HAS THREE ANSWERS -- ONE IS
YES, THE OTHER ONE IS NO, AND

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.466
THE THIRD ONE IS YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.369
( LAUGHTER )
SO I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT IS

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.536 align:start size:88% position:13%
YET.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.171 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DONALD TRUMP'S

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.308
GOTTEN IN SOME TROUBLE FOR SOME
OF THE ROUGH LANGUAGE THAT HE'S

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.812
USED AND PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED
HIM FOR THAT AND I'VE CERTAINLY

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.381
MADE SOME JOKES ABOUT IT.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.782
&gt;&gt; I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.950 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU GOT IN A

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.887
LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE BACK IN
1980 IN THAT CAMPAIGN WHEN IT

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:51.124
LOOKED LIKE TED KENNEDY MIGHT
RUN, YOU FAMOUSLY SAID TO A

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:55.295
REPORTER, I WILL KICK HIS ASS.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND AT THE TIME, THAT WAS
UNIMAGINABLE.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:58.131 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; FOR ME, YES.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.034
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT A PRESIDENT,
FOR ANY PRESIDENT, THAT HE WOULD

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.402
SAY THAT TO A REPORTER.

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.237 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SAY THAT TO A
REPORTER.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:07.140
I SAID IT TO A CONGRESSMAN AND
HE REPORTED IT TO A REPORTER.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.776 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO HE THREW YOU
UNDER THE BUS.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:10.543 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; HE DID, YEAH.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.045 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO WAS THE
CONGRESSMAN?

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.080
&gt;&gt; I WON'T SAY HIS NAME.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.814
HE'S OUT OF OFFICE NOW.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.715 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.183 size:78% position:39%
BUT STILL LIVING?

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.719
&gt;&gt; YES, HE'S STILL LIVING.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.788
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'LL FIND HIM.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:31.197
&gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS TRUE, AND I DID.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:38.271 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT AS

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.006
NICE AS PEOPLE THINK!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.843
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; MY WIFE CAN TELL YOU THAT.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:47.146
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN
CRITICAL OF SANCTIONS AGAINST

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:47.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
NORTH KOREA.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:47.814 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHY IS THAT?

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:51.050
WHY IS THE ISOLATION YOU THINK A
WRONG THING TO DO?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.588
&gt;&gt; WELL, BECAUSE WHEN WE IMPOSED
SANCTIONS FOR 70 YEARS AGAINST

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:59.659
NORTH KOREA AND ABOUT THAT LONG
AGAINST CUBA, WE GET BLAMED FOR

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.262
ALL THE THINGS THAT GO WRONG IN
THE COUNTRY AND IT EXALTS THE

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:03.696 align:start size:88% position:13%
DICTATORS.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.632 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE DICTATORS ARE ALREADY
PUNISHING PEOPLE.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:10.436
THEY'RE ALREADY UNDER DURESS AND
PUNISHMENT, NOT ENOUGH FOOD AND

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:14.640
FREEDOM AND THAT SORT OF THING,
AND WHEN WE PUT SOME ADDITIONAL

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.746 size:88% position:56%
STRESS ON THEM, LIKE NOT ANY
FOOD AID AND DESTROY THEIR

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:22.749
ECONOMY, IT HURTS THE AVERAGE
PERSON WHO IS ALREADY SUFFERING

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.053
UNDER THE DICTATOR AND THE
DICTATORS CONTROL THE NEWS MEDIA

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.690
COMPLETELY SO THEY BLAME ALL THE
PROBLEMS THAT THEY IMPOSE ON THE

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.360
PEOPLE OPEN US, SO WE GET BLAMED
IN CUBA AND NORTH KOREA FOR

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.662
EVERYTHING BAD THAT GOES ON IN
THE COUNTRY.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:38.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT EXALTS THE DICTATORS AND
HURTS THE PEOPLE.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:42.301
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE YOU AGAINST
SANCTIONS FOR ALL COUNTRIES LIKE

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:44.370 size:84% position:42%
IRAN, CUBA, RUSSIA?

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.939
&gt;&gt; I'M AGAINST ANY KIND OF
SANCTIONS THAT HURT THE PEOPLE

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.710 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHO ALREADY SUFFER UNDER A
DICTATOR, YES.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:03.489
WELL, THE BOOK IS CALLED "FAITH:
A JOURNEY FOR ALL."

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:07.126 align:start size:88% position:13%
I OFTEN WONDER WHAT THE MOST
IMPORTANT OF THE CARDINAL

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:07.727 align:start size:88% position:13%
VIRTUES IS.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:13.866 size:88% position:56%
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THEM ARE
ACHIEVABLE -- FAITH, HOPE OR

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.234
LOVE -- WITHOUT COURAGE?

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.637
DO YOU THINK COURAGE IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT?

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.072
IT SEEMS ALL TAKES COURAGE TO
ACHIEVE.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:22.141
&gt;&gt; I THINK LOVE TAKES MORE
COURAGE PERHAPS THAN FAITH

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.444
BECAUSE WE CAN'T AVOID HAVING
FAITH.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.381
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE ARE BABIES ALL
OF US HAVE FAITH IN OUR MOTHERS,

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.618
WE'LL SAY, AND WE HAVE SOME
DEGREE OF FAITH IN OURSELVES,

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.152 align:start size:88% position:13%
RIGHT?

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:37.690
AND WE HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR
CLOSE FRIENDS OR THINGS THAT WE

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.662
CHERISH, LIKE THE TRUTH OR FAITH
IN EDUCATION OR FAITH IN AMERICA

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:49.068
OR FAITH IN WHATEVER COUNTRY WE
LIVE IN, FAITH IN FREEDOM.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:52.738
SO WE HAVE FAITH MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS THAT WE CAN'T AVOID, BUT

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:56.709
IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY COURAGE TO
HAVE THOSE KINDS OF FAITH, BUT

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.446
IT TAKES COURAGE TO HAVE LOVE
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:09.021 align:end position:100%
FROM YOU AND IT TAKES COURAGE TO
HAVE FAITH IN PEOPLE THAT WE

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:12.625
CONSIDER TO BE INFERIOR TO US OR
ENEMIES OF OURS.
