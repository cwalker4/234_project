00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.269
The President: Okay,
thank you very much.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.639
For almost six decades,
NASA's work has inspired

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.410
millions and millions
of Americans to imagine

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.913
distant worlds and a
better future,

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.815
right here on Earth.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.584
I am delighted to sign
this bill - it's been

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.553
a long time since a bill
like this has been signed,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.689
reaffirming our national
commitment to the core

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.291
mission of NASA.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:31.097
Human space exploration,
space science, and technology.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:35.402
With this legislation, we
support NASA's scientists,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:40.640
engineers, astronauts,
and their pursuit of discovery.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.578
We support jobs, it's
about jobs also.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.748
This bill calls for
ongoing medical monitoring

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.284
and treatment of our
heroic astronauts for

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:55.922
health conditions that
result from their service.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:58.758
It's a pretty tough job, I
don't know Ted, would you

00:00:58.758 --> 00:00:59.692
like to do it?

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.927
I don't think I would.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:02.395
Mark, do you
want to do it?

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.997
(laughter)

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.532
I'm not sure we
want to do it.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.233
Senator Cruz: You could
send Congress to space.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.601
(laughter)

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.636
The President:
What a great idea.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:10.470
That could be a mission.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.071
(laughter)

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.240
This bill will make sure
that NASA's most important

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.310
and effective programs
are sustained.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.081
It orders NASA to
continue, and it does --

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.818
it orders just that, to
continue transitioning

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:30.356
activities to the commercial sector where we have seen

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.357
great progress.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.692
It's amazing
what's going on.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.161
So many people in so many
companies are so

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.730
into exactly what
NASA stands for.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.366
So, the commercial and the
private sector will get

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.101
to use these facilities.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.171
And I hope they're going
to be paying us a lot of money.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.573
That they're going to
make great progress.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.641
It continues support
for the commercial crew

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.478
program, which will carry
American astronauts

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:55.248
into space from American
soil once again.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.816
Been a long time.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.453
It supports NASA's deep
space exploration,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:04.724
including the space launch system and the Orient

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.759
space craft.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.097
It advances space science
by maintaining a balanced

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.534
set of missions and
activities to explore

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:18.638
our solar system and the
entire universe.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.574
And it ensures that
through NASA's astronauts

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.777
and aeronautics research,
the United States will

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:29.782
remain a total
leader in aviation.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.653
Now, these astronauts
are amazing.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.423
I've met some of them,
they are very brave people

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.125
and they're right
at the forefront.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.429
So, we salute them
with this legislation.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.299
And we salute the ones
that have lost their lives

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.334
doing what they
love to do.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.670
America's space program
has been a blessing to our

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.640
people and to
the entire world.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.409
Almost half a century ago,
our brave astronauts first

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.113
planted the American
flag on the moon.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.482
That was a big moment
in our history.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:07.687
Now, this nation is ready to be the first in space once again.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.023
Today, we're taking the
initial steps toward

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:14.794
a bold and bright new future
for American space flight.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.996
I am honored to
sign this new bill.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:20.199
The folks behind me have
been so involved in it.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.871
They love NASA, they love
everything it stands for,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.007
and they love the
people in their areas.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.344
You have a couple of areas that are going to be very benefit --

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.379
very much benefitted by this.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.884
So, I just want to thank all of the people standing behind me.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.319
They've done a great
service for the country

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.753
and to their communities.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.790
It's a lot of jobs, and
these are great jobs.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:59.005
So, thank you very much
and we'll sign this.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.441
Okay, so, we'll
hold that up.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.142
Lot of pages, look at
the pages in there.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.377
That's a lot.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.545
(laughter)

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:12.018
We don't want to
let that slip.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:23.529
(applause)

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.333
Who else should get these,
Mr. Vice President?

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.701
Okay, I have two left.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.670
Who else?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.675
Bill?

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:36.709
Male Speaker: Mr.
President, on behalf

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.645
of NASA, I'd like to
present you with this vest --

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.846
astronaut flight jacket.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.948
Thank you very much
for your support.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:49.255
(applause)

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.323
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.891
Does anybody have
anything to say?

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.426
Ted, do you want
to say something?

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.661
Senator Cruz: Well,
this is terrific.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.596
The first time in seven
years we've had a NASA

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.764
authorization bill.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.232
Thank you, Mr. President,
for signing it.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.802
This means a great deal to the nation's space exploration.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.771
It means a great deal to
the state of Texas,

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.906
and it continues America's
leadership in space.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.241
So, thank you for
your leadership.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.275
The President:
Thank you, Ted.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.443
Marco?

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:11.844
Senator Rubio: I just
think I'm happy to see

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:13.479
that Florida is going to
continue to do more than

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.014
Texas is in NASA.

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.849
(laughter)

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.485
The President Going to be
a good competition right, Kevin?

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.953
Mr. Vice President?

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:21.921
The Vice President:
Senator Nelson perhaps,

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:22.989
Mr. President?

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.090
The President:
Okay, Senator?

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.658
Oh, he's a Democrat, I
wasn't going to let him speak.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:30.096
(laughter)

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.198
He does love NASA.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.767
Senator Nelson: It puts
us on the dual track.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.936
We have to commercial
companies going to

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:40.473
and from the international
space station, and we have

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:43.476
NASA going out and
exploring the heavens.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.145
And we're going to Mars.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.448
The President:
Good, I love that.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.882
Representative Culberson: Just as a -- Mr. President, if I may.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.784
Just as Americans remember
that President Eisenhower

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.820
was the father of the
Interstate highway system,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.521
with your bill signing
today and your vision

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.690
and leadership, future
generations will remember

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.258
that President Donald
Trump was the father

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.394
of the interplanetary
highway system.

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:02.862
The President: Well,
that sounds exciting.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.130
(laughter)

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.598
First, we want to
fix our highways.

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.033
We're going to
fix our highways.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.735
(applause)

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.836
We're going to
fix our highways.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:10.703
Representative Babin:
Mr. President?

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.704
The President: Yes?

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.272
Representative Babin: As
the House Subcommittee Chair,

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.174
I'd like to --
and actually part of the

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:18.578
author of TREAT Act for
our astronauts, that

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:21.881
started in a meeting with
Astronaut Scott Kelly

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.784
after he got back from
nearly a year in space.

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.219
And I said, "What can we do for

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.954
you in the House of Representatives?"

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:30.656
He said, "Take care of us,
make sure we're hanging

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.392
on to this data so that
future astronauts will be

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:36.229
treated right and will
know what to do and make

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.898
the proper adjustments for
folks when they're up

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.868
in -- up there in the
ISS and beyond.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:44.137
So, I want to thank
everybody here, thank

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:48.441
these astronauts who've
put their lives on the line.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.876
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.077
Thank you, everybody.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.347
Mike, go ahead.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.581
The Vice President:
Excuse me, for a moment.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:59.085
I just want to, on behalf
of the President and all

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.820
of us, I want to thank
all of these members

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.755
of Congress, these courageous astronauts for their work

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:03.856
on this.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.025
But to assure you that in
very short order that

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.960
the President will be taking
action to relaunch the

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.129
National Space Council,
and he's asked me to share

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.265
that as Vice Presidents
have in the past.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.267
And we're going to be
bringing together the best

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:18.538
and the brightest in NASA
and also in the private sector.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.107
We have elected a builder
for President, and as he

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.242
said, America once again
is to start building

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.710
and leading to the stars.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.579
So, thank you,
Mr. President.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.181
The President: Thank
you, everybody.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.083
(applause)
