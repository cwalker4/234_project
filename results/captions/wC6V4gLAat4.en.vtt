00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.859

DIFFERENT.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.894 align:start size:88% position:13%

CRYSTALS.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.330
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DRUG.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.868
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE, "YOU
WANT THE FLAIMP CRYSTALS, MAN?"

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.301 size:88% position:44%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.571

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.540
AFTER SIX YEARS LIVING IN THE
UNITED STATES, RIGHT?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.776
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW, YEAH, RIGHT.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.111 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SIX YEARS LIVING
IN THE UNITED STATES, THREE

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.680 align:end position:100%
YEARS-- TWO YEARS-- HOW MANY
YEARS HOSTING "THE DAILY SHOW"?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.118

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.557
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO HOW DO YOU--
DOWNED AMERICA BETTER NOW?

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:01.494
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 54
YEARS AND I FEEL LIKE I'M

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.929
UNDERSTANDING IT A LITTLE LESS
EVERY DAY.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.965
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZE IS I
REALIZE NOT UNDERSTANDING

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.068
AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS
UNDERSTANDING AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.469
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.236
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, CONFUSION.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.107
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS THE SIEWB
DURKS JOUR.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.610
&gt;&gt; YOU BASICALLY GO, "I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ALL OF IT," WHICH IS

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.046
THE RIGHT WAY OF SEEING IT RIGHT
NOW.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.349 align:end position:100%
THE CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE ARE
HAVING, THE ARGUMENTS PEOPLE ARE

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.451 size:78% position:39%
HAVING RIGHT NOW.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.653 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE ARE ARGUING OVER KIDS
BEING SEPARATED.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.189 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU WOULD THINK, THE KID, WE
DON'T SEPARATE.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.157
BUT THIS IS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.793
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ONLY ABOUT 70% OF
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:33.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
IDEA.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:34.427 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:38.698
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE WERE 30%
THAT WERE LIKE, "LOCK THEM UP

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:38.932 align:start size:88% position:13%
BETTER.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:39.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
OF THE.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:39.466 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; SMALLER.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.700 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: KIDS WITH SMALL.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.036
THEY CAN GET RIGHT THROUGH THE
CHAIN.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.938
&gt;&gt; SO I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND
IT MORE.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:45.839 size:78% position:39%
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.809
LIKE I SAY, WHEN YOU COME FROM
AN AFRICAN NATION, IF YOU COME

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.213
FROM, YOU KNOW, A DEVELOPING
NATION, LEADERS LIKE TRUMP ARE

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
TOO FAMILIAR.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.520
SO YOU GO LIKE, "YEAH, IT'S THAT
WITH THE VERNEAR OF THE WHITE

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
HOUSE."

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"TOO FAMILIAR?"

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.993
&gt;&gt;UN, THE POLICY, EXTREME
RHETORIC, NOT HAVING A FIRM

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:07.894 size:78% position:39%
GRASP OF ENGLISH.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.797
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE
FAMILIAR WITH SO, YOU KNOW,...

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.466
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT THE TRAPPINGS
OF OFFICE KIND OF FOOL US A

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
LITTLE BIT.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:20.840
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT-- LIKE,
APARTHEID WAS ONE OF THE MOST

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.274 size:84% position:42%
REPRESSIVE REGIMES.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:21.708 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.877 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OF THE 20th
CENTURY.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.945
WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON KIDS IN
CAGES?

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:29.048
WAS THAT THE SORT OF THING-- WAS
THAT DONE?

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.117
WERE PEOPLE SEPARATED--
&gt;&gt; KIDS WERE SEPARATED.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:35.121
BUT THE KIDS IN CAGES THING IS A
COMPLETELY NEW IDEA FOR MYSELF

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.357
AS WELL, AS A HUMAN BEING.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:41.094 align:end position:100%
MY MOM ACTUALLY SAID TO ME WITH
THE KIDS IN THE CAGES IN THE

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:41.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
STORIES.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.664
MY MOM WAS LIKE, "SEE, THAT'S
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:44.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU."

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?"

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.172
MY PARENTS REMIND ME, MY MOM AND
GRANDMOTHER, BECAUSE PEOPLE OF

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.208 align:start size:88% position:13%
RACES WEREN'T ALLOWED TO BE
MIXED.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.211
MY MOTHER IS A BLACK WOMAN, MY
FATHER WAS WHITE.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.280
IF WE WERE CAUGHT TOGETHER, I
WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
MY MOM.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.715
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GROWING UP.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:06.986 align:end position:100%
WHEN THAT STORY CAME OUT SHE
SAID, "SEE, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:07.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.521
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU."

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.457
LIKE "WHY YARE YOU TELLING ME
NOW."

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.059
IT'S LIKE THREATENING POST.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.894
I'M JUST SAYING THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN YOU.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.030 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE LOGIC OF TAKING YOU

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.164
AWAY FROM YOUR PARENTS?

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.833
EVEN THE REPRESSIVE REGIMES SAY
THIS IS THE REASON WE'RE DOING

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.704
&gt;&gt; THE LOGIC IS IF YOU BUILD THE
COUNTRY AROUND THE NOTION THAT

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.775 align:end position:100%
PEOPLE OF COLOR CANNOT MIX, WHEN
THEY MAKE A MIXED THING THAT

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.245 align:end position:100%
DISPROVES YOUR POINT SO YOU NEED
REMOVE THE THING THAT PROVES

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.782
YOUR POINT SO THEY CAN CARRY ON
LIVING IN THEIR FICTITIOUS

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:35.982 align:start size:88% position:13%
WORLD.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.551
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT SEEMS REMOVING
YOU FROM YOUR PARENTS WOULD NOT

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
BE ENOUGH.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.021
THEY WOULD JUST NEED TO REMOVE
FRUPUBLIC VIEW.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.191
&gt;&gt; THEY WOULD TAKE YOU AND GIVE
YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:45.358 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.694
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT THE
PRODUCT OF A MIXED MARRIAGE.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:51.231
&gt;&gt; THEY GIVE YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO
LOOKS LIKE YOU.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT WORKS.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.567
IF YOU'RE CRAZY, IT WORKS.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT REALLY DOES.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.404
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO TO
KEEP YOUR SOUL FROM GETTING A

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.339 size:88% position:44%
THICK CALLOUS ON IT?

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.106 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.642
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE EVERY DAY
ONE OF THE THINGS IS-- ONE OF

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:06.312
THE GREAT-- ONE OF THE SORT OF
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT REALLY THE

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:10.083
PRIVILEGE OF A JOB LIKE THIS--
OR LIKE WHAT YOU DO-- IS EVERY

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.720
NIGHT-- EVERYONE HAS A REACTION
TO THE NEWS OR WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.222
WHAT THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION
IS.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:18.625 align:end position:100%
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK
ABOUT TGET YOUR FEELINGS OUT

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
ABOUT IT.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.928
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE FEELINGS ABOUT
THIS.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.463 align:end position:100%
CERTAINLY, THIS WEEK, IT WAS
DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE--

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:23.963 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.599
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TO PROPERLY
COMPRESS THEIR FEELINGS BECAUSE

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.567
THE FIRST FEELING IS GRIEF.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.134 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.169
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OFTEN FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDING IT

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.006
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.541
THAT YOU KNOW WOULD BE IN FAVOR
OF SOMETHING YOU FIND SO

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:35.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
HIDEOUS.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.976
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:41.347
I THINK WHAT I TRY AND DO IS I
SPEND MOST OF MY DAY SCREAMING,

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:45.118
AND THEN OVER TIME, I GET TIRED,
AND THEN WHEN I'M TIRED I START

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.819

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.491 align:end position:100%

AND THEN WE STOP.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.742
AND THEN WE'RE LOOK HOW DO WE
MAKE THE AUDIENCE NOT HAVE THE

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:10.376 size:88% position:44%
FEELING WE JUST HAD.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.613
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU TAKE THAT AND
TURN IT INTO A JOKE.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.347 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.450
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT
COMEDYSITIS WAY FOR US TO NUMB

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.219
THE PAIN, TO PROCESS WHAT WE'RE
GOING THROUGH WITHOUT FEELING

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.954
EVERY SINGLE, YOU KNOW, INKLING
OF IT.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.424
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HAVE ANOTHER WAY
TO NUMB THE PAIN.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
I HAVE THIS DRINKING GAME I
PLAY, OKAY.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.261
WHEN I WATCH THE NEWS I HAVE A
DRINKING GAME.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.429
I TURN ON THE NEWS AND I DRINK.

COVER A MAYOR IN MONTANA WHO IS
A REFUGEE AND LIVED IN AMERICA

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:03.196

AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE, "HOW DO
YOU DO IT?"

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:09.969
AND WE REALIZED IN MONTANA THE
MAYORAL RACE ISN'T RUN ALONG

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.972 align:start size:88% position:13%
PARTY LINES SO PEOPLE JUST
CAMPAIGN ON IDEAS.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:16.843
WHAT YOU REMOVE THE BLUE AND
RED, YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHO

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE CHOOSE.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:20.680
WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE ELECTION
PEOPLE SAY, "I DON'T LIKE

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
DONALD, BUT THAT'S MY ONLY
CHOICE.

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.752
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?"
IT'S WEIRD TO ME THAT AMERICA IS

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:29.889
A COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE 16
CEREALS AND TWO POLITICAL

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.957 align:start size:88% position:13%
PARTIES.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:32.358
YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE PARTIES.

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.726
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S LIKE CHOOSING
TEAMS.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.927
&gt;&gt; IT'S COMPLETELY TEAMS.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.296 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND PEOPLE VOTE
AGAINST THEIR SELF-INTEREST.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.065
&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:43.503
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WERE ALSO
INVOLVED IN A LOW LEVEL IN

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:48.474
AFRICAN POLITICS RECENTLY
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN "BLACK

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:48.741 align:start size:88% position:13%
PANTHER."

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.576 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; I WAS INVOLVED IN A HIGH
LEVEL, I THINK --

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:51.511 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.446
&gt;&gt; Stephen: PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
THIS AT FIRST.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:58.151
THERE WAS AN UNCRED TED
APPEARANCE IN "BLACK PANTHER."

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:03.389
&gt;&gt; I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG ABOUT
THIS, BUT I WAS IN "BLACK

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.625
PANTHER," THE SMASH HIT --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE NUMBER ONE

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:05.825 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:11.998
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS, RYAN
CRIEWGLER APPROACHED ME AND SAID

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.966
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THE SAROF
THE MOVIE.

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:19.405 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND I SAID, "NO, I HAVE THE
DAILY SHOW.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:23.009
AND HE SAID DO YOU WANT TO DO
WHAT MICHAEL JORDAN DOES.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.946
AND HE GOES I'LL BE THE VOICE OF
THE COMPUTER IN THE BACKGROUND--

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.681
EVERYONE SPACESHIP YOU SEE IS

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE DON'T NOTICE --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
TRUE.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.154
IT WAS A WHILE BEFORE THE MOVIE
WAS OUT BEFORE PEOPLE WENT,

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:36.289
"THAT WAS TREVOR NOAH."

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.826
I FOUND THIS OUT TODAY-- I'VE
SEEN THE MOVIE TWICE-- PLAY

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:43.162
THIS, WE'LL SEE THE CLIP, AND
YOU'LL HEAR HIS VOICE.

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.130
&gt;&gt; WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "WHAT
DOES HE MEAN?"

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.019
