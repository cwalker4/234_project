00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.340
and...

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.200
Alexa, what’s the weather today?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.980
with clear skies and sun.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.720
Today’s forecast has partly sunny weather
with a high of 77°F and a low of 61°F.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.700
UHHHH…

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.420
I still don’t understand the use of Fahrenheit.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.780
Virtually every country on earth uses Celsius
to measure temperature.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.910
But the US still uses Fahrenheit.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.800
And for that reason, we —at Vox— often
get comments like these.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.680
*Okay, we get it.*

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.580
Besides the fact that the majority of the world uses it—

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.760
the metric system makes conversions
a lot easier.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.310
The Celsius scale even looks simpler.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.840
It has freezing and boiling points at nice,
round numbers— zero and 100.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.380
Where in Fahrenheit, it’s a bit of a mess.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.840
And of course, this isn’t just an issue of aesthetics
or weather updates.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.700
America’s unwillingness to switch over to
the metric system has had serious consequences.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.940
In 1999, a 125 million dollar satellite sent
to Mars, disappeared in the Martian atmosphere.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.080
It’s a setback to years of work already
done in the vastness of space— all it takes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.820
is one navigation error.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.940
And this colossal mistake was largely due to a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.000
conversion error between US and metric measurements.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.540
Fahrenheit was really useful n the early 18th
century.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.080
At the time, no one really had a consistent
way to measure temperature.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.000
But then a German scientist, came up with
the Fahrenheit scale when he invented the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.299
mercury thermometer in 1714.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.220
To make the scale, the most popular theory
is that he picked the temperature of an ice/water/salt

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.210
mixture at the zero mark.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.880
He then put the freezing point of water, which
is higher than a salt mixture, at 32.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.420
And placed the average temperature of the
human body at 96.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.400
From there, he placed the boiling point of
water at 212 degrees.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.700
In 1724, Fahrenheit formalized that scale
and was inducted into the British Royal Society,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.940
where his system was a big hit.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.620
As Britain conquered huge parts of the globe
in the 18th and 19th centuries, it brought

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.120
the Fahrenheit system and other Imperial measurements,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.680
such as feet and ounces along with them.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.620
And Fahrenheit became a standard system for
the British Empire across the globe.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.200
In the meantime, the metric system was gaining
popularity during the French Revolution.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.340
It was put in place to unify the country at
the national level.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.060
So by the second half of the 20th century,
Celsius became popular in many parts of the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.560
world, when many English-speaking countries
began using the metric system.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.520
Even America attempted to switch over.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
The change would have been good for trade
and scientific communications with the rest

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.180
of the world.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.140
So, Congress passed a law, the 1975 Metric
Conversion Act—

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.960
Which led to the United States Metric Board
that would educate people about the system.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.280
This created the only metric highway sign
in the US— the Interstate 19 connecting

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.740
Arizona to Mexico.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.860
But it didn’t go much further than that.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.700
The problem was that unlike the UK, Canada
or Australia, the law made the switch voluntary

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.319
instead of mandatory.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.020
And of course people resisted the change,
and the Metric Board couldn't enforce the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.900
conversion.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.760
So, President Reagan ended up disbanding the
board in 1982.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.050
The next nudge to metricate came when the
metric system became the preferred measure

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.110
for American trade and commerce in 1988.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.000
But nothing really stuck with the general
public...

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.260
...Even though bizarre measurements like Feet
and Fahrenheit are not doing them any favors.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.880
Students have to train for two sets of measurements,
making science education even more difficult.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.340
And companies spend extra dollars producing two sets of products,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.040
one for the US and the other for metric.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.159
There’s also an argument for public health.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.820
According to the CDC, about 3 to 4000 kids
are brought to the ER due to unintentional

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.060
medication overdose, every year.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.160
And conversion errors for dosage are to blame.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.860
So it seems like a no brainer— America needs
to switch to the metric system to match the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.250
rest of the world.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.640
But it is still struggling to make that change.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.599
That’s because it’ll take a lot of time
and money but there’s no financial proof

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.780
that this will all be worth it.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.780
So unless that change is proven to be economically
better…

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.280
We’re not going to be using celsius anytime
soon.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.500
What’s 77°F in Celsius?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.180
77°F is 25°C.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.200
Ah!

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.500
Okay.
