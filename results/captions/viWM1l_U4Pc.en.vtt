00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:03.574
(bouncing, thumping beat)

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.280
- Hi, I'm Davin Reckow with Hagerty,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.710
and I'm the dirty hands
behind these videos.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.280
This is my cohort Ben,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.660
with the clean hands behind the camera.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.200
Today, we're gonna go through

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.510
our Volkswagen rebuild video,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.550
and we're also very glad to
see that you liked it sofar,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.360
but here are some of
the inside track on it.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.150
- [Ben] We're happy
that you guys got a kick

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.600
out of our little joke.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.951
Yes, we do know that the
engine is in the back.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.620
(Davin laughs)

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.795
- [Davin] But how do you
not start it off with that?

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:39.694
- [Ben] Exactly.

00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:43.170
- [Davin] Yes, to address some
of the questions and concerns

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.570
about this Beetle, it
is a kludge of parts,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.807
that's for sure, relative
to the year that it is

00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:54.060
and different taillights,
and bumpers, etc.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
That doesn't take away the
fun of driving this Beetle,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.400
and the enjoyment that
we both actually share.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.660
- [Ben] We did run the VIN
finally, which I don't know

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.090
why we didn't do it before.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.530
It is a '73, so thanks
to all the commenter,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.630
for pointing that out.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.640
What are we looking at here?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.210
- [Davin] Here's the underneath,
getting the engine out.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.450
I found that a tyranny jack

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.500
worked phenomenal for doing this

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.510
because of the square pan at the bottom.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.410
You can see, it has decades
of leaks that have accumulated

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.273
on both the transaxle, and
the bottom of the engine,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.130
but preserving it from
rusting, so that's good,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.890
with the exception of surface
rust on the suspension.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.570
- [Ben] We had lots of people commenting

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.330
that we were cheating
by doing it this way,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.970
that we should have had it up on blocks,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.943
and dragging it out with the dolly.

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:47.070
- [Davin] I've bench pressed
plenty of transmissions,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.060
and I tell you what, if you
have access to the tools,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.593
I don't find that cheating.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.263
But hey, to each their own.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.990
- So, we'll get this guy out of here,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.410
and on we go to the rebuild.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.040
The general thing with these engines,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.347
is everybody says, "Oh,
it's easy to drop 'em out.

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:08.217
"They're easy to rebuild.

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.400
"They're so simple, air cooled,"

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.300
that sort of thing.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.271
What, I meant there's
four bolts to undo there?

00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:17.104
- [Davin] Yeah, there's
four bolts to hold it in,

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.683
and then a splash pan is
all that's really there.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.060
I think we had roughly
an hour, hour and a half,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.920
in doing it, and that's
moving around for filming.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.470
So can you have it out
in 15, or a half hour?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.720
Absolutely.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.553
If you've done it before.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.500
This is the first time I ever done it,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.543
so at an hour and half, I'm fine with it.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.730
- [Ben] What are you
taking off here first?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.480
- [Davin] So, the first
thing I was getting out,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270
I had left the exhaust on it.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.360
Actually taking it out in the car

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.020
would have been a pain my mind,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.420
so I left the exhaust on it.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.350
The heat exchanger is the big piece

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.010
that goes up underneath the valve.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.443
The valve cover right
there with the little loop.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.320
That is how you get heat
to the front of the car.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.580
It basically runs the
exhaust fan or a blower fan

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.010
that blows through the tubes,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.890
and then up into the
rocker panels of the car.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.900
- [Ben] Off go the heat exchangers,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.040
and this thing had all sorts of shrouding.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.170
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.070
In fact, it's interesting
because as your pulling it apart,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.220
you're thinking, wow
this thing is air cooled.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.040
Well hell, air can't
even to the cylinders,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.440
because of all the shrouding.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.620
But the shrouding is there

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.373
for the routing off of that
fan blower going around.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.700
That washer.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.820
Look, that washer's right there Ben.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.383
I'm not sure why we couldn't find it

00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:35.480
when we couldn't put it
back together, but hey.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.480
- They even had to manufacture
that little cone washer

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.860
to put our pulley back on,
because it got lost in the--

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.890
- [Davin] It got eaten
somewhere in the shop.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.570
- [Ben] Lost the mix somewhere

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.260
So, Davin, you were taking
the carburetor off here,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.790
but there was a funny issue
that the carburetor had

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.100
in regards to the throttle linkage.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.820
- Yeah, the way everything was set up,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.360
it was only getting quarter throttle.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.810
- Anyway, we shot a little clip,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.940
while we were taking
this apart to show you.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.310
So, here that is.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.960
- So basically, I think we
can double the horsepower

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.130
by simply allowing the
carburetor to open all the way.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.010
So, it's going about here on the pedal,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.213
but that's why it opens.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.800
You can see that the
angle that this is all at,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.543
won't allow it to go
to wide open throttle.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.210
Well first off, this is on the wrong side.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.750
It should be over here, I'm gonna say,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.710
based on where it comes out
through the fan side of things.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.223
Put the spring on this side,

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:43.620
but it almost needs a extension on here,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.820
to where it's out this way,
so it's a straight pull.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.320
That would allow it to
go to wide open throttle.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.000
Right now it won't.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.542
- [Ben] All right, so
carburetor comes off,

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.460
plug up more bits.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.082
- [Davin] The coils out.

00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:56.810
Just kinda stripping things
down to get to the brass tax

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.680
of the engine.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.750
- [Ben] So this is all interesting,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.504
just in terms of how it was
all kind of woven together,

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.540
which thing to take off first.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.970
- [Davin] Yeah, there
definitely is a sequence

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.370
to put things back together.

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.200
So you have to pull the
one side intake runner

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.530
to get the main intake
out, but, of course,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.393
you almost have to pull
the generator off as well.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.379
Yeah, it's wound together,

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.430
and, of course, that intake
system, it's functional,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.650
but it's not all the
efficient, I wouldn't believe.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.750
- [Ben] Which is why a lot of people

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.720
who hop up these things
do the dual webers.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.680
- The dual webers, yep.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.890
Now we're pulling off that upper shrouding

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.370
on top of the cylinder head.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.913
Pulling the pulley off,
the main crank pulley.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.510
- As you went here, like you said earlier,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.740
this was your firs time too.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.650
We kind of in this disassembly, it's like,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.300
while we're working over here,
that's not gonna come off,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.700
we gotta do this on first.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.533
- [Davin] Exactly right.

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.070
Yeah, there was a couple spots

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.120
where you had to remove a
bolt to get to one shroud,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.060
but then you couldn't
get to the second one.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.150
- [Ben] Then speaking of
bolts, out comes the torch.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.150
- Yeah, so with anything,
there's always gonna be a bolt

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.000
here or there that you gotta heat up.

00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:18.870
This one happened to be in the head.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.189
We heated that up and we're
able to work on those cars.

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.620
So, they a slot-headed
screw to begin with,

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.140
so that doesn't make it any more fun.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.450
At least it wasn't a Phillips,
so that was a benefit.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.910
All right, so there's the valve cover.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.280
It's got like a little
piece of bailing there

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.560
to hold it down.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.380
Here's your shaft rocker assembly,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.670
which wasn't really expected.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.360
I was expecting individual rockers,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.080
but a shaft rockers
definitely appreciate high rpm

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.530
better than the individual.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.290
Then your push rods.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.930
Then you can see in this
shaft that the valve covers

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.060
were leaking a little bit,
that's why you've got that grime

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.900
on top of the--

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.733
- [Ben] Gadget.

00:06:57.733 --> 00:06:59.630
- [Davin] Intake, or right up the intake.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.150
Here's the long and short studs.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.180
- Well, what was your first start?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.580
I mean, we're coming off doing the Harley,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.053
which we pulled the cover off,

00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:09.040
and it was a mangled piston,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.800
so at least we didn't have that.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.640
- Yeah, we're happy to say
that we didn't have that.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.700
There's no holes in
the top of the pistons.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.330
A lot of crud on top for a running Motor,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.270
a decently running motor.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.730
You saw, I through out dowel capper

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.430
just to see where the bore was at,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.323
because I personally was
impressed at how big the bore was.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.393
The bore size on this
was what, 94 millimeters?

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.590
- [Ben] Which isn't stock for this.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.952
These are bigger than--

00:07:38.952 --> 00:07:39.785
- [Davin] It is not stock, yeah.

00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:41.840
It's got oversized jugs in it.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840
So instead of being a 1600
cc, it's a little over 19.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.150
- Gotcha.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.830
This one, I remember,
sitting here with this,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.780
and we couldn't fight out
why each individual jug

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.613
wouldn't come off,

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:56.620
and there ended up being a washer jammed

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.077
in between those ridges in the slot,

00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:03.420
in the cooling vents, or the cooling ribs.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.002
- [Ben] So you had to pull
them off at the same time,

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:08.700
it was very confusing, and
then we look in there like,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.480
oh yeah, there's this little
washer jammed in there.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.230
All right, so the other side,
pretty much exactly the same.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.810
- Except one jug at a time.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.740
No washer holding them together.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.573
- [Ben] At this point,

00:08:20.573 --> 00:08:22.780
you're thinking pretty straight forward.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.520
- [Davin] Yeah, should be.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.730
- [Ben] I found this interesting.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.372
This was a kitchen strainer.

00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:30.760
- [Davin] The kitchen
strainer for a filter,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.520
which there is an aftermarket
function you can get for

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.340
to add a filter, a remote filter to it.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.510
- [Ben] Okay, now what are ya doing?

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.140
- [Davin] This was the oil pump.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.655
Yes, that's right because
it had the metal cover,

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.830
and the oil pump, and
then the aluminum piece

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.930
that's kinda jammed in
there to some extent.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.240
There's a special tool to utilize.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.287
We tried to--

00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:55.310
- [Ben] You mean it's not
a hammer and screwdriver.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.340
- [Davin] Nah, probably not
the best place to start.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.423
We were gentle.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.300
There's a difference
between gently prying,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.240
and getting nuts.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.113
- [Ben] There you got it off.

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:06.963
- [Davin] Yep. We got it out of here.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.590
Pretty straight forward from that site.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.050
I mean, the reason they
had to do that is because

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.590
putting it down on that end,
you have that parting line

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.690
of the new case, so you'd
have no way ever be able

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.820
to seal that to create a good pump,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.363
so that's why that
separate piece is there.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.700
- [Ben] What are we doing here?

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.533
- [Davin] Just pushing things down

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:27.543
to get the pistons out.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.241
The pistons are a floating pin,

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.920
so they're not pressed into the rod,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.873
and it's just a matter of
taking the C clip out of there,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.390
and then knocking the wrist pin out.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.814
- [Ben] Okay, so now
were splitting the case.

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:48.160
- [Davin] Yeah, so these
are two case halves

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.747
that come together, so you got
modified engine stand here,

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:55.403
enough to hold one side
of the case and not both.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.629
The reason we're prying this part two

00:09:58.629 --> 00:10:00.268
is there's some locator dowels,

00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:01.440
that you're trying to lift off of there.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.340
They're not pressed, but
they're definitely snug,

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.040
and then of course, the sealant

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.283
just has some general
block sealant between 'em.

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.120
- [Ben] I remember this
is weird kinda goin around

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.420
being like, did we miss a bolt,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.390
because it was a bit of a
struggle to get it separated.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.540
'Cause there isn't a gasket but
you would put some type of--

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.720
- [Davin] Yeah, just some sealer.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.780
- [Ben] Sealer in there.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.613
Now what are we looking at?

00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:25.930
- So here's all the guts,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.380
so you got on the bottom
side of the screen here,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.213
with the big gear in it,
that's your cam shaft.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.840
It's two pieces, but
it's not bolted together.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.340
The factory ones are riveted,
the big gear to the cam,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.900
and then your crank on the other half.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.990
You can see the lifters are
underneath the cam shaft here,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.530
and when we lifted the
one-half off, of course,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.090
lifters fell out.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.040
I remember we were like, how, wow,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.770
I wonder how we're gonna
hold those in when we do it,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.397
but there is only one way to do it,

00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:58.450
and you have to have 'em in there.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.050
- [Ben] So out come the lifters.

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.859
- [Davin] And there's
your crank craft assembly.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.270
- [Ben] What were you
digging out of there?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.140
- That was the

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.470
distributor, distributor gear shaft.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.033
So, you got your main distributor, piece,

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:20.423
and then you go a short
drive shaft for it.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.190
Then pulling the bearings
out of the case shaft.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.090
- [Ben] Okay, we're off then engine stand,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.190
but still a little more disassembly to go.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.810
- [Davin] Well, I had planned
on pulling and replacing

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.540
the stud, so started taking those out.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.603
Used the torch once again to heat it up.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.152
I'm pretty confident
this is a magnesium case,

00:11:46.152 --> 00:11:49.511
which in some worlds magnesium heating up

00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:53.850
could be a problem, but it's
only the powder that burns,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.340
not the chunks, the big chunks,

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.820
so I wouldn't really worried
about an uncontrollable fire

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.653
in my shop.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.173
So we're heating things
up, and making it stinky,

00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:06.840
and double knotting to get them out.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.073
- This is when we had our
first inkling of uh-oh.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:14.300
- There was I don't know how many.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.910
I mean they have an insert anyway,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.740
where you can see here,
the insert is coming out.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.573
- Right here.

00:12:22.415 --> 00:12:24.799
- So, you got the insert
that's into the aluminum block.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:25.870
You gotta have something
steel to hold onto

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.423
for the heads, head bolts.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.303
Eventually there's one
that was just JB welded in,

00:12:33.696 --> 00:12:35.970
so it didn't unscrew, it just pulled out.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.350
I was like, "Oh boy, it
might be the very last one."

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.971
- [Ben] Yeah, you were scraping at it,

00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:40.804
you heated it.

00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:43.602
Yeah (chuckles).

00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:44.613
- Yeah, there it is, yeah there it is.

00:12:44.613 --> 00:12:47.123
- You can see there's
no coil on it anywhere.

00:12:47.123 --> 00:12:48.370
- It's a chunk of JB weld.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.080
- [Ben] At that point, were like "Ooh."

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.346
- [Davin] Yep.

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:52.840
This had a lot of different issues

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.470
as far as the spacers,
and how the hela coals

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.483
that were in it.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.780
The jug wasn't actually
sealed to the block,

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.820
there was a gap.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.730
I mean, it had miraculously ran.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.130
I'll put it that way.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.090
- [Ben] Yeah, it felt
like one of those things

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.320
where the sludge that was
on it was the only reason

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.480
it was still right.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.830
- So, here, I'm taking the
rods off the crankshaft,

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.130
different than normal V8s
that we have been working on

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.040
where the crank shaft would
be set into the block,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.770
mains caps torqued down,
and then you put the rods,

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.760
and these are the opposite, if you will.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.513
It's about like a snow
mobile from that standpoint.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.740
- [Ben] We have the whole assembly.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.193
- [Davin] Yeah, have the
whole assembly and put it in.

00:13:40.223 --> 00:13:41.056
Then you have

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.270
main bearings that are diameters

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.890
that slip on, pulling off right there.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.530
Then you have the brass deal

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:55.530
is your gear for the distributor.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.780
Then your timing gear,
and then another bearing

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.913
which those are all
pressed on to some extent,

00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:05.080
and then that bearing will just slip off.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.270
Likewise, on the bearings
on the other end.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.173
So, different than other
engines that I've worked on,

00:14:12.146 --> 00:14:13.810
where normally here in
the center where we've got

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.343
a half shell, so you have
two halves of a bearing,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.140
normally you'd put one in the
block, and one in the cap.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.630
Then you'd tighten everything down.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.130
This you had diameter bearings

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.570
of foot complete diameters,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.810
that would slip on the ends

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.313
and then only the bearing in the center,

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.227
which going through this found,

00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:37.990
and it makes complete sense
based on the two halves.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.070
So you would take the case,
put it assembled together,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.840
go in and mike everything out,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.060
which we did on this case, and determined

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.610
what the OD of the bearing is,

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.440
then, based on the crank,
then you'd find out

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.740
what the idea of that bearing needs to be.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.740
Typical circumstance is the OD, is the OD,

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.400
that normally doesn't
change, but the ID changes

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.260
relative to the crank being turned.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.340
This has actually two areas of adjustment

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.550
to make parts work.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.890
Then there's also, and you
can just see it in the bearing

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.340
over here by the timing gear,

00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:20.220
there's oil holes, and then
there's a locator hole,

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.040
or basically an anti-rotation hole.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.860
There's a subsequent pin in the block

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.173
that keeps them from spinning
relative to the block.

00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.896
Then to the far left there's the shims

00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:39.051
that you use between the
flywheel and the crank,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:44.330
so you set your in play of
the crankshaft right to left,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.720
down the block.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.022
- So define and play

00:15:49.022 --> 00:15:52.940
what's the problem with
not saying that, and--

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.790
- Well if you have too much in play,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.030
basically, you'll wipe
out your thrust bearing

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.233
on the rear main right here.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.210
Typically there'd be a
flange on the crankshaft

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.090
that would hold it moving right to left,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.050
or down the block if you will.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.470
These shims basically do that,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.213
and that gap was tight.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.350
Roughly, it's like two or three
valve if I remember right.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.350
It was really tight.

00:16:22.205 --> 00:16:23.640
You use a dial indicator on it.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.640
That's later on in the assembly,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.100
but this kind gives you a nice breakout

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.950
of where it's at.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.523
Here's our progressive weber,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.040
basically to give it a
freshen while we're here,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.296
clean it up, and make it
look a little nicer as well,

00:16:39.296 --> 00:16:42.227
and replace any nasty bits in any of this.

00:16:42.227 --> 00:16:46.360
- [Ben] Now we opened this
up, and it was full of crap.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.450
The poles were just filthy, rusty.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.010
I mean chunks of stuff.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.310
- [Davin] Chunks of stuff.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.407
I can't believe, it's one of
those that you open it up,

00:16:57.407 --> 00:17:00.500
and like, how did this run smooth at all.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.330
- [Ben] When we drove it 2500 miles,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.172
and it went 75 miles an hour

00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:06.157
at a quarter throttle (chuckles).

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.199
Then off to Thirstily there we go.

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:13.123
- [Davin] So at Thirstily
we polish the crank.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.550
Basically they're taking
any ridges out of it,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.170
but you change the diameter slightly

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.570
but still within the zone, if you will

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.140
of not being turned, if
that makes any sense.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.381
- [Ben] Gotcha.

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:28.550
- [Davin] Just a pure polish.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.310
- [Ben] So, we left it
up to Mark to pivot,

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.563
and disassemble the heads for us.

00:17:34.865 --> 00:17:37.315
- [Davin] Yeah, we kinda
threw that on his plate.

00:17:40.756 --> 00:17:43.750
From what we can tell, as
well, based on the valve sizes,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.073
these heads are actually off a Porsche.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.940
- [Ben] If that's true, it would
of come off of like a what,

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.768
a 912, or a 356?

00:17:51.768 --> 00:17:53.037
- [Davin] Yeah.

00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:55.610
Whatever Flat 4 would be.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.760
Here's he's heating up the guys.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.603
They give them out,

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.390
which you heat up the
aluminum a little bit,

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.990
it swells enough, and they
tap off pretty easy then.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.390
- [Ben] We were originally thinking

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.410
he was just gonna do some cleanup on it,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.070
but it ended up being...

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.700
- [Davin] Yeah, the seats were shot.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.610
- [Ben] The guides I
think were the main issue.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.082
- The guides were really bad, yeah.

00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:20.915
When the guides are bad,

00:18:20.915 --> 00:18:24.550
it causes that valve to
do this inside the guides

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.100
which slams the...

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.940
It slams the seat.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.973
It doesn't hit centered every time.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.160
- [Ben] We made him put
them back together for it.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.432
- [Davin] Yes.

00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:34.670
That's one of the reasons
I didn't pull those apart

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.430
is my valve screen
compresser wouldn't reach,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.573
without heavy modification.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.713
- [Ben] Now he's pressing out.

00:18:44.765 --> 00:18:48.960
- [Davin] So, we replaced the
bushings on the little end,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.661
so that's what he's doing
here, is he's pushing

00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:52.623
the bushings out,

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.230
put fresh ones in.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.170
- [Ben] Yep, they're getting pressure.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.243
Then what's he doing here?

00:19:01.243 --> 00:19:02.076
- [Davin] So here he is.

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:07.020
He's cleaning up the big end of the rods,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.900
honing and resizing them.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.590
- [Ben] Making sure they're circular.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.430
- [Davin] Yep.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.450
Taking any oval out of 'em.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.580
- [Ben] And sizing them
to what they need to be

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.800
with whatever.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.120
- [Davin] Yes, and making
sure they're to spec, as well,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.203
Not hadn't been oversized.

00:19:24.047 --> 00:19:24.964
He'll do the same thing

00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:28.460
with the small end as well,
which is what he's doing here,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.810
so that brand new bushing, by the nature,

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.060
it's always a little
bit, call it undersized,

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.880
or a little small, so he's
setting it to the size,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.630
and then, of course when
you push things in and out,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.290
you can disturb the edges
of them, just a little bit,

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.160
and that takes any of that out of it.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.130
- [Ben] You gotta rebuild kit, essentially

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.610
to put all new bits in here.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.443
- Yep, yep,

00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:54.623
a complete rebuild kit, all the gaskets,

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:57.950
the jets, and that type
of stuff, are reused

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.460
but they're cleaned out real well.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.570
You can see, I have a brass,

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.360
the key here is there's a brass brush,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.220
and you wanna use brass,
because it takes off

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.970
the gunk, but not remove any material.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.060
You don't wanna add any
scratches, you don't have to.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.280
You can still see in
the bottom of that bowl,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.740
there's still a little gunk left,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.470
and that does get cleaned out
before we reassemble that.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.160
- [Ben] It was just filled wsigth crap.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.530
- [Davin] Yeah, that
stuff was more staining

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:29.530
than it is actual chunks floating around.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.200
So fresh gaskets, all
the screws goes back in,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.053
evenly tighten them around.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.140
You can see, I put a little

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.340
of actually wheel bearing
grease on the threads.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.950
You're going into aluminum,
steel and aluminum

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.520
just makes sense.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.940
You could use anything from a lubricant.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.930
I've used wheel bearing grease obviously,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:56.280
Vaseline, anti-seize,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.053
anything, just to put something there,

00:20:58.053 --> 00:21:00.810
and then a clean up, and there it is.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.860
- [Ben] Now the fun stuff.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.380
- So here's the crankshaft,
as we mentioned before.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.840
It has to go in the block
halves as an assembly,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.413
so you have to assemble everything here.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.060
- Now you've put it on the flywheel.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.090
- I put it on the flywheel

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.300
simply to stand it up.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.180
You could do it laying on a table.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.820
Actually I found it was very handy,

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.860
instead of it rolling around.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.030
- [Ben] Wait, was this the one?

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.970
- [Davin] Yeah, there's
something to note here.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.670
You'll notice that I had a little,

00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:32.670
I'll call it flung the
rod, after I put it on.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.780
The reason I did that is

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.753
the first time we put the rod bearings on,

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.873
it didn't fling.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.680
- [Ben] It just clamped onto the...

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.150
- [Davin] The crank was standard size,

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.580
and we had 10 under bearings,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.390
so there was a mass of interference,

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.343
right about seven thousands.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.630
Yes, for those of you watching,

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.130
no initially, I did not check.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.680
I would of caught that if I
would have put one bearing in

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.780
and miked out the crank.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.803
The second time I miked the
crank, and miked the bearings.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.310
I think that's the first
time I haven't done that.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.380
- [Ben] I think that was just sort of like

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.880
we assumed that the
right part got ordered.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.333
- [Davin] Yep we did.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.453
- [Ben] And, they didn't,

00:22:26.453 --> 00:22:28.400
so we've got the right pieces.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.080
- [Davin] Which that's a cardinal sin,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.340
because you always make 'em,
regardless of the right one,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.660
blah, blah, blah.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.330
- [Ben] 'Cause they might
send you the wrong one.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.899
- [Davin] It bit me right there.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.140
- [Ben] They might accidentally send

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.090
one of the wrong ones, and
three of the right ones.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.363
- When we talked in our description,

00:22:46.739 --> 00:22:48.787
that just because everyone says,

00:22:48.787 --> 00:22:51.010
"Ah, these are the easiest things ever."

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.750
They're the easiest things
ever when it goes right.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.890
When it goes wrong, they're
just as crappy as anything else.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.670
- [Ben] Same thing said
for Chevy small block.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.660
- [Davin] Absolutely, right.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.700
- [Ben] Or really any engine,

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.427
but the ones that have the common sort of,

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:08.470
"Oh, they're so easy, yeah."

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.130
Yeah they're easy until they aren't.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.280
- Right.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.507
Everybody on the couches aren't doing 'em,

00:23:12.507 --> 00:23:14.290
'cause they're not that easy.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.640
They're not a bag of chips.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.787
This is after we went through the,

00:23:18.787 --> 00:23:21.710
"Oh, your crank case is no good.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.710
We're like, "Oh no."

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.263
- [Ben] So, speaking of the crank case.

00:23:25.263 --> 00:23:26.340
- [Davin] Here it is.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.770
- [Ben] Here's our fancy new one.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.120
- [Davin] This is a
brand new MP crankcase,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.133
aluminum built, way
heavier than the stock one,

00:23:37.342 --> 00:23:40.320
which bit us on a couple
spots, but only from

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.850
a clearance standpoint, but
it's a lot beefier case.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.933
It comes line honed.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.610
It's all ready to assemble.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.770
I did have to clean it.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.690
I rinsed things out and
got some bits out of,

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.840
from shipping and that.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.800
It's got beautiful steel inserts in there,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.950
that are not JB Welded into this case,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.220
so a couple cool things like that.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.190
Actually, in one of the spots,
you could see right where

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.800
the hold down clamp, it looks
like I've already hit that.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.186
See the hold down clamp there, and the--

00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:13.818
- Right here?

00:24:13.818 --> 00:24:14.901
- Right here.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.860
That was one area that had the clearance

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.610
with diagrander,

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.330
because the case was beefier right there.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.300
There were plenty of meat to work with,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.310
just the clamp I had,
I had to clearance it

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.080
so it sat down Flush.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.093
Otherwise it was kicking up.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.090
- [Ben] We did, as we come
into this new case here.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.640
The reason we did get the new case

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.500
wasn't just because of
those JB Weld things

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.023
to be pulled out of there,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.380
we took it to the shop to have it checked,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.500
to see if we could reuse it,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.680
and they basically told us no.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.600
We got a quick clip of
Dave explaining that,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.433
so here it is.

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:58.400
- So after we carefully taken apart

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.730
the engine block and
separated everything out,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.550
got our stuff apart.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.070
We started doing the inspections.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.850
A couple of critical areas in here

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.930
are the journal for your crankshaft,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.230
and the journal for your camshaft.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.040
These can be honed, align
honed after they're assembled,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.800
both journals.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.660
Then bearings purchased accordingly.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.631
Of course, bearings are only
offered in certain sizes,

00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:31.610
and what we found on our
inspection was these journals

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.560
have already been taken to their max,

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.023
plus you'll see that
there's been some damage

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.360
to the journals,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.700
specifically the pin
that holds the bearing

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.308
from rotating, and this one

00:25:47.308 --> 00:25:48.813
has been completely been wiped out.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.900
If you remember, we had to
use a torch in a couple areas

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.683
to get studs out.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.510
We had some pretty ugly
inserts that have already

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.350
been put in here, and been
replaced, and pretty nasty.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:08.390
So whatta you do when you
have problems with a block?

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.813
In this case, you do this right here,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.463
a brand new one,

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.300
all beautiful, shiny,

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.630
perfectly machined, and
ready to be assembled.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.600
The other case was ugly.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.630
- Yeah, it was.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.790
- [Davin] It's seen all of its life.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.180
So here were' putting in the head studs.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.960
You see I'm wiping off the excess,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.283
but using some aviation
sealer to hold those in.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.903
High Tack is another version of that.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.930
The idea is it seals them for oil leakage,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.870
and locks 'em in place.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.230
- [Ben] Now you're getting
ready to drop the crank in,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.120
and the cam shaft.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.953
- Yep, rods are on.

00:26:51.953 --> 00:26:53.660
You see now the camshaft.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.550
That's a brand new camshaft.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:27:00.550
Again, there was nothing
wrong with the stock camshaft

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.380
that was in it, other than it
didn't compliment the bore,

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.570
so the bigger bore size, you
might as well take advantage

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.540
of a little more lift on the camshaft,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.733
in different durations,
so it'll fuel it better.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.253
It has an aluminum bolt on, timing gear,

00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:19.260
and you can see brand new lifters.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.010
There are the brand new main bearings,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:28.010
and camshaft bearings, just
using a little assembly lube,

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.733
so it's on there when
everything goes back together.

00:27:35.225 --> 00:27:37.403
Put the timing gear back in.

00:27:37.403 --> 00:27:41.460
I'm sorry, the timing gear
and the distributor gear.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.850
So there goes the lifters into that half,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.040
which is easy, because
they're on the downside,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.140
so they're gonna stay
where they need to be at,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.906
set the crankshaft in,
obviously making sure

00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:56.230
the rods go through
the hole in the bottom,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.590
making sure that those
dowel pins are lined up

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.363
for the main bearing so they don't spin.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.730
Putting in the last,
or the center bearing,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.730
which I got it lubed up, but
you can see it's not there.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.060
That half goes into the other case half,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.930
lock tightening in the
bolts for the camshaft,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.093
torque 'em down,

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.534
again lubing up the cam lobes

00:28:23.534 --> 00:28:25.700
for initial fire up.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.550
Here is the lifters for the other half.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.760
Now, I mentioned earlier
that we were concerned

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.510
how we're gonna hold them in there.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.230
Actually what happened was really nice,

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.650
is they typically don't
ride all the way in.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.050
They ride, I don't know
a hundred thousands up,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.640
but when you push them in, just
that hundred thousands more,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.013
there's just enough bite,

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.888
just enough resistance in the case,

00:28:50.888 --> 00:28:53.410
that they hold them so when
you flip 'em upside down

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.017
they stay there,

00:28:55.017 --> 00:28:57.943
and then you can just
push them down into place.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.690
- [Ben] Okay, so on goes...

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.320
- [Davin] So here's the case half sealant,

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.430
so wiped everything down.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.380
Everything is clean.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.230
There's no burs, all that type of stuff,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.660
and just putting a real thin layer

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.500
on all the surface that come together.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.049
Again, there's some aliment
pins and everything.

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:22.860
You can see that case
half syncing together.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.000
In goes the oil filter strainer

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.080
- From the back your getting
the pistons ready, go.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.563
- We ordered pistons,

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.050
and didn't think anything about the price,

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.930
because it was reasonable
for four pistons.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.450
When we got the pistons,
the pistons had the rings

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.640
on them already.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.340
Of course, it came with wrist pins,

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.980
but it also came with new jugs.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.710
It was like, "Wow, that
was dirt cheap for pistons

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.543
and jugs.

00:29:51.543 --> 00:29:52.917
It was under $400, and I was like,

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:54.320
"Wow, that's crazy."

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.580
- So, we didn't need to replace the jugs.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.080
- No the jugs didn't need to be replaced,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.400
but at that point, we got free machining

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.970
by buying a brand new
jugs, so it just made sense

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.530
to use 'em.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.530
So, here's the only trick if you will,

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.480
and you can see it in the background.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.990
We put the piston into the jug

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.380
with the ring compressor first.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.600
Then slip it down over,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.943
push the wrist pin through,

00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:26.620
so through the piston into the rod,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.290
then of course across the other side.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.350
One clip is already in the piston,

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.823
and then here I'm just
putting the last clip in,

00:30:33.823 --> 00:30:37.424
that holds that wrist pin from coming out.

00:30:37.424 --> 00:30:38.257
- [Ben] There goes the pin.

00:30:38.257 --> 00:30:39.090
Now the pin's in,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.033
and there's the clip.

00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:45.100
- What you were doing
in the background there

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.313
was you were adding a little bead of,

00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:53.560
so that's a little separate.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.013
Just before I put the
pistons into the jug,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.990
speaking with a Volkswagen officinado,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.290
he recommended to take
instead of using any of shims

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:14.290
and all of that, because I had
already set my head height,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.630
on that top end where my hand's at.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.943
We had machined those.

00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:20.640
But, any rate, to get
the right compression,

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.600
so then when I set that
in there, I put a bead of

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.380
high temperature silicone,
the orange alter seal.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.240
- Around here, right.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.640
- Yep, right at the corner if you will,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.300
the cylinder jug to the fins,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.380
- [Davin] The ray where it meets here.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.060
- [Ben] Right where it meets there, yep.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.210
That is to seal that up right there,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.600
because you're really only sealing...

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.600
You're sealing some crank pressure,

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.813
but for the most part.

00:31:49.813 --> 00:31:53.560
It's not a normal head
gasket, or thought process

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.880
of a head gasket, it is
just sealing the oil.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.280
So, by doing that, that
puts enough sealant there,

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.100
without getting ugly, and
you might be able to see it

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.563
when it pushes in.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.500
I put it just in the corer.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.860
I remember a couple spots
where you could see it.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.693
There you go.

00:32:11.693 --> 00:32:15.173
So, you can just see the
orange that pushed dowel.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.810
- [Ben] Now what are these going on here?

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:23.663
- [Davin] These are very
fancy push rod tubes.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.470
- [Ben] I thought it was cool
when they tie mikes here,

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.950
as he tightened it down,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.453
you can see those little areas compress.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.443
There it goes.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.653
- [Davin] Yep.

00:32:34.653 --> 00:32:39.243
Now this is the first set of
cylinders we've put on, ever.

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:44.163
This is the first time
I have ever done this.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.650
For those that know,

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.410
we'll see that I did
not put in the shroud.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.410
There is absolutely no
way to put the shroud in

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.370
after you put head on in the tubes.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.490
A couple commenters caught that.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.890
- A couple commenters caught it,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.090
and they were 100% right.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.730
On the second set, I caught it

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.670
when we went to do the
second set of cylinders,

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.720
I put it on the second set,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.940
and I had to come back
and pull the head off,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.180
basically redo this sequence.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.500
I didn't obviously pull the cylinders off,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.470
and then slid that in there.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.600
So, in the car, it is there.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.680
Something else I want to note too

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.840
that we powder coated the valve covers.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.930
Pretty much anything that matte black,

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.290
has been powder coated.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.990
Reason for that is it holds up way better

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.050
than paint.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.910
Now, I don't believe this engine's

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.370
gonna get over 400 degrees,

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.680
and have any issue with the
plastic of the powder coating,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.520
so if it does, then we probably
got different problems.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.000
- [Davin] Yeah, if the
the valve covers are

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.803
getting up to 400 degrees,

00:33:46.803 --> 00:33:49.090
then we definitely have some issues.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.880
So same thing on the other side.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.923
- [Ben] You can see that red goop again.

00:33:54.714 --> 00:33:56.368
There it is.

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:57.201
- [Davin] Look at that,

00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:58.034
there's the shield

00:33:58.034 --> 00:33:59.073
That's on the other side.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.990
- [Davin] I shouldn't say it's a shield,

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.853
it is part of the cooling system.

00:34:06.412 --> 00:34:08.260
- [Ben] When it comes
down to drive it across

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.840
the bottom side of that.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.160
- [Davin] So, there's a
rocker assembly on there.

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.670
You can see, I set the
valve lash right in there.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.440
There's the fuel gauge
setting the valve lash.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.430
We didn't necessarily
show the wrench on there

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:21.933
rotating the crank shaft.

00:34:23.075 --> 00:34:24.900
I have to set everything correctly.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.210
- [Ben] All the bit so
you'd only catch in a frame.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.580
- [Davin] Yes.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.190
- I guess, I would say a lot
of the comments that we get

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.410
on these in terms of how we did these,

00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:37.410
is usually in regards
to stuff that we did,

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:39.890
but because of the nature of the videos.

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:43.060
You're just not gonna see, or
they're just mundane enough

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.303
that it's like, "Well
there's no point in shooting.

00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:48.695
♪ Dun, dun, dun ♪

00:34:48.695 --> 00:34:50.027
- Yes, you gotta have the book out.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.060
Only because the first
time it has a half load

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.870
type of function, or an off center mark,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.790
and it was just a question for me

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.453
of where does everything need to line up.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.781
Depending on the year that we don't know,

00:35:10.781 --> 00:35:13.310
and depending to this,
that and the other thing,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:14.760
there's about four different positions

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.260
of where it could be at,
and at the end of the day,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.600
I need to make a judgment
call of what it needed to be.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.240
So here we're getting that in there,

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.387
and what the flashlight's
doing in there is

00:35:26.387 --> 00:35:27.540
"I'm looking and making sure

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.640
I'm getting everything lined up,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.640
because there's a shaft, a
spring, and then the distributor

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.460
has to line up to everything
as you go in there.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.303
Then you have the nice hold
down clamp for the distributor.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.470
Oil pump goes back in.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.097
- [Ben] What kind of goop are you using?

00:35:48.097 --> 00:35:50.670
A little bit of that.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.133
Again, that aviation, sealer,
gasket make, type of stuff.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:59.500
Then gears go back in, and
filled it with lithium grease.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.490
and the idea there is it picks up faster

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.970
as far as the pump is concerned.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.410
- [Ben] Meaning the pump
turns into a pump faster.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.987
It's got more suction
to get the ore moving.

00:36:09.987 --> 00:36:11.970
- [Davin] Exactly.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.843
We opted to reuse the kind
of an ugly oil cooler.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.107
The adapter and everything is cleaned up,

00:36:19.107 --> 00:36:21.480
and I flushed out the
oil cooler really well,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.940
and was happy with that.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.222
- [Ben] I think we had a comment,

00:36:24.222 --> 00:36:27.010
or somebody sent us an email,

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.320
that said that their company
remakes or refurbishes--

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.640
- [Davin] Which I have now on the list,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.463
so that'll happen next time.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.020
A fuel pump went in here to the right,

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.523
and then the stand for
generator is what's on the

00:36:39.523 --> 00:36:41.403
farthest right.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.742
- [Ben] Also the oil fill tube too.

00:36:44.742 --> 00:36:45.575
- [Davin] Yes, and the oil fill

00:36:45.575 --> 00:36:47.871
is part of all that assembly there.

00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:49.353
There you can see it really well.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.220
- [Ben] Yeah that oil
cooler is kinda heinous,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.205
isn't it.

00:36:53.205 --> 00:36:54.527
- [Davin] Yeah it is.

00:36:54.527 --> 00:36:55.360
But it works

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.193
- That's right.

00:36:56.193 --> 00:36:57.711
It goes away here in a little bit.

00:36:57.711 --> 00:37:01.450
End up with pretty much
all brand new shrouding,

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.970
just because the other one had some tabs

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.090
that were beat off, broke
up, and it wasn't worth

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.910
repairing them for $30.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.210
- [Ben] These are all...

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.210
Again, they were brand new.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.300
I bead blast them, and
had them power coated,

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.000
so they'll hold up a little better.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.100
The paint that was on 'em was pretty thin.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.670
Crank pulley back on.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.788
I mean it's starting to look
good again here, if you will.

00:37:25.788 --> 00:37:27.700
- But now you can see,
we have both of those.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.250
- Yes, there we go, proof, right there.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.370
So there's one there, and one there.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.070
We redeemed ourselves there
before it went in the car.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.400
These are what we were just talking about,

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.780
is this bottom heat duct shrouding

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.900
for the cooling in the bit.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.370
They were flat, pretty much,

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.840
in a vendor put in position.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.890
They weren't ridiculous,

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.581
but it took a little effort to get there.

00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:55.383
- Now we're nearing the end here.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.373
- Nearing the end, so now I'm putting

00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:02.164
the big heat exchanger back on.

00:38:02.164 --> 00:38:03.662
That actually has a high
temperature paint put on them,

00:38:03.662 --> 00:38:05.930
that's gold when you spray it on.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:10.930
Then you bake it to 550 degrees,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:15.110
and it turns that gray, and
that is the best coating

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.270
I've ever found for exhaust.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.960
- [Davin] So here we're putting the fan

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.793
all back together again,

00:38:19.793 --> 00:38:22.810
and everything was stripped and shot.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.590
- Now this was a fun process.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:29.047
This was a fun process
because it was not happy.

00:38:29.047 --> 00:38:31.380
For whatever reason that shroud wound up,

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.630
or the fan itself wanted
to rub on the shroud.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.443
There was a lot of shimmying and cussing.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.630
So again, if you look right
there by the distributor

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.830
in my hand, there is a rod end

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.420
and that little linkage piece.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.075
That's the key to getting the--

00:38:51.075 --> 00:38:52.610
- Look at this guy,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.913
which the old intake
manifold did not have.

00:38:54.913 --> 00:38:57.060
- The old intake manifold
did not have that,

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.120
so what was happening
is as the cable came out

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:05.120
of the fan shroud, it was
coming up at a 45 degree angle

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.880
to the carburetor, and pulling down,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.710
but it has to go past
the six o'clock position

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.370
to go to full throttle.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.930
This rectified that.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.140
You'll see it here again when
we get the carburetor on,

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:27.100
but that little cast in bond,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.743
was the key to all this.

00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:30.640
We reused the fuel pump.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.620
It was fine.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.240
Obviously, the distributor,

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.111
so those two pieces show
a little wear there,

00:39:36.111 --> 00:39:37.640
and the generator is good.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.700
Freshly reloaded carburetor on there,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.150
a long search for the washer to go here,

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.720
but fabricated all the nice one.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.684
It looks good.

00:39:45.684 --> 00:39:47.470
- [Ben] It looks good we painted it.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.050
So last step now is to get the exhaust on.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.730
I don't remember what that brand was.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.620
Somebody asked, and I'll have to get it.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.703
- I got it through Apple Tree in Michigan.

00:39:58.976 --> 00:39:59.809
- [Davin] All right.

00:40:00.992 --> 00:40:02.242
- [Ben] So here's running

00:40:04.679 --> 00:40:08.100
the ignition wires over
to the correct area,

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.210
and figuring out how we
wanted to lay the fuel line,

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.770
based on for all intents and purposes,

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.210
whoever was not designed
to go on this engine.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.430
It's on backwards, if you will.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.550
Because your choke adjustment,

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.470
and your fuel intake is on the back side,

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.790
against that shroud, and
it is a pain in the monkey

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.860
to do it, especially to adjustment it.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:33.940
This is where it's handy that it's light,

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.739
- And handy that there's
a video guy there.

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:37.410
- Although I want to look at the look

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.067
on that video guy's
facing going, "Holy cow.

00:40:40.067 --> 00:40:42.201
"This is the heaviest
camera I've ever lifted."

00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:44.690
(Davin laughs)

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.650
Now here, this is were
I was talking about.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:51.070
We've set me in play,
so there's the gauge.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:53.093
I got the flywheel on.

00:40:53.093 --> 00:40:54.320
I've got it torqued out.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.540
Now I don't have it torqued
down to crazy number

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.373
that needs to be yet.

00:40:57.373 --> 00:40:58.800
I've just taken up the slack.

00:40:59.695 --> 00:41:00.528
- [Ben] Oh, is that me
trying to murder you there?

00:41:00.528 --> 00:41:02.360
- [Davin] It looks like
Ben's trying to take me out.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.550
- [Ben] I was bringing you a hammer.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.930
- [Davin] You were bringing me the hammer,

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:08.860
because I use an aluminum plate
to put the rear main seal in

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.960
after I had checked and
knew what kind of shims

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.310
I needed in there to get
that endpoint correct.

00:41:16.718 --> 00:41:19.777
I didn't happen to have the
right clutch alignment tool,

00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:24.343
so I had to turn one on the lathe.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.947
I didn't worry about any spines,

00:41:28.947 --> 00:41:30.950
because I just used the diameter.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.430
Diameter, diameter's the same thing.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.520
- [Ben] That's why you're special,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.118
because if we don't have a part,

00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:37.693
you just make it.

00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:38.526
- [Davin] Just make it.

00:41:38.526 --> 00:41:39.359
That's right.

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:40.192
- [Ben] There's that,

00:41:40.192 --> 00:41:42.363
- [Davin] That is all stainless.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.550
It functions fully like
the original stuff does,

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.780
but I'll tell you what,
the flow is a lot nicer,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.170
and it sounds good.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.407
- [Ben] I love the fact that
this engine sitting there.

00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:56.217
You could just start it up
sitting there if you wanted to.

00:41:56.217 --> 00:41:57.580
- [Davin] Oh, absolutely.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.151
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:01.570
- [Ben] There's no radiator to hook up.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.430
- [Davin] No nothing.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.886
- [Ben] It's all right there.

00:42:03.886 --> 00:42:04.719
- [Davin] Yeah, it's all there.

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:05.552
- [Ben] I mean you just
basically need fuel,

00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:06.385
and--

00:42:06.385 --> 00:42:08.000
- [Davin] Put the
battery into the spin it.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.020
Yeah 'cause the starter
bolts to the transmission

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.490
side of it, but--

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.713
- [Ben] Now we're back
on the training jack.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.410
This right here is where two more inches

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.310
would have been fantastic,

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.890
and it has nothing to do
with the other exhaust,

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.930
'cause it was equally as a bear
to get that little piece out

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:24.950
right there.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:26.110
- [Davin] What the time doesn't show,

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.950
is us spending like a half an hour

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:32.100
finagling things to get it lined up.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.933
- [Ben] Instead it's like,

00:42:32.933 --> 00:42:36.350
"Oh look, we did this in five minutes.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.820
We're pretty much wrapping things up here.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.250
- [Davin] Yep, everything's wrapped up.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.690
Timing set, we broke the engine in right,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.793
between that shot.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.823
- But you know, it's Hollywood.

00:42:50.362 --> 00:42:51.195
We gotta make a play.

00:42:51.195 --> 00:42:52.028
You guys don't wat to sit there

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:52.861
for 20 minute watching us break it in.

00:42:52.861 --> 00:42:54.630
- [Davin] That's not real impressive.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.970
I don't think either.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.770
- [Ben] So it's off you go.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.374
- [Davin] Off we roll.

00:42:59.374 --> 00:43:00.207
(VW engine purs)

00:43:00.207 --> 00:43:02.550
Glad you're still watching.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.410
We've got more things to come.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.350
As you noticed, or may not have noticed,

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.260
in the shop there's some
where's Waldos in there,

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.580
a couple of the projects,

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.410
and a couple of things
up our sleeves as well.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.580
Not in that shop.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.970
- Yep we have a couple
maybe out of the ordinary

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.324
for what you've seen so
far, for the red light

00:43:19.324 --> 00:43:21.900
and rebuilds, but leave comments.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.874
If you have any more
questions about this video,

00:43:23.874 --> 00:43:27.630
or if you have any
suggestions for what engines

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.520
we should be working on.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.990
I know we've gotten comments
about doing a Chevy big block,

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.650
a Ford 289, straight six, straight 8.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.480
Some people ask for a Porsche engine.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.266
I mean, isn't that the same thing as

00:43:39.266 --> 00:43:40.369
what we just did.

00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:41.202
- Pretty close.

00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:42.093
- It's just two more cylinders.

00:43:44.608 --> 00:43:46.370
Thanks for watching.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.270
We'll see you next time.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.283
- [Davin] See ya.

00:43:48.283 --> 00:43:50.866
(engine roars)
