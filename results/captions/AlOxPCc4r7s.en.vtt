00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.970
A maniac that was wanted by nearly everyone
in the galaxy, from the Rebel Alliance to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.280
even the Galactic Empire, the notorious Doctor
Evazan had the largest target on his back

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
as his crimes sickened every group and organization
that became aware of them.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.480
Not only was he wanted by the two major galactic
powers of his era, but also 12 separate planetary

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.570
systems gave him the death penalty on their
own accord, and on top of that dozens of bounty

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.199
hunters and mercenaries went out of their
way to to hunt him down for either personal

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.360
reasons or to eliminate what they believed
was truly the most sickening man they’ve

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.540
ever heard of.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.520
So who was Doctor Evazan and what did he do
that made him an enemy of nearly every being

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.960
in the entire galaxy?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.220
First in Canon, Evazan was originally a mildly
successful surgeon who was known for his cosmetic

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.370
operations.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.960
However during this time either something
snapped in his brain or he just decided to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.770
stop pretending on being a sane individual,
as shortly into his career as a professional

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.530
cosmetic surgeon he started to do extreme
experiments on unwilling patients.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.170
His early list of crimes consisted of mutilating
and killing hundreds of beings, with a few

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.280
of his experiments consisting of him rearranging
the limbs of his patients, leaving the few

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.880
who survived his operations to live out their
lives horrifically scarred.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.259
He seemed to choose his victims randomly and
without care of where they came from, as a

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.630
few wealthy and well connected individuals
were known to lose a few of their family members

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.039
to his experiments.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.700
He quickly became a high profile criminal
on his world and had a bounty placed on him

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.340
by local authorities.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.869
The first bounty hunter to come across Evazan
ended up disfiguring his face.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.359
He almost ended up being captured by the bounty
hunter had he not been saved by a nearby Aqualish

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.460
thug named Ponda.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.450
Following their escape from the bounty hunter,
Ponda realized Evazan’s intelligence and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.750
potential to be used to create a ton of wealth
for himself, so he convinced the doctor to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.249
partner up with him and use his connections
to enter the criminal underworld.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.569
Together Ponda and Evazan went on to become
partners in crime for a few years, which ranged

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.320
from smuggling to murder, and this earned
them a semi modest living.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.140
During this short period, they both ended
up on the wanted lists of multiple star systems.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.700
It wouldn’t be until in the later years
of their lives however, that they’d become

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.640
one of the most wanted individuals in the
galaxy.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.470
As at this point Doctor Evazan decided to
conduct perhaps some of his most cruel experiments

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.050
that would be both felt and seen across multiple
planets.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.420
His most infamous creations were the Decraniated.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.990
These were beings that were kidnapped and
cybernetically modified to be turned into

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.300
obedient slaves, and many of them were later
sold to wealthy crimelords and the like.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.780
The cybernetics that replaced their brains
took away their consciousness which in effect

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.340
eliminated who they were as a person before
the procedure, and they essentially became

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.270
mindless droids that were made to serve.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.350
Some of the earliest victims of these creations
were taken from medic bays as well as soldiers

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.060
from both sides of the war who were injured
during a bloody battle.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.850
Many of which actually came from the chaotic
moon of Jedha.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.620
Doctor Evazan and Ponda were known to always
be on the move, leaving behind only a trail

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.670
of victims from their sick experiments as
evidence of their stay for every planet.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.810
Not much else is known about the Doctor beyond
that, other than that a bounty hunter named

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.820
Tam Posla has been on their tail since at
least Jedha, and he has taken a personal vengeance

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.980
toward hunting Evazan down.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.569
This same bounty hunter has also acquired
Ponda’s severed arm from the cantina, suggesting

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.890
he is getting awfully close to catching up
with Doctor Evazan and his partner.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.040
In Legends, Doctor Evazan was known for being
a lunatic from the very start.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.540
Early on in his life he tried to apply to
the Imperial Military.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.730
However during the interview process, the
Imperials who interviewed him found him to

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.380
be so crazy of a person that they believed
he was a danger to society.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.630
So they ended up sending Evazan to an Imperial
prison, but he was able to escape shortly

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.630
afterwards.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.570
After his escape from prison he began to study
and practice cyborging and organic surgery,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.190
with nearly all of his patients being unwilling
kidnapped beings.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.490
His actions of course caught the eye of local
law enforcement agencies, which forced the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.900
doctor to be on the move as he jumped from
planet to planet.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.529
It wasn’t clear why he did what he did,
but one being suggested that Evazan was attempting

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:27.050
to find immortality and that he hoped his
experiments would lead him to said answer.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.099
While his forced surgery experiments were
his most well known crimes, Evazan also dealt

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.599
in slaving and assassination jobs.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.289
The origin of his deformed face and meeting
with Ponda was nearly identical to its canon

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.080
counterpart, where a bounty hunter had tracked
Evazan down and shot a blaster bolt that took

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.949
off half of the Doctor’s face.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.340
He was almost about to be captured, had it
not been for the intervention of Ponda.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.889
While they formed a somewhat uneasy friendship,
it quickly ended following their confrontation

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.259
with Luke and Obi Wan, where Ponda lost his
arm due to Evazan’s aggressive attitude.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.969
The doctor promised to reattach the Aqualish’s
arm back through surgery, but failed to do

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:05.969
so.

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:10.160
This failure ended their relationship, in
which Ponda later swore to kill Evazan for

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.879
causing him to lose his arm.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.680
However after about a year, the two came across
each other and made up.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.800
They then began working together, where Evazan
believed he made a breakthrough on achieving

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.069
immortality, which was to transfer the mind
from the aging body it was trapped in.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.469
After countless experiments on plenty more
innocent beings, Evazan eventually ended up

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.210
creating a few dozen zombies as he made progress
to achieving his goal.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.590
It was around this time of his experiments
that the bounty hunter Boba Fett finally had

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.460
tracked him down and infiltrated the mad Doctor’s
laboratory.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.580
After blasting away a few of the zombies that
were unleashed, Boba Fett successfully shot

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.069
and killed Doctor Evazan.

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.050
But wait, that wasn’t the end of his tale.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.669
As prior to his death, Evazan had injected
himself with an updated serum that he had

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.409
used on his patients that turned them into
zombies.

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.449
So even though he was killed by Boba, Evazan
was able to eventually come back to life as

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.069
his body slowly reanimated itself.

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.660
Though unlike his other subjects, the Doctor
still had his mind, but it was implied his

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.360
body at that point looked like a dead corpse.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.969
Though he wouldn’t remain alive long after
that, as he eventually died from a serum that

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.819
was used to wipe out the zombies he had created.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.310
Although it was believed that was the end
of Doctor Evazan, there were reports and rumors

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.409
that he was still active 9 years following
the battle of Yavin.

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.400
Though it was never confirmed if that was
truly him or just a copycat that commited

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:44.490
similar criminal acts.
