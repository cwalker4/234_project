00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.840
Hey guys, Chris Fix here. Today, I'm going to show you how to remove scratches from your car's paint.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000
Now there are a few types of scratches and in this video

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.740
we're going to fix the most common scratch, the clear coat scratch.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.800
There are many ways you get clear coat scratches just like this.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.060
Maybe someone was walking up and rubbing against your car and a zipper or something grabbed the paint.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.820
Maybe someone cleaned your car, or you cleaned your car, and by mistake you had some grit or something on here and you rubbed a nice scratch into the paint.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.900
Heck, even the other day my friend said their dog jumped up onto the side of their car because they were so excited to see them.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.000
And left a couple of nice size scratches on the side of their door.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So we all know there's tons of ways to get scratches on your car. We'll I'm gonna show you how to remove scratches so it goes from this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.880
To this!

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.120
Using 5 simple steps you could do it at home.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.820
The first step is to wash down the area with soapy water and a towel.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360
The second step is to mask the area so you know where the scratch is at.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.200
The third step is to sand the sratch with 3000 grit and then 5000 grit sandpaper

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.140
The forth step is to use polish.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.960
And then the final step is to buff it with wax

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.600
And the best part is, that this can all be done at home and it will cost you only a couple of bucks.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.160
As always, all of the products that I'm using in this video are listed in the description.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.920
If you are having a hard time finding 3000 grit and 5000 grit sandpaper, just check the description for the link.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.280
Before we get started, fixing scratches can be intimidating so I wanna explain what well be doing when we remove a scratch.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.020
Now the paint on your car has three main layers.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.700
The first coat is a primer that goes over the bare metal of the car.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
The second coat is the base coat which is the paint gives your car it's color.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
And the third coat, we have a clear coat which protects the paint and gives it it's glossy shine.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.860
This is the thickest paint layer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.680
At one to two mills (millimeters) which is one to two-thousands of an inch

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.780
To give you an idea, that's about how thick a Zip-Lock bag or a garage bag is.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.920
And the final layer really isn't a paint layer but I wanted to include it because it is important.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.600
And its a protection layer called the "Wax layer" which helps fill in small imperfections.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.020
It also helps to protect against light scratches and water marks.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.520
Now the reason you can see a scratch in the clear coat is because when light hits the scratch it stands out.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.220
On scratch free paint, when light hits the paint it reflects back in a constant pattern.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.420
But when there is a scratch the light reflects back differently and it catches your eye.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.580
So what we are going to do is to smooth out that scratch so light doesn't catch it anymore.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.060
So it goes from this.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.020
To this.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.380
Or from this.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.280
To this.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.600
And im going to show one more.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.360
This.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.360
To this.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.740
Since this process works on clear coat scratches, how do you know if your scratch is a clear coat scratch.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.380
Well it is actually pretty simple. One of the easiest ways is to just get some soapy water and spray it down.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.200
And if it disappears with soapy water then its a clear coat scratch

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560
Once it dries it will come back just like that.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.240
This happens because the scratch fills with water and the reflection matches the rest of the paint.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.800
Now with what I'm about to show you in this video you cant use it to fix deep scratches.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.600
Like this one. Right here.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.420
You can see, unlike the clear coat scratch, when you get this wet it doesn't disappear.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.820
So we know this is completely through the clear coat.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.480
Plus if you look closely.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.620
You can actually see the grey primer in the scratch.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.140
A scratch this deep you need to fill with paint and add your own clear coat on top, but that's for another video.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.080
So this method wont work on deep scratches like that.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.160
But that's ok because with this car

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.800
we have plenty of scratches all over the body that we could fix. Like that one

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.200
We have this one right here

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.660
We have another one out in the front right here.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.380
And now that you guys know all about scratches

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.960
I'm going to show you the five simple steps on how to remove a scratch.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.200
And to show you how well this process works and how confident I am in this fix

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm going to create my own scratch

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.320
So if your a car guy I suggest you look away.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.880
And this is a pretty deep scratch. Its like a worst case scenario so if we could get this out you could get the scratches out on your vehicle.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.340
So lets begin.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.140
Alright step one. We wanna get our soapy water and we wanna get a clean microfiber towel

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.480
If your microfiber towel still has a tag on it, make sure your rip that tag off.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.040
Because this tag could actually scratch the paint and we are trying to remove scratches not create scratches.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.100
Now we wanna clean the area that we are working on with soapy water to remove all the dirt and debris

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.640
So we aren't rubbing that dirt into the paint and causing more scratches.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.080
This is also a good time to check to see if your scratch disappears to verify that it is a clear coat scratch.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.700
And in this case it does so we are good.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.140
Next we are going to mask off our scratch.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.300
And place the tape about a half of inch on each side because its gonna be hard to see the scratch once we start fixing it.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.780
And now I'm just ripping off the ends of the tape

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.260
So that the end of the scratch is at the end of the tape on this side and on that side

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.420
Now we know exactly were the scratch is.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.300
So we have a nice area to work on.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.420
One thing to note is that we are going to move the tape up and down to create a bigger area for each step.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.080
So we are going to work the first step in this area.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.760
And the next step we are going to get it bigger and bigger

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.240
So that we are feathering in all our work so the paint blends nice and smooth

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.140
So its not like there is a strong tape line here or anything.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.100
It will be blended in nicely and you'll see what I'm talking about in a second.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.740
The next step is to sand the scratch down

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.520
If the scratch is deep and it catches your fingernail

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.940
Then you should start with the 3000 grit

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.820
But if the scratch isn't that deep and it really doesn't grab your fingernail that much you can skip right to the 5000 grit.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.640
But I know our scratch is pretty deep. I can feel it with my fingernail so we are going to start with our 3000 grit

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.360
And what we are going to do is we wanna sand perpendicular to the scratch.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.340
So the scratch is going this way. We wanna sand up and down

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.340
So against the grain of the scratch

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.760
Now a really helpful tip when sanding

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.140
Grab a kitchen sponge

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.360
and wrap the sponge with your sandpaper.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.160
This will prevent uneven pressure when pushing down with your sandpaper.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.040
If you are just your fingers

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.820
you are going to have a pressure point where each of your fingers is at

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.200
when we use a sponge

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.460
that pressure is distributed across the whole sponge

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.880
so the pressure on the sandpaper will be a lot more even

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.180
and your sanding job will come out a lot better.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.760
Alright now you just need to spray down the area

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.540
don't be afraid to get it soaking wet. Also spray down your sand paper.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.460
And now we are going to start sanding along this whole line

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.140
perpendicular to this whole scratch

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.320
so with this 3000 grit you want to push down with medium pressure

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.200
Every manufacture uses a different clearcoat some clear coats are harder than others.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.480
In general, I like to sand the scratch for about 15 seconds.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.200
And then check to see if your scratch is still there by wiping down the area with your towel

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.220
Here you can still see the scratch so when you continue to sanding until the scratch is almost gone

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.020
So get your surface wet again and keep sanding.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.820
And every once and a while stop, wipe the area

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.800
and check to see if your scratch is still there.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.100
If it is gone you are done with the 3000 grit

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.580
If it is still there continue working until it is gone.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.560
This may take a few tries but be patient you don't want to burn through that clear coat.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.760
Now I need a little bit more pressures so going to remove the sponge and use the spongy-ness of the sandpaper

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.760
Since this is a really deep scratch

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.480
And for those whole don't know the higher the grit number, the finer and less abrasive the sandpaper

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.220
So 3000 grit is more coarse than 5000 grit.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.000
And you can see I need to work on this area right here but if you look right here

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.940
But if you look over here, most of that scratch is gone.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.660
so im just going to focus right here

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.660
Alright, that looks great

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.480
I can not see the scratch anymore

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.580
and that is exactly what we want

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.540
but now we have this haze right here so lets move our tape up

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.620
and down about another inch or two

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.200
and what we want to do is get our 5000 grit sandpaper and work in this area

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.780
but also go up a little bit out into this area to feather in that work

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.940
and I just want to make it clear. The goal is to make this tight because you don't want to

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.300
on this whole body panel

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.320
and sand down this whole body panel

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.500
Two reasons. One you want to make the job easier for yourself. Smaller area, less work

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
Two. Once you take clear coat off, you cant put it back on

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.080
so we only want to remove clear coat in a little area

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.320
Ok, so we are done with our 3000 grit

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.280
Now we are going to move up to our 5000 grit.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.340
Make sure you use the sponge again and spray lots of soapy water

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.460
And spray the sandpaper too.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.160
Now we are following the same exact process as with our 3000 grit

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.260
except now with the 5000 grit we are going in circular motion

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.680
to cut down the scratches in all directions

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.100
Plus we are moving up outside the area that we just worked in

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.880
to blend in the scratches into the surrounding paint

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.800
Now lets spray down the area and clean it off to inspect our work.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.620
And this is coming out beautifully. We can take the tape off

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.660
because now we can see the area that we are working in

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.220
and the scratch is completely gone

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.120
there is no mark at all where that scratch used to be

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.020
I cant see anything.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.240
Prefect!

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.160
So now we have this area right here.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.180
That we need to polish so it looks like the rest of our paint, nice and shinny

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.760
so lets move to the next step

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.360
If your scratch is still there

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.460
keep going with the 5000 grit until you don't see the scratch anymore

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.260
At this point

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.100
you don't want to see any scratch

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.560
If you see any of the scratch

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.740
You're going to be able to see it when you're done so make sure you remove it completely

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.920
Alright! We are on our fourth step

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.880
We are almost done.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.780
In this step we want to use a really fine polish.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.000
If the polish says it will remove fine scratches and swirl-marks

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.720
That means you can use it.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.580
polish has grit in it so think of this between 5,000 and 10,000 grit

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.960
Before we polish, clean the surface to remove all of the dirt.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.900
Make sure it is clean because we don't want to rub any of the dirt into the paint

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.280
and create new scratches.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.220
And now we want to get a clean part of our microfiber towel that we have not used yet

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.640
and put our polish right on the towel

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.680
Now you just rub this polish in, in a circle motion

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.320
We want to focus our polishing in this hazy area

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.380
but we also want to feather it out into the surrounding paint.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.280
You want a medium to heavy pressure on that microfiber towel because this is a really fine polish.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.820
So more pressure then when you were using your sandpaper.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.780
Now you could still see a slight haze here

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.820
so we are going to do one more coat of polish.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.080
When polishing, you want to attach the scratches at all angles.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.720
so polish in a circular motion

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.000
and work that polish in there good.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.980
Now you want to get a clean part on your microfiber towel.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.320
And just lightly buff the surface to remove any of the polish.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.840
HOOOLLLYYY SMOKES look at this.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.860
Now THAT is a reflection

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.240
That is looking good, I cant see where that scratch was at all.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.420
That hazy spot is completely gone

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.780
And now there is one last step

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.780
and that is to grab your paste wax.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.740
I suggest using a paste wax because it works better than a liquid wax in this situation.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.300
And this is going to be step five where we put down our protective layer.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:32.100
Not only does the wax fill in any microscopic scratches, it also protects your clear coat. So this is a super important step.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.360
And this is as simple as wax on

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.100
Then give it a minute to haze up

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.460
And wax off

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.960
JUST. LIKE. THAT.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:48.520
And check it out, this is looking great. I do not see the scratch at all, it was right about here. And if we look here. You can see anything

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.360
That scratch is completely gone the only thing you can see is this gorgeous reflection right here.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.460
This paint work is looking real good.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.240
And the best part about this is. The scratch is gone but you at home could do this.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.840
I didn't use any special tools or anything.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.580
It is water, sandpaper, polish, wax. That simple.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.340
And then you get results like this!

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.780
And if this doesn't motivate you then I don't know what will.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.100
Check out this before.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.420
And after.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.720
Scratches happen no matter how hard you try to avoid them

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.660
and now there is no reason to get upset

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.580
because now you know how to remove them. Hopefully this video was helpful

And as always the products and tools I used in this video

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.760
are linked in the description so you can easily find them

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.100
And the top tip for this video is

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.120
you can see here where I completely sanded through the clear coat.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.320
so you wanna make sure if your scratch is too deep

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.780
you don't want to sand too far.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.600
So even if the scratch is still there your might have to stop.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.460
Otherwise you'll burn right through the clear coat just like this.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.360
And then you'll have to spray clear coat over here and sand it down

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.280
and feather it in and all that extra work

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.080
so just be mindful with your clearcoat

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.880
because too much sanding will do that.
