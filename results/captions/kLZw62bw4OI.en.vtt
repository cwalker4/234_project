00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:06.860
Welcome to the DietDoctor podcast.
I'm your host Dr. Bret Scher.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.939
Today it's my pleasure to be joined
by Ivor Cummins, fatemperor.com,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.859
and Denver's Diet Doctor
Dr. Jeffry Gerber.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.019
They are the authors of this fantastic book,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.539
"Eat Rich, Live Long, the power of low-carb
and keto for weight loss and great health."

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.859
And the two of them are a fantastic team,
I really enjoyed talking to them.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.100
We talk about coronary calcium scores,
we talk about the benefits of a low-carb diet,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
how it works, why it works

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.539
and how it's sort of one piece of the puzzle
for solving health problems.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.780
It's a nice overview

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.820
with some very good practical takeaways
that you can walk away with

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.979
and see how can I improve my life now.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.259
So I hope you enjoy this episode.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:51.299
If you want to learn more
you can look at us at DietDoctor.com

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.939

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:56.299
Now stay tuned,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.335
I hope you'll enjoy this interview
with Dr. Jeffry Gerber and Ivor Cummins.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.780
Dr. Jeffry Gerber and Ivor Cummins,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.700
thank you so much for joining me
on the DietDoctor podcast today.

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:10.459
Great to be here, Bret.

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:11.505
Thanks, Bret.

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.060
The first thing I want to talk to you about
is I learned from you guys

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.387
you have to be very careful
who you choose to write a book with.

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:21.099
Because then you're sort of stuck
with that person, right?

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.459
You guys are doing so much together,
probably so many joint interviews,

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.459
you are scheduled to talk together
at the conference today

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.060
and now we even have you
sharing one microphone.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.579
So maybe I want to ask you
if you're happy with your choice,

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.312
but I don't know if we want
to talk about that right away,

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.500
so instead talk to me a little bit

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.579
about of  what led up to your book

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.739
"Eat Rich, Live Long, the power of low-carb
and keto for weight loss and great health".

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.283
Give me a little bit of the background.

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.620
What inspired you to write this book
and what led to it?

00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:55.180
Well, Jeff your history with low-carb
goes back a lot longer,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.099
so maybe give your history first?

00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:01.579
Yes, Brett, it actually ties
into your original question.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.420
So I've been interested in nutrition
for over 20 years.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.659
As you know, I am a family physician
having done this for now 30 years almost

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.379
and about 20 years ago I started
to teach myself about nutrition

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.699
after patients had approached me,
family members approached me,

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.740
I had some experience with losing
40 pounds on my own

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.401
and just realized we didn't learn much
about nutrition in medical school.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:41.019
You know we maybe had two hours or less
and so like all of us we taught ourselves.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.539
And so it was about four or five years ago
that I had met Ivor.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.340
I had a particular interest not only
in nutrition but cardiovascular disease.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.939
And I always joke if it wasn't for cholesterol
we'd probably all be on a low-carb diet.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.860
So at any rate,
four years and a half years ago

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.259
this chemical engineer out of nowhere puts
up this video, "The cholesterol conundrum"

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:14.419
and I immediately contacted this guy
and I realized how connected we were

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:20.740
that the engineer from one walk of life
and the doctor from the other walk of life,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.020
our paths crossed at this opportune time

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.539
and realizing that we were both focused
on diet and cardiovascular risk

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.379
and I had said back then to Ivor,

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:41.340
we had done a little private video Skype

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.620
and I said to the guy,
"I think we need to collaborate".

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.300
And you know he said,
"What's the happening?"

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.699
and then he said to his wife,
"Who is this crazy doctor from Colorado

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.060
that wants to collaborate?"

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.593
And so essentially
this is what it's turned into.

00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:59.418
That's fantastic.

00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:01.900
And the genesis
of the cholesterol conundrum

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.580
was around 2012 I got
some very poor blood tests.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.500
I won't go into details, but multiple doctors
I consulted couldn't really explain

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500
the two key things about any challenge.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.819
You know, what's the implication
for mortality/morbidity

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.459
and what are the root causes
that would drive those blood metrics.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.259
And basically not getting any answers
I began to research intensively on...

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.179
within weeks I was
on carbohydrate metabolism as the cause.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.620
Yeah, we see it time and time again,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.779
someone has this personal experience
that sends them on this is path of discovery

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.220
and they end up with a low-carb diet

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
as being such a powerful treatment
for what they're looking for

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.660
and yet we were taught nothing of that.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.660
We were taught nothing of that
in medical school and residency,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.139
so I'm amazed that you
had been practicing this way

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.742
for more than a decade.

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:56.339
And at that time these conferences

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.699
like Low-Carb USA or Low-Carb Breckinridge
didn't exist.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.779
So how do you feel now when you come
to a conference like this

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.540
and they ask you or ask the crowd,
"How many people are physicians?"

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.339
and so many hands go up?

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.379
I mean you must feel
a little bit of pride in that.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.579
Yeah, when I first got involved with it
in the year 2000 I was on my own.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.500
And interestingly it wasn't
until I think 2005.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.220
Still on my own I had done my own research,
reading medical journals,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.459
fascinated with the metabolic syndrome,
understanding how that was a root cause,

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:36.540
but in 2005 the first person I reached out to
on social media was Jackie Eberstein,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.772
who was the nurse of Dr. Atkins.

00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:41.966
And my hands were shaking,

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.939
I somehow found her website, 
found her email

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.459
and I thought that this person
would never reply.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:53.220
And she replied right back
and she was lovely, she was warm,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.500
she answered all my questions,
so that was kind of the beginning.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.339
And, you know, the Internet social media
was nothing back then,

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.500
but slowly but surely it grew.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.060
I connected with Jimmy Moore
and we really have to give him credit,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.620
because if it wasn't for him,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.220
I really don't think this community would be
as connected as we are.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.699
So to his credit as well I became a member
of an obesity Society.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.100
And it was funny back then,
there were a lot of physicians

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.660
and myself and Dr. Eric Westman
would walk around the room

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.779
and real quietly say to the other doctor,
"I'm low-carb. Are you low-carb, doctor?"

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.514
And you had to really like...

00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:44.097
Keep it on the down low.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:48.100
Keep it on the down low
and slowly but surely it's grown,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.019
Dr. Westman became the president
of the society

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:58.139
and that's really helped to make, I think,
physicians aware

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.139
and, you know, we've just watched
this blossom ever since.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:10.019
And Ivor and I both attended the summit
in Cape Town South Africa from Tim Noakes.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:12.740
This was back in 2015.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.259
And we thought it would be a great idea
to bring conferences to the United States.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.459
So with my co-organizer Rod Taylor
we have conferences in Colorado,

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:27.100
we have one coming up next year in 2019
in March in Denver,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.660
and like you said it is just rewarding

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.459
to see healthcare professionals
attending these things,

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:38.386
because honestly they are the guys,

00:07:38.387 --> 00:07:41.459
they're the gatekeepers 
that need to learn this first.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:44.500
But we also love having the general public

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.540
and these events that we're at today
really helped to bring everybody together

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.543
and advance nutritional science.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:55.259
Yeah, that's so true and it seems
like the doctors are catching on,

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.259
but Ivor engineers are leading the way
and that's the fascinating part.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:04.139
And what I really like about most engineers,
I can't group you all into one,

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:07.620
but in general the problem-solving skills

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.300
in the way of thinking things
as problem solvers

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.060
is unique to the world of medicine
unfortunately,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.100
but that's sort of what we need
and you talk a lot about the Pareto principle

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.620
and you talk about
sort of problem-solving metrics.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.699
So give us a little overview of how you think
your approach to problems differ

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:28.379
than the average physicians approach
to health problems.

00:08:28.453 --> 00:08:29.779
Right, Bret.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:33.460
Well, essentially we use a lot of tools,
systematic tools.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.340
So there is the Pareto principle,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.860
which is a rack and stack of the most
important factors based on the evidence

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.220
and that's really important.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.419
Those comparative analysis,
a tool called Kepner Tragoe,

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:50.539
where you prosecute all of the distinctions
between what the problem is and is not

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:53.059
and then you record the inferences.

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:55.500
So it's kind of like
a little epidemiological.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.383
It's looking at all the differences
and what might cause them

00:08:58.384 --> 00:09:02.139
and that can become a very long list.

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:06.419
And then there's hypothesis for
against charts,

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:10.299
where you look at many hypothesis
for a single problem.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:13.100
And we split up many, many hypothesis

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.419
and they are constantly judged
against each other

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:20.139
based on the evidence
for each individual one and against.

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:23.299
And there's never any clarity early
in a complex problem,

00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:25.299
especially a multifactor.

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:28.585
So you have many, many hypotheses
and they are pitched against each other.

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:31.220
And that's
an enormously important discipline,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.740
which doesn't really happen in medicine.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.379
Usually a hypothesis gains ground,
becomes established,

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:41.860
the orthodoxy get behind it
and it kind of transcends into dogma.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.139
So there's a huge difference.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:49.740
And then statistical inference and
design of experiments to test hypotheses

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.019
is an automatic part of our life.

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:58.419
An autopsy, so intense autopsy
with electron microscopes and other tools

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:02.340
to dig in and scrutinize the problem
at a physical level.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.974
And again you don't have
so much of that medicine.

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:07.419
When I hear you go
through this checklist

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.820
and then I think in my mind
how we write guidelines in medicine

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.019
and they're so polar opposite.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.860
I mean the guidelines are...
you get a group of people together

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.940
that do a sort of a cursory evaluation
of the evidence,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.379
they come up
with their best case scenario

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:23.460
and their opinions
of what the guidelines should be.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.940
That is a far cry
from what you just described.

00:10:26.028 --> 00:10:29.299
And one crucial thing I'll just add,
there are many more tools,

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:32.779
but also the experience
of decades of using these tools...

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:38.059
you less and less make mistakes or jump
to conclusions through sheer experience.

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:41.179
But a crucial one is to always look
for black swans,

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:45.202
for contradictory evidence
against your hypothesis.

00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:50.500
So that's an enormous part of the time
to resolution and success in engineering

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.539
is you look for negative data
that conflicts with your hypothesis

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:57.779
and you rapidly kill incorrect hypotheses

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:01.899
or you rewrite them
to accommodate the conflicting data.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:04.139
And that's just so central

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:09.340
but I must say in nutritional medicine
that's the most extraordinary difference.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.460
Confirmatory data is always looked for

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.179
to build up more and more evidence
to support a hypothesis,

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:21.580
whereas one or two conflicting pieces
of data could reset the whole team

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.019
and get you back on the correct path
doesn't happen.

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:32.620
So we do have criteria in medicine
that prove or disprove hypotheses.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.820
And that's the Bradford Hill criteria,
but we've set the bar so low

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.860
that we don't look at it
like a scientist or an engineer looks at it.

00:11:41.957 --> 00:11:46.100
Right and I wonder how many doctors
are even aware of the Bradford Hill criteria.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.419
And when you're interpreting
an observational study

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:54.299
that shows a relative risk of 1.18
and that makes it as causative,

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:57.412
which, you know, that doesn't even scratch
the Bradford Hill criteria,

00:11:57.413 --> 00:12:03.179
I think it's just an underused tool for sure.

00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:07.059
And actually another example
of Bradford Hill that just springs to mind,

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:10.340
there has to be directionality
of dose-response.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:17.299
So cause X supposedly driving Y,
as X increases, why should increase?

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:21.019
But we have many examples including
cholesterol and other things,

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:24.299
whether is not a dose-response.

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:27.700
Yes so Bradford Hill is excellent actually
in principle,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.319
but it's utilization is almost zero
from what I've seen.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.700
Let's get into some of the specifics.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.019
So you talked
about the dose-response, Ivor.

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:38.379
And you spoke about that
in your talk yesterday,

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.700
specifically about coronary calcium score.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.980
So I know you're a big proponent
of the coronary calcium score.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.139
And one of the things you said was
there are 17 studies I think you quoted

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:53.220
where LDL does not correlate
with the degree of coronary calcium score.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.940
Yeah, actually there's a 2009 paper
and a book publication I think in 15,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.340
can't recall the author,
but I think it's closer to 20

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.460
and even includes familial
hypercholesterolemia studies.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.419
And across the board
with one exception in 19 studies,

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:16.580
there's a very slight correlation between
prospective LDL and coronary calcium.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.539
Now coronary calcium is far and away

00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:23.940
the best metric of atherosclerosis extent
and future risk.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.179
It beats all the risk factors together.

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:28.820
And it's because it sees
the actual disease process,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.460
the calcification
that's the response to injury

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.179
for this inflammatory vascular disease.

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:39.740
But it is interesting there's almost
no correlation with cholesterol metrics.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.336
Interest needed do highlight
that insulin pops up several times,

00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:45.419
but not cholesterol.

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:48.700
So I think to engineers
working on cholesterol,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.379
that and myriads other kind of negative
pieces of evidence

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:57.460
would've caused us to totally retool
the cholesterol hypothesis

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.620
very early in the prosecution
of the problem-solving effort.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.820
And we have 50 years now

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.740
where the negative evidence
is essentially almost suppressed,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.139
but certainly ignored.

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:12.585
So it's interesting...

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:19.899
mainstream, half of the cardiologists think
that the calcium score has a benefit,

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:21.940
half of them don't,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.340
but it's interesting when you look
at guidelines,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:32.779
they try to tack on calcium score
with your AHA risk markers,

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:37.059
and what we're suggesting is that that's not
the right way to use the tools

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:43.019
that use... just simply look at calcium
score by itself, independent of cholesterol

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:48.899
and what I can add is just clinically
we see that LDL cholesterol LDL-P

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:51.019
is all over the board

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:54.580
and it doesn't correlate
with the calcium score.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.860
And this is especially...

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.179
so we see lots of patients
who have been doing low-carb paleo diets

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:03.340
and I had many over years

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.620
where there are these cholesterol
hyperresponders

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.500
where they tend to high LDL-C,
high LDL P

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.700
and many of them
have calcium scores of zero,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.580
a perfect score of zero,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.500
which gives you a 15 year warranty.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.899
Let's talk about that 15 year warranty
for a second, because I have to be honest,

00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:25.620
I have a little bit of trouble
with that term,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.419
because it almost implies the risk is zero.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:32.820
So I think we have to admit
if you have a calcium score of zero,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.059
your risk of a cardiac event
in the next 10 years is not zero.

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:41.031
It's very low, it's between 1% and 2%,
but it's not zero.

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:44.260
So I think that's important
to sort of clarifying the warranty.

00:15:44.353 --> 00:15:46.700
It's really important to clarify

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.740
and anyone that infers from the word
warranty it's zero is mistaking obviously.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.340
And the warranty I think
there were two papers

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.659
were warranty was used
in the title of the publication

00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:00.059
and it probably is unfortunate.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:03.659
So one of the largest study showed
just from memory

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:10.539
that zero scoring middle-age people I think
12 years later at 99.6% were still alive.

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:16.019
And high-scoring people 75.6
were still alive.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:19.539
Now that's an enormous difference
in mortality.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:22.259
So although enormous, there's no zero,

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:25.820
and I think Jeff you probably agree
that if you're zero calcium,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.899
there are exceptions.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:32.500
On one end there are people with zero who
have rapid progression of atherosclerosis

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.100
and a soft plaque does rupture

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.860
before there's significant calcification
to show up in the scan.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.860
I mean later you could look
and probably find diffuse calcification,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.940
but not enough to register.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.980
Interestingly on the other end of the scale
there's a small maybe 1% of people

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.860
who have huge calcification
and who don't seem to have events

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.179
and they appear to be the people
where the protective effect of calcification,

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:02.980
which is to protect the arteries
when they're inflamed,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.380
is so advanced and rapidly progressing

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.220
that they actually end up with massive
calcification but relatively stable arteries,

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.740
they almost have a full metal jacket.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.195
So I think those two corner cases
around 1% at each end

00:17:17.196 --> 00:17:22.660
illustrate the protective nature of calcium,
it's a fantastic evolutionary process,

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.619
it's actually bone matrix,
it's identical to bone matrix formation,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:31.740
but of course people rapidly progressing
may have their event

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.299
before the calcification establishes.

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:38.180
So around 1% events
in the following 10 years

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:45.059
for zero versus in your recent paper, Jeff,
around 37% for high scores close to 1,000.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:49.099
People just need to see
it's not 100% perfect.

00:17:49.209 --> 00:17:53.900
And that's a great point to bring up though
because I think we can fall into a trap

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.380
of being sort of overly reassured
with a score of zero.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.859
It's not, "Your score is zero, see you later,
you don't have to worry about anything."

00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:05.140
It's, "Your score is zero,
but now you're on our radar screen

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.572
to follow again to make sure
there's no progression."

00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:14.660
So one other point is criticism of the test
is that it doesn't visualize soft plaque.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:21.740
And when you look at the data first of all,
so when your score goes from zero to 1,000,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.940
this is independent of whether you see
soft plaque or not.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.940
If you have a zero score you still have
a small chance of having an event.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.140
Now the question is
if you can visualize soft plaque,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.619
would that change
your ability to predict risk

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:42.180
for these people that have
a low calcium score?

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.420
So you can do a CTMR,
you could do a CT angiogram

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.539
and then you get to see the soft plaque.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:55.859
But in our experience it doesn't change
the data

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:58.731
looking at a CT calcium by itself.

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:01.740
So Jeff, what do you think about
the carotid intima media thickness

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.700
as a surrogate for that?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.740
Obviously again we're not talking

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.339
about the specific site
we're concerned about

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:10.619
and we're not even talking
about plaque so much.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:13.059
It's just the thickness of the intima
of the carotid artery,

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:16.819
but something you can measure quickly
without radiation

00:19:16.819 --> 00:19:19.875
that might be a decent surrogate marker
for the soft plaque as well.

00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:23.740
Yeah, so again you describe
that nice...

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.819
Well, the intima is just the lining
of the wall of the artery

00:19:28.819 --> 00:19:33.220
and so I don't know
who created the technology,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.539
but what he tried to do
was to age the blood vessel

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:41.259
based on the thickness of the intima.

00:19:41.259 --> 00:19:49.180
And on literature review it really does not
correlate with events and mortality.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.660
So it's interesting, in our office
we actually do the CIMT,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.779
because it comes along
with a limited Doppler.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:01.460
So the limited Doppler, we're actually
looking for plaque buildup

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.740
within the lumen itself.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.859
And that perhaps is a surrogate test
for say a coronary calcium score.

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:11.380
It's not quantifiable
quite like a coronary calcium score.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.099
The idea is if you could image
all the blood vessels in the body

00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:17.900
and look at the plaque burden,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.220
that would give you a great idea
about overall risk.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.420
But we do like the calcium score,

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.259
because it's looking
at those tiny little coronary arteries

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:29.940
that, you know, you are at risk
for heart attack and stroke.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.259
So CIMT doesn't really correlate.

00:20:33.355 --> 00:20:37.819
I'd like to see the rate of change study
sort of like with the coronary calcium score

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:43.500
that has a fast change or slow change,
same for CIMT, and correlate that.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.923
I don't know if the rate of change studies
have been done quite as well.

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:49.099
No not really.

00:20:49.099 --> 00:20:55.579
In fact there's not much really linking CIMT
impressively to future risk prediction.

00:20:55.579 --> 00:20:58.660
I mean it's a useful tool
to quantify and track,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.579
but it's just very weak
compared to calcium.

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:04.660
Because as you say it's surrogate
in different vessel,

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.980
there is operator variation, quite large,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:12.019
they have to pick the region, you know,
with to mouse clicks.

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:16.980
And you can't have people who have
quite a large intimal thickening,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.779
but really have very stable arteries
with no real vulnerable plaque

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:24.299
and vice versa.

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:26.779
It's just the calcium is vastly better.

00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:29.380
You did mention an interesting point,
the radiation,

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.660
and I researched that myself
out of interest because I often hear this,

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.819
but machines nowadays are around 1 mSv,

00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:38.619
which is around the same
as a bilateral mammogram.

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:41.380
And if you look back at research
in the past decades,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.779
Chernobyl and even Hiroshima
and the nuclear accident in Brazil,

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:49.220
the biggest civilian nuclear accident,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.339
they tracked the people who had
much, much higher exposures than this.

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:56.259
I mean much higher.

00:21:56.259 --> 00:22:00.140
And generally over decades
no signal between them and controls.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.299
So I think the expert Douglas Boyd
who invented the calcium scanner,

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:06.420
I interviewed him the other day,

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.660
he said that that risk is maybe one in 10,000
of some possibility,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.259
it's theoretical for 41 mSv, it's tiny

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:20.180
and it really is a distraction
from the topic of how powerful the scan is.

00:22:20.527 --> 00:22:24.619
Yeah, that's a great point about
how we interpret the risk of radiation,

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:29.740
because in medicine there's this concept
of ALARA, as low as reasonably acceptable,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:35.059
and it almost teaches us
to think of it as a way...

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:38.180
it doesn't matters
how high the radiation exposure is.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.900
What matters is how much is the test
going to contribute to the care.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.500
And is it worth it
for any amount of radiation exposure?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:51.120
Certainly a one-time calcium score
or following every five years or so.

00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:54.900
Where I get a little concerned is if someone
wants to follow a calcium score

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.099
every six months or everyone year,

00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:01.420
because we don't have data to say that
short-term of a progression on happens

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.980
or what it means,
but more of the longer term following.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.019
Would you agree with that statement?

00:23:07.107 --> 00:23:08.299
Yeah.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:12.220
So interestingly I've been working
with my hospital next-door,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:18.019
that they've had a 64 slice GE machine
for quite some time, GE Optima,

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:23.220
and last year they purchased
the cardiac package.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.420
And I've been bugging them right next door,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.619
I said, "Hey, we got to get this thing set up
for calcium scans."

00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:32.420
And I've learned a lot because I've sat
in there with their radiologist,

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.380
the radiology technician over lunch,

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.220
we just sit down and just... 
fascinating stuff.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:44.299
And first of all there's much less
user input error

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.460
when you do this calcium score.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.619
You know, they calibrate the machine

00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:52.220
and the machine does the calculation
to measure the calcium.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.380
And I actually have been looking
at the studies.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:03.099
So the radiating dosage,
so the effective radiation dosage...

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:10.980
So the device puts out a certain amount
of radiation, so it'll measure in DLP units,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.900
and I think our machine is about 165 DLP.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.819
So that is what the machine puts out

00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:22.859
and then you have to do a fudge factor
calculation for the effective dosage.

00:24:22.859 --> 00:24:27.059
So there's a chest factor.

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:31.779
And when we do the calculation,
our calcium score is...

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:34.953
the millisieverts is about 1.2.

00:24:34.954 --> 00:24:38.460
And so you know I'm watching that
really carefully

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.299
and there's things that the technicians
can do so they can make a smaller window

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:48.500
and the idea 
is that really is a small dosage.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.660
And if you have a zero score you could
probably say that you don't need any more,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.700
but it is okay to track...
you can track every 3 to 5 years,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.980
maybe sooner if people are concerned.

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:05.539
Yeah, especially if someone's changed
their lifestyle significantly

00:25:05.539 --> 00:25:08.019
and you want to see what impact that has.

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:11.500
So yeah, I think that's a pretty good
summary of calcium score.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.875
Let's transition to a second about...
transition to weight loss.

00:25:16.876 --> 00:25:20.259
Jeff, you talked about weight loss
in your talk today

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:25.140
and what is so interesting
is a lot of people come to a low-carb diet

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.980
for the purpose of weight loss.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.739
But would you say weight loss
is the most important metric to follow?

00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:31.900
No, not at all.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.140
So again as I mentioned earlier,

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.940
my understanding of cardiovascular disease
led me to the metabolic syndrome.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.700
And so I think why we're here
as engineers and doctors

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.980
is we're trying to understand how do treat
and prevent chronic disease.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.932
And weight loss is just kind
of a consequence of doing all this.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:59.140
And so, Ivor, when we talk about
the mechanisms of weight loss

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.420
or the mechanisms
of improving metabolic health,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.980
there's the debate
of the calories in calories out

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.579
versus the carbohydrate insulin model

00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:11.998
or some combination thereof
when you factor in psychological factors...

00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:17.205
How do you break down and say what is
the reason why a low-carb diet works?

00:26:18.114 --> 00:26:21.099
Yeah, that's 
the million-dollar question.

00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:23.099
So I will take a shot at it.

00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:27.380
I think that calories... there is a place
for calories, there's no question.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:33.460
It's not like the CI-CO,
that is simply eat less, move more,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.259
because the body is
far more complex than that,

00:26:36.259 --> 00:26:39.220
with myriad hormonal control
feedback loops.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.420
So I think the primary benefit
of a low-carb diet

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.460
actually is appetite control
and management.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.874
It's a really big factor.

00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:52.420
So when I went on a low-carb diet,
and I'm not speaking N=1,

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.380
but it's seen in studies
and all over the place,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:01.460
ad lib. low-carb diets have beaten
calorie controlled low-fat diets.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.420
And we see again and again that when you
switch over from a glucose based metabolism

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.660
to a more fat burning metabolism,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.660
appetite comes under your control.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.579
In my case it was striking.

00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:14.819
I was actually shocked within weeks

00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:19.424
of how I could blithely not have to eat
when I didn't want to.

00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:22.142
So I think that's one of the big factors.

00:27:22.143 --> 00:27:26.019
Now when your insulin is high
and you are hyperinsulinemic,

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:29.660
like probably the majority
of American adults today,

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.059
that will tend towards trapping fat

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.339
and tend against the burning
of your body fat, so that is another factor.

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.900
But I would say appetite control
is the central linchpin

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.940
with the metabolic advantage
that's being discussed

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:50.539
and the lowering of insulin
being another strong element,

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:53.417
but it's not fully quantified,
I think that's fair to say.

00:27:53.418 --> 00:27:55.819
What would you say, Jeff?

00:27:55.915 --> 00:28:00.380
Yes, so there's a lot of factor to consider
that it's not necessarily all insulin.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:08.099
There's many hormones and signals
such as leptin, the gut incretins,

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:13.579
we have to all consider that when
we are thinking about regulating appetite,

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:20.019
but of course insulin is probably
the master hormone involved.

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:27.859
And when you consider that perhaps
two thirds of the US population adults

00:28:27.859 --> 00:28:31.539
over age 45 are currently diabetic
and prediabetic

00:28:31.539 --> 00:28:37.700
that when you treat them
with carbohydrate restriction,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.740
you're going to have most success.

00:28:39.957 --> 00:28:42.819
And I think that's a very good answer

00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:46.579
because we like to simplify things
and almost to a fault,

00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:49.019
because we want to know,
"Is it the calories in, calories out?

00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:50.940
Is it the carbohydrate insulin?"

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.420
And the truth is
it's far more complex than that.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.099
That's basically how I would summarize
your answer, so I thank you for that.

00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:59.259
The next question though Jeff is

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:01.859
I'm sure you see these patients
all the time in your office

00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:04.460
that they come in with a stall.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.660
And you can define the stall
on different ways,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.108
but basically whatever metric
they are following,

00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:12.460
whether it's their weight loss,
whether it's their insulin sensitivity,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.900
it just plateaus and they get frustrated.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.660
What kind of advice can you give to people
about your general approach?

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.140
When you see a stall
what do you think about...

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.299
what are your sort of go to top two
or three things to ask them to do?

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.339
Right, so if you're insulin resistant
you just respond rapidly,

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:37.500
your appetite is controlled,
you correct insulin resistance

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.259
and the fat that is trapped in a damper
behind insulin...

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:47.980
it opens these insulin floodgates
and energy just pours out from fat tissue.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.700
But what often happens

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.299
and I mean I'm just thinking
of a patient I saw last week...

00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:58.460
they never lost weight
from the beginning

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.259
even though they were
markedly insulin resistant

00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:04.180
when we measured all the parameters.

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:10.539
This particular person was told by a trainer,

00:30:10.539 --> 00:30:15.099
"You have to eat 180 g of fat a day.

00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:18.140
No matter if you're hungry or not hungry."

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.579
And she was heeding the advice
and pumping in the fat.

00:30:22.579 --> 00:30:24.740
And nothing happened.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.259
I mean that's just an extreme example,

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:33.460
but the point is that what you are eating
at the beginning

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.019
is not going to be the same
when you hit this plateau.

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:39.940
And so guess what?

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.779
Controlling appetite
becomes most important.

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:47.380
This is what I think about, the quantity
of food that you consume,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.779
the calories the activity
and then it trickles downhill.

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:56.019
But we have to make people understand

00:30:56.019 --> 00:31:02.097
that the quantity of food is really important
once you become more insulin sensitive.

00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:03.859
Yeah, very good point.

00:31:03.859 --> 00:31:06.339
And now to tag onto that a little bit more,

00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:09.220
to go a little bit deeper
into the specifics of the diet...

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.500
Ivor, this one's for you
as a good Irishman...

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.539
How does alcohol fit into the low-carb diet
and the low-carb lifestyle?

00:31:15.651 --> 00:31:18.140
Rather well.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:24.299
No, actually alcohol, I think a glass or two
of red wine a day is fine.

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:27.539
You know, the beers are generally carby.

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:30.299
I've heard beer described as liquid bread,
which is a pretty good.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.900
A good description.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.940
Yeah so I think generally alcohol...

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.619
interestingly there are studies done
in the 60s on humans

00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:44.539
and calorie controlled, calorie for calorie
alcohol replacing carbohydrate

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:47.700
led to a slight drop in weight.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.460
And then replacing carbohydrate back in
instead of alcohol iso-calorific

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.859
increased the weight again.

00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:57.940
So well alcohol is the fourth food group.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.299
So we know the protein
has the thermogenesis effect,

00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:07.619
so over 100 calories of protein you eat
maybe 75 will fully get into your system

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:13.500
and there'll be losses for heat and fat and
carbohydrate around 10% or 15% of losses.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:19.579
It appears alcohol as the fourth food group
has losses also because of its metabolism.

00:32:19.579 --> 00:32:21.859
But that's just an amusing aside.

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:25.819
I think the advice is, you know,
moderate alcohol,

00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:28.940
particularly something like dry red wine

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.220
is low in carbs, low in sugar
and it's a pleasurable social thing.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.299
But anyone who has any hint
of an overindulgence nature,

00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:41.420
you know, maybe it's best
to avoid alcohol altogether.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.740
And drinking excessively
will knock people out of ketosis

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.819
and will lead to many other issues

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:50.282
including their work performance
and other things also.

00:32:50.362 --> 00:32:52.779
I see it sort of the same way

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:55.700
as trying to decide
what's the mechanism of weight loss.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.779
Well, you also have to factor in

00:32:57.779 --> 00:32:59.900
the psychological components
of what you eat.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.059
So with alcohol how it affects your liver,
how it affects your ketone production,

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:06.460
but also the psychological aspects
of alcohol.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.059
Because let's be honest,

00:33:08.059 --> 00:33:11.019
we don't make the best decisions
once we've had a couple of drinks

00:33:11.019 --> 00:33:14.140
so we have to factor that in as well,
beyond the physiological effects.

00:33:14.244 --> 00:33:17.940
That's a really, really important point...
I wish I'd remembered to mention.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.700
Absolutely, when under the effects
of alcohol

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.740
that's often where you will do your cheats.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.700
You will recharge your hands,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.099
you will eat things you would never eat
without being slightly affected by alcohol.

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:34.220
So that indirect way
can certainly lead to failures.

00:33:34.407 --> 00:33:36.740
Let's talk about your book for a second.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.339
It's a fantastic book, very detailed
with great recipes,

00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:45.339
great scientific descriptions
of why this works and how this works

00:33:45.339 --> 00:33:47.870
and some very practical tips.

00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:50.900
Can you share with us
maybe one of the stories in this book

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.099
that really jumped out at you,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.329
that's a motivating story for you
and your patients?

00:33:56.436 --> 00:34:03.900
One particular female who was here
last year at the conference

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.619
had come in to see us...

00:34:05.619 --> 00:34:08.139
It's actually a typical story.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:13.619
She was... Actually I'd say it's not
a typical story, it's an atypical story...

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:19.019
So this patient had been going
to the diabetes Center in Denver

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:21.659
for many, many years

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:27.659
and her weight kept going up and up,
diabetes was out-of-control,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:31.900
taking more and more insulin.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:38.860
And it was her partner that had brought
to her attention the low-carb diet.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.940
So she was very frustrated at this point.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:49.340
And so on their own as a couple
they pursued low-carb diet.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:52.260
On their own, not recommended
by the Diabetes Center,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.539
not recommended by any physician.

00:34:54.616 --> 00:34:56.619
Absolutely on their own.

00:34:56.619 --> 00:35:01.739
And by the time they had come to see me
she was already losing some weight.

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:10.219
And to make the long story short,
her A1c was in the range of 12 to 13.

00:35:10.296 --> 00:35:11.737
Wow, that's high!

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:18.340
She got off insulin,
she got off all medication and presently...

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.860
And it was funny because
as we were writing the book,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.659
she kept losing more and more weight
so we had to update...

00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:26.860
We had to keep updating the book.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:29.229
-What a great story!
-Yeah.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.980
So as of today, and this is probably
maybe two years now,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:39.380
she lost over 100 pounds,
I believe it's almost half her body weight.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:44.999
And her A1c is 5 or 5.2.

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:48.524
From 12 to 5.2
getting off her medications.

00:35:48.633 --> 00:35:49.659
Yes.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.309
That's a great story.

00:35:51.384 --> 00:35:54.940
And you know she went
to the elite diabetes center in town

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.820
and they couldn't help her.

00:35:57.964 --> 00:35:59.460
Wow!

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.420
So not your average case,
not your standard case,

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.539
but certainly shows the power
that this can manifest in the frustration,

00:36:07.539 --> 00:36:10.860
that it wouldn't be discussed
in an elite diabetes center.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.059
Now do you see that trend changing
with the evidence from Virta health

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:19.179
in a peer-reviewed journal that we can get
people off their medications?

00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:24.420
You know, it's not doctors around town
or N=1 stories telling their experience.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.619
Now it's a published article.

00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:28.579
So do you see the tide changing for that?

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.659
Again I've been at it for almost 20 years
and it's much slower than I would like,

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:37.059
but again we can do it one-on-one,

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:41.260
but that's not going to give us
that global message that we're looking for.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.659
So you know hopefully we can infiltrate
the ADA meetings,

00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:49.380
the American Heart Association meetings

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:55.417
and bring the evidence to the table
in that way and change the tide.

00:36:55.516 --> 00:36:58.804
So what's next for you guys?
Ivor, what's next on your plate?

00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:03.260
Well for me it's mostly conferences
in the next few months

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:07.179
where we'll be obviously sharing the book
and circulating that.

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:14.340
I'm in Glasgow
for a British cardiovascular society,

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.940
I'm in Majorca for Low-Carb Majorca,
Low-Carb Houston is on,

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:24.460
Estonia has popped up for September,
just a kind of health conference there

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.019
and possibly Cuba in December,
a diabetes conference,

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:31.059
not low-carb but diabetes and health.

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:34.152
And actually quite a few more
heading into next year.

00:37:34.237 --> 00:37:37.019
That's great to hear that
it's a diabetes conference in there,

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:40.579
cardiovascular conference in there,
so not just low-carb conferences.

00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:43.380
Well, actually my supporter,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.019
and I kind of report to David Bobbitt now
of Irish Heart Disease Awareness

00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:52.619
and we certainly share the focus on getting
the message out to wider communities

00:37:52.619 --> 00:37:55.300
because I think
within the low-carb community

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.940
our obsession is giving people the chance

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.659
to discover their heart disease
with the calcium scan

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:03.219
and giving them the solutions
which include low-carb,

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:07.019
but obviously low-carb is only one part
of the multifactor solution.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:11.380
But the challenges that people
within the low-carb community

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.980
have a good idea for a lot of the science
and they are quite ahead of the game

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.940
and they are even now learning a lot
about the calcification scan

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.300
through our efforts and others.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.460
But the huge majority of people
are outside the low-carb community.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.260
So it's really vital for us
to get to ordinary people,

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.139
I mean those people at 52 or 53 of age

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:33.179
that are going to drop dead
of a heart attack and leave children behind

00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:35.380
and they are not obese
and they don't smoke,

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.900
but they have hyperinsulinemia
unknown, undiagnosed,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.340
they have huge vascular disease
that's going to kill them,

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.940
but no one gave them a scan
to wake them up.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.260
So our fixation is to get to those people.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.127
So I agree any conferences that are not
just low-carb are our primary target.

00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:55.860
That's a very good point.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.059
I love how you brought up that the low-carb
is one part of the solution

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:01.139
and is so important to emphasize.

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:03.860
And in your book you do put
a strong emphasis

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:08.579
on sun exposure and sleep
and stress and physical activities

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:11.860
and you have your list of 10 factors

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.059
and I think that's really important
to fall back on,

00:39:15.059 --> 00:39:18.699
that we focus so much on diet because
it's something we're involved in every day

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:21.940
and we have such an intimate relationship
with food and it's so complex.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.099
But it's one piece of the puzzle
so I'm glad you brought that up.

00:39:25.173 --> 00:39:29.260
Yeah absolutely, Bret, and again
just thinking back to the Pareto principle,

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.820
people say that heart disease
has 300 factors now.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.699
It's apparently 300 that are listed.

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.219
But obviously by the Pareto principle

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:43.219
the top 5 or 10 will account for a huge amount
of the disease on mortality

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:45.420
and people can't focus on everything.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.179
So it's very confusing to tell people
too many factors including many lesser ones.

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:52.940
And cholesterol can suffer
from this problem as well,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.260
that is not a primary central factor,
it's an interacting factor.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.420
But we like to focus on the top ones,

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.527
the Big Bang for the book
that will save most people.

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:04.457
Good point. 
And Dr. Gerber, what's next for you?

00:40:04.558 --> 00:40:08.340
Yes, so I don't go
to as many conferences as Ivor,

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.780
because I still have my day job
as a family doctor

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.579
and that takes up most of my time.

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:20.420
And I have to say, you know,
almost 30 years doing it I still enjoy it.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:26.699
There's passion and helping
to take people off medication

00:40:26.699 --> 00:40:32.860
and giving them tools where they can really
make changes is really helpful.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.699
But just a backup in terms of conferences,

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:40.460
Ivor and I did attend a really important
and interesting conference in Zürich.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.619
It was put on by the BMJ and Swiss RE.

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:47.340
And the purpose of that conference
was consensus.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.139
So we actually had
the two sides come together

00:40:51.139 --> 00:40:56.820
and I'm a person of moderation
and so trying to find consensus

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.619
and this was just wonderful.

00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:02.980
And we hope that we could see
more conferences like that into the future.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.820
So I pick and choose the conferences
that I attend,

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:12.619
I'm busy with our Denver conference
that is coming up in March 2019

00:41:12.619 --> 00:41:18.619
and we're always looking
for interesting topics, keeping it fresh.

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:22.420
We have some of the returned
regular speakers

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.739
and then to find new speakers.

00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:28.980
And so our mantra for our conferences

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:34.219
is that these are for doctors
put on by doctors,

00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:40.492
so we offer educational credit
and everyone else is invited.

00:41:40.596 --> 00:41:42.539
That's great, very good.

00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:46.780
Dr. Jeffry Gerber, Denver's Diet Doctor,
thank you so much for joining me.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.980
Ivor Cummins, fatemperor.com,
thank you so much for joining me.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.860
-Thanks a lot, Bret.
-Thanks.
