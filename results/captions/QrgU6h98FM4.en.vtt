00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.090
From unexplained vibrating spheres to an ancient
Egyptian scroll full of spells, here are 10

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.900
of the strangest artifacts to ever be found….

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.439
10.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.769
The Betz Mystery Sphere

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.800
On May 26th, 1974, the Betz family were looking
at the damage caused by a brush fire across

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.320
their land near Jacksonville, Florida, when
they found a strange sphere.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.239
It was just less than 8 inches in diameter,
made from metal, and highly polished.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.670
The only mark on its surface was a triangular
shape that had been stamped onto it.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.789
They immediately knew there was something
strange about this 22 pound (9.9kg) object,

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.589
so they took it back home.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.410
From there things got weird.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.420
A few weeks later, the son was strumming his
guitar, and the orb started to vibrate in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.010
a similar way to a tuning fork.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.800
It also started emitting a high frequency
noise that panicked the family’s dog.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.440
Then they found that, when they rolled it
across the floor, the orb would stop, and

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.330
then roll in a different direction.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.580
Furthermore, it responded to weather- becoming
more active on sunny days than overcast ones.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.140
The family started hiding it away in a bag
at night so it couldn't escape.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160
Was it a downed satellite of some sort?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.830
Did it belong to NASA, or was it a Soviet
space probe?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.430
The sphere became notorious, but has never
truly been explained.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030
The US Government said it didn’t belong
to them.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.190
But, it was kind of similar to a sea bottom
marker to assist missile launching submarines

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.290
by giving them a reference point.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.660
Some think it’s an alien probe, others that
it’s an ancient object of religious significance.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.113
Perhaps the most logical answer is that it
was a part of an artist’s project…

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:48.260
In any case, the location of the sphere is
unknown.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.750
Imagine if the proof of extraterrestrial intelligence
were just sitting in a box somewhere….

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.750
9.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.670
The Holy Right Hand

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.160
On August 15, 1038, St. Stephen, the first
king of Hungary, was buried in a sarcophagus

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.550
and then moved to an underground catacomb
to protect his remains.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.390
When this happened, someone decided to remove
his right hand because it was believed to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.500
have miraculous properties, and it was put
in the treasury of the Basilica.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.390
Ironically, the guard in charge of protecting
the treasury actually stole it and kept it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.670
in his estate.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.010
The thief was forgiven (miraculously!) and
the hand was later recovered and taken back

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.280
to his burial place at some point in the 16th
century.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.730
It is now housed in St. Stephen's Basilica
in Budapest, and once a year on August 20th,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.590
is paraded as a part of the Holy Right Hand
procession, promising good luck to any who

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.590
witness it.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.370
There’s some confusion as to whether this
hand is actually that of St. Stephens, though.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.930
Earlier descriptions mention it wearing a
ring, which was proof that it belonged to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.970
the king, but this ring is nowhere to be seen.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.870
Furthermore, the coat of arms, where the hand
was once kept, shows an arm as well as the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.040
hand- so where did St. Stephens arm end up,
and who detached it from the hand?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.760
In 2000, the hand and the arm were put on
display, but the arm bone turned out to be

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.870
a fibula from a right leg.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.100
With religious artifacts, it’s hard to tell
since they have survived theft, war, and all

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.150
kinds of destruction.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.459
Who knows where his hand might be?

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.870
One thing’s for sure, there are bits and
pieces of St. Stephen located all over the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.870
world.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.380
And now for the Amazing Aluminum Wedge, but
first if you are new here be sure to subscribe

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.740
so you don’t miss out on the latest vids!!

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.690
For you returning subs, welcome back!

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.130
I missed you!!

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.130
8.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.349
The Aiud Aluminum Wedge

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.720
The Aiud Aluminum wedge was found in a trench
along Romania’s Mures river in 1974.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.930
In itself, this wouldn’t be particularly
strange, but the location in which it was

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.430
found, and the tests results from analyzing
the object, point to something very peculiar.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.740
It was discovered next to a set of mastodon
bones, and if it was the same age as them

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.470
it would be 11,000 years old.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.880
The surrounding rocks and sediment suggest
that objects in that place are at least 10,000

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.989
years old.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.490
The wedge was sent for much testing, and was
found to be 89% Aluminum, along with traces

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.370
of copper, silicon, zinc, lead, and a number
of other elements.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.660
Scientists believe it is not a natural formation.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.289
The results of dating were the most interesting,
though, and while it proved that the object

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.960
wasn’t anywhere near as old as the mastodon
bones, two independent tests determined that

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.270
it was about 400 years old.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.150
This still predates Aluminum manufacturing
by 200 years, and raises questions of how

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.590
that could be possible, and why it ended up
where it did!

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.629
Some people argue that it is a fragment of
an ancient UFO!

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:43.770
Because...why not??

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.770
7.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.349
The Klerksdorp Spheres

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.330
The Klerksdorp spheres are a series of objects
that have been retrieved from mines around

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.990
Ottosdal, South Africa, from pyrophyllite
deposits that are more than 3 billion years

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.990
old.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.060
They range in size between a quarter of an
inch to 4 inches in diameter, and some of

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.569
them have clear, defined grooves and ridges
around them.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.930
Some are spherical, and some are flattened
spheres, and they all range from a dark reddish

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.029
brown to a dusky red colour.

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.281
The spheres have been subject to much debate
because they seem too perfectly round to have

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.970
been naturally formed.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.949
Some claim that they are evidence of intelligent
beings being present on the earth billions

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.430
of years ago, and that they could even be
a form of information technology.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.509
Tests on the spheres, though, support the
theory that they have been formed by geological

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.960
processes- the grooves occurred when minerals
formed in the space between sediments, and

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.259
the shapes are formed as a result of weathering
processes of millions of years.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.330
Nature can make perfect shapes too!!

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.330
6.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.159
The Ubaid Lizard Man

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.740
Very little is known about the ancient Ubaidian
culture that lived in Mesopotamia between

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.210
5500 and 4000 BC.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.000
I mean, it was a long time ago!

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.110
What we do know is that they lived in mud
brick houses that were arranged into large

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.199
settlements, and that they used irrigation
to farm the land.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.419
It was a discovery made during excavation
of a site called Tell Al’Ubaid that uncovered

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.300
some small sculptures, which have become known
as the lizard men.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.270
They have long heads, oval eyes, tapered faces,
and lizard noses.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.949
They are all depicted in different positions,
with some even having children that are lizard

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.350
like and suckling milk.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.180
With so little known about the Ubaidians,
it’s not entirely clear what these figurines

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.289
are meant to represent.

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:31.240
Were they ritualistic objects dedicated to
a reptilian god, or even realistic representations

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240
of the people themselves?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.430
It’s clear that there’s a lot more to
be learned about one of the oldest cultures

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.339
that we know of, and plenty more secrets to
be revealed.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:42.559
5.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:43.879
Four Golden Hats

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.409
In the past 200 years, 4 golden hats have
been found in Europe that date back to the

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.569
bronze age!

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.469
As of yet, no-one knows who made them, why
they were forged, or what their purpose was.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.779
The first to be discovered was the Golden
Hat of Schifferstadt, which was found in Germany

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.539
in 1835.

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:04.469
It seemed to have been intentionally buried,
and is the shortest of the four at almost

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.559
1 foot (30.5 cm) tall.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:09.099
It has a number of concentric rings and other
designs, and is thought to have been made

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.610
at some point between 1400 and 1300 BC.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.009
Two more hats have been found in Germany,
with another in France.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.069
All of them are different shapes and sizes,
and forged about 300 years later than the

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:21.840
first one that was unearthed.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.900
There are several suggestions as to what they
were used for- ranging from symbols of fertility,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.069
to suits of armour.

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:31.569
Researchers currently believe they were owned
by priests of the time, with the symbols relating

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:36.180
to astrological events that they would have
used to predict the seasons, the weather and,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.759
most importantly, when to harvest.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.319
Further research is needed to fully understand
these hats, though, and perhaps there are

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.669
many more just waiting to be found.

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:45.669
4.

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.599
The Coso Artifact

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:53.279
In February of 1961, the owners of a California
gemstone shop were searching for geodes in

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.599
the mountains near Olancha, California.

00:07:55.599 --> 00:08:00.490
They collected a bunch of rocks and it turns
out they found something quite unusual.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.719
When they were sawing open the rocks, one
of them nearly broke the diamond saw blade

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:06.119
that they were using.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:10.219
And instead of revealing an empty cavity like
you would expect with a geode, they found

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:12.740
a hard, porcelain-type material.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.499
It was a perfect cylinder of porcelain and
inside, was a 2 millimeter shaft of bright

00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:20.479
metal that turned out to be magnetic!!

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:22.410
So what the heck was this object?

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.460
The outer layer of specimen was encrusted
with fossil shells and other fragments that

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.499
would have taken more than half a million
years to form.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.849
There were other metal objects in the crust
and there was a layer of decomposing copper

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:35.930
surrounding the porcelain.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.399
This seemed to be a human-made object, so
what were all of these things, fossils and

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.029
metals all doing together?

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:45.980
The porcelain and the magnetic metal couldn’t
have been the same age as the fossils.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.980
But what was it?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.480
And how did it get to be inside the rock?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.660
There are no convincing answers to explain
this and, since then, very few people have

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.360
been allowed to to inspect the object.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.190
2 of the discoverers are deceased and the
other is avoiding any public comment.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.320
The whereabouts of the object are unknown
and it is suspected it was destroyed.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.460
This is a mystery that will probably be left
unsolved.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.460
3.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.380
The Dropa Stones

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.130
In 1938, a expedition set off to explore a
little known region in the Baian-Kara-Ula

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.829
mountains on the border of China and Tibet.

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:23.210
Near the summit of the mountains they found
a network of caves, where the walls were decorated

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.149
with images of people with elongated heads
and representations of heavenly objects.

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.880
In the ground, researchers found a number
of graves.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.730
Inside, they found unusual skeletons that
were about 3 feet tall, with unusually large

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.310
skulls, but the strangest things (and most
famous things) that were discovered became

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.490
known as the Dropa stones.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.170
These spherical disks were 12 inches in diameter,
had a hole in the centre, and grooves that

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.670
spiralled outwards.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.959
In total, 716 of these stones have been found,
and, upon closer inspection, the grooves turned

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.079
out to be intricate carvings.

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:01.440
The professor who studied these stones in
Beijing said that after translating the mysterious

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.910
language, the stones told the story of alien
visitors that arrived 12,000 years ago that

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.240
became stranded on the planet.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.120
The professor was forced to resign and the
stones have disappeared.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.870
There none available for public viewing although
there are some random pictures of the artifacts.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.680
In any case, the findings in the cave could
be proof of an ancient people that time forgot

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.759
but further research has proved to be impossible.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.170
2.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.690
Ritual Cat Claws

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.770
Another little known civilisation, known as
the Moche, lived on the northern coast of

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.860
Peru about 1,500 years ago.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.069
Their lands stretched for 215 miles, and they
built numerous pyramids that still look over

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:42.420
the countryside.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.629
In some cases they look more like hills after
hundreds of years of erosion.

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:51.750
There are also a number of temples and tombs,
one of which was discovered and explored in

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.750
2014.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.670
Built for a 30 year old man, this tomb at
the Temple of the moon, known locally as the

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.649
Huaca de la Luna, had some very strange artifacts
inside it.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:05.880
Alongside his body was a copper sceptre, bronze
earrings, a mask, and ceremonial ceramics,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.600
but what stood out most were pieces that looked
like feline jaws and paws.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.199
The claws are made from metal, and are thought
to have been part of a ritual costume that

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:17.660
was worn in ceremonial combat.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.829
The trove of artifacts that were found show
that this man was a part of elite society,

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:25.990
but without any written records surviving
from the times, there’s still plenty we

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.490
don’t know about the mysterious Moche civilisation.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.490
1.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.420
Egyptian Spellbook

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.670
One of the most mysterious and intriguing
artifacts to ever be found is the ‘Handbook

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.480
of Ritual Power’.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.329
Dating back to ancient Egypt, this book was
deciphered in 2014 and gave an insight into

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:47.310
the rituals and traditions of the most renowned
of the ancient civilisations.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.189
It’s about 1,300 years old, and is written
in an Egyptian language called ‘Coptic’.

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:57.910
The 20 pages of parchment, known as a codex,
contain information about love spells, medical

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.050
treatments and even how to exorcise evil spirits.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.500
There are lots of different incantations,
and instructions on how to make your desires

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500
come true.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.800
For example, one spell, used to subjugate
someone, requires a spell to be read over

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.519
two nails, and then for them to be driven
into that person’s doorpost.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.810
It’s not entirely clear who would have used
this codex, but it’s thought to have been

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.720
written by an Egyptian Christian group known
as the Sethians.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.009
They rose to prominence in Egypt during the
early days of Christianity, and worshipped

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:28.800
Adam and Eve’s third son, Seth.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.949
The book also references another spiritual
figure, “Baktiotha”, who it says is a

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:37.529
“great power and a ruler of forces in the
material realm”.

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:42.259
No other mention of Baktiotha has ever been
found, so the true meaning and intent of this

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:47.180
Handbook may never truly be known- whether
it was intended for use in enlisting forces

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.339
for good, or for evil.

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:52.209
Thanks for watching!!
