00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.740
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Well, today

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.590
is Teacher Appreciation Day, and
I wanna show you a video we got from two

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.890
teachers who are in the audience,
take a look.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.640
&gt;&gt; Hi Ellen, my name's Lauren, and
this is my amazing fiance Alan.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.270
We're elementary school teachers,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.860
who happen to also be your
biggest fans in the entire world.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.110
&gt;&gt; On our first date, we talked about
you literally, the entire night.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.540
So if you think about it, you're kinda
the reason we're getting married.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.370
&gt;&gt; We really appreciate the fact
that you love and respect teachers.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.140
We would never want to do
another job in the entire world.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.290
We love being teachers.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.050
&gt;&gt; You're the best.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.740
&gt;&gt; We love you Ellen.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.240
&gt;&gt; Goodbye.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.500
&gt;&gt; So, you basically say that I'm
the reason because your first

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.880
date you talked about me the whole time.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.655
&gt;&gt; We did.
&gt;&gt; The entire night.

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.880
[LAUGH] So whenever we went on our first
date, I'm sorry, I can't breathe, I'm so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.400
excited, this is so cool!

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.490
So on our first date, we went out to
dinner, and you know, it's the cliche,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.800
you know, what's your favorite movie,
what kind of food do you like, and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410
I said my favorite show is the Ellen Show,
and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.060
he was like, that's my favorite
&gt;&gt; I love Ellen too!

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.330
And she's like, you don't watch the Ellen
Show, I'm like, I watch the Ellen Show!

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.280
I had to convince her that I,
like watch this show!

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.540
So,
&gt;&gt; She probably though I was just trying

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.000
to get her to like me, and I'm like no,
I like the Ellen Show, I love it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.730
&gt;&gt; So we bonded the entire night over you,
and how much we love how funny you are,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.260
and how amazing your show is.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.930
And they actually turned the lights on
at the restaurant and they were like,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.614
you have to go.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:18.279
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; They were standing

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.900
there tapping their

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.520
&gt;&gt; We're closing
&gt;&gt; feet

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.030
looking at us, like
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.979
&gt;&gt; We're like, we should probably go

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:21.788
then, I guess.

00:01:21.788 --> 00:01:22.600
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.580
&gt;&gt; So yeah,
we bonded over you on our first date.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.260
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.800
So you're teachers and you make,
you said you wouldn't do anything else.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.010
That, what is that feeling knowing
you're changing those kids' lives?

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.920
&gt;&gt; I mean for me,
my students had a chorus concert.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.340
&gt;&gt; About 2 weeks ago,
Lauren came and the kids.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.410
But a dad came up to me, and
he was, Hey, Mr. Matthew.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.790
We'd appreciate all you do.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.500
My son didn't really enjoy 1st
grade that much last year and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.570
he loves coming to school now.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.500
So seeing that change in
the students make a difference,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.410
mold those young students lives.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.270
&gt;&gt; He's an amazing teacher.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.230
&gt;&gt; I couldn't do anything else.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.040
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic and I heard you
incorporate me into your classroom.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.920
&gt;&gt; I do, I do in my classroom,
I have pictures on my schedule

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:05.300
&gt;&gt; I laminated them and they're you,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.300
they're pictures of you and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.060
throughout the day my kids they
know that it's Ellen dance time.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.800
So they'll see guided reading,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.720
independent reading,
and then Ellen's face.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.840
So when it's Ellen's face it's time to
dance, so we dance around the room and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.820
it builds confidence and I love it.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.375
&gt;&gt; That's adorable.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.820
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:23.870
&gt;&gt; That's adorable.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.720
You're an intricate part of
our day every single day.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.500
&gt;&gt; Well, I wanted to do something for you.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.850
Since I was a part of your first date,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.852
I want to give you a few more
dates that I'll be a part of.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.430
So here, I'll take these down and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.620
let's walk over here I'm gonna
show you what I'm gonna give you.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.170
All right, so the first one is
&gt;&gt; You're

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.950
gonna go on a picnic and you have,
I didn't know I had Ellen wine.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.585
I had no idea.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.307
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; My gosh.

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:54.140
&gt;&gt; So, there's a picnic or
you could have Ellen water.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.240
If you don't want that,
You can play Heads Up!

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.780
on your picnic.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.580
There's an Ellen blanket.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.460
&gt;&gt; My gosh.
&gt;&gt; Right there.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.480
You can go bowling.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.350
We have special Ellen bowling balls and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.340
then we also have
&gt;&gt; my God

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.010
&gt;&gt; you can go to a movie and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.090
then there's all kinds of things inside,
the Ellen jacket, alright?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.110
So-
&gt;&gt; My gosh, thank you.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.388
So, that's your dates in the future and

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:17.885
then maybe one more think
we'll take a break.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.040
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Weâ€™re back with some amazing teachers,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.950
Lauren and Allen, and
you getting married soon, right?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.560
Congratulation.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.290
&gt;&gt; Three months.
Actually, two and a half months.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.520
&gt;&gt; Two and a half months.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.270
And-
&gt;&gt; July 22nd.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.865
&gt;&gt; That's exciting.

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:28.385
&gt;&gt; Exciting, right?

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:29.475
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so exciting.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.515
&gt;&gt; And weddings are expensive.

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:31.545
&gt;&gt; They are, they really are.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.795
&gt;&gt; And so how are you saving for that?

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.795
&gt;&gt; We've actually been engaged
since December of 2014.

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:38.525
And we worked something
out with our vendors,

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:41.425
our hotel where we can sorta do
a monthly payment each month.

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:44.835
So we've been paying for
our wedding since December of 2014.

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.680
And we, we do the best we can.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.400
We, teacher salaries.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.020
We-
&gt;&gt; Paycheck to paycheck but

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.600
we put as much away as we can away for
the wedding.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960
And we're not saving any money
at the moment for the future,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.050
but we're trying the best that we can.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.577
&gt;&gt; Well, I know there's student
loans involved as well,

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:01.320
so here's what I want to do.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.840
Our friends at Credit Karma care
about how much student loan you have.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.275
I know you have a lot of debt in that.

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:10.181
So they want you to know
that you have options.

00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:15.096
They're going to give you 25,000
dollars to pay off your student loans.

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:18.633
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My gosh.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.243
My gosh.

00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:28.019
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:29.401
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.623
&gt;&gt; Have a seat.

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:33.123
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] My gosh!

00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:33.810
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.320
&gt;&gt; I've never-

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.820
&gt;&gt; Here's-

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.460

&gt;&gt; Cool about,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.044
and you'll take it home in that briefcase.
[LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]

00:04:40.044 --> 00:04:40.730
&gt;&gt; Carry-on?

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.500
&gt;&gt; Here's what's cool about Credit Karma.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.250

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.240

They help you save money and
