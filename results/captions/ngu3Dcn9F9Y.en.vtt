Hey, it's Marie Forleo and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be to create a business

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.990
and life that you love. Now, if you're someone
who's interested in a science-backed method

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.199
to grow an unshakeable core of strength and
calm and happiness, our guest today is here

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.740
to show us the way.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.190
Dr. Rick Hanson is a psychologist, Senior
Fellow of The Greater Good Science Center

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:39.230
at UC Berkeley and a New York Times best-selling
author. His books, including Resilient, Hardwiring

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.899
Happiness, Buddha’s Brain, Just One Thing,
and Mother Nurture are available in 26 languages.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.230
He's spoken at NASA, Oxford, Stanford, Harvard,
and other major universities, and taught in

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.710
meditation centers worldwide. Dr. Hanson's
work has been featured on the BBC, CBS, and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.440
NPR among others.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.370
Rick, thank you so much for being here. Thanks
for making the trip. We were talking off camera,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.240
I have talked about you and your work so many
times and it has been such a source of education

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.950
and inspiration. So, I really appreciate you
being here.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890
It's an honor to be here. Really.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.450
Thank you. So, take me back to the beginning.
You shared that as a young child you realized

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.289
that there was great unhappiness in the world.
In school, in your family, everywhere. How

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.230
did that realization really shape and then
form the work of your life?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.979
Well, thank you for going there. Right off
the top.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:34.979
Yeah.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.500
Well, first off, I've done a lot of work with
little kids and kids in general and one thing

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.300
that really strikes me is that so many people
knew things when they were young that were

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.209
really important. Many of which they couldn't
put into words. When I look back at my memories

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.320
and I have a lot of them of early childhood,
there was a quality, sort of in the wallpaper,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.539
of the experience of this haunting, poignant
sense I've had of a wistful sadness and a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.390
recognition that there was so much unnecessary
unhappiness. Even in a pretty ordinary situation

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.390
which I grew up. There was just a lot of household
stress, tension, unfulfilled longings, et

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.390
cetera.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.810
And that really set me on my way 'cause I
had a strong sense of that and I wanted to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.651
do something about it. But, I had no idea
what to do. So, that began things and then

00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.020
I had actually a turning point. I was just
thinking about that related to what we were

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.739
saying off camera, that in my mid-teens, and
I knew it happened when I was reading Dune

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.319
'cause I was a science fiction geek and the
main character was 15 at the same time.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.250
I had this insight, even though I was really
unhappy and quite neurotic, the thing I could

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.920
do no matter about the past was to learn and
grow from here. I could get better from here

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.379
a little bit every day. I could learn how
to talk to girls. I could learn how to deal

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.900
with my parents. I could learn how to deal
with my mind. I could get a little stronger,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.862
a little more skillful every day. That was
full of hope 'cause I couldn't do anything

00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:02.689
about the past, but I could grow and learn
from here.

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.680
Then, related to that, the most important
thing in a sense, is knowing how to grow.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680
Yes.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.879
How can you help yourself, steepen your growth
curve, your healing curve, as you go through

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.680
life? That really set me on my way.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.489
Did you have that belief that you could grow
and improve? Was that something that you felt

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.731
like was there before you started getting
into these books and getting inspired? Or

00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.359
was it something that you feel like was triggered
as reading these books and noticing these

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.489
characters actually developing?

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.330
I think that was deep inside me and where
that comes from I don't really know.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.330
Yeah.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.200
But, I think that's one of the most essential
things for a person to have inside themselves.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.180
This quality of being on their own side. And
I've been a long time psychotherapist and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.330
maybe you would not be surprised, but many
people would be surprised how few people actually

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.800
have that stance of being a friend to themselves
or being for themselves. Not against others

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.939
but for themselves. But, if you don't have
that, you're kind of dead in the water.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:58.939
Yeah.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.239
And for whatever reason, I had that quality
inside me. I was miserable but I knew I didn't

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.609
want to be miserable and I was gonna figure
my way out of this.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.609
Yeah.

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:08.769
What's your phrase? Figureoutable?

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.380
Everything is figureoutable. Yeah. We were
talking about, so I am now giving Dr. Rick

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.850
and all of my guests, they can have their
water in our Everything is Figureoutable mugs.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.239
Oh, I am gonna treasure that.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.940
Oh, yeah. You're gonna take that home with
you.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.220
Yeah. A hundred percent.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.449
I think it's so wonderful, though. One of
my beliefs, I'm curious if you share this

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.080
as well, is for those watching who feel like
"Okay, I'm listening Rick and I'm listening

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.050
Marie, but what if I didn't have that sense
that I could grow and get better? Is that

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.699
something I can learn?" I'm a big yes. Are
you a big yes?

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.280
A hundred percent. In my experience and observation,
and in the research. People can acquire, and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.960
there are fancy terms for this, a sense of
agency, efficacy, or feeling more like a hammer

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.580
and less like a nail. And the point about
that is that this is not about positive thinking.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.599
It's not about denying your situation or how
you feel inside. If anything, it's about developing

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.710
the resources inside to deal with the really,
really hard things.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.710
Yes.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.979
It is, for me, extremely hopeful that if you
look for ways in which you can make a little

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.370
thing happen like you chose to pick up the
cup.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.370
Yes.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.419
I love these little examples. Like, reach
for the salt instead of the pepper. Know what

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.940
it feels like to not say something by choice
or to choose to say something. What's that

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.699
feel like? And then when you know what that
feels like, to be the chooser, or the poker,

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.740
or the restrainer, the one who puts on the
brakes or the one who hits the gas pedal,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.290
then you can start applying that sense of
agency to other bigger parts of your life.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.460
I love it. So, one of the things that you
have shared is this thing, we have this three

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.949
pound piece of tofu or cauliflower in between
or ears called our brain, and one of the questions

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.870
I was curious to hear how you would describe
this 'cause I love how you articulate sometimes

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.210
complex neurological phenomenon in very, very
simple to understand terms. What is the distinction

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.080
between our brain and our mind?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.690
It's such a huge question. There are many
ways of approaching it and it's great that

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.190
you went right there. The neuroscientific,
psychological way of relating to this is that

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.940
the brain is the meat. It's the hardware.
It's physical. It's the stuff. And this nervous

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.199
system that we have which took 600 million
years to evolve, thank you Mother Nature,

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.360
has a function. And its function is to represent
information. Now, that kind of stops you right

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.840
there but if you think about it we deal with
this all the time. Like, I walked here today

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.900
and I was dealing with traffic signals that
were red, yellow, or green. That's material

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.290
in a sense. Energy and light are part of material
reality but the meaning of red, the meaning

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.099
of green, is not physical. It's information.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:54.099
Yes.

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.081
So, right there you have the distinction between
matter that exists and also information, which

00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:01.870
also exists which is intangible.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.870
Yes.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.259
So, the information flowing through the nervous
system, the motor systems are tracking your

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:14.770
sensory systems. This smells good, swim towards
it. Ew, this tastes bad, swim away. That is

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.259
the basis for our experiences. Like, right
now you and I are hearing, seeing people listening

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:27.030
to this. Hearing, seeing, thinking. Those
experiences are made of information, in effect.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:33.220
They are immaterial. They exist, but they're
not tangible. The takeaway point for me is

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.720
you can use your experiences, you can use
your mind, the flow of thought where you rest

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.590
your attention, what you do with your feelings,
you can use that because it enlists underlying

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.199
neural processes. So, you can use your mind
to enlist these underlying neural processes

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:57.050
that represent your mind to actually change
your brain because the repeated patterns of

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.629
neural activity leave lasting traces behind.
Like water coming down a hillside.

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:02.629
Yes.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:06.919
And that means fundamentally as a take away,
you have the power inside yourself every minute

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:11.651
of every day to use your mind, to change your
brain, the change your mind for the better.

00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:17.669
Yes. I get so excited by this stuff and i
love the phrase that I learned in one of your

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:22.400
earlier books Hardwiring Happiness, it just
really solidified home that neurons that fire

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.319
together, wire together. It just got me so
excited because it was this scientific affirmation

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:31.160
of something intuitively that I've always
believed in my life.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
I know. Yeah.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.280
I feel like it's so powerful for everyone
listening that even if you feel as though

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.290
you were born into certain circumstances and
there are certain pain and trauma in your

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.320
past, that that doesn't have to be your destiny
moving forward.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.630
That's right. One of the things that struck
me about honestly your approach in your programs

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.950
was that clearly you have what Carol Dweck
at Stanford calls a growth mindset.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.950
Yes. I love Carol Dweck.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.950
Yeah. A learning mindset.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.950
Yes.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.790
Exactly right. Whatever this truth about the
past is the truth but we can grow and learn

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.790
from here.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.790
Yes.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.200
So, let’s move on to your latest book Resilient.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
Mmhmm.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
Which is fantastic. Congratulations.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
Oh, thank you.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.770
So, there are big problems in the world and
all of us have those everyday stresses. We

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:15.080
have illnesses, we have difficulties, we have
disappointments. Let's talk about the importance

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.640
of growing our inner strengths. You share
that the world may be chaotic and let you

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.710
down but you can count on is growing the strengths
inside of yourself.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.710
Mmhmm.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.800
Talk to me about this focus on resilience
and why it's so important right now.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.200
Yeah. So, it's easy to think of positive psychology
or self help as like a magic carpet ride.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200
Yeah.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.530
Just do this thing, do this gratitude practice,
do this mantra and you will be transported.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.060
All of that's pretty good but what about the
real world?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.060
Yeah.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.170
What about everyday stresses, everyday difficulties,
and what about the really, really hard things

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:55.080
in your life? Walking through the city streets
of Manhattan today reminded of Thoreau's line,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.830
“most people lead lives of quiet desperation.”
So, if we're gonna deal with both the worst

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.610
day of our life and thrive every day of our
life. We need resilience. We need these inner

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.790
strengths. So, where does resilience come
from? It's kind of a common word these days.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:16.110
Resilience comes from capabilities and know-how
and determination and positive emotions that

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.411
you have inside yourself. So, if you need
to tap into your inner supply. So, I've done

00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.950
a lot of stuff in the wilderness and rock
climbing and so forth.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.950
Yeah.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.950
So, you think about what's in your backpack.
You know?

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.950
Yeah.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.560
What's more important than what's in your
wallet when you're out in the boonies?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560
Yes.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.100
What's in your backpack? Is there fortitude?
Is there happiness? Is there care and concern

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.230
for other people?

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.230
Yeah.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.070
So, those are the important things. How do
you grow them. That's where this fancy phrase

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:48.200
comes in: experience-dependent neuroplasticity.
This idea that through focused attention and

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.720
sustained experience of something that's useful
to you, you can actually hardwire it into

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.210
your nervous system. So, more and more you
feel like it's with you wherever you go.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.210
Yes.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.760
So many people feel like they're running on
fumes. Running on empty. They just don't have

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.690
it inside. So, how do you actually build up
the good stuff inside? The key is really simple.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.100
It's to look for those experiences that are
useful for you, that are authentic. And then

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.970
don't skitter on to the next thing. Take a
breath or two or longer to feel it in your

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:25.070
body, to stay with it, focus on what's rewarding
about it, and that will drive the neural processes

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:31.190
of installation. That will hard wire and actually
in effect, record the song of experience into

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.840
your nervous system. So more and more you
have a with you wherever you go.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:41.030
I just think this is so exciting and wonderful.
And that's why I was so thrilled when you

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.420
said yes to come on the show, because this
is stuff... Again, I feel like this is the

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:50.480
reason I do what I do in life because when
I started to discover basic self help concepts,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.330
learned how to meditate when I was 17, a bunch
of these different things. I was like, wait

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.600
a minute, why am I just learning this now?
And I feel like this keeps happening.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600
Yeah.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.760
And we're not taught these things in school.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760
I know, it's amazing.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.400
Right? And children aren't taught that you
have to kind of develop these tools and put

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.370
them in your backpack. And I love this analogy,
and I know this is one of the things that

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.200
I've talked about on MarieTV, quoting your
work, one of the things that we really have

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.220
to be aware of is negativity bias.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.220
Yeah.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.930
So for folks that didn't catch that episode,
can you tell us what negativity bias is, and

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.750
then give us some pointers on how to navigate
it, because I feel like that's one of the

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.980
things that we have to keep watch out for
when we want to really savor those good things.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.470
A hundred percent true. So if you want to
grow the good inside yourself...

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.470
Yeah.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.100
You have to experience it, number one. But
most important, once you're experiencing it,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.990
you need to internalize it. That's a general
truth. That general truth is really sharpened

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.770
by one of the most powerful findings in neuroscience.
The brain's negativity bias, which I say is

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.890
like having a brain that's like Velcro for
bad experiences, but Teflon for good ones.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.880
And there are so many everyday examples. Ten
things happen in a relationship in a day,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.950
nine are good, one is irritating. What's the
one you obsess about?

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.080
The irritating one, of course.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080
Yeah, exactly right.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.160
And people in my audience, I hear about this
all the time, they'll be like, "Marie, I'm

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.530
so afraid of getting criticism. I'm so afraid
of being judged. I run this business and someone

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.210
left this really nasty, ignorant comment."

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.210
Oh, yeah.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.300
And that's the one that stays, not the hundred
happy customers.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.480
A Hundred percent. So I'm a writer...

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480
Yeah.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.930
...and you know, it's that one star review
on Amazon...

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.930
Yes.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.930
...that really bugs you.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.180
My friend, Author Seth Godin, he actually
doesn't read reviews anymore.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.180
Yeah.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.960
And I think, because he's like, "You know
what? Don't need them. I'm going to keep writing."

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.060
Because the negativity bias of our brain is
real.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.970
It is very real. And why do we have it? And
it's really interesting to reflect on the

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:45.100
fact that the negativity bias is not your
fault. I've had people actually tell me, "Thanks,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.640
Rick, you actually made me feel okay about
the fact that I'm anxious a lot.” Or “I'm

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:55.120
still affected by bad things that have happened
to me." It's natural. And the reason for that,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.650
is that is the nervous system evolved over
600 million years. Our ancestors had to, in

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:07.320
effect, get carrots, like food and avoid sticks,
like predators or aggression inside your band.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.110
Both are important, but here's the difference.
If you don't get a carrot today, back in the

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:16.390
Stone Age, you'll have a chance at one tomorrow,
but if you fail to avoid that stick today,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.920
whack. No more carrots forever.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920
You're done.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.920
You're done. Yeah.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920
It's lights out.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.260
Yeah, so, I know. So you can watch your own
mind. It's really interesting to watch your

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260
mind...

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.260
Yeah.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.201
...routinely does these five things, the brain's
designed to do them. Look for bad news, over

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:34.570
focus upon it. Bad news also inside your body
and in your mind. Focus upon it, overreact

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.980
to it. That one little light in the old inner
dashboard, this flashing red. And then fast

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.351
track it into memory. Once burned, twice shy,
never forget. For example, there's research

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:52.220
that shows that one negative interaction in
a relationship has much more impact than several

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.270
positive interactions. That was a takeaway
for me when I was in grad school and I came

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.770
upon it. I thought, "Wow, what's my wife's
life been with me recently?"

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.360
I mean, I kind of.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.180
We got to tip those scales.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.390
That's right. Game here.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.390
Yeah.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.170
Yeah. And then literally the brain, the fifth
thing it does through cortisol, the stress

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:16.900
hormone becomes sensitized to the negative.
We become extra prickly, extra irritable,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.900
extra anxious...

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900
Yes.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.870
...which then creates more negative experiences
the next day.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.870
Absolutely.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:28.970
So, it's by design. But what we can do is
feel the negative. Feel it, let it flow. And

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:34.140
then what am I going to do about it? How can
I grow the good inside myself for my own sake

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.480
and other people everyday forward.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.990
Love it. Another metaphor that's wonderful
is loving the zoo in your head, really honoring

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.880
the lizard, the mouse, and the monkey. And
again, I love this because I'm always a student

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.170
of brain science. And I feel like this is
such a wonderful way to help us all remember

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.380
it. So can you talk about the zoo in our mind?

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.380
Oh sure.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.380
Or brains, I should say.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.981
So, I think a lot of us, I certainly do, have
this feeling that what's inside is sort of

00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:04.810
like a zoo, of all these different voices
tugging in different directions. And that's

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.750
partly related to the three stage evolution
of the brain. Like building a house from the

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.770
bottom up in three floors. So we have the
more or less reptilian brainstem, very focused

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:20.660
on safety. On top of it we have the mammalian
subcortex with strange parts of the brain,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:26.060
like the amygdala or the hippocampus, that's
very focused on satisfaction. And then we

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:32.470
have the primate human neocortex sitting on
top of that, that's very focused on relationships,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.290
on our need for connection. So, in effect,
each of us has inside themselves a kind of

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.640
inner lizard, mouse, and monkey.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.190
Can I ask you a question?

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.190
Yeah.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.830
So the amygdala is not a part of the reptilian,
it's a part of the second level?

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.830
Correct.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.830
Really.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.800
It's part of the subcortex that sits on top
of the ancient nerve, the brainstem.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.980
Thank you for teaching me that.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.990
Oh yeah. So it's oriented around fear and
alarm. So it definitely helps us with safety.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.890
But the amygdala also lights up when we see
opportunities. There's actually a research

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.280
paper that has a wonderful title, “The Joyful
Amygdala.”

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.059
I love this.

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:07.059
I know.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.059
This is exciting.

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:11.559
It is. And we have the opportunity to. Research
shows us, you can train your amygdala to shift

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:13.289
out of a kind of grumpy amygdala...

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:14.289
Yeah.

00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:16.750
...into more like of a joyful amygdala. You're
still going to see threats. You were still

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.020
going to see red lights and angry faces. But
you're also going to be able to see many more

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.070
opportunities in your life. And a typical
life is full of them. So that's anyway, that's

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:30.480
the brain. And so my takeaway from all that
is, okay, we have this structure inside us.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.379
It's very real. There's no way around it.
We have these needs for safety, satisfaction,

00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:36.919
and connection. What are we going to do?

00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:42.720
One of the things we can do is look for those
authentic opportunities every day to register

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.059
an enoughness of safety. We're so scared,
we're like scared little critters. And enoughness

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:53.720
of satisfaction, of fullness already, a sense
of contentment and gratitude and also, an

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.380
enoughness of relatedness. It would be good
to have more five star reviews. It'd be nice

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.970
to have more people like you. And still there
can be a sense of connection already. So if

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:08.390
you do that routinely, you start filling yourself
up from the inside out and I have this jokey

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.600
phrase, look for those opportunities each
day to pet the lizard, feed the mouse, and

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600
hug the monkey.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.340
When I was thinking about feeding the mouse,
I was like petting the lizard, totally got

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.240
it. Feeding the mouse, it's like I want to
give my mouse some cheese.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.299
Yes. Look for satisfaction.

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:23.299
Yeah.

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:24.299
Beauty. These lovely flowers.

00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:25.299
Yes, yes, yes.

00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:27.070
You get these things done every day.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.330
And then the primate in us, right?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.330
Oh yeah.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.601
That connection. I feel like every time I've
seen these wonderful studies and the work

00:18:32.601 --> 00:18:33.919
that Jane Goodall has done...

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:34.919
Yeah.

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:37.549
...and it's like you just see the connection
between these primates and it's like, yeah,

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:38.850
that's part of us.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.950
Oh yeah. Absolutely. If you think about it,
back in the Serengeti being exiled was a death

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:43.950
sentence.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.950
Yes.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.360
And the nice thing also about hugging the
monkey, is that it meets all three needs,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.620
because it meets our need for connection,
but it's also very rewarding.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.620
Yes.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:58.090
Like right now, really nice sense of connection.
And then a social experiences are also reassuring.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:03.070
They're a safety signal. Think about a child
that wants to connect or people in general

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:07.769
want to find a secure base. So I'd say that
love is the universal medicine.

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:08.769
Yes.

00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:09.769
It's the multivitamin.

00:19:09.769 --> 00:19:14.790
It is the multivitamin. One of the cornerstones
of the practical work in this book, and there's

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:20.129
so much, is about taking our experiences and
using them to build resiliency. Taking a state,

00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:24.990
I love this, and turning it into a trait,
something more permanent. Any thoughts about

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.659
how we can use both are positive and our negative
experiences to really turn something from

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:31.190
a state into a trait?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.570
Well you really nailed I think the key question.
And as a frame, so I think the dirty little

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.630
secret in so much clinical work...

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:40.630
Yes.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.559
...as well as in coaching, human resources,
mindfulness training. I'm a longtime meditater

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:48.379
like you. I was actually a little older than
you, so I'm impressed that you were just 17

00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:49.379
when you started meditating.

00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:52.789
Yeah. I wasn't consistent. I got more consistent.
Like my 20s, I was a mess.

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:53.789
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:56.299
I fell out of it a little bit, but I got better
with it.

00:19:56.299 --> 00:19:59.799
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the dirty little secret
is we're good at having states. We're good

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:01.179
at having experiences.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.179
Yeah.

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:06.110
Positive thoughts, positive emotions, sensations,
connections, we're good at that. Most of them

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.700
wash through the brain, like water through
a sieve, while the negative ones are caught

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.700
each time.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700
Yes.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.179
Negativity bias, again. We waste them ourselves.
So the opportunity is to help our experiences

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:23.740
leave a lasting trace behind in physical changes
of neural structure or function. Without those

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.539
physical changes, we've left all that money
on the table and by definition there's no

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:34.790
lasting value. It's haunting and profound
to really let that sink in. So the question

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.899
then becomes, as you move through your day,
half a dozen times a day, maybe just on the

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:44.490
fly, and maybe once or twice on something
really big, each day, how can you increase

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.200
the conversion rate of those states to traits?
How can you actually help the nervous system

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.090
change for the better?
That's what's called positive neuroplasticity,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.660
and it's really my specialty. That's what
I'm especially interested in because if you

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.559
think of it, learning is the super power of
super powers.

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.559
Yes.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.580
It's the one that brings the rest of them.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.580
Yes.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.580
Just like you've said, that growth mindset.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.580
Yes.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.320
So the question is really how to do it. There
are a lot of details about it that can be

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.740
applied in different situations, but the essence
is super simple. When you're already having

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.100
some kind of useful experience, which could
be an insight you might realize, "Okay, it

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.740
goes better with my partner, if I lean in,
rather than out, when I'm having a tricky

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:27.919
conversation." I had to learn that one. Whatever
it might be, now that you're having that song

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:31.769
playing, how do you turn on the inner recorder,
on your inner iPod as it were?

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:37.070
Well, stay with it for a breath or two or
longer. Isn't it haunting how rapidly people

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.149
skitter on to the next thing...

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:40.149
Yes.

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:43.909
...before the current reasonably good thing
has a chance to sink in? Stay with it for

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:48.730
a breath or two or longer. Second, try to
feel it in your body. As you said earlier,

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.901
those neurons that fire together, will wire
together. So it's kind of mechanical. Keep

00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:58.460
them firing, have as many firing as possible
as you feel it in your body. As any good kindergarten

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.020
teacher knows, embodied experience is what
we learned from.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.020
Yes.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.960
And then third, focus on what's rewarding
about it, what's meaningful or enjoyable.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.919
Technically that will increase dopamine and
norepinephrine activity in your brain.

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:13.700
I had to look up how to pronounce that one
because I kept want to go someplace else,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.700
but thank you.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.009
Yeah. These little neurotransmitters. These
little molecular systems. What they do when

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:23.429
you focus on what's rewarding is they flag
experiences as keepers for protection as they

00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:29.840
become consolidated technically in the long-term
storage. That's a very pleasurable thing to

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.149
do, the three things I'm describing. No one
needs to know you're doing it. On the outside,

00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:38.370
if you have to, you can look really miserable
and uptight and concerned, but inside you

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.259
could be like, "Yeah, take it in. Take in
the good. Help it really land. I want that

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:44.169
to go with me wherever I go."

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:50.200
I like that. That's actually fun. There was
an antidote you write about to disappointment

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:58.059
and envy. I thought that it is so simple and
so profound and so beautiful this idea of

00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:02.711
being happy for others. I feel like in the
world that we live in and of course, people

00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.249
will undoubtedly stumble upon this video,
whether it's through our email list or through

00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:10.429
social media. Speaking of social media, I
feel like that's the place I'm always advising

00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:16.570
people to spend less time on because it is...
I talk about comparison hangovers.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.580
That's a great phrase.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.889
When I was in college, I drank this horrible
stuff called Goldschläger. It was like this

00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:28.129
terrible liqueur with gold flakes through
it. I totally drank way too much and threw

00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:34.159
up in the bushes, but I call comparing yourself
to others like doing shots of Compareschläger.

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.159
It's going to make you sick.

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:36.159
That's true.

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:40.200
You're going to be in bed for days. You'll
have no clue about your own greatness. I feel

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.039
like we should talk more about this antidote
to disappointment and envy, like being happy

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:46.799
for others. Talk to me about that.

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:52.571
Well, first off, the naming of the antidote
is great because if you think about it, we

00:23:52.571 --> 00:23:57.340
have various needs, we have various issues.
What's the inner resource that would be matched

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.500
to it? It's like if you have a flat tire,
you could put all the gas in your tank you

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.279
want. It won't solve the problem. It's not
matched to it. For example, if people are

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:09.289
worried about something for themselves or
others and they do gratitude practice or someone

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:14.120
compliments on how they look today, that's
nice, but it doesn't address the actual need.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.659
What's the antidote? That's a really useful
thing to focus on what you named here.

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:22.880
If you think about it, what if it were more
present in my mind would really, really help

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.620
me these days, would help me with my family,
would help with my work, with my long standing

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.909
issues? What would be the good thing to really,
really grow? Then when you know what that

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:38.190
is, it's so powerful to look for one or more
opportunities a day to experience some sense

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:44.399
of it or something that supports that antidote.
Your own special Vitamin C I call it for which

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:48.909
you really need inside, what will actually
really fill that hole that in your heart.

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:53.620
Then you find a little experience of it, that's
a high value growth opportunity.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.519
You don't want to let that one sail on by.
Focus on that one. That's the general idea

00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:03.070
of antidotes. Then just as you say, for envy,
a traditional notion in Buddhist practice,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:09.320
there are these four immeasurables, as they're
called, or heavenly ways of experiencing things.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.770
One of them is to be glad for the good fortune
of others. As the Dalai Lama says, "If you

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.940
can be happy that others are happy, you will
always be happy because there's always somebody

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.600
somewhere who's happy," right?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600
Yes.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.480
I have done meditation retreats where I was
sitting there doing practices on being glad

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.330
for the success that others had that I didn't
have. And that really, whatever the benefit

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:40.480
might have been for them, it helped me, as
you say, feel less envious. Envy is like taking

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.879
poison and waiting for others to die.

00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:47.909
Absolutely. Whenever I've had that in my own
life and looking at someone and I'm like,

00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:53.059
"Well, if he did it or she did it, I can do
it too." They're an example for me to be inspired

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:58.149
by. They're showing me possibilities that
I may not have ever even considered before

00:25:58.149 --> 00:26:02.870
had it not been for them being brave and stepping
out and doing this inventive work or whatever

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:09.889
it is. I loved this, just idea of being happy
for others was beautiful. I want to wrap on

00:26:09.889 --> 00:26:15.049
this. You have two brain strategies to share
with us that can change your lives, the two

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:18.600
brain hacks so to speak about not marinating
and taking in.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.679
Let's just drive this home because it does
feel like as simple and direct as these are,

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:28.720
they're the power buttons that can change
everything.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.429
It's totally great what you're talking about.
One is when you appreciate how quick the brain

00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:41.799
is and how biased it is to taking in negative
experiences, it's like a sponge for the negative.

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:48.200
The key distinction is between mindful awareness
of something negative, physical pain, worry

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.510
about something, internal sense of pressure,
whatever it might be. Mindful awareness of

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:59.029
that in which you're holding it in a space
of untroubled awareness is completely different

00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:06.259
from marinating in it, from ruminating about
it, from being preoccupied, looping around

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:11.919
that track in hell, digging in a little deeper
each time you go around it. Yuck.

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:17.539
I think for many people what's transformative
for them is to realize that they don't need

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:21.990
to do that. There's a teacher of mine at one
point. He said, "Think the same crazy thought

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:27.251
again and again. That's okay, but 10 is enough,"
right? At some point you just go, "I'm not

00:27:27.251 --> 00:27:31.460
learning anything else from this. There's
no more value here for me. I'm going to move

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.510
on." That's one of the big takeaways. It's
the feeling that your inner being is like

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:40.730
a temple. Here's a maybe potentially gross
metaphor. I grew up with dogs. Temples have

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.980
dogs. Sometimes they come in. Maybe they leave
a mess.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.809
What do you do? If you hate the dog or attack
the dog, that's just more mess in your temple.

00:27:48.809 --> 00:27:52.269
You got to shoo the dog out of the temple,
maybe prevent it from coming in the next time,

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:56.500
and then clean the mess up before it stains
the floor. That's to me the proper way to

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.020
approach it, and to realize you have to do
that. It doesn't mean suppressing your feelings.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.090
It means experiencing them in a space of awareness
and then helping them on out the door. That's

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.539
a huge takeaway.

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:12.100
The other one, exactly like you said, is to
have a learning orientation that says, "You

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.070
know, whatever has happened to me so far and
whatever the tough hand that's been dealt

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:22.409
me in this life, I can everyday look for these
little opportunities to experience something

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:27.269
good either because I'm just noticing it happening
usually or occasionally I get something good

00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:32.970
going. Either way it's now present in my mind.
I'm going to help it sink into my soul. I'm

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:37.960
going to give myself the gift and kind of
an intimacy with my own experience moment

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960
to moment.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.480
“I'm going to give myself the gift of receiving
this to grow it inside myself both for happiness

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.999
and to have more strengths inside that enable
me to deal with tough things, and to have

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:52.960
more inside myself that I can then offer to
other people."

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.360
Rick, thank you so much for the work that
