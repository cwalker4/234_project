00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.602
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS YOU

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:08.575
MIGHT KNOW, TRUMP HAS PLUNGED
THE WORLD INTO A TRADE WAR.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.144
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING
DESPERATELY TO STOP IT, LIKE

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.748
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT
AND MAN NOT IMPRESSED BY HIS

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.817
GRANDSON'S MAGIC TRICK,
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.353
JUNCKER MET WITH TRUMP AT THE
WHITE HOUSE TODAY TO TRY TO TALK

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.256
TRUMP OUT OF HIS TRADE WAR WITH
THE E.U.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.860
AND IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS
VISIT, YESTERDAY TRUMP TWEETED,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.330
"THE EUROPEAN UNION IS COMING TO
WASHINGTON TOMORROW TO NEGOTIATE

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.965
A DEAL ON TRADE.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:35.235
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR THEM.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.470
BOTH THE U.S. AND THE E.U. DROP
ALL TARIFFS, BARRIERS, AND

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.839
SUBSIDIES!

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.678
THAT WOULD FINALLY BE CALLED
FREE MARKET AND FAIR TRADE!

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:49.249
HOPE THEY DO IT, WE ARE READY--
BUT THEY WON'T!"

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.185
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.687
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S LIKE IF YOUR PSYCHIATRIST

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.189
SAID, "IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE
COULD FIGURE OUT YOUR ISSUES

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.024
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.827
BUT AIN'T NO WAY THAT'S
HAPPENING, MAMA'S BOY.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:06.032
UH-OH, HERE COME THE
WATERWORKS.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.568
GO AHEAD AND SQUIRT THEM."

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:13.039
AND JUNCKER IS READY TO GO TO
THE MATTRESSES HERE.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.808
RESPONDING TO TRUMP'S THREATS OF
STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS,

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.043
JUNCKER SAID, "SO NOW WE WILL
ALSO IMPOSE IMPORT TARIFFS.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.545
THIS IS BASICALLY A STUPID
PROCESS, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.346
TO DO THIS.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.116
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.151
WE WILL NOW IMPOSE TARIFFS ON
MOTORCYCLES, HARLEY-DAVIDSON;

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.787
ON BLUE JEANS, LEVIS; ON
BOURBON.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.124
WE CAN ALSO DO STUPID."

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:31.524
( LAUGHTER ).

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:39.132
( CHEERS )
OH.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:39.299
OH.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.201
OH, WE KNOW EUROPEANS CAN DO
STUPID.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.970
I'VE MET PIERS MORGAN.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.208
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, HOLD ON, JUNCKER.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.177
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO OUT-STUPID THIS GUY?

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.813
&gt;&gt; BING, BING, BONG, BONG, BING,
BING, BING.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.682
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:01.187
(STAR SPANGLED BANNER)
GOD BLESS THE UNITED SHTATES.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.935
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO, YEAH, YEAH, GOOD
LUCK OUT-DUMBING THAT.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:21.941
HE'S LIKE THE BOBBY FISCHER OF
BEING A MORON-- HE'S ALWAYS

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.978
THREE MOVES AHEAD, AND HE'S
GROPING THE QUEEN.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.080
BUT TRUMP JUST WANTS EVERYONE TO
GET OFF HIS CASE, TWEETING,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.184
"WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE SNIPPING
AT YOUR HEELS DURING A

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.753
NEGOTIATION, IT WILL ONLY TAKE
LONGER TO MAKE A DEAL, AND THE

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.589
DEAL WILL NEVER BE AS GOOD AS IT
COULD HAVE BEEN WITH UNITY.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.426
NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING REALLY
WELL, BE COOL.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.661
THE END RESULT WILL BE WORTH
IT!"

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.230
"BE COOL"?

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.565
&gt;&gt; Jon: BE COOL!

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.599
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BE COOL.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.869
&gt;&gt; Jon: BE COOL, DADDY.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.405
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAY WHEN YOU'RE NEGOTIATING FOR

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:58.344
A BAG OF WEED, NOT PLUNGING THE
WORLD INTO AN ECONOMIC CRISIS.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.280
"IT'S JUST A FEW HUNDRED BILLION
DOLLARS WORTH OF TARIFFS.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.881
CHILLAX, BRO-SEF."

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.517
( LAUGHTER )
THIS AFTERNOONA THIS AFTERNOON,

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.186
THIS JUST HAPPENED?

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.990
THIS AFTERNOON,
TRUMP AND JUNCKER AGREED THAT

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.625
EUROPE WOULD AGREE TO IMPORT
MORE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.628
SOYBEANS WHILE NEGOTIATIONS
CONTINUED.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.566
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING, BECAUSE
THE PEOPLE GETTING HURT THE MOST

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.234
BY ALL THIS ARE FARMERS.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.803
FIRST, TRUMP SLAPPED A TARIFF ON
CHINESE SOLAR PANELS.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.772
THEN CHINA CAME BACK AND HIT US
WITH A TARIFF RIGHT IN THE

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.440
SOYBEANS.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.178
NOW TRUMP'S HITTING BACK WITH A
TARIFF ON SEAFOOD AND COSMETIC

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:32.879
PRODUCTS.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.348
SO IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT MORE
EXPENSIVE TO PUT MASCARA ON YOUR

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.650
GOLDFISH.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.020
( LAUGHTER )
THESE-- THESE ARE TRUMP'S

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.657
PEOPLE, AND HE IS RUINING THEIR
LIVELIHOODS.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.759
CHINA IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST
CONSUMER OF AMERICAN SOYBEANS,

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.496
AND NOW U.S. SOYBEAN PRICES HAVE
PLUNGED TO A TEN-YEAR LOW.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:51.798
OH, NO... IS WHAT I WOULD SAY IF
I KNEW HOW MUCH SOYBEANS USED TO

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:58.071
COST.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.740
( LAUGHTER )
SO TRUMP IS SCRAMBLING TO

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.444
APPEASE HIS FARMER BASE,
TWEETING THINGS LIKE, "CHINA IS

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.981
TARGETING OUR FARMERS, WHO THEY
KNOW I LOVE AND RESPECT, AS A

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.551
WAY OF GETTING ME TO CONTINUE
ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.852
OF THE U.S.

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:19.225
THEY ARE BEING VICIOUS IN WHAT
WILL BE THEIR FAILED ATTEMPT.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:24.397
WE WERE BEING NICE-- UNTIL NOW!"
"YES, I LOVE ALL MY FARMERS.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:30.436
THE OLD McDONALDS, THE ONE IN
THE DELL, THE INSURANCE GUYS--

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.305
♪ I LOVE FARMERS
BUM, BA, DUM, DA, DUM

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:36.676
DA, DUM, DUM" ♪
BUT TRUMP IS--

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.678
( APPLAUSE )
ARE THEY A SPONSOR?

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.946
ARE THEY A SPONSOR?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.949
THEY'RE A SPONSOR!

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.321
AND TRUMP IS PUTTING OUR MONEY
WHERE HIS STUPID MOUTH IS

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:51.124
BECAUSE YESTERDAY, HE ANNOUNCED
PLANS TO SEND $12 BILLION TO

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.892
FARMERS HURT BY RETALIATORY
TARIFFS.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:53.893
THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.828
NORMALLY, TRUMP ONLY PAYS
130 GRAND TO PEOPLE HE'S

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.531
SCREWED.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.568
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:06.572
SO IT LOOKS LIKE-- NOTHING?

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.775
NOTHING?
TOO LATE!

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.411
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S MOVING
FORWARD.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.281
AND IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT IT,
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.951
ANNOUNCED IT WILL UTILIZE A
GREAT DEPRESSION-ERA LAW TO SEND

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.388
PAYMENTS TO PRODUCERS OF DAIRY,
HOGS, AND CERTAIN CROPS.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.058
AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE GOING
AWESOME WHEN YOUR SOLUTION IS,

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:29.095
"HEY, WHAT DID WE DO DURING THE
GREAT DEPRESSION?"

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.480
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH "CBS
THIS MORNING"'S JOHN DICKERSON.
