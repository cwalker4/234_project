00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.471
-President Trump freaked out
about the Russia investigation

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.705
this morning after returning

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.640
from a very awkward
international summit.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.109
For more on this, it's time
for "A Closer Look."

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.113
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.451
Trump was at the G20 summit
in Argentina over the weekend

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.920
as he faced his most serious
legal threat yet

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.022
from the Russia investigation,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.557
which right off the bat
has to be weird.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.127
Every time Trump goes to one of
these international summits,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.928
he's under a cloud of suspicion.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.231
He's like a guy
who goes on a date

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.631
and tries to ignore the fact

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.201
that his ankle bracelet
is beeping like crazy.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.502
[ Laughter ]

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.437
[ As Trump ] What? No.
That's just like a Fitbit.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.875
That noise means -- it just
means I got my steps in."

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.742
[ Normal voice ]
And from day one,

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:46.345
the constant and
increasingly damning revelations

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.647
from the Russia investigation
have made Trump's relationships

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:50.517
with other world leaders
super awkward.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.552
For example, in Bob Woodward's
book "Fear,"

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.355
Woodward describes Trump
calling his Egyptian counterpart

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.623
and President,
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.193
saying, "Donald, I'm worried
about this investigation.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.794
Are you going to be around?"

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.163
Trump said it was
like a kick in the nuts.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.865
Although in fairness,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.434
Trump always looks like he
just got kicked in the nuts.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.236
[ Laughter and applause ]
Right?

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:14.307
And...
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.309
...look at the way he stands.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:19.445
The way he stands looks
like a freeze frame

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.914
from "America's Funniest
Home Videos."

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.515
He looks like a dad

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.752
who was standing on
the wrong end of a seesaw.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.320
[ Laughter ]

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.423
And you could see
how lonely Trump was

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.758
throughout the G20 summit.
On Friday, for example,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.561
world leaders gathered
for the traditional group photo.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.895
And after the photo was done,

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.398
Trump just sort of milled around
by himself for a while.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.834
[ Laughter ]
Look at him.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.135
[ Laughter ]

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.870
He looks like he's
at a house party

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.774
and the only other person
he knows is in the bathroom.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.209
Surprised he didn't do that move

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.811
where you pretend
to respond to texts,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.113
but in reality, you're just
playing Words With Friends.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.282
[ Laughter ]

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.484
Trump is desperate.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.219
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.722
Trump is desperate to socialize
at these things,

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.791
but he's so bad at it.
For example, he signed

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.659
a new trade deal
with Mexico's president

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.527
and Canada's prime minister,
Justin Trudeau,

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:09.963
who he's repeatedly attacked.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.631
Trump tried to claim the dispute
had made them better friends,

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.500
but Trudeau
didn't seem to agree.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.472
-I'm honored to be here with
President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto --

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:23.542
become a great friend --
of Mexico

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.745
and Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau,

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.780
who has also become
a great friend.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.682
It's been a battle,

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.984
and battles sometimes
make great friendships.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:33.619
So it's really terrific.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.622
-Look at his face.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:40.826
Absolutely nothing.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:44.464
That face is the closest thing
Canada has to a middle finger.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.666
[ Laughter ]

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.368
In fact,
on Canadian television --

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.271
on Canadian TV, that face
is considered so obscene,

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.275
it has to be blurred out.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.010
And even when someone does want
to be friendly with Trump,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.213
he messes it up.
For example, he was supposed to

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.114
take a photo with
the president of Argentina.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.318
But watch as Trump walks away
from the shoot early

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.454
and is caught muttering
off camera on a hot mic

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.022
while the president of Argentina

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.991
stands there awkwardly
by himself.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:15.028
[ Indistinct conversations ]

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:25.204
-Get me out of here.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.706
-That's right.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.308
Trump was caught on a hot mic,
saying, "Get me out of here."

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:32.779
First of all, we're trying.
Second, why?

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.714
Why can't...

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.984
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:41.187
Why can't you stand still
for like 10 seconds?

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.855
I've had better luck
getting my dog

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.957
to take a Christmas photo
in her Santa hat.

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:46.125
[ Laughter ]

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.693
Is there a more exhausting job

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:49.962
than a man who has to chase
President Trump?

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.064
[ Laughter ]
"Go get him, Gary."

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.899
"Uh..."

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.236
The only person Trump ever seems
truly comfortable with is

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.405
at these summits is Russian
President Vladimir Putin.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.140
So Trump must have been
super Bummed

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.109
when he was forced to cancel
his meeting with Putin

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.311
after his ex-lawyer,
Michael Cohen, admitted

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.279
in a plea deal
that he lied about plans

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.683
to build a Trump Tower in Moscow
during the 2016 campaign.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.885
Although when he was asked
about the meeting with Putin,

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.987
Trump insisted
that he canceled it

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.522
not because of the guilty plea

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.325
but because of a naval skirmish
between Russia and Ukraine.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.427
And as usual, Trump made clear

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.997
that he definitely
knows the specific details

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.465
of what happened
in that naval skirmish.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.234
-You know, frankly, in light of
what happened with Ukraine,

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.838
with the ships and the sailors,

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.472
it just wouldn't be
the right time.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.808
We can't allow certain things
to happen.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.978
And you know, it happened.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:42.448
-Okay, so, he has no idea
what happened.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.884
All he knows is it had something
to do with ships and sailors.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.754
This is what I think went down.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.022
The National Security Advisor
briefed Trump and told him,

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:51.824
"Okay, Mr. President,
all you have to do is

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.692
tell the press
that the United States

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:56.762
is protesting the seizure
of Ukrainian naval personnel

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:58.631
by Russian forces
in the Black Sea

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.299
in violation of
international law."

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.401
And then Trump just, like,
stared at him for 30 seconds,

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:06.038
and the
National Security Adviser

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.040
said, "Just say Russians seized
Ukrainian naval personnel."

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.241
And then Trump stared at him
for another 30 seconds.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.610
And then he said,
"You know what?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.511
just say it's
about ships and sailors."

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.446
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:18.317
The revelation that Trump
was pursuing a business deal

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:21.186
with Putin in the summer of 2016
during the presidential campaign

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:22.755
is probably
the most damning development

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.023
in the investigation so far.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.591
It makes clear that not only
have Trump

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.593
and his closest associates
lied repeatedly,

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.829
both to the American people
and to Congress,

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.465
but also that Special Counsel
Robert Mueller knows they lied

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:35.868
and he can prove they lied.
And now Trump is freaking out,

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:38.303
unleashing an angry tirade
this morning on Twitter.

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.738
-The President wrote this.

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.175
"Michael Cohen asked judge
for no prison time.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:44.744

off scot-free.

He lied for this outcome and
should, in my opinion,

serve a full and complete
sentence.

that he will not be forced

by a rogue and
out-of-control prosecutor

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:20.613
to make up lies and stories
about President Trump.

still have guts."

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.885
-Damn. There are only two
explanations here.

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.421
Either he got more
bad legal news this morning

or someone kicked him
in the nuts again.

Also, I have a few questions.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.195
First of all, you know
"scot-free"

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:40.199
is spelled with one "T," right?
It's not a person's name.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.634
Trump probably thinks Scott Free

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.970
was the first person
to get way with a crime.

In order to believe
that Trump did nothing wrong,

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.373
you'd have to believe that he
and his closest associates

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:23.976
have been lying for three years,
including to Congress,

under penalty of perjury
because they're innocent.

Just think about how many times
their story has changed.

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.415
First, they said

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.217
there were no contacts
with any Russians, period.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.419

they did try to collude,

nothing came of it.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:36.589
Then, they said collusion
is not a crime.

And now Trump's defenders
are reduced to insisting

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.860
that he wasn't personally
involved in the hacking himself.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.928
-Robert Mueller and
his team of partisans

The hacking -- that's absurd.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.241
Trump wasn't involved in that.

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.910
-Of course he wasn't.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.545
Trump couldn't
hack into a computer

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.647
even if the password
was "Melania."

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.950
[ Laughter ]

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.918
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:06.918 --> 00:08:10.255
-Trump's ex-lawyer
lied to Congress

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:11.857
about a business deal
with the Russian government,

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:14.192
and he told investigators
he lied because Trump lied,

00:08:14.192 --> 00:08:15.661
and Mueller can prove it.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.663
Every new legal filing
from Mueller makes clear

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.898
that he knows
what really happened.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:20.099
And when Mueller's
done with him,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.700
I have a feeling
Trump will be saying...

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.536
-Get me out of here.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.604
-This has been
"A Closer Look."

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:28.374
[ Cheers and applause ]
