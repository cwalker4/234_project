00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.910
It's been over nine years since the tragic
death of Michael Jackson, who left behind

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.500
an incredible legacy in the music world.
Jackson left behind Prince Michael Joseph

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.480
Jackson (born 1997), Paris-Michael Katherine
Jackson (born 1998), and Prince Michael Jackson

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.460
II, also known by the name “Blanket” (born
2002). His eldest two children were born during

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.620
Jackson’s marriage to his second wife, Debbie
Rowe, while his youngest son was born to a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.090
surrogate mother. After Jackson’s death,
his mother, Katherine, was granted temporary

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.720
guardianship of the children.
Each of the children were left a hefty inheritance,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.650
as reported by Bank Rate and Daily Mail has
reported they get a yearly allowance of $8

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.760
million. According to Celebrity Net Worth,
each of the children is worth an estimated

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.670
$100 million. Get to know more about each
of the kids and where they are now.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.890
Prince Michael Joseph Jackson.
Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., also known as

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.719
"Prince," is the first child of pop star,
now at the age of 21.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.700
Although Debbie Rowe is certain to be Michael
Jr.'s biological mother, who his biological

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.340
father is has come in to question. Despite
the public curiosity, Michael Jr. doesn't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.030
understand why the subject is an issue.
"Every time someone asks me that," Prince

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.049
says about who his real father is, "I ask,
'What's the point? What difference does it

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.189
make?' Specifically to someone who's not involved
in my life. How does that affect your life?

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.759
It doesn't change mine," he said in 2017.
In 2013 Michael Jr. made his first foray into

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.079
being a media personality. He served as a
guest correspondent for the entertainment

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:57.310
news program Entertainment Tonight. On the
show, Michael Jr. interviewed James Franco,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.419
Zach Braff and director Sam Raimi about their
film Oz the Great and Powerful. He has expressed

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:08.000
an interest in getting more involved in show
business, telling Entertainment Tonight that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.570
"I'm looking to become well-rounded as a producer,
director, screenwriter and actor."

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.990
“Music is a big part of my life,” Jackson
said in 2016. “It shaped who I am because

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.890
of my family, but I’ve always wanted to
go into production. My dad would ask me what

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.140
I wanted to do and my answer was always producing
and directing.”

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.320
Jackson graduated from Buckley School, located
in Sherman Oaks, California, in May 2015.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.890
Paris and Prince have often been spotted on
red carpets together in recent years. He is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.190
a student at Loyola Marymount University and
is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.340
Michael Jackson’s Daughter Paris Jackson.
Paris Jackson has transformed into an “it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.620
girl”, now at the age of 20. She has been
living on the property of her father’s estate

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.140
and has even locked down some modeling gigs
with IMG Models. Though she clearly is close

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.150
with some of her family members, some of whom
celebrated her 20th birthday with her, she

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.990
caught heat for not attending her aunt, Janet
Jackson’s, 2018 Billboard Music Awards performance.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.400
In response to haters, Paris wrote online,
“No one from my mgmt reached out to me about

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.380
attending billboards or about the award, and
no one from my family did either. I had absolutely

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.340
no idea until y’all spammed with hatred.”
Over the years, Paris has dealt with many

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.460
obstacles and issues. She revealed that she
was sexually assaulted at age 14 by an older

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.100
man she described as a “complete stranger”.
She was also cyber-bullied and said that all

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.200
the turmoil drove her to attempt suicide three
times. Fortunately, she was able to overcome

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.361
her depression.
Paris has appeared in several projects. She

00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:00.340
was on the show Star and made her film debut
in Gringo in 2018.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.170
Prince Michael Jackson II aka “Blanket”
Jackson.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.390
Prince Michael Jackson II is Michael Jackson's
youngest child, now at the age of 16.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.540
On November 19, 2002, Michael Jackson carried
his then-9-month-old son, Blanket, to the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.729
balcony of a hotel and, unintentionally, alarmed
many when they worried a dangling Blanket

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.380
would fall. A towel covered Blanket’s face
at the time. At the time of the incident,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.240
Michael Jackson released the following statement,
“I offer no excuses for what happened. I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.020
got caught up in the excitement of the moment.
I would never intentionally endanger the lives

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.250
of my children.”
So, where did the name “Blanket” come

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.360
from? Michael Jackson stating that, “It’s
an expression I use with my family and my

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.810
employees. “I say, ‘you should blanket
me, you should blanket her with something—meaning,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.479
like, a blanket is a blessing. It’s a way
of us showing our love and caring.” Though

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:04.190
“Blanket” may be a blessing to Michael
Jackson, his son now goes by B.G. or Bigi.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.360
In 2017 grandmother Katherine’s guardianship
of Blanket was turned over to 34-year-old

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.590
cousin Tito Joe Jackson, since Katherine is
87 years old. Tito Joe was previously a co-guardian

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.999
of all three children.
Blanket Jackson was recently spotted in Los

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.820
Angeles and, seriously he has grown since
the last time we saw him.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.909
It appears that Prince Jackson II loves books
as he was photographed while leaving the Barnes

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.490
&amp; Noble store near Calabasas recently. Both
Blanket’s grandmother, Katherine Jackson,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.990
and older brother, Michael Joseph Jr., live
in the area.
