00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:11.820
Vitamin k2 -  I had a viewer, Richard
Dixon. He asked about vitamin K2.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.929
Here's his - he gave us his
experience. He had a good experience with

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.480
it.
"Hey doc, have you heard about vitamin k2?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
Combine it with vitamin D3. Check it out.
Enough said."

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.470
You know,  I thought I had done one on K2.
We've heard it quite a bit in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.890
the (PrevMed) community.  I've done a little bit on
it. Actually I went back and looked and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.700
it's one of those that's in the queue. So
I moved it up in the queue -  because again

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.820
because of the interest in the community.   Richard goes on to say, " Look,six years

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
ago I had a knee replacement surgery on
my right knee. The pre-op exam showed a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.600
lot of calcification in the arteries and
vessels around my heart. My knee surgeon

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.070
put me on k2 - MK 7."  (and you'll see what
that is in just a minute). " I've never

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.220
heard of it but it seems it's really
good for clearing up plaque in just a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.409
few months.  Just a few months ago  -six
years later I had the left knee replaced.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.090
The cardiologist showed me my
chest x-ray -  which showed no calcium

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.650
deposits at all." You hear a lot
about it. You you don't see it in a lot

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.030
of standard recommendations. What is
it. Why are you not seeing a lot of it?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.570
Let's talk about it. It's a vitamin. K2
But first, a brief introduction - my name

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:49.350
is Ford Brewer F-O-R-D B-R-E-W-ER. PrevMed. I've  been doing preventative medicine for over

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.020
30 years. I started off as an ER doc. I got
tired of seeing things that need to be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.430
prevented (like early heart attack &amp; stroke). So I went to Johns Hopkins for
training. I ended up running the program.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:07.079
Again, I'm still doing prevention. It doesn't pay
very well.  But that's my legacy. I want to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:15.390
prevent disease rather than
then then cure it. Let's talk about

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.240
Vitamins k1 and k2 .Vitamin V1 has the
chemical name called phylloquinone.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:33.120
Vitamin k2 is menaquinone. Both are
fat soluble. Menaquinone has subtypes. I

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410
quote a study -  I go through a randomized
clinical trial a little bit later - at the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.850
end of this survey. Iit's using m4
through m7, menaquinone m4 through m7.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.670
That gets back to Richard Dixon's
comments about m7  - which is what he was

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.930
given by his orthopedist. Now what are
the sources ? Green leafy vegetables for

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:04.500
vitamin k1 - very different meats eggs and
cheeses for vitamin k2. What does vitamin

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.200
k1 do in the body? It's a cofactor -( gamma
glutamyl carboxylation) well vitamin

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.130
k2 is the same thing - ( and don't get too
wrapped up in that. I know that you

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.650
know sometimes get medical geeky terms.) 
Basically these are the types of enzymes.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:32.070
They assist in the body's processes.
Here's the difference though- vitamin k1

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.350
is involved with coagulation process - with
FACTORS 7, 9, AND 10.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.940
Vitamin k2,however is involved in
tissue calcification processes -

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.320
especially in tissue
calcification, in bony tissue and artery

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.230
walls.
So again  - the dietary source is very, very

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:09.840
different  - green leafy vegetables for k1
and meats,  cheeses &amp; eggs for k2. Of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.720
course you could get either one as a
supplement.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.389
What's the literature (scientific evidence) been on K 2
and K 1?

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.460
Results from lab animals and human
studies were recording vitamin K in

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.370
general and cardiovascular risk have
been inconsistent. How much of this

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.020
inconsistency is due to the fact
that there's been a failure in most

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.690
research to differentiate between K 1
and K 2?    The Nurses Health Study -  I

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.450
think about forty thousand nurses. They did
see some moderate decrease in risk. But

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.530
they were looking at K1. It looked
like the health professionals follow-up

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.120
study -  again tens of thousands of people -
no change. The Rotterdam study with some change.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.370
There was follow-up. They did both K 1
and K 2 -  no change with K 1 but some

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:23.930
decrease in cardiovascular risk with K 2.
As I mentioned I I pulled up one of the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.560
studies that created a lot of the the
questions and focus around this area.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:38.720
It's still an old study - 2009. Its
ATHEROSCLEROSIS Journal 2009 volume 2

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.450
203 issue number 2 pages 489-493.The

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:56.000
author was Buelens  and
associates. They saw something five

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.680
hundred and sixty four women -
postmenopausal. They did a food

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.530
questionnaire and then estimates of k1
and k2 from the food questionnaire.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.280
62%  of the women  or 360 of them had positive

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.820
coronary artery calcium scores.  One of
my other viewers asked me to do a video

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:25.000
about that (CACS) (I'll be doing that soon - we've done a few - and are now on a series on CACS)  But
 let's go back to vitamin K 2.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.680
coronary artery calcium score,by the way,
is calcification

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.880
in the walls of the artery of the heart
it's indicative of past inflammation in

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.530
the walls of the artery of the heart and
inflammation. As we've said many times in

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:50.320
many other videos inflammation is the major risk
factor for heart attack and stroke. I

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:59.270
personally have some. I had coronary
artery calcium score about two weeks ago.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:07.910
I had a score of I think it was 81 put
me in about a 57% risk for my age. This

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:15.380
is an age-related risk. And again I'll do
other videos. And I have done other

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.900
videos regarding my own risk. I have some
significant genetic challenges which

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.930
I've overcome fairly well. (Anyway I said
I wasn't going to talk about coronary

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.979
artery calcium score - sorry).  Vitamin k1  - in the
Buelens study they looked at the

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:42.409
probability of calcification.  Tthey
saw an N of 1.17  -  oops - I mean a relative risk

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:50.750
of 1.17 -  with a p-value for 95% of 0.96
to 1.42.  So what does that mean? Let me

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.740
go through some epidemiology. It's actually pretty simple:

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.500
if your relative risk is 1 -  
there's no change. If your relative risk

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:08.659
is 1.17 that means you've got a little more risk  - 17% more risk. What are

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:12.380
these numbers? That's for taking
vitamin k. But what are these numbers

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.599
over here well when you do a study.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:23.960
You're only looking at the probability
of a random event. so then you

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.430
develop parameters on either side -  so
what they said was this, "Given the

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.380
statistics - the high number of people in
this study and a 95 percent probability -

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:44.420
the relative risk is 95 percent
probability

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:51.920
between point nine six and one point
four. In other words it could be 1. So

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.709
the way we would interpret this study
for vitamin k1 is that vitamin k1 really

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:02.260
has no relative risk. It does not decrease
risk &amp;it does not increase risk

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.389
significantly for cardio vascular
calcification  - or coronary artery calcium

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:15.860
score.  Vitamin k2 however came up with a
point eight and the probability 95%

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:25.300
probability parameters for 0.65 and 0.98
So basically what this says is -

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:32.540
with 95% probability - with vitamin k2 you
tended to get a lower coronary artery

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:42.050
calcium score.  Now this was positive - but
not really earth-shaking. What have you

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:47.269
seen since then ? I couldn't find a lot
more in the literature since then. I also

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:53.380
had some question about the the
mechanism  - because we know from following

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.949
coronary or arterial
inflammation  - if you have it in the

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:02.029
coronaries you have it everywhere else.
We actually usually look for it using a

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:07.699
CIMT in the neck because there's no easy to get (to the coronary arteries.) It's very very accurate

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:12.649
and reliable and we can follow it on a
serial basis(meaning time and again to follow the progression.) What we find on a

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:21.350
serial basis is this once you get
calcification in a certain plaque  - that

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.750
plaque has tended to stabilize. So we
WANT to take a soft plaque and calcify

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:35.240
it (Calcification of plaque happens when the plaque is stabilizing.). So one of my questions is this, - even
if you're able to calcify or to remove

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:42.440
calcium from calcified plaque  - what does
that really accomplish the stabilization

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:51.290
of the plaque? Isn't removing
the calcium from hardening

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:57.600
plaque  removing the stabiity?- (Calfication is )getting rid of the soft
plaque. Again as we follow patients

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.649
-as we're getting appropriate treatment
for them and decreasing their risk  - we

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:05.339
will see a progression from soft plaque (with no calcium) 
to (stable plaque with) calcification.

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:11.720
So again vitamin k2 may work in terms of
pulling calcium out it may or may not

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.449
actually decrease risk. even if it does. I'd
love to hear what you've seen. Especially

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:22.699
if there is any further research in this
area. Thank you!
