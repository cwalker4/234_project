00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.569
The President: Thank you
very much, thank you everybody.

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.471
(Applause.)

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.841
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.644
Thank you, Matt,
for that great introduction.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.046
And thank you
for this big crowd.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.148
This is incredible,
really incredible.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:15.982
(Applause.)

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.884
We've all come
a long way together.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.152
We've come a long way together.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.689
I'm thrilled to be back at CPAC,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.624
with so many
of my wonderful friends

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.761
and amazing supporters,
and proud conservatives.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.230
(Applause.)

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.965
Remember when I first
started running?

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.534
Because I wasn't
a politician, fortunately.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.170
But do you remember I started
running and people would say,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.471
 Are you sure he's
a conservative? 

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:43.643
I think now we've proved
that I'm a conservative, right?

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.479
(Applause.)

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.182
For more than four decades,
this event has served

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.951
as a forum for our nation's
top leaders,

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.887
activists, writers, thinkers.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.357
Year after year, leaders
have stood on this stage

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.959
to discuss what
we can do together

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.096
to protect our heritage,
to promote our culture,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.664
and to defend our freedom.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.235
CPAC has always been
about big ideas

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.973
and it's also been about
putting those ideas into action.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:18.044
And CPAC really has put
a lot of ideas into action.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.346
We'll talk about some
of them this morning.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.816
For the last year,
with your help,

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:28.288
we have put more great
conservative ideas into use

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:32.625
than perhaps ever before
in American history.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.494
(Applause.)

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.496
Right?

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.101
By the way, what a nice picture
that is, look at that.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.603
I'd love to watch
that guy speak.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.338
(Laughter.)

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.673
Oh, boy.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:59.786
That's a --

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.357
I try like hell to hide
that bald spot, folks.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.291
I work hard at it.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.560
(Applause.)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.264
It doesn't look bad -- hey, we're 
hanging in, we're hanging in.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.866
We're hanging in there, right?

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.970
Together, we're hanging in.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.706
We've confirmed
a record number --

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.941
so important --
of circuit court judges,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.544
and we are going to be
putting in a lot more.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:27.413
(Applause.)

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.983
And they will interpret
the law as written.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.486
And we've confirmed
an incredible new

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.588
Supreme Court justice,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.524
a great man, Neil Gorsuch.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.959
(Applause.)

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.961
Right?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:49.536
We've passed massive --
biggest in history --

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.405
tax cuts and reforms.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.408
(Applause.)

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.010
You know, I don't use
the word reform. 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.278
There was a lot of reform, too.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.946
Very positive reform,
I don't use it.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.981
And when we were first doing it,

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.917
I told everybody --
everybody gathered --

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.618
I said,  Just talk
about tax cuts.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.121
People don't know
what reform means.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.256
They think reform
might mean it's going up. 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.026
And I said,
"Do tax cuts."

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:20.833
Audience Member:  (Inaudible.)

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.335
Audience: Booo --

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.304
Audience Member: (Inaudible.)

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:34.013
Audience: USA! USA! USA!

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:37.850
The President: Thank you,
how did he get in here, Matt?

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.823
Boy, okay.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.825
Just for the media,
the fake news back there,

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.927
they took very good care of him.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.829
They were very gentle.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.431
(Laughter.)

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:56.736
He was very obnoxious,
it was only one person.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.504
So, we have thousands
of people here.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.872
(Applause.)

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.442
So, listen -- tomorrow,
the headline will be,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:07.880
 Protestors disturbed
the Trump -- one person, folks.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.382
Doesn't deserve a mention.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.452
Doesn't deserve a headline.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.686
The headline tomorrow:

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:17.890
 Disrupters of CPAC. 
One person.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.359
And he was very nice --
we looked at him,

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.593
and he immediately left, okay.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:27.900
(Laughter and applause.)

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.969
No, I've had it too often.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.505
You'll have one person, and you
can hardly even hear him.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.074
In fact, the biggest, really,
disturbance are you people.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.044
You know why, he'll say
something; nobody hears him.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.145
Because it's all --

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.214
and then the crowd
will start screaming at him.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.983
And then all of a sudden,
we stop for -- and that's okay.

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.385
You have to show
your spirit, right?

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.788
You have to show
your spirit, it's true.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.057
(Applause.)

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.059
So, we passed
the biggest tax cuts

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.794
in the history of our country.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:58.164
And it was called
 tax cut and reform. 

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.334
And I said to our people,
don't use the word  reform. 

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.036
Because we were going to
call it the Tax Reform Act. 

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:06.305
I said, "No wonder for 45 years
nothing has been passed." 

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.075
Because people want tax cuts,

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:10.743
and they don't know
what reform means.

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.945
Reform can mean you're
going to pay more tax.

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.083
So, I convinced politicians
who have done this

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.351
all their lives --

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:20.186
and they do a great job,
in many cases --

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.021
but this was one --
they were going,

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.256
the  Tax Reform Act 

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.125
of whatever year we want to put.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.261
Okay?

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.130
So, they have the Tax
Reform Act, and that was it.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:36.569
And now it was called the Tax
Act -- Tax Cut Act and Jobs.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.505
We had to add  jobs  into it
because we're picking up

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:42.308
a tremendous number of jobs --

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.778
2.7 million jobs
since the election.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.614
2.7.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.417
(Applause.)

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:55.822
So, now, people hear tax cuts,
and it has been popular.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.657
Remember, it started off
a little slow.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.327
Then it got passed,
and we had some great help.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.695
I will say, we had some great

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.897
help in the Senate,
in the House.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.400
We have guys here today --
we have a lot of congressmen,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.102
we have a lot of senators.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.704
We had a lot of help,
and we got it passed.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.172
Just -- it was not easy.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.975
We didn't have
one Democrat vote,

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:18.044
and I think that's going to
cost them in the midterms.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.447
I know that whoever wins the
presidency has a disadvantage,

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.416
for whatever reason,
in the midterms.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.284
You know what happens?
I'm trying to figure it out.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.121
Because historically,
if you win the presidency,

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.589
you don't do well
two years later.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.458
And you know what?
We can't let that happen.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.526
(Applause.)

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.194
And I know what happens,
I finally figured it out.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.796
Nobody has been able
to explain it.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:38.731
It just happens, statistically,

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.633
almost all of the time
for many years.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:44.804
What happens is, you fight
so hard to win the presidency.

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.439
You fight, fight, fight.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.342
And now only two years --
that's a very short period.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.444
And by the time you start
campaigning, it's a year.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.981
And now you got to go
and fight again.

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.383
But you just won.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:00.319
So, nobody has that
same drive that they had.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.790
So, you end up
not doing that well

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.492
because the other side
is going -- they're crazed.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.928
And, by the way, they're crazed
anyway, these people.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.496
They are really crazed.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.565
(Laughter and applause.)

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.599
Right?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.069
So -- because I kept trying
to say, "Why is this?" 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.671
But it's just there.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.941
So, the great enthusiasm --
you know, you're sitting back,

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.843
you're watching television.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.945
 Maybe I don't have
to vote today;

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.513
we just won the presidency. 

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:31.551
And then we get clobbered,
and we can't let that happen.

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:35.822
We get clobbered in '18,
and we can't let that happen --

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:39.826
only because we are so happy,
we passed so many things.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.094
Honestly, and I'll say --

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:43.830
I'll use the word
 my administration 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.932
as opposed to me --

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.934
my administration, I think,

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.102
has had the most
successful first year

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.672
in the history
of the presidency.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:55.875
I really believe that.
I really believe it.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:58.377
I really believe it.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.645
(Applause.)

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:05.084
So, I mean, judges,
regulations, everything.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:13.192
And the beautiful thing
about the tax cuts

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.894
is nobody thought
we could do it.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.563
Because again, we had to get
100 percent of our vote.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.932
And nobody thought
we could do it.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:24.403
And, frankly --
I mean, to me we got it

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.873
and it's turned out to be
one of the most popular things.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.875
And, by the way, for the
Republicans in this room,

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.344
of which I assume --
would you say,

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.881
is it 99 percent, Matt,
or 100 percent? Huh?

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.416
I would hope it's close to --

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:38.851
you know what, hey,

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.187
we probably have some Democrats
that want to come over.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.956
We have a great governor
from West Virginia

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.625
that left
the Democratic Party --

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.926
Big Jim --

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.028
and he came over
to the Republican Party.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:54.066
(Applause.)

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:57.069
So, people are sitting there,
and they're saying,

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.571
 Oh, we just had
that great victory.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.773
Eh, let's not vote,
let's go to a movie.

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:03.476
We're the Republican Party,
we're going to do great. 

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:05.211
And then they end up losing.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.979
So, you got to keep up
the enthusiasm.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.849
Now what happens,
by the way, they lose.

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:12.585
And then you have
the presidential election

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.320
coming up again,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.324
and you clobber them because
everybody gets off their ass

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.859
and they get out and they work.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.629
Right? And they work.
And they work and work and work.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.934
And you end up winning
the Presidency again.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:28.935
And we should do that --

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.670
hopefully we're going
to do that very easily.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.740
But never -- we have to worry --

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.676
right now, we have a big race
coming up in '18.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:39.845
You have to get out. You have
to just get that enthusiasm.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.680
Keep it going.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.348
(Applause.)

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.383
See, the word, really,
is  complacent. 

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.386
People get complacent.
It's a natural instinct.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:50.723
You just won, and now you're
happy and you're complacent.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.292
Don't be complacent, okay,
don't be complacent.

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:59.031
Because if they get in,
they will repeal your tax cuts,

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.268
they will put judges in that
you wouldn't believe,

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.637
they'll take away
your Second Amendment,

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.006
which we will never
allow to happen.

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.841
They'll take away your
Second Amendment.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:25.091
(Applause.)

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:29.929
Audience:  Donald Trump!

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.565
Donald Trump!

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.570
The President:  Remember that.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.373
They will take away --
thank you.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:44.510
They will take away
those massive tax cuts

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.379
and they will take away
your Second Amendment.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.314
By the way, if you only had
a choice of one,

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.115
what would you rather have?

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.549
The Second Amendment
or the tax cuts?

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:54.353
Go ahead, Second Amendment,
tax cuts.

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:57.289
Second Amendment.

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.291
(Applause.)

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.993
I'm going to leave it
at the Second Amendment.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.495
I don't want to get into
that battle, all right?

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.931
We're going to say you want --
Matt, we're going to say

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.933
you want the
Second Amendment the most.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.769
But we're going to get them all.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.270
And remember this --

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.105
(Applause.)

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.307
-- remember this, we've gotten
-- you know,

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.443
somebody got on
television recently

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.612
and they said, actually, this is
the first time I can remember --

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.847
Trump made campaign promises.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.649
He may be the only person

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.284
that actually fulfilled

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.786
more promises than he made.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:28.020
I think that's true.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.455
(Applause.)

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.757
I fulfilled more promises.

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.526
But we have
a very crooked media.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.730
We had a crooked candidate,
too, by the way.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:43.369
But we have a very,
very crooked media.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:49.375
Audience: Lock her up!

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.945
Lock her up!

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.214
Lock her up!

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.816
The President: I will
say this, folks,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.885
everything that's turning out,

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:03.189
now it's amazing
that's come full circle.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.726
Boy, have they committed a lot
of atrocities when you look.

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:08.694
(Applause.)

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.763
Right, when you look.

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.832
Have they done things
that are wrong.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.604
But remember this, not only did
we get the tax cuts,

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.606
which everybody said
we wouldn't get --

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:23.275
and, by the way, repealed,
in that tax cut,

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:25.878
the individual mandate,
which is a tremendous thing.

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.514
(Applause.)

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:32.184
This is where you're forced
to pay in order

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.886
not to have healthcare, okay?

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.087
Is that great?

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:38.824
You pay for the privilege
of not having healthcare.

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.626
So, you're subsidizing
lots of other people.

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:41.760
That's gone.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.130
I know people came up to me
with tears in their eyes;

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.365
they're saying, I'm forced
to pay not to have healthcare.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.833
Very unfair.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.336
And, by the way, we're having
tremendous plans

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:52.204
coming out now --
healthcare plans --

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:55.274
at a fraction of the cost that
are much better than Obamacare.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:58.210
(Applause.)

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.881
And except for one Senator,
who came into a room

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.349
at 3 o'clock
in the morning

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:06.185
and went like that -- we would
have had healthcare, too.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.453
Audience:  Booo --

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.188
The President:  We would have
had healthcare, too.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:11.223
Think of that.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.425
But I think we may be better
off the way we're doing it.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.427
It's piece by piece by piece.

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:18.998
Obamacare is just
being wiped out.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.734
The individual mandate,
essentially, wipes it out.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.303
So, I think we may
be better off.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.405
And people are getting
great healthcare plans

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:27.540
and we're not finished yet.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.143
But, remember, one person
walked into a room

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.846
when he was supposed
to go this way,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.649
and he said he was going
this way, and he walked in,

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.317
and he went this way,

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.952
and everyone said,
"What happened?"

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.921
"What was that all about?"

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.656
Boy, oh, boy,
who was that?

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.492
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.927
I don't want
to be controversial,

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.328
so I won't use his name, okay?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.463
(Laughter.)

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:55.734
What a mess,
but it's all happening anyway.

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.036
It's all happening anyway.

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:00.139
And we've, at the same time,

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:06.111
eliminated a record number
of job-killing regulations,

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:07.379
and people are
going back to work.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:09.215
(Applause.)

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:13.752
Right, people are
going back to work.

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.324
So -- and you know,
the fake news always --

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:22.828
if I say something that's like,
a little off, next day headline,

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:24.797
 He misrepresents --
I have to be careful.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:29.668
But in the history of
Presidents, no President --

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.104
and I'm saying no President.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.373
Now, maybe they'll find
I was off by two

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:37.243
but we're here one year.

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.111
No President --

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.313
well, I read it in lots
of good papers, actually.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.448
(Laughter.)

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.116
But they'll change the story
when I say it.

00:14:45.284 --> 00:14:49.455
No President has ever
cut so many regulations

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:52.324
in their entire term, okay --

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.592
(Applause.)

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.194
-- as we've cut in less
than a year.

00:14:55.194 --> 00:15:00.799
(Applause.)

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:06.071
And it's my opinion that the
regulations had as big an impact

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.574
as these massive tax
cuts that we've given.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.742
So, I really believe it.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.211
(Applause.)

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:15.414
We've ended the war on
American energy -- we were in war.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:21.186
And we've ended the war
on beautiful, clean coal.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:22.154
(Applause.)

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.056
One of our great
natural resources.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.260
And very important
for our defense -- coal --

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.662
very important for our defense.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:31.130
Because we have it.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.698
We don't have to
send it through pipes.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.301
We don't have to get it
from foreign countries.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:39.538
We have more than anybody,
and they wanted to end it.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.774
And our miners
have been mistreated

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.609
and they're not being
mistreated anymore.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.277
We're doing tremendous business.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:50.015
(Applause.)

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.651
I was in Vietnam,
and the Prime Minister

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.420
and the President
of Vietnam were there.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.988
And we have a massive
deficit with them,

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.156
like we do with everybody else

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:59.558
because these Presidents
have just let it go to hell.

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.927
We have the worst trade
deals you've ever seen.

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:03.696
So, we're changing it.

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.998
So, I said, we have too big
of a deficit with Vietnam;

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:06.965
I'm not happy.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.334
He said, "Well, but
we're going to --"

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:09.868
I said, "Buy coal, buy coal. 

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.904
They use a lot of coal,
buy coal."

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:15.174
And he said,  You know, we have
bought coal from West Virginia

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.608
and other places,

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.744
and it's the finest coal
we have ever used. 

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:19.845
It's interesting.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:21.947
And West Virginia
now is doing great.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.351
You look at what's
happening in West Virginia.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:27.820
You look at what's
happening in Pennsylvania.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.424
You look at what's
happening in Ohio.

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:35.361
And you look at what's
happening in Wyoming.

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:37.696
You look at what's
happening all over.

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:39.531
It's like a --
it's like a different world.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.003
And remember this: Virtually,
as soon as I got into office,

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:49.041
we approved
the Keystone XL pipeline

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.076
and the Dakota Access pipeline,

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.578
which would never
have been approved.

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:55.781
(Applause.)

00:16:55.781 --> 00:17:01.553
And we announced our withdrawal
from the totally disastrous,

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:05.057
job-killing,
wealth-knocking-out --

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.226
you know, it knocked out
our wealth, or it would have.

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:11.530
They basically wanted
to take our wealth away.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.300
They didn't want us
to use our wealth power.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:20.072
We knocked out
the Paris Climate Accord.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:21.707
Would have been a disaster.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.709
(Applause.)

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.744
Would have been a disaster
for our country.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:38.257
Audience:  USA! USA! USA!

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:41.894
The President:  You know,
basically, it said,

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.230
you have a lot of oil
and gas that we found --

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.865
you know, technology
has been amazing --

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.034
and we found things
that we never knew.

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.036
But we have massive --

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.805
just about the top
in the world --

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.140
we have massive energy reserves.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.842
We have coal,
we have so much.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.745
And basically, they were saying,
don't use it, you can't use it.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.614
So, what it does is it
makes us uncompetitive

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:04.316
with other countries.

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:05.751
It's not going to happen.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.352
I told them,
it's not going to happen.

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.054
And, you know, China,

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:12.124
their agreement didn't
kick in until 2030.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:16.094
Right? Our agreement
kicks in immediately.

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:20.966
Russia, they're allowed
to go back into the 1990s,

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.569
which was not a clean
environmental time.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:27.506
Other countries, big countries
-- India and others --

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.175
we had to pay,

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:33.045
because they considered
them a growing country.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:35.380
They were a growing country.
I said,  What are we? 

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.450
Are we allowed
to grow too, okay?

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.418
(Laughter.)

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.419
Now, are we allowed to grow?

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:44.323
(Applause.)

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.391
They called India
a  developing nation. 

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:48.961
They called China
a  developing nation. 

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.263
But the United States,
we're developed -- we can pay.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.933
So, folks, if you don't mind --
I'll tell you what --

00:18:54.933 --> 00:19:00.138
it's amazing how many people
understood the Paris Accord,

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:02.274
because it sounds so good.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.244
It's like some of the
environmental regulations

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:07.579
that I cut -- they have
the most beautiful titles.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.882
And sometimes I'd say,
"Look, I'm just going

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:12.184
to close my eyes and sign this
because, you know what,

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.552
I'm going to get
killed on this one." 

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:15.654
And I get so much thanks.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.155
The country knows
what I'm doing.

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.091
We couldn't build.
We couldn't farm.

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.627
If you had a puddle
on your land,

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.763
they called it a lake for
the purposes of environmentals.

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.965
(Applause.)
I mean, it's crazy. It's crazy.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:35.207
And I'd sign certain bills
and I'd have farmers behind me

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:38.210
and I'd have house builders,
home builders behind me.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.980
And these are tough people,
strong people.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.583
They fought hard, they've worked
all their lives, hard.

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.119
And they'd be --
half of them would be crying

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:49.855
because we gave them
their property back.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.524
We gave them the right to earn
a living, they couldn't do it.

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.926
They couldn't do
what they had to do.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.129
We gave them
their property back.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:59.097
We gave them their dignity back.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:07.439
(Applause.)

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:10.475
By the way, you don't mind
if I go off script a little bit

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.010
because, you know,
it's sort of boring.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.012
It's a little boring.

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:18.450
(Applause.)

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.885
Got this beautiful speech,

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.486
everything is wonderful
but a little boring.

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.622
We have to, you know --

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.557
But we gave them
their dignity back.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:31.697
And that's why our country
is doing record business.

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:34.132
We're doing record business.
We're doing business --

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.134
and you have to look
at the fundamentals.

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.271
Companies are pouring
back into this country.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.573
They're pouring back.
Not like --

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.876
I mean, when did you hear
about car companies

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.345
coming back into Michigan

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.413
and coming to Ohio
and expanding?

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:51.016
(Applause.)

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:52.484
When did you hear --
you never heard that.

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.654
You hear they're leaving.

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.122
I've been talking
about it for 20 years.

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.523
I was a private sector guy.

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.058
But for whatever reason,
I always had --

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:03.395
these guys always covered me
much more than anybody else.

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:05.364
I always got a lot
of these characters.

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:07.699
They used to treat me so good
too, until I ran for office.

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.234
I used to get
the greatest publicity.

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:10.736
A friend of mine said,
"You know,

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.937
you used to be the king

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.239
of getting great publicity,
what happened?"

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.641
I said, "Well, I have some views

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.510
that they're opposed to
for a lot of bad reasons." 

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.678
(Laughter.)

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.380
A lot of really bad reasons.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.816
But when you look at what's
happening to our country,

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.952
it's incredible.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.820
And the fundamentals
are so strong.

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:32.924
The stock market -- I just see
with all of the ups and downs --

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.926
since Election Day,

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:38.697
is up 37 percent
from Election -- 37 percent.

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.532
(Applause.)

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:45.170
Now, it did a little bit
of a correction.

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:47.439
In fact, I started to say --
you know,

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.875
I was in it for like 13,
14 months from election.

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:53.211
I say, "Is this sucker
ever going down a little bit?

00:21:53.211 --> 00:21:54.413
This is a little embarrassing."

00:21:54.413 --> 00:22:00.786
It was up 100, up 200,
up 1,000, up 150, up 90, up 63.

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.421
I said, "Good, that's better." 

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:03.588
(Laughter.)

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:06.758
You know, hey, we've got
seven years to go, folks.

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.860
You know, we got
a long time to go.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:24.509
(Applause.)

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.478
So, thank you, everybody.

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:30.515
You've been amazing,
you've been amazing.

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:34.019
You know what Matt didn't say --
when I was here in 2011,

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.420
I made a speech,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.557
and I was received
with such warmth.

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.726
And they give --
they used to give --

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:41.693
I don't know if Matt does that

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.695
because he might not want
to be controversial,

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:46.631
but they used to give
 the best speech of CPAC. 

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:47.699
Do they do that still, Matt?

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.367
Because you better pick me
or I'm not coming back again.

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:53.138
(Laughter.)

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:56.942
But -- and I got these --
everybody,

00:22:56.942 --> 00:23:00.145
they loved that speech.
And that was, I think, Matt --

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.346
I would say,
that might have been

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:03.949
the first real
political speech that I made.

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:07.252
It was a love fest -- 2011,
I believe the time was --

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.521
and a lot of people remembered,

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.823
and they said, "We want Trump,
we want Trump." 

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.459
And after a few years,
they go by,

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.962
and I say, "Here we are,
let's see what we can do." 

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:19.498
And then everybody said, 
"He cannot get elected.

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:22.834
He cannot do it,
you need 270 votes."

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:25.904
You need Electoral College --

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.273
which, by the way, is much
tougher than the popular vote.

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:31.176
The popular vote, actually,
would be so much easier.

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.879
You go three or four states,
and you just go,

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.380
and you just do great job.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.449
Hillary forgets that. You know,
she went to these states.

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:38.650
I said, "What's she doing?

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.352
Why does she keep going
back to California?"

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:42.554
(Laughter.)

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.556
Crazy.

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.360
Next time, they're going
to remember Iowa.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.695
They're going to remember Ohio.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:51.463
(Applause.)

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:53.465
Remember?

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:56.568
They spent a lot of time
in Pennsylvania to no avail.

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:58.703
(Applause.)

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:00.305
They spent a lot of money.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:03.175
They spent a lot of money
in North Carolina,

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:04.709
the great state
of North Carolina.

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:05.343
(Applause.)

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:06.945
We did very well there.

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:11.349
We have a great person
in the room,

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:13.185
Mark Meadows,
from North Carolina.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:15.554
(Applause.)
He's around here -- where's Mark?

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.088
Where's Mark?

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:18.890
And Deb.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.626
And we have Jim Jordan --
Warriors, warriors all.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:22.727
(Applause.)

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:25.163
We have a lot of great -- we
have a lot of great people here.

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:28.500
But, you know, we just --
we hit a chord.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.569
And if you remember, 2011,

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.205
probably that was the beginning
of what we've done.

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:35.740
And hopefully, at the end
of a period of time,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.243
people are going to say thank
you, because it is not easy.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.611
We're fighting a lot of forces.

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.948
They're forces that are
doing the wrong thing.

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.149
They're just doing
the wrong thing.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:47.152
I don't want to talk about
what they have in mind.

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.420
But they do the wrong thing.

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:51.056
But we're doing what's good
for our country

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:55.293
for the long-term
viability and survival.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:59.865
Like, for instance, $700 billion
got approved for our military.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.233
Our military was going to hell.

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:09.541
(Applause.)

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:11.176
We declined to certify

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:17.048
the terrible one-sided
Iran nuclear deal.

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:18.550
That was a horrible deal.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.552
(Applause.)

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:26.391
Whoever heard you give
$150 billion to a nation

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.360
that has no respect
for you whatsoever?

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.594
They're saying
 Death to America 

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:31.363
while they're signing
the agreement.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.964
If somebody said
 Death to America 

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.099
while I'm signing an agreement,

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:35.533
and I'm President,
I immediately say,

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.435
 What's going on here,
folks, I'm not signing. 

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:38.436
(Laughter.)

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:39.471
What's going on --
they just kept going.

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:42.774
Kerry -- Kerry may be the worst
negotiator I've ever seen.

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:45.677
(Laughter.)

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.545
How about this guy --
how about --

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:49.047
and Obama, of course --
he's the one.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:55.887
But how about
$1.8 billion in cash?

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:58.490
Did you ever see what, like,

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.392
a million dollars
in hundred-dollar bills?

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.193
A lot of people do it
as a promotion.

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:03.929
It's a lot. It's big.
It's like big.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.030
(Laughter.)

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:10.035
Now, take that, go to
$1.8 billion in cash.

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.603
$1.8 billion.

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.804
For what, for what?

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.473
Why did we do this?
Why did we do it?

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:20.545
Anyway, we didn't certify,
and lots of interesting things

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.213
are happening with
that whole mess.

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.782
But we have to treat --

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:27.552
people that treat us well,
we treat them well.

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:29.120
People that treat us badly,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.755
we treat them much worse

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.891
than they can ever imagine,
that's the way it has to be.

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.459
(Applause.)

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:36.461
That's the way it has to be.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.879
We officially
recognized Jerusalem

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:56.214
as the capital of Israel.

00:26:56.214 --> 00:27:13.565
(Applause.)

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:15.633
You know, every President
campaigned on,

00:27:15.633 --> 00:27:17.535
 We're going to
recognize Jerusalem

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:18.670
as the capital of Israel. 

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.406
Everybody -- for many Presidents
-- you've been reading it.

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.074
And then they never
pulled it off.

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:26.378
And I now know why.

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:29.981
Because I put the word out
that I may do it, right?

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.249
I said, I'd do it
in my campaign,

00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:32.517
so that usually means --

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:34.252
unless I find something --
I'm going to do it.

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.423
I was hit by more countries
and more pressure

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.025
and more people calling,
begging me,

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.493
 Don't do it. Don't do it.
Don't do it. 

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:45.296
I said, "We have to do it,
it's the right thing to do.

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:47.098
It's the right thing to do,
we have to do it."

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:47.899
(Applause.)

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.934
And I did it.

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:51.870
But every other President
really lied,

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.271
because they campaigned on it.

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.006
That was always a big part
of the campaign.

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:56.875
And then they got into office;
they never did it.

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.643
So, I understand
why they didn't do it.

00:27:58.643 --> 00:27:59.844
Because there was tremendous --

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:03.081
the campaign against it
was so incredible.

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:08.053
But you know what? The campaign
for it was also incredible,

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:10.055
and we did the right thing.

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:13.058
(Applause.)

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.795
So, we've kept our promise, as I
said, to rebuild our military,

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:20.832
eliminating the defense
sequester, which is a disaster.

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:24.235
And I don't know if you saw
the number, $700 billion.

00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:27.172
You know, ultimately, that comes
before everything else.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:28.706
We can talk about
lots of things.

00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:31.342
But if we don't have
a strong military,

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:34.879
you might not be allowed
into this room someday.

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:35.780
Okay?

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.116
You may not have
your houses, your homes,

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.851
your beautiful communities.

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.419
We better take care
of our military.

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:42.921
These are the greatest people,

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:45.056
and we're going to take
care of our veterans.

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.424
We're going to take
care of the vets.

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.060
We've been doing
a good job on the vets.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:09.114
And after years of rebuilding
other nations --

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.448
we rebuild other nations --

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.719
we rebuild other nations
that have a lot of money,

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:17.455
and we don't ever say,
 Hey, you got to help. 

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:22.060
We're finally
rebuilding our nation.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.261
We're rebuilding our nation.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:25.430
(Applause.)

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.567
And we're restoring
our confidence and our pride.

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:35.473
All of us here today are united
by the same timeless values.

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:38.710
We defend our Constitution,

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.646
and we believe in the wisdom
of our Founders.

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.148
Our Constitution is great.

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:46.885
(Applause.)

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:51.856
We support the incredible men
and women of law enforcement.

00:29:51.856 --> 00:30:02.033
(Applause.)

00:30:02.033 --> 00:30:04.035
True.

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:16.548
We know that a strong nation
must have strong borders.

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:20.185
We celebrate our history
and our heroes,

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:22.453
and we believe young Americans

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:25.356
should be taught
to love their country

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.626
and to respect its traditions.

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:30.461
Don't worry,
you're getting the wall.

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.096
Don't worry, okay,
I heard some --

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:34.098
(Applause.)

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.400
-- we're getting the wall.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:44.175
Audience: Build that wall!

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.143
Build that wall!

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:50.381
Build that wall!

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:51.849
The President: I had a couple
of these characters

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.551
in the back say,

00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:54.819
 Oh, he really doesn't
want the wall.

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.254
He just used that
for campaigning. 

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.356
I said, are you --
can you believe it?

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.692
(Laughter.)

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.527
You know, I say,
every time I hear that,

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:04.462
the wall gets 10 feet higher.
You know that, right?

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:05.763
(Applause.)

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:09.467
Every time,
every single time, okay?

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.102
No, we're going to have the wall

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:12.403
or they're not going
to have what they want.

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.739
You know, we have a problem,
we need more Republicans.

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:18.476
We have a group of people
that vote against us in a bloc.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.047
They're good at two things,
resisting, obstruction.

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.516
Resisting, obstruction.

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.452
And they stick together,
they do.

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:30.688
They always vote in a bloc.
You know, it's very rare

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.357
that you get a couple of them
to come your way.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.424
Even on the tax cuts.

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:35.593
I mean, we're going to be
fighting these people

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.296
in the '18 election.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.864
We're going to be
fighting people

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.132
that voted against the tax cuts,

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:44.269
because the tax cuts
are phenomenal and popular,

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:46.838
and helping people
and helping our country.

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.874
You saw Apple just brought
$350 billion in;

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:53.111
Exxon brought $50 billion in.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:55.013
(Applause.)

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:55.947
So, we're going to be fighting.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.516
The fact is, we need more
Republicans to vote.

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:01.286
(Applause.)

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:03.721
We want to get our agenda.
Because, now, what we have to do

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.024
is in order to get a vote
to fix our military,

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.893
we have to give them
$100 billion

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.595
in stuff that nobody
in this room,

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.764
including me, wants,
in many cases.

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:16.467
It's terrible,
we need more Republicans.

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.003
That's why you have to get out
and you have to fight for '18.

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:22.840
You have to do it.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.076
We salute our great
American flag,

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:29.080
we put our hands on our hearts
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.517
(Applause.)

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:36.688
And we all proudly stand
for the national anthem.

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:42.960
(Applause.)

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.663
Audience:  USA! USA! USA!

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.311
The President:  Above all else,
we know that faith and family,

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:02.347
not government and bureaucracy,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.583
are at the center
of American life.

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.318
We know that.

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.320
(Applause.)

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.889
Because in America, we don't
worship government,

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.891
we worship God.

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:40.118
(Applause.)

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:43.588
Our nation's motto is,
"In God We Trust."

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.623
(Applause.)

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:48.192
And this week, our nation
lost an incredible leader

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:53.030
who devoted his life
to helping us understand

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:59.003
what those words
really mean. Leader.

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.372
He was a leader.
He was a great man.

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:06.010
We will never forget
the historic crowds,

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.213
that voice, the energy,

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:15.086
and the profound faith of
a preacher named Billy Graham.

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:36.774
(Applause.)

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:39.744
Great man and great family --
Franklin Graham, great family.

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:43.014
And they were for us --
I'll tell you, they were for us.

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.483
Right from the beginning
they were for us.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.954
As a young man, Billy decided
to devote his life to God.

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:55.793
That choice not only changed his
life, it changed our country.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.230
And indeed, it even
changed the world.

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:04.869
Reverend Graham's belief
in the power of God's word

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.205
gave hope to millions

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:11.275
and millions who listened to him
with his very beautiful,

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.845
but very simple message,

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.847
God loves you.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:22.854
(Applause.)

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.722
And a very special tribute --

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.557
because it's almost
never done --

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:33.631
on Wednesday, we will
celebrate Billy Graham's life

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:39.103
as he lies in honor
in the Rotunda of our Capitol.

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:42.874
(Applause.)

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.876
Very rarely.

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:04.395
One day -- Wednesday
until Thursday,

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:07.665
about 11 o'clock on Wednesday.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:10.368
I bet those lines are going
to be long and beautiful,

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:13.271
because he deserves it.

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:15.106
Not everybody deserves it.

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.141
But very few people --
you look back,

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:18.910
Ronald Reagan was so honored.

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:22.647
Very few people are so honored,
that's a big thing.

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:27.752
And he really, almost more
than anybody you can think of,

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:31.856
he deserves to be
in the Rotunda.

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.324
So, that's going
to be very special.

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.759
Wednesday at 11 o'clock.

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.627
(Applause.)

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.629
And Paul, and Mitch,
and the whole group,

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:41.399
they worked very hard
to make it all happen.

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.701
So, we want to thank them too.

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.771
Everywhere you go,
all over the country,

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.205
in cities small and large,

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:52.176
Americans of all faiths
reach out to our Creator

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.779
for strength, for inspiration,
and for healing.

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:57.081
Great time for healing.

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.783
In times of grief and hardship,

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:03.254
we turn to prayer
for solace and for comfort.

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:06.357
In recent days, our entire
nation has been filled

00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:11.862
with terrible pain and sorrow
over the evil massacre

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.266
in a great community --
Parkland, Florida.

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.736
This senseless act
of mass murder

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:22.073
has shocked our nation
and broken our hearts.

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:26.611
This week, I had the honor
of meeting with students

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:30.114
from Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School,

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:33.184
with families who have
lost their children

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:35.453
in prior shootings --

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:36.988
great families,
great people --

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:40.257
and with members of
the local community

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.094
right here in Washington, D.C.

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:47.264
Our whole nation was moved
by their strength

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.332
and by their courage.

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:50.501
We listened to their
heart-wrenching stories,

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:55.940
asked them for ideas,
and pledged to them --

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:59.176
and I can speak
for all of the senators

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.212
and congressmen
and congresswomen,

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.780
all of the people in this room

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.216
that are involved
in this decision --

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.952
that we will act.
We will do something.

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.488
We will act.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:13.724
With us on Wednesday
was one of the families

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:17.795
whose daughter didn't
come home last week --

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:21.499
a beautiful young woman
named Meadow Pollack.

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:25.636
Incredible family,
I had them in the Oval Office.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.805
Incredible people.

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.473
You've probably
seen her picture.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:33.344
She had a beautiful,
beautiful smile,

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:35.346
and a beautiful life.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.115
So full of promise.

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:41.485
We wish there was
something -- anything --

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:45.589
we could do to bring Meadow
and all of the others back.

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.926
There are not enough
tears in the world

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:52.229
to express our sadness
and anguish for her family,

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:57.868
and for every family that has
lost a precious loved one.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:01.706
No family should ever save --

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:05.576
and ever have to go in

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:11.248
and suffer the way
these families have suffered.

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:16.554
They've suffered beyond anything
that I've ever witnessed.

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:21.125
A father drops his daughter
off at school,

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.196
kisses her goodbye,
waves to her --

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.564
she's walking up the path --

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:29.667
and never sees her alive again.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.771
Gets a call, can't believe it.

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.706
Thinks it's a nightmare.

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.575
Wants to wake up
from the nightmare.

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:41.746
So, we want to hear ideas
from Americans

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.414
of all backgrounds and beliefs

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.883
about how we can improve
security at our schools,

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.185
tackle the issue
of mental health.

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:52.590
Because this was a sick
person -- very sick --

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.427
and we had a lot of warning
about him being sick.

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.828
This wasn't a surprise.

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:02.867
To the people that knew him,
this wasn't even a little bit;

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:06.003
in fact, some said,
were surprised it took so long.

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:09.273
So, what are we doing --
what are we doing?

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:13.244
We want to ensure that
when there are warning signs,

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.979
we can act and act very quickly.

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.349
Why do we protect our airports,

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.251
and our banks,
our government buildings,

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.286
but not our schools?

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:32.129
(Applause.)

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:34.064
It's time to make our schools

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.835
a much harder target
for attackers.

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.603
We don't want them
in our schools.

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:46.010
(Applause.)

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.645
We don't want them.

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:53.818
When we declare our schools
to be gun-free zones,

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:58.122
it just puts our students
in far more danger.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:03.093
(Applause.)

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.095
Far more danger.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.578
Well-trained, gun-adept
teachers and coaches

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.413
and people that work
in those buildings;

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.549
people that were in the Marines
for 20 years and retired;

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:29.220
people in the Army, the Navy,
the Air Force, the Coast Guard;

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.555
people that are adept --

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:35.793
adept with weaponry
and with guns -- they teach.

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:41.198
I mean, I don't want
to have 100 guards

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:44.068
standing with rifles
all over the school.

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:47.938
You do a concealed carry permit.

00:41:47.938 --> 00:42:02.086
(Applause.)

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:05.623
And this would be
a major deterrent

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:09.994
because these people
are inherently cowards.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.529
If they thought --

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:18.068
like, if this guy thought
that other people

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:20.671
would be shooting bullets
back at him,

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.039
he wouldn't have gone
to that school.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.509
He wouldn't have gone there,
it's a gun-free zone.

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.945
It says, this is
a gun-free zone;

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.447
please check your guns
way far away.

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:34.418
And what happens
is they feel safe.

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:36.453
There's nobody going
to come at them.

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:38.956
This way, you may have --
and remember,

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.958
if you use this school
as an example --

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.194
this is a very big school
with tremendous floor area

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.562
and a lot of acreage.

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:49.166
It's a big, big school,
good school, a big, big school.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.536
You'd have to have
150 real guards.

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:53.570
Look, you had one guard.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.205
He didn't turn out
to be too good,

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:57.174
I will tell you that.

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.176
He turned out to be not good.

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.412
He was not a credit
to law enforcement,

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.713
that I can tell you.

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.715
That I can tell you.

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:09.386
(Applause.)

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:11.889
But as I've been talking
about this idea --

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:13.924
and I feel it's a great idea,

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:16.527
but some people that are
good people are opposed to it;

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:18.429
they don't like the idea
of teachers doing it.

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.763
But I'm not talking
about teachers.

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.566
You know, CNN went on,
they said,

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.535
 Donald Trump
wants all teachers. 

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:28.772
Okay, fake news, folks,
fake news, fake news.

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:33.177
I don't want a person
that's never handled a gun

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:35.446
that wouldn't know what a gun
looks like to be armed.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.749
But out of your
teaching population --

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:41.418
out of your teaching population,

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.254
you have 10 percent,

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:47.124
20 percent of
very gun-adept people.

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:49.994
Military people,
law enforcement people,

00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:51.962
they teach,
they teach.

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:53.364
(Applause.)

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:56.600
And something I thought of this
morning. You know what else?

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.837
And I thought of it since
I found and watched Peterson,

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:03.474
the deputy who didn't
go into the school

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.943
because he didn't want
to go into the school.

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:10.080
Okay, he was tested under fire,
and that wasn't a good result.

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:12.883
But you know what I thought
of as soon as I saw that?

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:18.155
These teachers -- and I've seen
them at a lot of schools

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.590
where they had problems --

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.458
these teachers love
their students.

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.560
And the students love
their teachers, in many cases.

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.063
These teachers love
their students.

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:31.568
And these teachers
are talented with weaponry

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.570
and with guns.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.639
And they feel safe.

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:40.444
And I'd rather have somebody
that loves their students

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.579
and wants to protect
their students

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:45.449
than somebody standing outside
that doesn't know anybody

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:46.884
and doesn't know the students,

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:49.420
and, frankly,
for whatever reason,

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.256
decided not to go in even though
he heard lots of shots

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:54.224
being fired inside.

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:59.563
The teachers and the coaches and
other people in the building --

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:03.834
the dean, the assistant dean,
the principal --

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:07.171
they can --
they love their people.

00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:08.605
They want to protect these kids.

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:11.642
And I think we're
better with that.

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.744
And this may be
10 percent or 20 percent

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.646
of the population
of teachers, et cetera.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.816
It's not all of them.

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.784
But you would have a lot,

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.554
and you would tell people
that they're inside.

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.489
And the beauty is,
it's concealed.

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:28.358
Nobody would ever see it
unless they needed it.

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.894
It's concealed.

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:33.330
So, this crazy man who walked in

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.132
wouldn't even know
who it is that has it.

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.267
That's good.
That's not bad; that's good.

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:41.105
And a teacher would have
shot the hell out of him

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.073
before he knew what happened.

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:55.886
(Applause.)

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:59.423
They love their students.
They love those students, folks.

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:03.360
Remember that.
They love their students.

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:05.796
And I'm telling you
that would work.

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:07.865
Because we need
offensive capability.

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.666
We can't just say, oh,
it's a gun-free school.

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:11.268
We're going to do it
a little bit better.

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.537
Because then you say,
 What happens outside? 

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.872
The students now leave school,

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.174
and you got
a thousand students --

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:20.210
you got 3,500 at the school
we're talking about --

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.613
but you have a thousand
students standing outside.

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:24.848
The teachers are out there also.

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:28.085
If a madman comes along,
we have the same problem,

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:30.754
but it's outside of the school.
Or they drive cars.

00:46:30.754 --> 00:46:32.222
There are a lot of things
that can happen.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.491
I want to stop it.

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.360
And I know it's a little
controversial to say --

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.229
but I have to say, since
I started this two days ago,

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:41.165
a lot of people that were
totally opposed to it

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:42.666
are now agreeing.

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:44.134
They love their students.

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:46.937
They don't want their students
to be killed or to be hurt.

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:50.440
(Applause.)

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.712
So, we have to do
something that works.

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:59.983
And one of the big measures
that we will do,

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:02.052
and everybody in this room
I think has to agree --

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.555
and there's nobody that loves

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.323
the Second Amendment
more than I do.

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:08.625
And there's nobody
that respects the NRA --

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.661
they're friends of mine.
They backed us all.

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.497
They're great people,
they're patriots.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:17.100
But they're great people, but we
really do have to strengthen up,

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.070
really strengthen up
background checks.

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.906
We have to do that.

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:26.877
(Applause.)

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.812
And we have to do --
for the mentally ill,

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.047
we have to do very, very --

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:32.583
we don't want to people
that are mentally ill

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.385
to be having any
form of weaponry.

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:36.954
We have to be
very strong on that.

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:42.326
(Applause.)

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:43.460
So, we're going to do that.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.962
And I really believe
that Congress

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.330
is going to get it
through this time.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.364
And they have
a different leader.

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.799
They have somebody
that wants to get it through;

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:51.368
not somebody that's just
all talk, no action,

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.669
like so many of these folks.

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:55.072
This is somebody that
wants to get it through.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:59.009
But I also want to protect --
we need a hardened site.

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.478
It has to be hardened.
It can't be soft.

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.547
Because they'll sneak in
through a window,

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.615
they'll sneak in some way.

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:07.484
And, again, you're standing
there totally unprotected.

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:12.656
You know the five great soldiers
from four years ago,

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.691
three of them were
world-class marksmen.

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:18.428
They were on a military base
in a gun-free zone.

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.665
They were asked to check
their guns quite far away.

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.301
And a maniac walked in,

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:26.937
guns blazing,

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.772
killed all of five of them.

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:32.709
He wouldn't have had a chance
if these world-class marksmen

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:37.881
had -- on a military base --
access to their guns.

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:40.550
And I'm going to look at that
whole policy on military bases.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.552
If we can't have --

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:49.826
(Applause.)

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.828
-- all five were killed.

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.931
All five, the guy wouldn't
have had a chance.

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.734
But we're going to look at
that whole military base,

00:48:57.734 --> 00:48:58.835
gun-free zone.

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:02.372
If we can't have our military
holding guns, it's pretty bad.

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:05.275
We had a number of instances
on military bases.

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:08.045
You know that, so, we want
to protect our military.

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:11.515
We want to make
our military stronger

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:14.284
and better than
it's ever been before.

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:18.088
(Applause.)

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:20.691
We also need to create
a culture in our country

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:23.794
that cherishes life
and human dignity.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.362
That's part of what
we're talking about.

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:30.434
A culture that condemns violence
and never glorifies violence.

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.937
We need to foster real
human connections

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.373
and turn classmates
and colleagues

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.608
into friends and neighbors

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:40.043
that want to fight for us.

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:44.548
We're not just having
a conversation

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.283
about school safety.

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:48.251
You've had conversations --
in all fairness,

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:50.354
I'm pretty new on this job.

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.588
We're here a little
more than a year.

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:55.025
I've been watching this stuff
go on for 20 years.

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.161
The President gets up,

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:00.931
everybody is enthusiastic
for the first couple of days,

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.733
then it fades, fades, fades.

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.167
Nothing ever gets done.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.402
We want to see
if we can get it done.

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:06.803
Let's get it done right.

00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:09.039
We really owe it to our country.

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:14.745
And I've been watching
for a long time.

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.714
Seen a lot of words, and
I've seen very little action.

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:21.051
And, you know,
if you think about,

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:23.120
most of its just common sense.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.422
It's not  do you love guns,
do hate guns. 

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:29.192
It's common sense,
it's all common sense.

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:32.562
And some of the strongest
advocates about

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:35.265
what I'm saying
are the strongest advocates --

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:37.667
I know them very well --
political people --

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:40.170
the strongest advocates
for the Second Amendment.

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.539
But this is common sense.

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.575
In addition to securing
our schools,

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:50.347
we're also implementing a
strategy to secure our streets.

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:52.816
We want our kids to be
safe everywhere they go,

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:56.620
whether they're in a classroom
walking home from school

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.456
or just outside playing
with their friends.

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.224
(Applause.)

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:04.694
Every child deserves to grow up
in a safe community

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.897
surrounded by a loving family

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:10.734
and to have a future filled
with opportunity and with hope.

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:20.143
(Applause.)

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:25.248
Thank you, thank you,
just not fair.

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:28.885
Reducing violent
crime in America

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:32.689
is a top priority
for my administration,

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:36.426
and we will do whatever
it takes to get it done.

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:39.896
No talk. We're going to do
what it takes to get it done.

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:45.502
(Applause.)

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:48.772
As you've seen,
pretty well reported,

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:53.143
that we're significantly
increasing gun prosecutions

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:55.312
by tremendous percentages,

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:58.048
and we're working to get
violent offenders

00:51:58.048 --> 00:52:00.817
off our streets
and behind bars,

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:04.488
and get them behind bars
quickly, for a long time,

00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:06.656
or get them the hell
out of our country.

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:11.495
(Applause.)

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:16.399
In 2017, we brought cases
against more violent offenders

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:20.570
than any administration
in a quarter of a century --

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.639
more than any administration.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:26.776
And we're just gearing up.
We have tough people.

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:30.146
I'll tell you what --
when you deal with MS-13,

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:33.083
the only thing they
understand is toughness.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.285
They don't want anything.

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:37.387
All they understand
is toughness.

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:40.357
If that ICE agent
or Border Patrol agent

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.893
is tougher than them,
they respect him.

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:44.928
We got the toughest guys
you've ever seen.

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:45.662
We got tough.

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:46.997
(Applause.)

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.431
They don't respect
anything else.

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:50.767
And they shouldn't
be in our country.

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.336
They were let in for years.

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.805
They shouldn't be,
and we're getting them out.

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:58.441
Our administration
prosecuted more people

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:01.545
for federal firearm charges

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:04.314
than has been done
in more than a decade.

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.883
And again, we're
just gearing up.

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:11.154
We've convicted
1,200 gang members

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:14.457
and nearly 500
human traffickers.

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:15.992
You know what human
trafficking --

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:19.029
who would think that
we have this in this age?

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:24.968
And with our foreign partners,
we've helped charge or arrest

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:29.472
more than 4,000 members
of the savage gang

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:32.442
that we talked about -- MS-13.

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.044
Now, they don't like guns,
you know why?

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.545
They're not painful enough.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:39.215
These are animals;
they cut people, they cut them.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.052
They cut them up
in little pieces

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.853
and they want them to suffer.

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.622
And we take them
into our country

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:47.924
because our immigration
laws are so bad.

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.595
And when we catch them --
it's called catch-and-release --

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:55.765
we have to, by law, catch them
and then release them.

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.100
Catch-and-release.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.868
And I can't get the Democrats --

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:01.371
and nobody has been
able to for years --

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:04.374
to approve common-sense
measures that,

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.910
when we catch these
animal-killers,

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:10.647
we can lock them up
and throw away the keys.

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:21.257
(Applause.)

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:27.263
In 2017, our brave ICE officers

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:31.434
arrested more than
100,000 criminal aliens

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.104
who have committed tens
of thousands of crimes.

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.173
And believe me,
these are great people.

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:41.177
They cannot -- the laws
are just against us.

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:44.414
They're against --
they're against safety.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:48.785
They don't make sense.
And you meet with Democrats

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.987
and they're always fighting
for the criminal.

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:54.257
They're not fighting
for law-abiding citizens.

00:54:54.257 --> 00:54:55.792
They're always fighting
for the criminal.

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.360
(Applause.)

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.362
Doesn't make sense.

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:05.468
Here are just some of the
criminal charges and convictions

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:07.570
for the aliens arrested by ICE:

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:12.275
11,000 charges or convictions
for sex crimes;

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:16.513
48,000 for assault;
13,000 for burglary;

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.249
and 1,800 for killing people.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:23.820
We're cracking down on sanctuary
cities, can you believe this?

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.823
Where they protect --
that's another one.

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:34.030
Because we want our cities
to be sanctuaries

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:37.567
for law-abiding Americans,
not for criminals.

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:42.872
(Applause.)

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.874
And, by the way,

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:51.414
the Senate Democrats
and the House Democrats

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.050
have totally
abandoned DACA.

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:57.020
They've total -- they don't
even talk to me about it.

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:58.855
They have totally abandoned.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.457
You know, we get
the reputation -- like

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.293
DACA, it's not Republican.

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:04.894
We'll let me tell you,
it is Republican,

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:06.629
because we want to do
something about DACA,

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:08.565
get it solved after
all these years.

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:11.501
The Democrats are being
totally unresponsive.

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:14.571
They don't want to do anything
about DACA, I'm telling you.

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:17.674
And it's very possible
that DACA won't happen,

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:19.509
and it's not because
of the Republicans,

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:21.277
it's going to be
because of the Democrats.

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:24.714
And frankly, you better elect
more Republicans, folks,

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.716
or it will never happen.

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:34.724
(Applause.)

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:37.794
The Democrats voted in favor
of sanctuary cities.

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:40.396
In other words, they voted
to protect criminal aliens

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:44.701
instead of voting to protect
the American citizens.

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:48.304
To secure our country,
we are calling on Congress

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:51.474
to build a great border wall

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:54.677
to stop dangerous
drugs and criminals

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.679
from pouring
into our country.

00:56:56.679 --> 00:57:04.454
(Applause.)

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:06.523
And now they're willing
to give us the wall,

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.526
but they don't want
to give us any of the laws

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:11.861
to keep these people out.

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.296
So, we're going to get the wall,

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:16.232
but they don't want to
give us all of the other --

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:18.535
chain migration, lottery.

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.136
Think of a lottery.

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.972
You have a country,
they put names in.

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.874
You think they're giving us
their good people?

00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.777
Not too many of you people
are going to be in a lottery.

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:30.780
So, we pick out people.

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:34.517
Then they turn out
to be horrendous,

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.619
and we don't understand why.

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:39.956
They're not giving us
their best people, folks.

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.892
They're not giving us --
I mean, use your heads.

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.862
They're giving us --
it's a lottery.

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:49.132
I don't want people coming into
this country with a lottery.

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:53.436
I want people coming into
this country based on merit.

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:55.438
Based on merit.

00:57:55.438 --> 00:58:11.688
(Applause.)

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:16.426
I want people, and we all want
to be admitting people,

00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:20.897
who have skills, who can support
themselves financially,

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:23.032
who can contribute
to our economy,

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.401
who will love our people,

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.203
and who will share our values,

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:28.404
who will love our country.

00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:31.574
(Applause.)

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:38.147
I don't want people
who drive a car at 100 miles

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:40.149
an hour down
the West Side Highway

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:43.186
and kill 8 innocent victims

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:46.022
and destroy the lives
of 14 more.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.690
Nobody talks about that.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.593
Nobody ever talks
about the people

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.395
that have been
so horribly injured,

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:56.065
who lose legs and arms,
in Manhattan,

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.835
where I used to spend my time.

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:03.006
I know it very well, the stretch
along the West Side Highway.

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:07.277
People run in order
to stay in shape.

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:10.446
They want to be healthy,
they want to look good.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.782
They're running
all the time; I see it.

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.752
They run.

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.654
We work in different ways.

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.721
(Laughter.)

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:21.224
But they run -- no, but think
of this -- they run.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.226
And they're so --
they want to be fit.

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.296
They're proud people,
they want to be fit,

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.364
and they're running up
and down West Side Highway.

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.799
It's beautiful;
it's a beautiful thing.

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:34.404
And this maniac takes a car
going down the highway,

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:37.407
and just turns to a right,
and he kills eight.

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:43.579
But he really badly wounded
12 to 14 other people.

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:47.884
So, somebody think of it: Runs
to stay in shape,

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:50.153
leaves the house,

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.454
is jogging along,

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.855
working hard,

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:56.526
ends up going home
two months later with no leg

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:01.364
or with no arm,
or with two legs missing.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.832
Nobody ever talks about that.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:06.336
They talk about the people,
rightfully, that were killed.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.505
But they don't talk
about the people

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.808
whose lives have been
just changed --

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.176
just changed.

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:15.144
They don't talk about that.

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.280
This guy came in through
chain migration

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.783
and a part of
the lottery system.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.452
Audience:  Booo --

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:26.522
The President:  They say
22 people came in with him.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:30.360
In other words, an aunt,
an uncle, a grandfather,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.095
a mother, a father,
whoever came in.

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.530
But a lot of people came in.
That's chain migration.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.067
Let's see how those people
are doing, by the way.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.403
We've got to change our way.

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.839
Merit system --
I want merit system.

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:43.940
Because you know
what's happening?

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.509
All of these companies
are coming into our country.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.211
They're all coming
into our country.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:52.015
And when they come in, we need
people that are going to work.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:56.219
I'm telling you, we need
workers now, we need workers.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.253
(Applause.)

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.721
But when I walked in today,

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:04.093
did anyone ever hear me do
the snake during the campaign?

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.030
Because I had five
people outside say,

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.098
 Could you do "The Snake?" 

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.533
And I said, well,
people have heard it.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.869
Who hasn't heard  The Snake ?

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.875
You should read it anyways.

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.244
Let's do it anyway, I'll do it 
-- all right, should we do it?

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.578
(Applause.)

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:28.484
Now, this was a rock-and-roll
song -- little amendments --

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.253
a rock-and-roll song.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:35.425
But every time I do it,
people --

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:38.828
and you have to think of this
in terms of immigration.

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.329
We have to have great
people come into our --

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.798
I want people to come
into our country.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:44.267
And I want people
that are going to help us.

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.802
And I don't want people
that are going to come in

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:50.006
and be accepting all of
the gifts of our country

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:52.475
for the next 50 years
and contribute nothing.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.343
I don't want that,
and you don't want that.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.647
I want people that are
going to help and people

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:59.382
that are going
to work for Chrysler,

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.952
who is now moving
from Mexico into Michigan,

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:06.389
and so many other --
and Apple, by the way.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.123
(Applause.)

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.158
And Foxconn up in Wisconsin.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.395
They're going to need
25,000 workers.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:16.999
I want people that can come in
and get to work and work hard.

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:19.802
Even if it means a learning
period -- that's fine.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:23.339
But I want people that are
going to come in and work.

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:28.044
And I want people that love us
and look at security.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.713
And they want you to be safe,
and they want to be safe.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.383
I want great people
coming into this country.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:37.186
I don't want people coming
in the way they do now,

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.890
because I want people
that contribute.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:45.595
So, this is called 'The Snake."

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:49.699
And think of it
in terms of immigration.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.136
And you may love it, or you
may say, isn't that terrible.

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.938
Okay? And if you say,
isn't that terrible, who cares?

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.707
Because the way they treat me --

01:02:57.707 --> 01:03:00.076
that's peanuts compared
to the way they treat me.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.110
Okay?

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.112
(Laughter.)

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.881
Immigration.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:11.521
 On her way to work one morning,
down the path along the lake,

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:19.629
a tenderhearted woman saw
a poor, half-hearted,

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.699
frozen snake.

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:28.404
His pretty colored skin had been
all frosted with the dew.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.940
"Poor thing," she cried,

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:35.144
"I'll take you in,
and I'll take care of you."

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:39.749
"Take me in, oh, tender woman,
take me in, for Heaven's sake.

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:45.788
Take me in, oh, tender woman,"
sighed the vicious snake.

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:51.394
She wrapped him up all cozy
in a comforter of silk

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:59.168
and laid him by her fireside
with some honey and some milk.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:04.974
She hurried home from work that
night, and soon as she arrived,

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:10.746
she found that pretty snake
she'd taken in had been revived.

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.918
"Take me in, oh, tender woman,
take me in for Heaven's sake.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:21.991
Take me in, oh, tender woman,"
sighed the vicious snake.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:29.665
She clutched him to her bosom,
"You're so beautiful,"

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:31.834
she cried.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.370
"But if I hadn't
brought you in by now,

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.607
surely you would have died."

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:42.478
She stroked his pretty skin
again and kissed

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.648
and held him tight.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:48.417
But instead of saying thank you,

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:52.655
that snake gave her
a vicious bite.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:59.228
"Take me in, oh, tender woman,
take me in for Heaven's sake.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:03.065
Take me in, oh, tender woman,"

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.601
sighed the vicious snake.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:10.573
"I saved you," cried the woman.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.375
"And you've bitten me.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.977
Heaven's why?

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:20.283
You know your bite is poisonous,
and now I'm going to die."

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:28.124
"Oh, shut up, silly woman,"
said the reptile with a grin.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:33.863
"You knew damn well I was
a snake before you took me in." 

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:55.084
(Applause.)

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.253
And that's what we're doing
with our country, folks.

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.988
We're letting people in,

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.690
and it's going to be
a lot of trouble.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.891
It's only getting worse.

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.226
But we're giving you 
protection like never before.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.062
Our law enforcement
is doing a better job

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.864
than we've ever done before.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.267
And we love our country.

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.769
And we're going to take care
of our country, okay?

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:15.171
We're going to take care
of our country.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:20.109
(Applause.)

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.410
So just in finishing,

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:26.515
our country is starting
to do very well.

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.919
Our economy is blazing.

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.322
Jobs are at a record level.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.459
Jobs are so good.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:41.697
2.7 million jobs created
since the election.

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.099
(Applause.)

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:50.272
Unemployment claims have
reached a 45-year low.

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:55.678
(Applause.)

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.048
African American
unemployment has reached

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.916
the lowest level
in our history.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:10.526
(Applause.)

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:16.031
Hispanic unemployment
has reached the lowest level

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:18.033
in our history.

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:21.971
(Applause.)

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:31.981
Women -- women unemployment is
at the lowest level in 18 years.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:37.386
(Applause.)

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:42.758
Wages are rising for the
first time in many, many years.

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:44.393
(Applause.)

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:47.830
Small business confidence
is at a record high.

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:53.436
And thanks to our
massive tax cuts,

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:56.338
millions of Americans
are getting to keep

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:59.275
a great percentage
of their money

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.277
instead of paying it
to a government

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.545
that throws it out the window.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:10.453
(Applause.)

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:14.924
So, I just leave you with this:
We have to fight Nancy Pelosi.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.258
They want to give
your money away.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.562
They want to give
your money away.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.330
They want to end your tax cuts.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.699
They want to do things that
you wouldn't even believe,

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:27.470
including taking your
Second Amendment rights away.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.537
They will do that.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.539
Audience:  Booo --

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:33.809
The President:  So, we have
to get out there

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.179
and we have to fight in '18

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:40.783
like never before --
just the way you fought with us.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.451
Just the way you fought with us.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:47.356
You fought so hard, and you were
so tough, and you were so smart.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.526
You were so smart,
and you know what?

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:52.428
I know for a fact
you did the right thing,

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.963
because we're looking
at the numbers.

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:57.266
And the numbers --
even they have to give credit

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.368
for the kind of numbers
that we're producing.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.938
Nobody has ever seen
anything like it.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:06.775
(Applause.)

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:13.582
Under my administration, the era
of economic surrender is over.

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:18.687
We're renegotiating trade
deals that are so bad,

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:20.823
whether it's NAFTA

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:24.293
or whether it's
World Trade Organization,

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:27.129
which created China --
that created --

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:30.065
if you look at China,
it was going along like this,

01:09:30.065 --> 01:09:32.601
then we opened,
stupidly, this deal.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.739
And China has been like
a rocket ship ever since.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:44.280
And now, last year, we had
almost a $500 billion

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.616
trade deficit with China.

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.019
We can't have that.
We can't have that.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.788
I have great respect
for President Xi,

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.423
but we can't have that.

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:57.493
We have to go, and we have
to do what we have to do.

01:09:57.493 --> 01:10:02.197
We just can't let countries --
as an example, Mexico.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:06.902
We have a $100 billion
trade deficit with Mexico.

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.804
What does that tell you?
You know what it tells you?

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:12.675
NAFTA is no good.
It never was any good.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.910
But for some reason,
nobody ever changed it.

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.378
They emptied our factories --

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.181
you got to see the car plants
and the auto plants in Mexico.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.784
Like -- you've never seen
anything like it before.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.321
I want those companies --
and they're starting --

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:29.058
I want them back here,
I want them back here.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.259
They're going to come
back here, too.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.794
(Applause.)

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:34.463
And we want to make
our neighbors happy.

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.533
But we can't continuously
have other nations

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:40.669
taking advantage of the
United States like never before.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.939
And this has gone on
for a long time.

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.175
This has gone on for longer --

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.978
the last administration
was a disaster,

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.713
but this has gone on
for much longer

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.047
than the last administration.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:55.150
And we got to change it,
we're going to change it.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.586
So, we're renegotiating deals,
and you know what?

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.255
Hate to say it,
but if we can't make

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.157
a fair deal
for the United States,

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.760
we will terminate the deal
and we'll start all over again.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.160
(Applause.)

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.162
We have to do it.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:13.235
(Applause.)

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:17.306
So, under my administration,
and with your help --

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.274
don't forget --

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.577
you, many of you,
were the forgotten people.

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.380
You were the people that,
when the polls came out,

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.015
they didn't know
that you existed.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.251
The Democrats are trying
to figure out who you are,

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.387
because they want
to get you back.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:34.556
But you are people -- we've had
people that never voted,

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:35.457
but they're great patriots --

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.459
but they never saw anybody
they wanted to vote for.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.627
Then they go to the election,

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.863
they've got Trump-Pence,
Trump-Pence.

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.666
They got hats, they got
all sorts of things.

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:47.670
Trump over here -- Make America
Great Again hats, right?

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:57.212
(Applause.)

01:11:57.212 --> 01:12:00.349
So, our country is
starting to do well.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:04.887
We are going to
make it great, better,

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:07.890
safer than it ever was before.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:11.493
The reason is you;
this has been a great movement.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.863
They try like hell, they cannot
stand what we've done.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.699
But we're doing the right thing.

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:19.501
We're even doing
the right thing for them.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.602
They just don't know it yet.

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.404
(Applause.)

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.406
They just don't know it yet.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:29.878
Even the media -- the media
will absolutely support me

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.213
sometime prior to the election.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.748
All those horrible
people back there,

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.383
they're going to support me,
you know why?

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.253
Because if somebody else won,

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:42.424
their ratings would go down,
they'd all be out of business.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:47.329
Nobody would watch,
they'd all be out of business.

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:51.533
So, I just want to tell you
that we are going to win.

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:54.169
I'd love you to get out there,
work really hard for '18.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:56.872
We need more Republicans
to keep the tax cuts

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.073
and keep all of this going.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.910
And I love you, I respect you.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:04.246
I appreciate everything
you've done for the country.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:10.586
(Applause.)

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:25.167
Audience:  USA! USA!

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.435
USA!

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.103
The President: I appreciate
everything you've done.

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.773
I do want to say, because people
have asked -- North Korea --

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:34.209
we imposed today
the heaviest sanctions

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.978
ever imposed
on a country before.

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:42.551
(Applause.)

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:45.354
And frankly, hopefully something
positive can happen.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:48.257
We will see, but hopefully
something positive can happen.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.193
But that just was announced,
and I wanted to let you know.

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:54.363
We have imposed the heaviest
sanctions ever imposed.

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.699
So, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for everything.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:00.402
You have been
incredible partners.

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.236
(Applause.)

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:03.238
Incredible partners.

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:11.013
And I will let you know in the
absolute strongest of terms,

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.315
we're going to make
America great again,

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:18.253
and I will never, ever, ever let
you down, thank you very much.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.488
(Applause.)

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:19.788
Thank you.
