RECORDED.

00:06:47.404 --> 00:06:48.671
WHAT WE ARE DOING WORKS.

00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:50.273
&gt;&gt; Martha: BEFORE I GO, IF ALL

00:06:50.274 --> 00:06:51.975
THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE AND HE'S

00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:53.343
STILL NOT WHAT TEXAS WANTS, WHAT

00:06:53.344 --> 00:06:55.078
I'M HEARING FROM YOU, WHY IS IT

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.447

THEY ARE FILLED WITH RAGE,

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.457
FILLED WITH HATRED FOR THE

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:08.358
PRESIDENT.

00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:09.125
THAT MEANS THEY ARE SHOWING UP

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:09.692

THE HARD LEFT IS COMING.

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:27.477
