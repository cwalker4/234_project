HELLO, PEOPLE UP THERE.

HELLO.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:29.529 align:start position:0%
SO, I AM ACTUALLY AN AMERICAN
IMMIGRANT.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start position:0%
AND THEY SAY THAT AMERICA IS A
COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:39.605 size:84% position:42%
SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU GUYS--
PLEASE, LEAVE MY COUNTRY.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.742 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
I'M SERIOUS.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:50.016 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
I HEARD THAT ASIANS HAVE BECOME

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.985
THE FASTEST GROWING IMMIGRANT
GROUP IN AMERICA, WHICH IS

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.923
REALLY AMAZING BECAUSE MEXICANS
CAN CROSS THE RIVER AND COME

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.924 align:start position:0%
HERE.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:03.162 align:start position:0%
AND I HAD TO FLY THOUSANDS OF
MILES TO MEXICO--

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
AND THEN CROSS THAT RIVER.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:18.111 align:start position:0%
TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A WALL TO
STOP IMMIGRATION.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'M FROM CHINA.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:28.121 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
SO I KNOW A LOT ABOUT WALLS.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start position:0%
THEY DON'T WORK.

AND SINCE IT'S LATER, IT'S JUST

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:45.838 align:start position:0%
GOING TO BECOME A HUGE TOURIST
ATTRACTION.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
BUT I DO RESPECT TRUMP, THOUGH,

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:58.518
BECAUSE AFTER HE TOOK OFFICE,
THERE WAS THE K.K.K. MARCH,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:05.458 size:88% position:44%
ANTI-K.K.K. MARCH, WOMEN'S
MARCH, ANTI-CHILD SEPARATION

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.426 align:start position:0%
MARCH.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.927 align:start position:0%
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH AMERICANS
HATE EXERCISE.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:21.841
HE HAS CONTRIBUTED MORE TO
AMERICANS' HEALTH THAN ALL OF

THE Y.M.C.A.s COMBINED.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:31.284 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
AND HE ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.385 size:88% position:44%
HEALTH OF OTHER COUNTRIES,
BECAUSE LAUGHTER IS THE BEST

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:37.657 align:start position:0%

PERFORMANCE AT THE U.N.?

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:52.605 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
HE KILLED.

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:55.474 align:start position:0%
THEY WERE PROBABLY EVEN A BETTER
AUDIENCE THAN YOU GUYS ARE.

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:56.475 align:start position:0%

JUST KIDDING.

MY SON WAS BORN AND RAISED IN
AMERICA.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:06.118 align:start position:0%
I REMEMBER ONE DAY HE CAME
HOME-- HE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:07.753 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS ABOUT FIVE
YEARS OLD.

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:10.790 align:start position:0%
HE SAID TO ME, "HEY, DAD, I
LEARNED AMERICAN HISTORY TODAY."

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.725 size:84% position:42%
I SAID, WOW, THAT'S GREAT."

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.995 align:start position:0%
HE SAID, "NOW I REALLY FEEL BAD
FOR BLACK PEOPLE."

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
I SAID, "YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY
MISTREATED IN AMERICAN HISTORY."

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:24.770 align:start position:0%
HE SAID, "YEAH, AND I'M SO GLAD
THAT I'M WHITE."

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:34.547 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
I SAID, "HOLD ON.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
YOU'RE NOT WHITE."

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:41.821 align:start position:0%
HE SAID, "WHAT AM I?"
I SAID, "YOU'RE YELLOW."

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:42.955 align:start position:0%
THIS IS A TRUE STORY.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.191
HE TOOK A LOOK AT I HAD HAND.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:48.861 size:84% position:42%
HE WAS LIKE, "DADDY, THIS
DOESN'T LOOK YELLOW TO ME."

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:53.432
I SAID, "YES, I KNOW, BUT THIS
IS AMERICA AND EVERYBODY HAS TO

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:59.171 align:start position:0%
HAVE A COLOR, AND THAT'S THE
COLOR THEY GAVE US.

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.274 size:78% position:39%
YOU BETTER DEAL WITH IT."

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.542 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
BUT MY SON HAS A GOOD POWNT,

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:04.810
THOUGH.

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:07.947
NOBODY IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY A
PERSON OF COLOR, IS EXACTLY THE

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.782 align:start position:0%
COLOR THEY ARE ASSIGNED,  YOU
KNOW.

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.218 align:start position:0%
LIKE, THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
YELLOW.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.287 align:start position:0%
IT'S KIND OF BROWN.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.691 align:start position:0%
A BLACK PERSON IS NOT EXACTLY
BLACK.

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:19.792 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE KIND OF BROWN.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:23.195 align:start position:0%
SO WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ALL
DIFFERENT SHADES OF MEXICANS.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:27.466 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:35.207 align:start position:0%
<i> ( CHEERS )</i>
SO, WHITE PEOPLE, PLEASE DON'T

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.010 align:start position:0%
FEEL LEFT OUT.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:41.681 align:start position:0%
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON
WITH WHITE GUYS.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:44.383 align:start position:0%
FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE AN ASIAN
WIFE.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:47.753 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ABOUT MY TIME.

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:48.988 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.790 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:51.190 align:start position:0%
THANKS.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
THANKS A LOT.
