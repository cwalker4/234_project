00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.160
Hey Thoughty2 here. Earlier this year Facebook
was working on a new highly-intelligent AI

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.200
chatbot that could talk to and negotiate with
humans in a realistic manner. When one Facebook

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.080
engineer had the bright idea to take two of
these AI bots and let them talk to each other,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.140
that's when something unexpected and terrifying
happened. The two AIs invented their own language

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.370
that us humans couldn't understand and began
using it to talk to each other.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.980
Here's a snippet of what the two bots, named
Bob and Alice said to each other:

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.460
Bob: I can i i everything else
Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.399
me to me to me to me to me to
Bob: you i everything else

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.329
Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me
to me to me to me to me to me

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.520
The Facebook engineers had no idea what they
where talking about, but it was very clear

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.470
that the AIs did. They had invented their
own secret code to converse using the power

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.330
of artificial neural networks. International
news soon reported that Facebook forcefully

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.700
shut down the experiment due to concerns that
the AIs were becoming too smart, getting out

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.380
of control and to prevent a Skynet situation.
This isn't entirely true, yes, they did shut

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.250
it down right away, but because they were
trying to create an AI that could talk to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.810
humans and if it was going to take the liberty
to invent its own language then that wasn't

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.330
much use and so the experiment was a failure,
in that respect. But nevertheless, this is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.420
still really creepy. As we continue to advance
Artificial Intelligence technology and push

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.900
the boundaries further and further every year,
what happens when they do become self-aware,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:09.190
sentient beings that are more intelligent
than us humans? Could AI take over the world?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.160
And will it be in our lifetimes?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.100
Artificial Intelligence, the ability for computers
to think at a human level and beyond and to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:28.840
self replicate is not a dystopian vision of
the future, it is hear, it is now, it is happening.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.350
Most people are unaware at the phenomenal
rate that our AI systems have improved over

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.110
the past five years and the trend is only
getting steeper and steeper. You may not realise

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.600
but you use AI every day, we all do. Virtual
Assistants like Google Assistant, Siri and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.960
Alexa are obvious examples of cutting edge
artificial intelligence, but it's also used

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.680
in many really subtle ways that affect your
everyday life.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.670
When you see music recommendations on Spotify
and film suggestions on Netflix, there is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.480
a highly complex computer algorithm behind
that, an algorithm that teaches itself with

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.500
passing time, an AI. This is known as machine
learning and large retailers such as Amazon

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.530
have been using machine learning algorithms
for many years now, to predict what you want

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.890
to buy, perhaps before you even know yourself.
In one infamous case in 2014 American retailer

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.700
Target Stores used artificial intelligence
to predict that a teenage girl was pregnant,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.790
before any of her family members knew and
before she was even sure of it herself.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.980
Target's cleverly designed machine learning
algorithms had detected that this particular

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.819
Minnesota teenager's buying habits had changed
slightly. Over the past couple of months,

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.689
she had begun purchasing scent-free soap and
extra large bags of cotton wool balls. Upon

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.810
seeing his daughter's mail one day, the girl's
father stormed into his nearest Target store

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.230
and said the following to the store manager:
“My daughter got this in the mail! She’s

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.010
still in high school, and you’re sending
her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.850
you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”
A short while later, the store manager received

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.370
a phone call from the abashed father in which
he said: “I had a talk with my daughter.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.860
It turns out there’s been some activities
in my house I haven’t been completely aware

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.630
of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”
So to answer the question, is AI smarter than

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.540
human's yet? The answer is perhaps not all
of them, but smarter than one slightly naive

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.990
Minnesota father, absolutely.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.530
Moore's law states that every year the amount
of transistors in computer processing units

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.380
will double. This has held true every single
year since Gordon Moore theorised it and the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.630
first CPU was invented in 1971. So whilst
superhuman artificial intelligence may not

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.550
be among us just yet, many futurists predict
its advent could happen any time within the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.520
next 50 years, some say it could be far sooner
than that, in as little as 10 years time.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.330
Some of the most intelligent individuals in
the world who deal with futuristic technology

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.530
every single day have repeatedly warned that
AI could be the most dangerous thing we ever

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.540
create and our greatest ever existential threat.
Stephen Hawkins has made numerous pleas to

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.510
the global scientific community to tread carefully
with AI, or face our own damnation and Elon

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.850
Musk is constantly expressing his concerns.
In an interview Musk recently stated that

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.470
with artificial intelligence we are "Summoning
the devil".

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.680
Many people who truly understand the power
and dangers of Artificial Intelligence have

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.500
called it the "Last invention we'll ever make
- the last challenge we'll ever face". Because

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.370
when the time comes, if we do get it wrong
and we do lose control, there will be a final

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.490
challenge, a final war, a war against software,
a war that we cannot win. Because the AI will

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.680
be so many millions times more intelligent
than the entire human race, so whatever plan

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.190
we come up with, whatever we try to do to
regain power and destroy the AI, the AI will

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.990
have already thought of well in advance. It
would be like ants attempting to wage a war

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.410
on humans. Except many thousands of times
harder.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.419
From our perspective, as a species, we feel
like we are supremely intelligent, compared

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:55.360
to our more primitive animal cousins. But
in reality, humans are only fractionally more

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.900
intelligent than say, an ape. But that tiny
fraction of increased intelligence has allowed

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.610
us to develop tools, language and thus civilisation.
If we were to plot the intelligence of every

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:16.770
animal on planet earth on a graph from one
to one thousand, if mice are at 1, then chimpanzees

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:25.060
would be at 4 and dolphins at 8, then that
would place humans at a grand total of...

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.080
10. Whereas a super intelligent AI would easily
be at 1,000, and likely many times higher.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.979
Our brains are the most complex organism we
have discovered in the entire universe but

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:44.130
as marvellous as they are, they are, at the
end of the day, limited. They are confined

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:50.690
within our skulls, with only limited room
for neurons. An AI would have no such limits,

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.139
our computing power isn't yet fast enough,
but when the time comes in the very near future,

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:01.479
and it will due to exponential growth, when
computer processors are many thousands of

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:07.200
times more powerful than they are today, AIs
will have access to as much computer processing

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.930
power as they desire. And since software can
travel at the speed of light, all over the

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:20.380
globe, there are truly no limits to how powerful
an AI can grow. Add on top of that the fact

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:26.060
that shortly after a super AIs conception,
it will most likely design its own faster,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:32.050
smaller and more transient hardware to run
on, hardware more powerful than humans could

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.050
ever fathom.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.719
Before the AIs do take over and your brain
becomes irrelevant, you should make the most

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:45.829
of it whilst you still can. That's why I regularly
use Skillshare to sharpen up my skills, an

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:14.129
I really enjoyed learning about how artificial
intelligence can be used to improve peoples

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:20.660
lives and real world problems by watching
the Skillshare course "Goal-Driven Artificial

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.690
Intelligence and Machine Learning" If you
want to create your own AI then you should

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.769
definitely give this course a go. Skillshare
is also more affordable than most learning

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:35.180
platforms out there: an annual subscription
is less than $10 a month. But since Skillshare

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.670
have supported me on this video I am able
to offer the first 500 people who click the

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.670
link in the description, 2 months of Skillshare
premium for free, so give it a go today, there's

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.670
no risk.

00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:53.290
The very moment in time when humans create
such a super intelligence - an artificial

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.980
intelligence that can re-write its own software
and becomes just one percent more intelligent

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:07.399
that humans has a name. This theoretical event
is called the "Singularity". Such an AI is

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:13.939
known within the scientific community as Artificial
General Intelligence, all the AI we have created

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:20.199
to date is Artificial Narrow Intelligence,
or weak AI, since it only operates within

00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:27.241
specific boundaries and performs pre-designated
tasks, such as shopping recommendations. But

00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:36.259
a general AI would be essentially creating
a sentient being, creating new life.

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:41.449
Recently the worlds greatest thinkers in the
fields of AI and futurism were surveyed on

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:49.040
what year they think the singularity will
happen, when will we create general AI? The

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:57.410
average answer was 2040, just over 20 years
from now but some scientists have said it

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:04.839
could happen as soon as 2029. Our current
technology is not even remotely close, but

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:11.019
in only 10 years it's highly likely that it
will be, because human progression and innovation

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:17.329
is and always has been exponential, it is
not linear. In the past 50 years we have made

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:23.660
more advances in technology than over the
entire history of the human race, and over

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:30.959
just the past 10 years, we have made more
technological advances than the previous 50.

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:37.160
Futurist and chief Google Engineer Ray Kurzweil
estimates that by 2021, we will be making

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.449
more advances and new discoveries in just
one year than we have over the entire past

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:48.589
century. This is known as the Law of Accelerating
Returns.

00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:55.379
98% of the scientific community agree that
the singularity will definitely happen and

00:11:55.379 --> 00:12:02.100
most of them believe it will happen in our
lifetimes. So what will happen to the human

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:10.579
race? Well, the fact is, we don't know and
we can never know, until the moment it happens.

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:16.939
One thing that all AI researchers agree strongly
on is that when the singularity happens one

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:25.309
of two extremes will happen - the human race
will either become extinct or become immortal.

00:12:25.309 --> 00:12:31.239
When creating AI we are essentially creating
a god, and we can't know if it will be a kind

00:12:31.239 --> 00:12:37.759
god or an evil god until its too late. This
is because the AI will be so many magnitudes

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:44.050
smarter than us, so our puny minds can't even
begin to imagine what a being of such supreme

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:50.149
intelligence would be interested in. What
would its desires, hopes, ideologies and morals

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:51.149
be?

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:56.509
If this omniscient AI turns out to be a merciful
god the future will be an incredibly exciting

00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:02.679
time but we'll look at that in a minute. Let's
first take a look at scenario number one,

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:06.679
the extinction of the human race. Because,
you know, it's nice to get all the doom and

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:12.160
gloom out of the way. If evolution has taught
us one thing it's that a species will do whatever

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:19.149
it can in its power to survive and reproduce.
There's no reason why AI would be any different.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:25.589
Our planet contains limited resources and
if the AI deems the entire human race as an

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:32.189
unnecessary consumer of said precious resources,
then it could decide to terminate us to free

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:35.910
up all those lovely resources and energy

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:41.290
The only reason humans are civil and decent
to other humans, most of the time, is because

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:47.850
they view them as intelligent beings. Why
do we find it so easy and guilt-free to swat

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:53.199
a fly yet we wouldn't instantly condemn a
stray dog to its death if it found its way

00:13:53.199 --> 00:14:00.059
into our home? Because the dog is more intelligent
than the fly, so humans, for some reason,

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:06.069
believe that that particular creature's life
is worth more, due to its intelligence. This

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:10.939
is called humanisation and its an ability
that psychopaths don't possess, their lack

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:15.839
of empathy when harming others comes from
the fact that they are unable to humanise

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:24.179
their peers, they see them as lesser beings.
So many Nazis felt comfortable and proud with

00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:29.670
mercilessly slaughtering millions of Jews,
because Hitler had quite wrongly portrayed

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:37.439
them as less intelligent and less worthy beings
than the German peoples - he had de-humanised

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:38.439
them.

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:44.550
An AI would be so many magnitudes more intelligent
than us that the chance of them de-humanising

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:52.279
us and seeing us more as a pest, similar to
how we see ants and mosquitos, is very high.

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:58.490
This would erase any moral guilt they could
potentially have about committing genocide.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.389
And how would they go about said genocide?
It would be a grand plan so intelligent and

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:11.309
complex that we can neither predict it nor
see it coming. Something like, the AI creating

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:16.149
trillions of nano robots that would enter
into the bloodstreams of every human on Earth

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:22.850
undetected and then, simultaneously release
a tiny quantity of the most toxic poison that

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:30.019
the AI is capable of creating, instantly killing
over 7 billion people.

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:36.519
We have no idea how a super AI would think,
it could be because of the most basic oversight

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:42.989
in its design. For example, if we create an
AI to grow potatoes for us and its primary

00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:51.519
goal is to grow as many potatoes as possible.
It could one day decide that to grow more

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:58.720
potatoes it needs more land and humans are
taking up that land, so it eradicates all

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.480
life on Earth, so it can have more room for
potato fields. This seems like a stupid prospect,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.850
but its entirely possible, because we don't
know what the motives would be of an AI, there

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:18.639
is no guarantee it would view life with the
same esteem as we do. One thing that will

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:24.540
not happen is the classic Hollywood image
of killer robots out of control. Such "hardware"

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.540
would be far too primitive and rudimentary
for a super AI, it's choice of weaponry would

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:37.089
be something we don't even know exists yet
and something far more effective and terrifying.

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:43.309
But what about the more cheerful outcome?
When the singularity hits, what if we discover

00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:49.769
that our new sentient overlord is merciful
and kind, then boy are we in for a wild and

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:56.069
exciting future. Once the AI reaches levels
of intelligence many thousands or even millions

00:16:56.069 --> 00:17:01.259
of times that of the human race there are
essentially three roles that it could take

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:02.579
within our world.

00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:07.440
It could act as an oracle, doing no more than
answering any question we ask it. Such as

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.260
"How do we solve world hunger?", "How can
we build a time travel machine?", "What is

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.480
the answer to life, the universe and everything?".
So it would essentially be Deep Thought.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.959
The second role it could undertake would be
more like a super intelligent servant, a genie

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:27.110
if you like, where it would actually enact
what we asked of it. A super-intelligent being

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:33.710
would very likely know how to modify, dissemble
and re-assemble atoms and even particles,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:39.540
and build anything it likes. So we could ask
it to build us a time machine, and it would,

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.590
using some advanced atomic-level construction
technique that us humans couldn't even begin

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.310
to comprehend.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:53.151
The final role it could take on is a ruler,
overlord or sovereign. Basically, a god. When

00:17:53.151 --> 00:18:00.290
the singularity happens there will be an intelligence
explosion, because of the recursive self-improvement

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:06.160
that the AI will be capable of, it will shoot
past human level intelligence like a rocket.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.480
Within days, possibly even hours it will have
solved world hunger, cured all diseases and

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.440
hereditary conditions, reinvented human transportation,
possibly even introducing us to teleportation

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.720
and figured out the most stable and fair political
and economic systems to run our world. But

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.050
all this is only the beginning.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:34.850
When I say we will have created a god, I'm
not exaggerating. The AI will effortlessly

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:41.721
be able to create and destroy life and shape
the very earth itself. Think about it, for

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:46.800
a few years now scientists have been able
to manipulate and move individual atoms in

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:53.710
the lab. If it's possible for us dumb humans
to move atoms then it goes without saying

00:18:53.710 --> 00:19:00.680
that a super-intelligent being could effortlessly
rearrange billions of atoms all at once, meaning

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.230
nothing in the universe will be safe from
its touch. The AI god could move mountains

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:13.840
and part the seas, Moses-style. Anything and
everything could be transmuted into something

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.620
else. Garbage could be transformed into bags
of rice or even chunks of meat, we would no

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:25.850
longer need to farm animals because atomically-identical
meat and other foods could be created out

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.060
of anything.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:35.440
This of course leads to immortality. If the
AI can re-arrange atoms then it could, theoretically

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.700
create an anti-aging box that an eighty-year-old
could walk into and come out the other side

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:47.330
twenty-years-old again. The AI could even
create super-intelligent nano bots that would

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:54.380
permenantly live inside all of us and would
constantly repair damaged cells, so we would

00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:01.380
no longer age. After all the body is like
a car, if we can repair it from the inside

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:07.390
it will keep going forever. The human body
is just a lot more complex than a car engine,

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:14.010
but it would be child's play to a super AI.
And if we were to get knocked down by a bus?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:20.680
No problem, we could of course ask the AI
to back up our brains in advance and a new

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:27.911
body, even a new identical brain, could easily
be created and the backup be restored, if

00:20:27.911 --> 00:20:33.220
the worst were to happen to us. We truly would
become immortal.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.280
Of course, we would eventually come to the
realisation that our bodies and limited brains

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.130
are only holding us back. We would eventually
abandon our physical bodies and upload ourselves

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:52.050
into a new digital realm, where we too would
become an AI, just as intelligent as the AI

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:59.400
god that we created. And once we have all
become sentient, space travel would be a breeze,

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.290
since we would all be software, we could simply
beam ourselves on a laser beam to other planets

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.950
and other galaxies.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:12.520
All I have talked about seems like science
fiction, possibly scenarios that could unfold

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.270
thousands of years in the future, but the
terrifying reality is that we are on the very

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:25.480
cusp of all this happening within the next
fifty to one hundre years or sooner, the majority

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.930
of the world's greatest scientists agree with
this. So the next twenty to fifty years are

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:39.030
going to be either terrifying or exciting,
but one thing is for sure, we are about to

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:48.210
create our very last and the most significant
invention in our entire 2.5 million year lifetime

00:21:48.210 --> 00:22:04.190
as the human race. Thanks for watching.
