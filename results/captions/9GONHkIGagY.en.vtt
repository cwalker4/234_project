00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.917
SENATE.

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:08.854
SENATOR GRAHAM.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.824
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU AWARE THAT AT 9:23 ON

00:00:08.987 --> 00:00:13.826
THE NIGHT OF JULY 9, THE DAY YOU

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:15.227
WERE NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.663
COURT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.433
SENATOR SCHUMER SAID, 23 MINUTES

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.234
AFTER YOUR NOMINATION, I WILL

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.702
OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:24.770
NOMINATION WITH EVERYTHING I

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.672
HAVE.

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:27.873
I HOPE I HAVE A BIPARTISAN

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:29.975
MAJORITY WILL DO THE SAME.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.743
THE STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.211
FOR ANYTHING LESS.

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:32.711
IF YOU WEREN'T AWARE OF IT, YOU

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.281
ARE NOW.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.549
DID YOU MEET WITH SENATOR DIANNE

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:38.651
FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20th?

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:39.051
&gt;&gt; I DID MEET WITH SENATOR

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.953
FEINSTEIN.

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:42.354
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW THAT HER STAFF

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:42.822
ALREADY RECOMMENDED A LAWYER TO

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:44.356
DR. FORD?

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:47.626
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.528
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW THAT HER AND HER

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.563
STAFF HAD THIS ALLEGATIONS FOR

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:52.565
OVER 20 DAYS?

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:52.865
&gt;&gt; I DID NOT KNOW THAT AT THE

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:55.434
TIME.

00:00:52.998 --> 00:00:56.168
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANTED AN FBI

00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:56.936
INVESTIGATION YOU COULD HAVE

00:00:56.302 --> 00:01:00.072
COME TO US.

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:05.811
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:07.580
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:08.314
HOPE AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.716
NOT ME.

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:12.151
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.954
FOR.

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:16.122
WHEN YOU SEE SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN

00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:17.323
THAT LINDSEY SAID HELLO.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:18.691
I VOTED FOR THEM.

00:01:17.456 --> 00:01:21.760
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THIS WHAT

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:25.331
YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:26.799
IN IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SCAM

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:30.569
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS.

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:32.338
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW THE

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:33.706
TRUTH, YOU SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:34.974
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID TO THIS

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.411
GUY.

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:39.679
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST?

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:41.681
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:43.449
&gt;&gt; I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:44.651
YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:46.586
BOY, YA'LL WANT POWER.

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:48.454
GOD I HOPE YOU NEVER GOT IT.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.455
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN

00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:51.491
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.991
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:54.894
HELD IT.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:55.762
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF

00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:56.062
PROTECTING DR. FORD.

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.699
NONE.

00:01:56.195 --> 00:02:00.033
SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:02.035
ARE.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:03.136
GOD I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:05.772
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.774
LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT COMES

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:09.375
TO THIS, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:12.111
FAIR PROCESS?

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.813
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:17.050
THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND.

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.684
YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB

00:02:17.183 --> 00:02:19.786
INTERVIEW?

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:21.454
&gt;&gt; THE ADVICE AN CONSENT ROLE --

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.823
&gt;&gt; DO YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU'VE

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:26.092
BEEN THROUGH A JOB INTERVIEW?

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:27.093
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:29.896
OF ADVICE --

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:30.563
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.831
THROUGH HELL?

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:32.332
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL AND

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:34.367
THEN SOME.

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:36.569
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.738
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:40.573
&gt;&gt; THIS IS HELL.

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:43.710
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:47.080
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME

00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:48.781
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP.

00:02:47.213 --> 00:02:50.817
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK.

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:51.818
YOU HAVE INTERACTED WITH

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.953
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR

00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:56.356
LIFE, NOT ONE ACCUSATION.

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:58.791
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILL COSBY

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.459
WHEN YOU'RE A JUNIOR AND SENIOR

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:04.864
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:06.733
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GOT OVER IT.

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.268
IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:10.837
IF YOU DRUG WOMEN AND RAPE THEM

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:12.706
FOR TWO YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.874
YOU PROBABLY DON'T STOP.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:17.377
HERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:19.512
IF YOU LIVED A GOOD LIFE, PEOPLE

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.815
WILL RECOGNIZE IT LIKE THE

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:22.649
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION HAS THE

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:27.654
GOAL STANDARD.

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:29.356
HIS INTEGRITY IS ABSOLUTELY

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.991
UNQUESTIONED, HE'S A VERY

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.563
CIRCUMSPECT IN HIS PERSONAL

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:39.466
CONDUCT, HARBORS NO BIASES OR

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:42.535
PREJUDICES, A DECENT PERSONAL,

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.870
WARM, FRIENDLY, THE NICEST

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.473
PERSON IN THE ABA.

00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:48.608
ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU, YOU

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:50.710
SHOULD BE PROUD OF, ASHLEY, YOU

00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:53.213
SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS.

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:55.915
THAT YOU RAISED A DAUGHTER THAT

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:56.950
HAD THE GOOD CHARACTER TO PRAY

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.253
FOR DR. FORD.

00:03:57.083 --> 00:04:03.189
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:05.559
YOU VOTE NO, YOU'RE LEGITIMIZING

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:08.862
THE MOST DESPICABLE THING I HAVE

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:10.230
SEEN IN MY TIME IN POLITICS.

00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:12.165
YOU WANT THIS SEAT?

00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:14.234
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.701
I HOPE YOU'RE ON THE SUPREME

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:16.103
COURT.

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:16.536
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE YOU SHOULD

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:19.039
BE.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.242
AND I HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:22.976
PEOPLE WILL SEE THROUGH THIS

00:04:22.376 --> 00:04:24.745
CHARADE.
