00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.009
and I stay out here this morning so I
thought I'd come and sit on the wall

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.000
drink some coffee and a little chat with
you about it's a very common mistakes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
that I see beginner photographers make
but first of all why do you make them

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.090
why do those mistakes come from well
very often it's from confusion because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.730
you encounter a problem you go online to
look for a solution and there is acres

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.910
of amazing free stuff out there online
for some incredible tutors just like me

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.950
however how do you know which order you
need to put that information together so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.270
you don't get confused so you don't make
mistakes how do you know how to string

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.930
those different solutions those
different answers those different bits

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
of learning together appropriately for
the shot that you want to take we're

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.680
gonna play with some sausages later to
show you now one of the things I would

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.579
suggest and this is also a mistake is
people say to me well why would I buy an

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.460
online course when I can get a lot of
free stuff on YouTube well I've just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
kind of told you when you buy a course
or a workshop or any training from me or

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.290
anyone else for that matter what you're
paying for is a guide to take you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.340
through that confusion to make sure you
do know the order in which you need to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.450
put things together so let's go have a
little look at some of the most common

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.210
mistakes I see beginner photographers
make let's find out here's a really good

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
place to do it I've taken this shot
loads of times I know it well and that's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.799
why I thought I'd bring you here this is
a tricky exposure what am i bringing you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.729
somewhere where it's tricky it's because
that's when these mistakes will happen

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.740
so let's have a little look at our shot
I'm gonna see if I can roll a little bit

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.110
of video in here so I can show you what
I'm thinking look nice we've got a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.930
little bit of reflection going on down
there in the water so we got the house

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.990
and we've got the sky but the sky is
quite bright when compared to the house

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.250
you see how that exposures changing
that's because my camera meter is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.810
changing the exposure according to what
I've pointed out so it is your camera

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.649
meter always right let's take a picture
if I just line the shot up

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.590
here we go I am on evaluative metering
so if we just line that shot up is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.189
measuring the entire scene and I take
this picture wait for a gap in the

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:26.489
traffic and there it goes
that's what we've got is that right dono

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.209
what do you want you have to realize
that you have to be in control of your

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
your your photography you're the one who
has to decide what you want so what if

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.609
we increase the exposure a little bit
because I think that looked just a tad

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:46.349
dark how about this one let's try again
there I've got a car in that one because

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.060
I don't waste time look first one a
little bit darker next one a little bit

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.459
brighter so was the camera meter right
or did I have to step in and tell it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:06.180
what it needed to do let's just take a
little look at that shall we so I'm

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.030
going to put my camera on to spot
metering and let's do a spot meter now

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:21.329
my spot is pretty much in the middle of
the frame so if I meter our shot it

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:28.769
looks like this mm not bad but what
happens if the spot isn't on a darker

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.739
area what happens if the spot is
somewhere else what happens if it was on

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.319
something a little brighter well that's
not very good is it the spot was on that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.370
horizon that bright area kind of
underneath the tree what happens if the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.370
spot is in a darker area if I move it so
it goes in kind of under the bridge

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.239
where the water's quite dark there
what's going to happen if we meter down

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.819
there if I just move it against it's not
in the right place here we go I'm just

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.689
going to meet her down there and I'm not
gonna wait for the traffic because again

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.400
we'll be here all day look at the
difference right so these are all spot

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.479
metered which one is right
see how these things start to join up

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.949
bit like a string of sausages the thing
you've got to realize is spot metering

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.680
isn't best spot metering is more precise
but unless you understand how a camera

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.020
meters light how into
corporates that metering into what it's

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:36.130
going to do to your exposure it's just
going to cause you confusion let's just

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.970
take a little look at that because in
the vast majority of cases which

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.750
settings you apply I'm really going to
make a lot of difference now here's our

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.150
shot let's just get it focused and lined
up let's take that shot at six forty at

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.330
five six now let's take that shot at

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.590
250th of F eight now let's take that
shot at one hundred and sixtieth at f/11

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:10.419
and have a little look back through them
because look it's the same thing people

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.650
get terribly hung up as beginners and
they make this huge mistake of trying to

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.760
copy settings
the thing is settings change all the

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.120
time just now we had to pause filming
because one of these little bits of

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.020
fluffy cloud going on up there went
across the Sun it changed the light that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.010
changes the settings unless you are
shooting within the infinity distance of

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.680
the lens then the aperture isn't really
going to make any difference and the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.630
shutter speed is only there to control
movement that's why there are so many of

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.400
them so unless you want to freeze or
blur movement it ain't really gonna make

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.949
a great deal a difference yes they do
but they do a lot more than that as well

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.599
look I'm gonna put my glasses down here
let's just take a little picture off

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.460
them so if I move back a bit with the
lens at about fifty five millimeters and

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.380
just get them in focus and take a shot
then zoom the lens double the focal

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.370
length move back
take the shot again put them in roughly

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.370
the same place I think there and if I
double it again and take the same

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.930
picture again reckon it's about here and
doing this very roughly there if we just

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.760
look at those pictures all three are
different but the glasses are very much

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.540
the same size in each shot I've done a
free video about this

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.750
I go way more in depth in one of my
courses and it's a common mistake people

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.950
make they're cutting off so much of
their own creativity now if you're

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.700
someone who's going to argue with what
I've just demonstrated yes you're right

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.870
but it's a very technical explanation
and if you're a beginner and you're

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.900
confused with some things you really
want to go into all that stuff about

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.190
cropping away pixels and it's the
distance not the lens the end effect is

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:08.770
make that longer move yourself the
picture looks like this no don't what

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.660
they do is they make great image files
but what you put into that image file

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.010
that's your choice that's not a camera
function that is a photographer function

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.940
and I think this is probably one of the
biggest mistakes a beginner photographer

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.850
can ever make
think about it how often have you been

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.850
summer and you thought you'll have a
little go at controlling the camera it's

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.590
not quite going as well as you'd hoped
so you bang it onto Auto and you give

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.100
responsibility back to the camera but
actually what the camera did an auto

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.330
still wasn't working either that's
because of the other problems the other

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.800
beginner mistakes we've just been
looking at now don't feel bad if you

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.280
don't know these things how can you know
them there's loads of things we don't

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.340
know when we're beginning with something
myself everybody in the world we've got

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.540
to begin somewhere we've got to learn
somewhere so these are some of the

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.310
mistakes that you need to avoid great
cameras this to me is the biggest do not

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.450
take great pictures they make great
image files what's in those files is up

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.320
to you does your camera know what
exposure it needs to take the picture

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.430
how bright or how dark does it know
where to stand what angle to shoot from

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.560
to get a great composition does it know
the decisive moment when to open the

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.670
shutter to capture a look to capture a
glance to capture the Sun breaking

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.420
through the clouds to light up the
mountains or to capture a lover's kiss

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.760
these are all photographer functions and
you do need to know your camera settings

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.400
and your controls in order to string
them together in the appropriate order

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:45.600
so that you can get the picture
sausage time now look so look imagine

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.470
would you want the picture to look like
where you gonna stand to take it what

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.970
exposure do you need to get it oh dear
they're all sort of tied up together

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.759
which aperture which shutter speed which
ISO how long a lens do you want etc all

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:11.459
these questions they all string together
and that is your photo I'm sorry I

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:15.509
couldn't resist that but in all
seriousness I'm pure confusion all the

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:18.660
rest of it yeah there's some great free
training out there I totally agree but

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.769
if you didn't know which order to put
together the information it's going to

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:26.910
add to your confusion rather than clear
it up so I hope your these beginning

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.130
mistake 7 has some value to you if they
have we'd really like to know more about

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.060
what's confusing you what are the things
you're confused by what are the mistakes

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.380
you found yourself making what are the
things you'd really work hard to try and

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.440
fix put them in the comments below
because we'd love to hear from you and

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.370
maybe just maybe if you come up with a
good enough question I might make a

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.810
video and give you a shout out to try
and answer your specific question can't

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:57.420
promise those so don't be disappointed
so um all these videos they come with a

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.760
free article by the way if you watch
them on my website if you subscribe to

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.300
my newsletter which is popping out I
think it's this site but it might be

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.790
that site though click the link pop over
there and I'll send you an email

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.329
whenever there is a new video there
meanwhile you can really really help me

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:18.569
make more free videos because it's
selling the courses and workshops that

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:21.149
pays for them but if you don't do that
please

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:24.480
share these videos around with as many
photographers as possible like and

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.069
subscribe that helps me make more of
them meanwhile take care have a great

00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:37.399
time see you next time oh got the
sausage
