WANT TO DELETE BECAUSE THAT
TELLS THEM YOU DELETED THEM.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:35.266 size:88% position:44%

THINK YOU'RE STILL FOLLOWING

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.233 align:start position:0%
THEM AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SEE
THEIR TWEETS.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEN THE TWEETS

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:47.133 align:start position:0%

AND YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU MUTE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT DRAMA!

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT HE'S
PRESIDENT.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, I DO.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.633
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE
PRESIDENT, I JUST DON'T NEED TO

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:52.633 align:start position:0%

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:57.233 align:start position:0%

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
TO HAVE MY PRIVATE LINE AND BE
ABLE TO CALL ME.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.666 align:start position:0%
I DON'T WANT THE UPS AND DOWNS
IN MY LIFE.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.766 align:start position:0%

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:09.533 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I DON'T THINK I
HAVE THAT.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:13.300
&gt;&gt; NO ONE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE IT.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.600 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO HOW DO YOU AS
NEWSMAN, A CORRESPONDENT FOR

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.933
"60 MINUTES," AS IT WERE -- HAD
THE TO THROW "60 MINUTES" IN

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:24.133 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.433 align:start position:0%
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I WAS IN
PHOENIX.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:30.933 align:start position:0%
I WAS IN PHOENIX FOR
"60 MINUTES."

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:31.133 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.266 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DO YOU JUDGE

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:34.166 align:start position:0%
ON WHAT TO REPORT ON?

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:40.600
THERE IS MORE BASIS TO THE
SCHWARZENEGGER TWEET THAN THE

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.466 size:84% position:42%
OBAMA TWEET, WHY ISN'T THE
SCHWARZENEGGER BIGGER NEWS?

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:47.500
&gt;&gt; I GUESS HIS RATINGS WERE NOT
AS BIG AS DONALD TRUMP'S WERE.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SAD END TO A GREAT
SHOW.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.533 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SADDISH SAD.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.166 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THE REPORTING ON THE TWEETS, I

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:59.433
THINK IT'S A LARGE DISTRACTION,
I THINK THAT'S CLEARLY PART OF

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:01.033 align:start position:0%
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT PURE
DISTRACTION?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S LIKE A SEISMOGRAPH,
THIS IS LIKE A REAL-TIME

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.833 align:start position:0%
SEISMOGRAPH OF THE INNER
WORKINGS OF THE PRESIDENT'S HEAD

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.133 align:start position:0%
AND IT'S FASCINATING.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.733 size:84% position:42%
AN EMOTIONAL SIZE MO GRASP.

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:23.533 align:start position:0%
HE'S LIKE A LIVE WIRE OF
EMOTION.

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:28.666 align:start position:0%
WE HAD TO WAIT FOR DECADES TO
HEAR NIXON ON TAPES.

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:33.700
WE HEAR DONALD TRUMP REALTIME.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.933
USUALLY PEOPLE TRY TO KEEP THE
PRESIDENT CLOISTERED AND NOT

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.133
BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ALL TIMES.

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
HE BREAKS THROUGH.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.500 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHOEVER PRIES THE
THE PHONE OUT OF HIS HANDS TAKES

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.566 align:start position:0%
SATURDAY OFF.

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.133
&gt;&gt; THE "THE WASHINGTON POST"
WROTE AN ARTICLE YOU QUOTED AT

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:52.900
THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW AND
PART THAT I FOUND FUNNY IS YOU

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
QUOTED A PART WHERE THE
PRESIDENT SAID AFTERWARD HE FELT

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.933 size:84% position:42%
BETTER LATER ON IN THE DAY.

00:04:57.933 --> 00:05:01.933 align:start position:0%
IT ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT HIM
NEED AGO RELEASE.

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:06.366
HE GETS ANGRY, IT BUILDS UP,
NEEDS A RELEASE, FEELS BETTER,

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:11.800
THEN GETS ANGRY, THEN NEEDS A
RELEASE -- THERE ARE MANY OTHER

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.833 align:start position:0%
FORMS OF RELEASE.

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:19.133 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DOESN'T DRINK,
SMOKE, DO DRUGS.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:21.233 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, THERE ARE THINGS
YOU CAN DO.

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:26.033 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WOULDN'T KNOW,
ANDERSON.

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:28.033 align:start position:0%
HANDS ARE TOO SMALL.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:30.833 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
LET'S GET TO THE FAKE NEWS

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
THING.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.266
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT CNN,
OVER THE YEARS, IT'S NOT LIKE

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:49.466 align:start position:0%
YOU WERE RAVING IDEALLOGS OVER
THERE.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:50.800 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE FAIR AND ACCURATE.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.633 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BALANCED?

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.300
I BELIEVE THAT'S TRADEMARKED.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.666
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE YOU SURPRISED
YOU GUYS ARE THE BAD GUYS AS

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:02.066 align:start position:0%
OPPOSED TO MSNBC?

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:05.233
&gt;&gt; THE THING, IS DONALD TRUMP
WATCHES CNN, WHICH IS WHY HE

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:08.666
TALKS ABOUT IT SO MUCH BECAUSE
HE ACTUALLY WATCHES IT AND EVEN

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:12.133 align:start position:0%
WHEN HE'S RAILING AGAINST IT,
HE'S WATCHING IT.

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:16.333 align:start position:0%
I'VE HAD HIM WATCH MY SHOW AND
TWEET ABOUT PEOPLE I'M

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.333 align:start position:0%
INTERVIEWING WHILE I'M
INTERVIEWING HIM.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:23.766
OH, THAT GUY IS A JOKE ANDERSON
COOPER IS INTERVIEWING, WHAT A

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:24.033 align:start position:0%

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
THINGS LIKE THAT WHILE YOU'RE
INTERVIEWING.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.333 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURPRISED HE SAID
THAT.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:31.266
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON YOUR SHOW.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.533 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )3

00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:37.333
YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT -- DOES
THAT CHANGE THE WAY YOU REPORT

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:41.266
YOUR SHOW, KNOWING THE PRESIDENT
IS WATCHING YOU GUYS AT CNN, DO

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:43.433 align:start position:0%
YOU TRY TO GET A RISE OUT OF
HIM?

00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:44.966 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU DO YOUR JOB.

00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.433
YOU WANT TO BE TOUGH AND -- I
MEAN, LOOK, I DIDN'T HAVE A

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:49.766 align:start position:0%
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
OBAMA WHITE HOUSE.

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:54.233
I USED TO INTERVIEW PRESIDENT
OBAMA ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL,

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:56.666 size:84% position:42%
BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:02.033 align:start position:0%
I SPENT TWO MONTHS IN
NEW ORLEANS DOING THE B.P. OIL

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:04.700 align:start position:0%
SPILL, AND THE WHITE HOUSE
STOPPED TALKING TO ME FOR YEARS.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.133 align:start position:0%
SO I DIDN'T HAVE GREAT
RELATIONSHIP, I DIDN'T VEALLY

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:08.900 align:start position:0%
HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.333 align:start position:0%
I ALSO DON'T WANT TO HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE PEOPLE.

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
I INTERVIEWED KELLYANNE CONWAY A
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.833 align:start position:0%
PROBABLY MAYBE MY LAST INTERVIEW
WITH HER EVER, I DON'T KNOW.

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:21.466 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NO, I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING BAD

00:07:21.466 --> 00:07:25.133
ABOUT HER, I'M JUST SAYING I
HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED HER SENSE.

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:30.066
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A 12
MINUTE INTERVIEW AND ENDED UP

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.333 align:start position:0%
BEING 26 MINUTES.

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:34.933
AT ONE POINT IN THE INTERVIEW,
SHE SAID TO ME, WE MAY HAVE TO

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:37.033 align:start position:0%
RE-THINK THE RELATIONSHIP WE
HAVE.

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
I WAS, LIKE, WE DON'T HAVE A
RELATIONSHIP.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.633 align:start position:0%

DON'T WANT TO HAVE A

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:42.266 align:start position:0%

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:43.133 size:84% position:42%
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:44.900 size:78% position:39%
I DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.666
I DON'T BELIEVE REPORTERS SHOULD
BE GOING TO PARTIES AT THE WHITE

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:47.866 align:start position:0%
HOUSE.

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.733 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I WENT ONCE, I'LL NEVER GO

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.000 size:75% position:38%
WHEN I FIRST GOT TO CNN.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.233 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK IT'S
GREAT.
