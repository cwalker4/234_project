00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.290
16 Places Stranger Than The Bermuda Triangle!

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.059
16.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.300
Superstition Mountains
Located in Arizona just outside of the capital

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.840
city of Phoenix, the Superstition Mountains
are well known for their mysterious nature.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.029
They are the site of the infamous Lost Dutchman’s
Gold Mine, where according to legend an immigrant

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.310
from Germany named Jacob Waltz discovered
a huge vein of gold.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.790
He then, again according to the legend, revealed
the location of the mine on his deathbed in

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.500
1891.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.640
Since then, many people have endeavored to
find the gold mine.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.850
Many mines have been found, but none have
been verified to be the actual Lost Dutchman

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
mine.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.899
It’s not known if the true location even
exists, let alone if it will ever be found.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.899
15.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.370
South Atlantic Anomaly
The Van Allen radiation belts are collections

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.820
of electrons and other charged particles held
in place by the Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.190
The area where the Earth’s inner Van Allen
radiation belt comes closest to the Earth’s

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.020
surface is known as the South Atlantic Anomaly,
and has been known to cause problems with

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.680
satellites and spacecraft which have to traverse
it periodically.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.920
Objects passing through the anomaly are exposed
to significantly higher levels of radiation

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.390
while they’re in it, and it’s even thought
to have started a chain of events which led

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.990
to the destruction of the Hitomi, which was
previously a Japanese x-ray observation spacecraft.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.259
14.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.720
Lake Anjikuni
A lake located in Canada has become the stuff

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.020
of legend after a very strange series of events
occurred there in 1930.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.090
Called the “myth of the vanishing village”,
the story goes that a fur trapper named Joe

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.990
Labelle visited the village as he had grown
accustomed to doing so, but found every person

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.100
there missing.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.520
Unfinished clothing items hung with sewing
needles still in them, pots of food hung over

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.659
stoves, and dogs which had died of starvation
after being left tied to their sleds all indicated

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.810
that the villages had either left or disappeared
very suddenly - at a moment’s notice.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.630
Various theories have surfaced to explain
the strange disappearances, ranging from the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.950
inhabitants being driven out, to those which
purport that the entire village’s inhabitants

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
- estimated to be about 25 people - had been
abducted by aliens.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.610
13.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.879
Area 51
You need only say the name, and most people

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.320
in the United States will start spewing out
conspiracy theories and dismissals automatically.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.520
Area 51 is not just famous, it’s infamous.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.560
The base, which is located in the middle of
the Nevada desert and is also called Groom

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
Lake.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.050
Dreamland, and Paradise Ranch, is said to
be the main facility at which the United States

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.200
government houses and performs tests on captured
alien spacecraft.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
Less out of this world claims say that the
base is used as a testing facility for the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.220
most top-secret aircraft in the world, and
this seems likely since the base houses one

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.430
of the longest airstrips on the planet.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.980
The US Government only officially even acknowledged
its existence in 2005, when commercial satellites

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.269
used for mapping, like those used by Google
for Google Earth, revealed that the base was

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.330
indeed there.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.459
Still, no real information about what goes
on at the base has come to light, and it’s

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.640
unlikely that the government will willingly
release anything about it anytime soon.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640
12.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.280
The Devil’s Sea
Called the “Pacific Bermuda Triangle”

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.760
and the “Dragon’s Triangle” as well
as its more well-known name, the Devil’s

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.790
Sea is a region located around Miyake Island,
which itself is about 60 miles south of Tokyo.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.810
It is known for being a region in which ships
vanish, specifically the Japanese research

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.909
vessel Kaiyo Maru No 5, which was destroyed
when an undersea volcano erupted.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.849
All 31 members of the crew aboard the ship
died in the event.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.060
Additionally, another 7 boats were lost between
1949 and 1953 - all of which were small fishing

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.060
vessels.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.060
11.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.140
Bigelow Ranch
Also known by its much more ominous sounding

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.400
nickname Skinwalker Ranch, Bigelow Ranch is
located southeast of Ballard, Utah and has

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.080
been the subject of a great many conspiracy
theories, UFO sightings, and speculations

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.730
of paranormal activity.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.970
These claims date back decades - with the
earliest reports of strange things happening

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.520
in the area dating back about 50 years.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.250
A 1974 book entitled The Utah UFO Display:
A Scientist’s Report cited that almost 100

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.120
incidents including vanishing and mutilated
cattle, UFO sightings, and orb sightings had

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.760
taken place in the area.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760
10.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.470
The Dulce Base
Referred to by many as the “real Area 51”,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.750
the Dulce Base is a supposed military installation
located on the Colorado - New Mexico border

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.500
under Archuleta Mesa.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.020
The base is said to be a joint effort between
humans and extraterrestrial visitors, and

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.990
has been the subject of an almost endless
array of conspiracy theories.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.470
Although the base has never been officially
acknowledged by any authority connected to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.280
the United States government, many point to
the fact that Area 51 was not officially acknowledged

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.840
for decades as reasoning as to why that may
be the case.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840
9.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.910
Point Pleasant
There are a few legends in American culture

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.990
which have stuck around through the ages to
become the stuff of true folklore.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.810
One of these is without a doubt the weird
events surrounding Point Pleasant, which would

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.900
become famous for The Mothman legend.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.150
The story states that a creature known as
the Mothman inhabits an abandoned TNT factory

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.880
in the area, and shows up whenever a terrible
event is about to take place.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.050
The legend has been around the area for quite
some time, with the first sightings of the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.330
creature having taken place in 1966 and 1967.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.780
In 1975 a book entitled The Mothman Prophecies
popularized the story, and it has since become

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.490
something of a cultural phenomenon.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.950
The city of Point Pleasant even holds an annual
Mothman Festival.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.950
8.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.130
Michigan Triangle
It seems that wherever there is water, stories

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.560
of the paranormal and downright strange are
simply bound to emerge.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.400
The residents of areas surrounding Lake Michigan
grow up knowing of one such story, which involves

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.350
what is called the Michigan Triangle.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.770
In 1891, a schooner called the Thomas Hume
set sail on the lake to receive a load of

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.770
lumber.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.419
When a bad storm stole across the region,
the Thomas Hume vanished without a trace,

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.210
and the crew of seven aboard it vanished with
the vessel.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.470
The boat has never been found, despite dedicated
and extensive searching.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.410
Since then, equally strange events have taken
place in the Michigan Triangle on a fairly

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.830
regular basis.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.090
In 1921 a ship called the Rosa Belle was found
overturned, and all 11 people who’d been

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.479
aboard had vanished.

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.880
Many UFO sightings have occurred in the area,
as well as sightings of ghosts and other paranormal

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880
entities.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
7.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.270
San Luis Valley
UFO sightings are abundant all across the

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.910
internet, and most are easily dismissed as
nothing more than overactive imaginations

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.580
or things which tend to happen when folks
have a little too much to drink.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.699
But sometimes an entire area becomes so well
known for UFO sightings, that you can’t

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.389
just help but wonder if there might be something
to it.

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.960
This is the case in San Luis Valley in Colorado,
where hundreds of UFO sightings have been

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.020
reported.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.680
The stretch of Highway 17 which passes through
the area has come to be known as “The Cosmic

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.350
Highway” due to the abundance of sightings
which take place there.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.560
Additionally, self-styled psychics have claimed
that there are large energy vortices in the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.990
area, which may also contribute to the sightings
and experiences.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.990
6.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.410
Hangar 18
In the relatively small town of Dayton, Ohio,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.810
there is an Air Force Base which will never
be far from the lips of any avid UFO hunter.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.479
This is of course Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, inside of which sits Hangar 18.

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.690
Hangar 18 is a legendary structure, known
throughout the UFO community to reportedly

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.470
hold the remains of the UFO which crash-landed
in Roswell, New Mexico, as well as the bodies

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.770
of the alien pilots who occupied the craft.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.880
It is believed that Hangar 18 has been used
since the arrival of those materials to research

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.360
and reverse-engineer the technology contained
in the craft, and numerous whistleblowers

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.360
have come forward to supposedly back up the
claims.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360
5.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.520
Bennington Triangle
In southwestern Vermont, there is a region

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.440
known as the Bennington Triangle.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.009
This region is mysterious because a large
number of people have gone missing inside

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:49.550
of it, with the bulk of those disappearances
having taken place between 1920 and 1950.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.860
A total of 9 people went missing in that time
range - with 5 of the disappearances taking

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.879
place in 1945 alone.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.540
Additionally, as is common with mysterious
places such as the Bennington Triangle, strange

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.449
occurrences and paranormal activity have also
been reported there.

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:09.470
The term “Bennington Triangle” was first
coined in 1992 during a radio broadcast, and

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.820
has since been popularized in novels and media
since then.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.820
4.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.530
Skeleton Lake
In 1942, a shocking discovery was made in

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.789
the Roopkund region of India when a British
forest guard came upon a frozen lake 16,000

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.060
feet above sea level.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.650
The lake, which is positioned at the bottom
of a small valley, contained dozens of skeletons.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.890
The following summer when the ice melted,
even more remains were found, both in the

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.539
lake and around its perimeter.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.870
It was unknown from whence these corpses had
come or what had caused their demise until

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.899
2004, when an expedition to the site solved
the mystery.

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:47.260
DNA evidence showed that the lake contained
two separate groups of people, whose remains

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.370
date back to 850 AD.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.100
Each skull seemed to have a similar wound
- a blow which looked to be caused by a large,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.860
round object.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.760
Researchers eventually came to the conclusion
that the groups had died in a sudden violent

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760
hailstorm.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.271
The bodies still rest in Skeleton Lake today,
though there are no roads leading to the location

00:09:05.271 --> 00:09:06.600
as of yet.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600
3.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.280
Bridgewater Triangle
Another mysterious site in the continental

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.840
United States is the Bridgewater Triangle,
an area of some 200 square miles which is

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.140
thought to be the site of a great deal of
strange phenomena.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:24.279
These have included ghost sightings, UFO encounters,
and even a few reports of Bigfoot-like creatures.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:29.131
Historic sites within the region include Hockomock
Swamp, the name of which means “the place

00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:34.500
where spirits dwell”, as well as Freetown-Fall
River Forest, where various cult activity

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.860
including animal sacrifices and ritual murders
have taken place, and Profile rock, where

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.450
a figure revered by the Wampanoag people known
as Anawan received a legendary wampum belt

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.450
from King Philip.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.290
It’s now said that the ghost of a man can
occasionally be seen sitting on the rock.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.290
2.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.930
Pine Gap
Called by many the “Australian Area 51”,

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.930
the Pine Gap facility is located about 11
miles south of Alice Springs, Northern Territory

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.200
in Australia.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.680
The base is operated in tandem by the Australian
military and the United States, and is officially

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.860
called the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.000
Although it is still considered to be a top
secret facility, the base is officially the

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.880
home of a large supercomputer complex and
contains a staff of more than 800 individual

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880
employees.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.700
Many researchers of UFOs and the paranormal
contend that there is much more going on at

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.800
the base than our governments would have us
believe - and the 2013 leaks of Edward Snowden

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.079
seem to back this up, though with more down
to earth claims.

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:36.490
The Snowden leaks showed that Pine Gap is
one of the locations where the PRISM operation

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.920
of global surveillance was carried out.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
1.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.480
The Nazca Lines
Few places on Earth are as instantly recognizable

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.310
- and instantly unusual - as the Nazca site.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.390
The plains, which are located in the Nazca
Desert in southern Peru, feature some of the

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.420
largest ancient geoglyphs ever made.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.600
These figures, which were drawn into the ground,
are so huge that most can only be fully appreciated

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600
from above.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.700
The largest figures reach lengths of up to
1200 feet, and the drawings are thought to

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.769
date back to 500 BC.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:09.070
Many have speculated that the Nazca people
made these images to speak with their gods,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.029
who are believed by a great deal of UFO researchers
to have been extraterrestrials.
