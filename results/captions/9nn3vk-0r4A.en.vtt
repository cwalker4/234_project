00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:07.851
HOWIE: LET'S TAKE A MORE

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:10.254
IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE DNC'S

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:13.724
DECISION TO BAR FOX NEWS FROM

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:14.959
THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.429
I SAT DOWN WITH BRET BAIER.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.096
WELCOME.

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:23.467
IF THE DNC HAD AWARDED FOX A

00:00:23.468 --> 00:00:25.369
DEBATE, YOU WOULD HAVE MODERATED

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.306
WITH CHRIS WALLACE AND MARTHA

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:29.874
MacCALLUM.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.244
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:34.578
DECISION?

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.479
BRET: DISAPPOINTED.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.581
WE HAVE A RECORD OF BEING FAIR

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:42.286
TO DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS,

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:42.953
WHOMEVER.

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:46.957
I WAS DOING A TOWN HALL IN

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.626
MICHIGAN WITH HILLARY CLINTON

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:49.960
AND BERNIE SANDERS.

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.529
BOTH SIDES SAID THEY THOUGHT IT

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.296
WAS FAIR.

00:00:52.297 --> 00:00:54.965
CHRIS WALLACE HAS BEEN TOUTED AS

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.802
A GREAT GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE

00:00:57.803 --> 00:00:58.235
MODERATOR.

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:01.172
A LOT OF PRAISE FROM BOTH SIDES.

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.174
HOWIE: YOU ASKED THE FIRST

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:05.376
QUESTION AT THE FIRST REPUBLICAN

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.646
DEBATE THAT WAS AIMED AT DONALD

00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:08.947
TRUMP.

00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:10.949
BRET: IS THERE ANYONE ON STAGE

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.184
WHO IS UNWILLING TONIGHT TO

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:15.820
PLEDGE YOU'RE SUPPORT TO THE

00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:20.125
EVENTUAL NOMINEE OF THE

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:24.396
REPUBLICAN PARTY?

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:26.231
MR. TRUMP?

00:01:26.232 --> 00:01:28.400
HOWIE: THIS "NEW YORKER" PIECE

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:33.271
SAID UNNAMED SOURCES SAY THERE

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:35.674
WAS A LEAK IN ADVANCE TO

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:36.641
CANDIDATE TRUMP.

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:39.177
BRET: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT COULD

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:40.812
BE TRUE, LOOKING BACK.

00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:43.248
WE HAD A VERY TIGHT CIRCLE ON

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.249
THOSE QUESTIONS.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.484
THERE WAS A LOT OF BACKLASH.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:48.987
WE SPENT TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:50.488
MOMENT DEFENDING BOTH OUTSIDE

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.124
AND INSIDE THAT WE WERE TOO

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.926
TOUGH ON DONALD TRUMP.

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.295
I DON'T THINK JUST BY THAT FIRST

00:01:57.296 --> 00:01:59.297
QUESTION IT SEEMED LIKE A MOMENT

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:02.167
THAT HE WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IN

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:04.736
HIS ANSWER.

00:02:04.737 --> 00:02:07.272
I CAN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY.

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:09.941
BUT IT'S ANONYMOUS SOURCES.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:12.477
THE FORMER HEAD OUR NETWORK YOU

00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:13.445
CAN'T ASK.

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:18.850
HOWIE: A FOX EXECUTE WHICH WITH

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:21.353
ROGER AILES TELLS ME HE WAS

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:23.255
FURIOUS AT THE QUESTIONS HE

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:27.592
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME.

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:30.529
THE PRIMETIME HOSTS AND HOSTS OF

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.330
"FOX AND FRIENDS" ARE SUPPORTIVE

00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.500
OF TRUMP, BUT NOT ALWAYS.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:37.469
TRUMP DOES WATCH A LOT OF FOX.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.571
BUT HERE IS WHAT WASN'T

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:40.639
INCLUDED.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.242
FOX HAS A FULL-FLEDGED NEWS

00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:46.345
DIVISION OF WHICH YOU AND I AND

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:48.981
OTHER REPORTS AND ANCHORS ARE A

00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:50.349
PART.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.852
DO YOU FEEL THAT'S OFTEN

00:02:53.853 --> 00:02:54.252
OVERLOOKED?

00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:55.454
BRET: YES.

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.189
THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.158
HAVE BEEN HERE, 22 YEARS.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.994
DEFENDING FOX.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:03.695
THERE ARE TWO SIDES.

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:05.330
THE NEWS SIDE AND OPINION SIDE.

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:07.899
THE LOUDEST CRITICS OF FOX ARE

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.668
OFTEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T WATCH.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.437
I SAY WATCH MY SHOW THREE TIMES,

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:15.073
THEN DROP ME AN EMAIL OR POST OR

00:03:15.074 --> 00:03:15.774
TWITTER WHEAT.

00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:18.076
THE PEOPLE WHO DO SAY THAT THEY,

00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:20.312
YOU KNOW, THEY GET IT, THEY

00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:21.814
THINK IT'S FAIR.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:24.817
HOWIE: YOU COMPLAINED ON THE AIR

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:27.553
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AN

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:30.155
INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:33.592
BRET: IT TOOK ME 600 DAYS.

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:35.995
I HAD TO CHASE HIM DOWN IN

00:03:35.996 --> 00:03:37.796
SINGAPORE TO GET MY FIRST

00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:38.330
INTERVIEW.

00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:41.066
CHRIS WALLACE WAS EVEN LATER

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:41.767
THAN THAT.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:42.434
LISTEN.

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.103
THERE IS A DISCONNECT HERE.

00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:45.538
THERE IS A BIT.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.740
CHRIS SAID THIS ON THE RADIO

00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:49.074
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:51.811
THERE IS A BIT OF FOX

00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:53.379
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME WITH A

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.146
SECTION OF THE LEFT.

00:03:54.147 --> 00:03:55.881
THERE ARE A LOT OF CANDIDATES

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:58.250
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:00.586
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO REALIZE THE

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:02.855
POWER OF THE VIEWERSHIP AND THE

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.024
POWER OF THE FAIRNESS OF THE

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:05.958
NEWS OPERATION.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.960
BUT OFTEN THEY ARE DROWNED OUT

00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.663
BY THE LOUD VOICES ON THE LEFT

00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:13.266
SIDE OF THE PARTY.

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:17.570
HOWIE: THE REPORT THAT FOX

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:20.573
KILLED THE STORY ABOUT STORMY

00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:22.775
DANIELS.

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:31.284
HER BOSS SAYS HE MADE THE

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:37.256
DECISION BECAUSE IT WASN'T

00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:41.294
SOURCED NOT TO PROTECT DONALD

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:43.529
TRUMP.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.236
BRET REQUIRE WAS A RUPERT

00:04:50.237 --> 00:04:51.671
MURDOCH PUBLICATION, THE "WALL

00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:53.239
STREET JOURNAL" THAT BROKE THIS

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
STORY.

00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.075
THERE WERE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

00:04:56.076 --> 00:04:58.278
THAT DIDN'T RUN WITH IT EITHER,

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.047
BUT I WANTS AWARE WE HAD

00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:03.516
ANYTHING PRIOR TO THAT.

00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:09.656
HOWIE: "TIMES" JAY CARNEY BECAME

00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:17.130
A PRESS SECRETARY, AND GEORGE

00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:24.137
STEPHANOPOULOS, SO THIS IS

00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:27.507
HARDLY UNIQUE TO FOX NEWS.

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:31.011
BRET: I'M DISCONNECTED FROM THE

00:05:31.012 --> 00:05:32.012
OPINION SIDE.

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:34.447
I LIKE TO THINK WE HAVE HORSE

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:36.416
BLINDERS ON AND WE LET NEWS

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.752
BUBBLE UP ON OUR PROGRAM.

00:05:38.753 --> 00:05:42.522
THE DEMOCRATS WHO COME ON SAY

00:05:42.523 --> 00:05:43.623
THAT WAS FAIR.

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:44.724
TOUGH AND FAIR.

00:05:44.725 --> 00:05:45.859
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.895
GET IF YOU HAD A DEBATE ON FOX.

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:52.098
HOWIE: IT'S MY JOB TO SOMETIMES

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.734
CRITICIZE WHAT HAPPENS ON FOX.

00:05:54.735 --> 00:06:03.744
TO ME THIS IS LIKE SAYING IT'S

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:04.978
UNFAIR TO FOX.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.447
YOU DON'T SEE LONG OPINION

00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:12.252
PIECES ABOUT WHETHER NBC AND

00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:15.889
CNBC CRITICIZE TRUMP AS CRAZY,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.590
UNHINGED, DANGEROUS.

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:19.726
SHOULD THE DNC CONSIDER THAT AS

00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:22.329
A STANDARD FOR AWARDING DEBATES?

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.865
BRET: I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THEM.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:25.766
I AGREE WITH YOU.

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:27.901
I THINK THERE IS A DISCONNECT

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:29.503
BETWEEN HOW WE ARE TREATED ON

00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:31.872
THE NEWS SIDE AND HOW OTHER OPEN

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:34.441
RACES ARE TREATED, GIVEN HOW

00:06:34.442 --> 00:06:35.943
THEIR OPINION IN PRIMETIME DEALS

00:06:35.944 --> 00:06:37.478
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.446
THE PRESIDENT TWEETS OUT THAT HE

00:06:39.447 --> 00:06:41.248
MAY NOT DO GENERAL ELECTION

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.150
DEBATES WITH OTHER NETWORKS.

00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:46.020
I DON'T THINK THAT HELPS US

00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:46.353
EITHER.

00:06:46.354 --> 00:06:47.721
BUT THERE IS A POINT HERE AT

00:06:47.722 --> 00:06:51.525
WHICH YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:52.159
FAIRNESS.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.628
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DNC IS

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:55.095
SAYING.

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:57.298
BUT IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT THEY

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.166
CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.235
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT ADD

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:03.571
THREE CYCLES OF TRYING TO GET

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:05.840
BACK A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, WE

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.708
HAVE DONE THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:09.376
THIS WAS THE YEAR.

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:11.479
I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THIS

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.813
DECISION.

00:07:12.814 --> 00:07:15.750
I DO FEEL THE "NEW YORKER" IS A

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:16.884
FIG LEAF.

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:18.586
IT'S BASICALLY WHAT THEY WANTED

00:07:18.587 --> 00:07:21.323
TO HAVE HAPPEN.
