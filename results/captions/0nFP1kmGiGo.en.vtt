WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"
EVERYBODY.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.205
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:09.209 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:15.348
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
YOU COULD BE THIS SHOCKED EVERY

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:19.119
DAY BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.621
I MEAN, FRESHLY SHOCKED.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.456
&gt;&gt; Jon: EVERY SICKLE DAY.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.526
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE EVERY DAY THEY ATTACH

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.964
THE ELECTRODES TO A DIFFERENT
PART OF US.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.865
( LAUGHTER )
AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT TODAY,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.500
THEY HAD TO SHAVE US FIRST.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.435 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
JUST TO GET CONTACT.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.570 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Jon: MMM...

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.443
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE AMERICANS
OF EVERY POLITICAL STRIPES HAVE

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.878
BEEN
HORRIFIED BY TRUMP'S HELSINKI

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.579
HELL SUCKING, WHERE PUTIN WAS
PLAYING CHESS, AND TRUMP WAS

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.482
EATING HIS OWN CHECKERS.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.850 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
CHOKING HAZARD.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.420
SHOULDN'T GIVE THEM TO HIM.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.488
AND EVERYONE AROUND TRUMP HAVE
SPENT THIS ENTIRE WEEK TRYING TO

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.959
PUT DISTANCE BETWEEN TRUMP AND
PUTIN.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.928
SO THIS WHOLE SORDID THING CAN
BE BEHIND US AND THE

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:04.164
ADMINISTRATION CAN GO BACK TO
THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS OF CAGING

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
TODDLERS.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:11.871
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, TODAY, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:17.911
THIS:
"THE SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA WAS A

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.080
GREAT SUCCESS, EXCEPT WITH THE
REAL ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, THE

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.182 size:75% position:38%
FAKE NEWS MEDIA.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:28.154 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start size:88% position:13%
SECOND MEETING!

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.574 align:start size:88% position:13%
SECOND MEETING, BECAUSE THE
FIRST ONE WENT SO WELL?

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.676
IT'S JUST LIKE THE EXCITING
SEQUEL COMING OUT THIS SUMMER:

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:53.379
"TITANIC II, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
"THIS TIME IT ENDS WELL."

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.318
( PIANO RIFF )
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
VAGUE.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.858
SECOND MEETING, COULD HAPPEN,5!l
WHERE WOULD HE EVEN MEET WITH A

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.294
UNIVERSALLY CONDEMNED, WAR
CRIMINAL STRONG MAN, WHO

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.763
PERSONALLY ORDERED THE ATTACK ON
OUR ELECTION?

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.966 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; SARAH SANDERS TWEETED JUST A
FEW MOMENTS AGO-- SAYING THE

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.735 align:end position:100%
PRESIDENT ASKED HIS NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON TO

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:23.443 align:start size:88% position:13%
INVITE VLADIMIR PUTIN TO
WASHINGTON THIS FALL.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.713 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: WOW...

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.281
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WHERE DOES THIS MUG
KEEP COMING FROM?

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.082 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'M SORRY.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.617 align:start size:88% position:13%
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:34.988 align:start size:88% position:13%
( PIANO RIFF )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.824
HE'S INVITING HIM TO WASHINGTON!

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.660
NOTHING COULD HAVE GONE WORSE
THAN YOUR MEETING IN HELSINKI.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.828
IT EMBARRASSED OUR COUNTRY.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.963
IT ENRAGED OUR ALLIES.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.798
IT STRONGLY REINFORCED THE IDEA
THAT PUTIN'S GOT SOMETHING ON

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.636 size:88% position:56%
AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOUR
PARTY TURNED ON YOU EVEN A

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.471 align:start size:88% position:13%
LITTLE.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:56.576
SO, LET'S COLLUDE IT AGAIN LIKE
WE DID LAST SUMMER.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.144
(AS TRUMP)
"THANKS, GUYS, FOR CLEANING ALL

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.446 size:75% position:38%
THE POOP OFF ME.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.282
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GOING TO MAKE A SNOWMAN OUT OF

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start size:88% position:13%

( PIANO RIFF )
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.136
( APPLAUSE )
THIS MEETING IS GONNA BE A TOUGH

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:27.106
ONE FOR DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE AND STATLER BEING

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:31.878 align:start size:88% position:13%
INFORMED OF WALDORF'S DEMISE
DAN COATS.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.647
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER, TRUMP THREW
COATS AND HIS INTELLIGENCE

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:39.052
AGENCIES UNDER THE BUS TO SIDE
WITH PUTIN IN HELSINKI, SO IT'S

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:43.523
HARD TO IMAGINE THE LOOK ON HIS
FACE WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THIS.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.159
LUCKILY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
IMAGINE IT, BECAUSE HE WAS

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.996
GIVING A LIVE INTERVIEW WHEN IT
BROKE.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.431
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.201
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ANNOUNCED ON
TWITTER THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.071
BE COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN
THE FALL.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.507 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; SAY THAT AGAIN?

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:06.145
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: DAN, WOULD YOU LIKE

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.982 size:78% position:39%
TO BORROW MY MUG?

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.623 size:84% position:42%
I GET HIS REACTION.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:26.199
( CHEERING )
I UNDERSTAND -- WELL -- WELL --

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.302
BLUB-BLUB -- I UNDERSTAND HIS
REACTION,

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:29.902
BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:30.536
CAN WE CHECK WITH SOMEONE?

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.738
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM WALKING
THIS BACK TOMORROW.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.006
(AS TRUMP)
"I'VE REVIEWED THE TRANSCRIPT

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND I NEED TO MAKE A
CLARIFICATION.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:40.947 align:start size:88% position:13%
I SAID I'M INVITING VLADIMIR
PUTIN TO WASHINGTON.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:46.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
I MEANT TO SAY, I'M INVITING

WASHINGDON'T."

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.895
( LAUGHTER )
MR. PRESIDENT, THEY JUST GOT YOU

00:04:55.895 --> 00:05:02.268
-- NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU JUST
FOUND THE STRENGTH TO ADMIT THAT

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
PUTIN IS
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:03.803
ATTACKING OUR ELECTION.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.637
SO LET'S INVITE HIM TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.706
(AS TRUMP)
"I WANT PUTIN FOR SUSHI DINNER,

HANDLED BY MS-13.

MAKE IT HAPPEN."

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.687
( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S HOW DISASTROUS THAT FIRST

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:24.123
SUMMIT WAS-- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THE BAD PARTS YET.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.659
BECAUSE REMEMBER THE TWO HOURS
WHERE THEY WERE ALONE WITH JUST

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.227 size:81% position:41%
THEIR TRANSLATORS?

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:31.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY
SAID.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.101
BUT THEY SAID SOMETHING, BECAUSE
TUESDAY, RUSSIA'S EMBASSY

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.503
TWEETED, "THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE
MINISTRY ARE READY FOR THE

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:41.607
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF

BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND
DONALD TRUMP."

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.345 size:75% position:38%
WHAT AGREEMENTS?

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.414
(AS TRUMP)
"OKAY, VLAD, YOU GIVE ME YOUR

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:52.952
CAPRI SUN, YOUR LUNCHABLES, AND
TWO OF YOUR OREOS, AND I'LL

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:56.823
GIVE YOU ALASKA AND ERIC."

( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.493 align:start size:88% position:13%
IS IT A DEAL?

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
IS IT A DEAL?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:10.503
IS IT A -- IS IT A -- A -- A --
( PIANO RIFF )

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:13.373
NOW, THERE IS ONE POSSIBLE DEAL
WE DO KNOW ABOUT, BECAUSE IN THE

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.976
PRESS CONFERENCE HE MENTIONED AN
OFFER PUTIN MADE ABOUT THE

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:19.946
TWELVE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE
OFFICERS ROBERT MUELLER INDICTED

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.049
FOR ELECTION INTERFERENCE.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.551
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE DID IS AN INCREDIBLE
OFFER.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:30.056
HE OFFERED TO HAVE THE PEOPLE
WORKING ON THE CASE COME AND

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.691
WORK WITH THEIR INVESTIGATORS
WITH RESPECT TO THE 12

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:32.658 align:start size:88% position:13%
PEOPLE.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:33.860 align:start size:88% position:13%
I THINK THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE
OFFER.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.161 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY?

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.997
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"HE GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLE DEAL,

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:42.168
HE SAID HE NEVER DOES THIS AND
HIS MANAGER'S GOING TO BE REALLY

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:46.606
PISSED AT HIM, BUT HE THREW IN
POWER STEERING, AN AM/FM RADIO,

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:51.277
AND HE PROMISES TO MAKE EUROPE
GO AWAY."

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.780
( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S THE ACTUAL DEAL: PUTIN

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.883
SAYS RUSSIANS WOULD INTERROGATE
THE RUSSIANS, AND MUELLER COULD

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
WATCH.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.888 align:end position:100%
BUT, IN EXCHANGE, RUSSIANS WOULD
THEN ALSO GET TO INTERROGATE

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.389

OF HIS CRITICISMS OF RUSSIA'S

HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.971
THAT IDEA IS RIDICULOUS... SO,
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.374 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES YESTERDAY
NAMED SEVERAL AMERICANS WHOM

MICHAEL MCFAUL.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.512
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT THAT
IDEA?

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:27.647
IS HE OPEN TO HAVING U.S.

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:29.348
OFFICIALS QUESTIONED BY RUSSIA?

HIS TEAM AND WE WILL LET YOU

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:35.555

ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT.

STATE DEPARTMENT, WHAT'S THE

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:46.999

THAT THE WORD?

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.367 size:78% position:39%
IS THAT THE WORD?

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:49.202 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S TWO WORDS.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:53.539
&gt;&gt; Jon: PUT THEM TOGETHER.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:54.740 align:end position:100%
ONE CURRENT U.S. DIPLOMAT SAID,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.726

-- SO

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.846 align:start size:88% position:13%
BY DEFINITION, IT'S THE MOST
DIPLOMATIC WAY TO PUT IT.

ARE SHOCKED.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.484 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.153
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY ABSURD.

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:44.423
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE LIKE A VICTIM
ALLOWING THE BURGLAR TO SET

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.058 size:88% position:56%
UP THE HOME SECURITY SYSTEM.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:51.430
&gt;&gt; TO EVEN ENTERTAIN THIS SHOWS
TO ME HOW NAIVE THEY ARE.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.598
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE
OFFER.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:57.169 size:88% position:44%
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.304
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: EARLIER TODAY, THE
WHITE HOUSE FINALLY CAME

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:58.804
OUT STRONGLY AGAINST...

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.774 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEMSELVES.

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:04.710
SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS TOLD A
REPORTER THAT "IT IS A PROPOSAL

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.015
THAT WAS MADE IN SINCERITY BY
PRESIDENT PUTIN, BUT PRESIDENT

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:10.983
TRUMP DISAGREES WITH IT."

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.553
YEAH, TRUMP DISAGREES, BUT HE
WAS IMPRESSED THAT IT WAS A

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:17.723
PROPOSAL MADE IN SINCERITY.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:21.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT USED TO
SINCERE PROPOSALS.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:22.395 align:start size:88% position:13%
(AS TRUMP)
"WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:22.929 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU WILL?

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:23.396 align:start size:88% position:13%
DAMN IT.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:27.867
I'LL GO TELL MY WIFE."

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.403
( LAUGHTER )
SO WE KNOW TRUMP IS IN PUTIN'S

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.704 align:start size:88% position:13%
POCKET.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:34.073
THE QUESTION REMAINS: WHY?

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.676 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE'S ONLY TWO POSSIBLE
ANSWERS.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:40.379
EITHER PUTIN HAS SOMETHING ON
HIM, OR HE'S AN IDIOT.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:44.684
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF PROOF ON
BOTH SIDES.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.585
( LAUGHTER )
HE DOES EVERYTHING PUTIN ASKS

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.589
FOR, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HE
CAN'T SPELL, HE CONFUSED H.I.V.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
WITH H.P.V., HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY WE FOUGHT THE

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:56.028
CIVIL WAR, AND JUST LOOK AT THIS
PICTURE OF HIM PLAYING IN A BIG

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
TRUCK.

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.801 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.704
BUT WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT,
WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT TRUMP

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:05.871
CANNOT STOP COZYING UP TO PUTIN.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:09.609
THAT'S WHY, TODAY, I'M HOLDING
AN INTERVENTION.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:15.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR
BEING HERE.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:19.352
I'VE WRITTEN MY THOUGHTS DOWN
BECAUSE THIS IS SO EMOTIONAL.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:29.829
( LAUGHTER )
SIR, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:35.668
OUR COUNTRY VERY MUCH, AND YOU
ARE -- IN IT.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:36.836 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
AND WE NEED YOU TO HEAR SOME

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:37.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
THINGS.

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:42.141 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHEN YOU ATTACK NATO, I FEEL
LIKE I'M BEING ATTACKED.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:42.808
AND YOUR FRIEND VLADIMIR?

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.811 size:88% position:56%
HE'S NOT REALLY YOUR FRIEND.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:46.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY?

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:47.380
YOU'RE DOING WHAT HE WANTS
BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S FUN, BUT

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.382
WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE IS, IF
YOU EVER STEP OUT OF LINE, HE'S

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.417 size:88% position:56%
GOING TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT
YOU'RE A BIG DIRTY CLOWN WHO

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:54.387 size:78% position:39%
LOVES THE PEEPEE.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:11:01.093 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, INSTEAD OF SUCKING UP TO

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:05.665
DICTATORS, WE WANT YOU TO FIND A
SAFER HOBBY.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:10.636
LIKE VOLCANO PARKOUR, OR SHARK
DENTISTRY.çóxD

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:15.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
OR HEROIN.xD

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.443
AND WE'VE GOT A FACILITY WAITING
FOR YOU.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.979
YOU CAN GO THERE ANY TIME AND
WE'LL PAY FOR IT.

PAUL MANAFORT'S ALREADY THERE.
