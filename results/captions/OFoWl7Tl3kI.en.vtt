00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.026 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JOYCELYN.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.027 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND ASRIEL.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.965 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHO IS 21.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:35.935 align:start position:0%
AND HE IS 52.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.804 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS KIND OF MY REACTION
TOO.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.038 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:47.213
AND THERE IS AGE DIFFERENCE,
THAT HE IS IN-- THEY ARE BOTH

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.215
HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE SAME TIME.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:50.783 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I UNDERSTAND R.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.652 align:start position:0%
KELLY STAYED IN THE ROOM FOR
THAT INTERVIEW.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.020 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE THING.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:01:00.359
I HAD BEEN WORKING WITH HIS-- HE
HAS A MANAGEMENT PERSON, DARRELL

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:03.563
JOHNSON, AND HE SAID ROBERT WILL
NOT BE IN THE ROOM, OKAY, GREAT,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.065 align:start position:0%
AND DARRELL WAS STANDING BEHIND
ME.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:09.435
THE GIRLS ARE IN FRONT OF ME,
WHEN YOU GO INTO A SWANKY SUITE

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.638
THEY VEY LITTLE HALLWAY BEFORE
YOU GET INTO THE MAIN ENTRANCE.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.808 align:start position:0%
I SAW ROBERT LEAVE, I DID NOT
SEE HIM COME BACK IN.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.644 align:start position:0%
SO I DID NOT KNOW THEY HAD COME
BACK IN.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:22.882
NEITHER DID DARRELL JOHNSON WHO
ASSURED ME HE WOULD NOT BE IN.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.784 size:84% position:42%
SO I'M NOT BLAMING DARRELL.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.653
R. KELLY COMES BACK IN, HE CAN
HEAR THE CONVERSATION, HE IS OUT

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.690
OF MY EYESIGHT AND OUT OF THE
GIRL'S EYESIGHT TOO, THEY DID

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.893
NOT SEE HIM, BUT WHEN THERE WAS
A QUESTION HE DIDN'T LIKE AND I

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:39.332
CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE,
YOU HEAR THIS-- -- I AM A LITTLE

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.835
IRRITATED BECAUSE I'M THINKING
WHO ON THE CREW IS KROF COUGHING

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start position:0%
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW WHEN ARE YOU
TAPING, YOU WOULD MUCH RATHER

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:51.310
CHOKE THAN INTERRUPT A TAPING,
SO I AM THINKING WHO IS THAT,

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:52.511
AND THEN I AM CLEARED IT IS R.

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:57.817 align:start position:0%
KELLY, I'M TOLD HE IS TALKING TO
MY CREW, THEY ARE DOINGOGUE,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.187 align:start position:0%
SHOULD I GO IN AND STOP T SHOULD
I STOP IT, HE IS HAVING A

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.755
DIALOGUE WITH PEOPLE ON MY TEAM.

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
THEY SAID NO, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY LEAVE ALONE.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.592
WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.262 align:start position:0%
BUT THE GIRLS ARE SO ANGRY, SO
ANGRY THE WAY THEY SPOKE.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:13.199
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ASRIEL HE'S
DAD CALLED ME, HI BEEN TALKING

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start position:0%
TO HIM TO APOLOGIZE, HE SAID FOR
THE BEHAVIOR OF MY DAUGHTER.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.705 align:start position:0%
HE CALLED ME TODAY.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.407 align:start position:0%
THAT IS NOT THE DAUGHTER I
RAISED.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.942 size:84% position:42%
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT GIRL.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.277 align:start position:0%
IS I'M SO SORRY.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.712 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HER PARENTS ARE
VERY WORRIED.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.849
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE TERRIFIED, BOTH SETS
OF PARENTS ARE TERRIFIED BECAUSE

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:32.185 align:start position:0%
THEY BELIEVE THEIR DAUGHTERS
HAVE BEEN BRAIN WASHED.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.788 align:start position:0%
THESE GUYS, THEY ARE 21 AND 23,
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW.

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.525
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE R. KELLY
STORY IS GOING TO END, WE REALLY

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.793 align:start position:0%
DON'T.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.563
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THOSE
GIRLS ARE GOINGED TO NEED THEIR

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.164 align:start position:0%
FAMILIES SOONER I THINK RATHER
THAN LATER.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.432 size:78% position:39%
SO IT WAS HEART BREAKING.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.303
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND IN THE SPECIAL
TOMORROW NIGHT YOU HAVE AN HOUR

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.071 align:start position:0%
LONG SPECIAL AT 8 P.M.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.606 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE WORKING ON IT RIGHT
NOW, RIGHT NOW.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HAVE GOT AN
EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK AT PART OF

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.243 align:start position:0%
IT HERE.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:03.249 align:start position:0%
THIS IS YOU TALKING TO R. KELLY,
I THINK, ABOUT HIS HISTORY OF

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.384
BEING WITH INAPPROPRIATE GIRLS.

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:07.553
&gt;&gt; I WASN'T SURE WHAT THEY HAD.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.754 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.924 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW THAT
ABOUT YOU, WHY DO YOU CONTINUE,

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:16.262 align:start position:0%
IT SEEMS, TO CONTINUE TO SEE
YOUNG WOMEN?

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.497
WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO DID THAT?

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.132 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHY DO I CONTINUE TO SEE
WOMEN.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:21.834 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING
WOMEN.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.536
&gt;&gt; I KNOW OLDER WOMEN AS WELL.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:33.579 align:start position:0%
I KNOW-- 43 YEAR OLDS, THEY
COOL, I GO OUT WITH THEM, I LOVE

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.813 align:start position:0%
WOMEN.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.983 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE THING, WHEN I ASKED R. KELLY

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.086
ABOUT YOUNGER WOMEN, DON'T YOU
THINK CONSIDERING YOUR BEHAVIOR

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.522 align:start position:0%
THAT YOU MIGHT SAY TO YOURSELF,
MAYBE THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.525
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A "HE SAID,
SHE SAID" THIS IS A "HE SAID,

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.828 align:start position:0%
SHE SAID" SHE SAID HE SHE SAID
SHE SAID HE SHE SAID.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.697 size:81% position:41%
AND HE KEEPING SAYS THAT I
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.698 size:81% position:41%
ALL THESE WOMEN ARE LYING.

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:55.067 align:start position:0%
I GO EVERYBODY IS LYING EXCEPT
FOR YOU?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.904 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, THAT JUST-- THAT JUST
DEFIES LOGIC.

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:01.440
WHEN I WENT INTO THE INTERVIEW I
KNEW HE WASN'T GOING TO SAY YOU

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.110 align:start position:0%
KNOW GAYLE, YOU ARE RIGHT, HAVE
I DONE TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:07.246
BUT I DID THINK THAT ON SOME
LEVEL HE WOULD HAVE A MOMENT OF

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.914 align:start position:0%
REFLECTION, HE WOULD HAVE CON
TRIGS.

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:13.185
SO IT BECAME VERY, YOU KNOW,
VERY TROUBLING TO ME TO SEE HIM

00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:14.687 align:start position:0%
REALLY JUST FALL APART.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.424 align:start position:0%
I THOUGHT WE WERE
WITNESS-- WITNESSING OF THE

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
SELF-DESTRUCTION OF A MAN HAVING
A BREAKDOWN, THAT IS NEVER A

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:22.461 align:start position:0%
GOOD THING TO SEE.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:23.629 align:start position:0%
NEVER.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:25.264 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT HOW WE AS AN AUDIENCE OR

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:29.101 align:start position:0%
FANS CAN APPROACH THE ARTIST'S
WORK ETHIC.

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:30.335 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU SEPARATE IT.

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:35.074
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MICHAEL JACKSON IS
BEING PULLED OFF RADIO STATIONS,

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.610
PLAY LISTS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:38.744 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.780 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN YOU STILL
ENJOY THE WORK OF ARTISTS LIKE

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.515 align:start position:0%
R. KELLY OR MICHAEL JACKSON
AFTER THIS.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.749 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THAT.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.086
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, LISTEN, THAT
SONG I BELIEVE I CAN FLY WAS ONE

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:50.256 size:88% position:44%
OF MY FAVORITE SONGS, SERGE
LOVED ALL OF MICHAEL'S WORK.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.693 align:start position:0%
BUT FOR ME IT'S HARD TO SEPARATE
IT NOW.  AND I THINK THAT YOU

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.896
KNOW, YOU HAVE TO DI SIDE FOR
YOURSELF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.364
BUT THESE ARE DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
AND WE ARE HEARING IT NOW WITH
DIFFERENT EARS.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:04.170 align:start position:0%
WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO IT IN
A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T PAID A

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.338 size:81% position:41%
CONTINUATION TO IT BEFORE.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.774
AND THE THING ABOUT MICHAEL
JACKSON AND R. KELLY, NONE OF

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.042 size:81% position:41%
THESE ARE NEW ALLEGATIONS.

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:12.712 align:start position:0%
WE ARE ALL HEARD THESE
ALLEGATIONS FOR YEARS.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:16.349 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK BECAUSE WE AS A
SOCIETY LIKE THE MUSIC, WE SAID

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.651 align:start position:0%
W-8, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE
ACQUITTED, SO OKAY.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:21.253 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL ENJOYING
THE MUSIC.

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:24.123
BUT NOW WHEN YOU SEE THE PEOPLE
COME OUT AND THEY ARE TALKING

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:26.726 align:start position:0%
THE WAY THAT THEY ARE TALKING,
YOU CAN'T UNHEAR THAT.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.895
YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT YOU

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
CAN'T UNHEAR IT.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:33.733 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK WE ARE LISTENING TO
IT NOW VERY DIFFERENTLY.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.435 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, GAYLE, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

00:05:36.468 --> 00:05:37.903 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME,
REALLY, REALLY.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.037 align:start position:0%
