00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.220
Since December 2018, China’s biggest company,
Huawei, has has been rocked by political and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.240
legal turmoil.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.280
Huawei, a company that most Americans may
not have even heard of until just recently.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.010
The FBI is investigating Huawei’s dealings
with this tiny Chicago-area startup…

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.470
Huawei can create a backdoor to China.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.530
The Trump administration has been on a campaign
to block Huawei from selling equipment for

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.560
5G networks in the U.S. and allies abroad,
claiming the company poses a national security

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
threat.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
Speak to the company’s customers and they
paint a different picture.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.100
To them, Huawei makes reliable, affordable
equipment without equal.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.220
This is the story of how Huawei went from
a small-time parts reseller to the homegrown

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.109
tech giant China always hoped for, and the
west always feared.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:52.480
I am announcing that a grand jury in seattle
has returned an indictment that alleges 10

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.269
federal crimes by two affiliates of telecommunications
company Huawei

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:08.530
There is clearly a full court press in Washington
to make it seem as though Huawei poses a grave

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.530
threat to the future of Western civilization
literally, and that's why you saw the Commerce

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.110
Secretary, the FBI director, and the acting
Attorney General of the United

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.890
States at a press conference for what were
really not that serious a charge.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.050
Huawei’s recent spat with the U.S. began
in December with the arrest of Meng Wanzhou,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.390
Huawei’s CFO and daughter of the company’s
founder.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
Then in January, the U.S. indicted the company
for theft of trade secrets, conspiracy, and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.530
obstruction of justice stemming from a previous
lawsuit brought by T-Mobile.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.670
Bloomberg Businessweek discovered that January
28th, the same day as the Attorney General’s

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
announcement, the FBI raided a Huawei-owned
lab in San Diego under suspicion that it had

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.201
stolen groundbreaking smartphone glass technology
from another firm.

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:54.201
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has
come close to issuing an us-or-them ultimatum

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.201
that nations buying from Huawei might find
they can't shop for American technology too.

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.770
But Huawei’s troubles aren’t anything
new, having been accused by Cisco in 2002,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.960
and Motorola, in 2010, of intellectual property
theft.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.160
Since 2012, major U.S. telecoms have essentially
blackballed Huawei thanks to government pressure,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.580
which while damaging hasn’t done much to
slow its progress worldwide.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.590
Huawei was founded in 1987 by former People’s
Liberation Army engineer Ren Zhengfei in Shenzhen.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.760
At the time, all of China’s telecommunications
equipment was imported from abroad- Ren wanted

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.510
to build a domestic competitor that could
rival and eventually surpass foreign companies.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.019
The company moved quickly from reselling telephone
switches made mostly in Hong Kong, to reverse-engineering

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.319
equipment made abroad for Huawei to manufacture
itself.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.410
Its early contracts with groups like the People’s
Liberation Army gave Huawei the Government

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.560
connections it needed to grow, and its high-quality
products did the rest.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.010
They're really good at what they do.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.999
They build very sophisticated devices that
power wireless systems and cellular systems

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:57.819
and telecom and the backbone of the internet,
the networking environment, and they do it

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.299
at a much lower price point.

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.650
Better equipment, lower cost.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.160
//There are other countries, other companies,
primarily in Europe that make this stuff,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.739
but Huawei is by far the price performance
leader at the moment.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.040
By 2012, Huawei had become the biggest telecoms-equipment-maker
in the world.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.120
And in 2018, it overtook Apple as the second-biggest
smartphone manufacturer.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.200
But what could be Huawei’s biggest success,
and what scares countries like the U.S. so

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.109
much, is its role in building the backbone
of the coming 5G revolution.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.159
It has a lot to do with the specific character
of the 5G world.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.120
It's going to be far more software driven,
which is far more open to very hidden, very

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.560
subversive, very discreet back doors that
could allow malevolent states or hackers or

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.950
others with the control and means over the
technology to wreak all sorts of havoc.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.510
To this end, Congress has enacted a ban on
government agencies and contractors purchasing

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.620
Huawei equipment.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.099
Ren Zhengfei and Huawei have always maintained
that the business is “employee-owned,”

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.309
and they would not cooperate with any interference
from China’s government.

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.400
U.S. officials like to point out that they
may not have to.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:17.979
China passed a law that requires all companies
and all individuals in China to cooperate

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.289
with the Intelligence Services if asked.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.919
So, the China Hawks are saying, "Well, we
don't have to give anyone proof of past bad

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.571
behavior, because, with that law on the books,
the potential is there for the government

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:36.580
to simply commandeer Huawei for its' own purposes.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.370
5G tech will be far more prevalent in daily
life than anything we’re used to now, and

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.129
the country that controls or builds 5G will
simply have more influence than they used

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.129
to, on a global scale.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.280
there's companies and executives all over
the world, including in the United States,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
who absolutely swear by them.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.620
So China’s long-hoped-for tech giant has
finally arrived.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.389
What remains to be seen is how much more of
the world Huawei can conquer- and if the U.S.

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.389
can slow it down.
