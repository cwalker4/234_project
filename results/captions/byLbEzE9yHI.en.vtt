00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.703
GUEST: Well, it was a
gift from my father.

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.338
My father grew up in
Greenwich, Connecticut.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.307
It was given to him
from a neighbor.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:12.245 align:start position:0%
His neighbor was a civil
engineer, and his neighbor also
ran a radio repair shop in his

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
basement, and my dad
helped him repair radios.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:21.254 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he actually told me
that this man inspired him
to go on to M.I.T., and...

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.689
So it's really special.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.424 align:start position:0%
APPRAISER: We know it's a pocket
watch, it's 18-karat gold.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:28.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was made by Smith
&amp; Son in London.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.529
GUEST: Okay.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.598 align:start size:88% position:13%
APPRAISER: And they
were famous watchmakers.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
They made watches for
the British royalty,
they made them for the
Admiralty, for the navy.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.473
They were very famous for
making chronometers and
very accurate timepieces.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.609
They also made watches
for the king of Spain.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.177
GUEST: Oh, okay.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.579
Because it's called the king
of Spain watch by my family.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.214
APPRAISER: Oh, is that right?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.217 align:start size:88% position:13%
GUEST: Right, it's
written somewhere on it,
I think on the inside.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.853
APPRAISER: Okay, well, we'll
open it up and look at it.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.588
Let's study the face
of the watch first.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.690
You have an hour hand, of
course, like all watches.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.093 align:start size:97% position:3%
And a minute hand, and a
constant running second hand.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
But do you know what
that little dial is, and
that hand is, up there?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
GUEST: I'm not sure, I think
it said, "Wind," on it.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.033
It says, "Up-Down."

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.034
APPRAISER: Wind?

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.035
GUEST: Yeah.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.036
APPRAISER: Okay.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.771
GUEST: That's all I know.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.808
APPRAISER: It's called a
power reserve indicator
or a winding indicator.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:19.245
And basically it would tell you
how much time the watch had left
before it would stop ticking

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you would know when
to wind the watch.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.048
GUEST: Oh, "Wind." (chuckles)

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.683 align:start size:97% position:3%
APPRAISER: And I'm just going
to give it a quick turn.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:28.688 align:start size:97% position:3%
As we... turn the watch to
wind it, watch that hand move.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.024
Do you see it's moving?

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.459
GUEST: Oh, look at that.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.461
Okay.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.664 align:start position:0%
APPRAISER: And so, that winding
indicator would turn, and
you would know when you wound

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.132
the watch all the way up.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.267
You'd also know when you'd
have to wind the watch again.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.037
It's a very heavy case,
18-karat solid gold.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:48.575 align:start size:94% position:6%
The case was made by
Frederick Thoms, who was a
famous English case maker.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
Now, the watch has an
enamel-porcelain dial, which has
a very faint hairline crack, and

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
that was about the only
flaw that I could see in it.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
But other than that, the watch
has a very special feature
that I want to show you.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.722
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.859
APPRAISER: When we open up
the back of the watch, you'll
see here that-- there's the

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.861
escapement of the watch.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.998 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now, this has a very
special type of escapement
known as a tourbillion.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.933
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start size:97% position:3%
APPRAISER: And the whole
escapement makes one
revolution every 60 seconds.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:22.842 align:start position:0%
Tourbillions were invented by
Breguet, who was really the most
famous watchmaker in France.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.112
He was 50 years ahead
of everybody else.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:30.450
Breguet didn't make this
actual tourbillion, but
this was his invention.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.455 align:start size:97% position:3%
And what it was made for was
to counteract the effects
of gravity on the watch.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:41.027 align:start position:0%
When a watch lays flat, gravity
is pulling on it and can
affect the timekeeping of it.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
And if you turn the watch
over, now gravity's pulling
on it in another way.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.036 align:start size:97% position:3%
So it was thought that if
the escapement was constantly
revolving, gravity would never

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.872
be pulling on it in one
particular direction.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:57.277
And, therefore, it would
be of the utmost accuracy.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:01.247
These escapements are
really incredibly rare.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.715
GUEST: Really?

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.617 align:start size:97% position:3%
APPRAISER: Now you mentioned
the king of Spain watch.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:09.088 align:start position:0%
And it's upside-down, but it
says, "Maker to the Admiralty,"
and it's signed by the

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.558
maker here, Smith &amp; Son, London.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:15.295 align:start size:97% position:3%
It also says, "His Majesty,
the King of Spain,"
with the royal warrants.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:19.699 align:start position:0%
And one other interesting
feature on these watches is that
it actually spun all the way

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.934
around here.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.369 align:start size:88% position:13%
Your watch is hallmarked
and I dated them.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.538 align:start size:84% position:16%
The case was
manufactured in 1904.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:29.542
I think this case could
be as heavy as three
ounces of 18-karat gold-

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.578
GUEST: Okay.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.480
APPRAISER: -which at present
gold prices today would put the
gold value at over $2,000 and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.481
close to $3,000.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.483
GUEST: Oh, wow, okay.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.487 align:start size:97% position:3%
APPRAISER: The power reserve
indicator adds a little
bit to the value of it.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:46.492 align:start position:0%
So a watch like this with
a power reserve indicator--
nice, heavy, big English watch,

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:52.632 align:start size:94% position:6%
with a normal escapement,
would retail for around
$4,000 to $5,000.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.167
GUEST: Wow.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:58.638
APPRAISER: This watch, in the
present market, would retail

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.873
between $40,000 to $50,000.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.276 align:start size:84% position:16%
GUEST: Oh, my gosh,
you're kidding.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:04.811
APPRAISER: No.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.846
GUEST: Wow, I had no idea.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.148
(laughs) I better
be careful with it.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.351 align:start position:0%
APPRAISER: This tourbillion
escapement is still rare today.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.419
And it's made for very
collectible watches.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.855
Let's take an example of, like,
a Patek Philippe wristwatch.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:20.860
A strapped, Patek Philippe,
18-karat gold, retail price,
let's say is around $20,000.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.529
GUEST: Wow.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.199 align:start size:97% position:3%
APPRAISER: That same watch
with a tourbillion escapement
would retail by Patek Philippe

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.101
between $200,000 and $250,000.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.103
GUEST: Oh, wow.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.606 align:start size:94% position:6%
APPRAISER: So it's
something really wonderful
to have and very special.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.241
GUEST: That's amazing.

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:38.077 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well, I knew it was a
special watch, but I
didn't know how special.
