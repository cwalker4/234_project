00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:05.881
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:06.181
ANGLE.

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:09.418
OH, THINGS ARE COOKING IN

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.620
AMERICA'S SOCIALIST KITCHEN.

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:12.754
THE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY SEASON IS

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:14.890
ALMOST A YEAR AWAY, BE BERNIE

00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:17.659
SANDERS IS ALREADY SLATED TO NAB

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.096
THE COVERTED ENDORSEMENT OF THE

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:24.666
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST OF AMERICA.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:29.905
AND YESTERDAY, OCASIO-CORTEZ RID

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:30.305
AND YESTERDAY, OCASIO-CORTEZ R D

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:34.176
READ HER PARTY THE RIOT ACT.

00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:36.178
SHE TOLD THEM TO EITHER HOP

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.480
ABOARD THE SOCIALIST TRAIN OR

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.449
GET SQUISHED ON THE TRACKS.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.852
&gt;&gt; SHE DID STAND UP AND ARGUED

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:45.520
TO THOSE MODERATES, LOOK YOU

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.056
CAN'T DO THIS, AND THERE WILL

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:50.158
ESSENTIALLY BE SOME SORT OF

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.760
TRACK KEEPING.

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:55.630
&gt;&gt; WHILE OTHERS HAVE LAUGHED AT

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:59.568
AOC AND HER SISTER IN SOCIALISM,

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.237
I THINK THEY'RE THE LEGITIMATE

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:03.638
THOUGHT LEADERS OF THE DEMOCRAT

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.939
PARTY.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.475
PELOSI HAS BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:09.077
31 YEARS AND HAS 2.3 MILLION

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:10.412
TWITTER FOLLOWERS.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:11.980
OCASIO-CORTEZ HAS BEEN IN

00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.817
CONGRESS FOR TWO MONTHS AND HAS

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:18.587
3.3 MILLION FOLLOWERS.

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:21.356
THE NEW SOCIALISTS MAY BE

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.692
INEXPERIENCED, BUT THEY'RE BOLD,

00:01:23.693 --> 00:01:24.593
ENERGETIC AND DETERMINED TO

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.194
SHAKE UP THEIR ESTABLISHMENT.

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:30.198
NOW, I TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD.

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:33.335
THEY WANT A COMPLETE

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:34.536
TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:38.273
SOCIETY THAT WILL REQUIRE

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:39.007
MASSIVE WEALTH CONFISCATION,

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:40.575
GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF CERTAIN

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:43.011
INDUSTRIES AND AN OVERTHROW OF

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:45.580
THE FREE MARKET.

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.550
IT IS BIZARRE THAT THIS IS THE

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:49.684
DEMOCRAT'S ANSWER.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.621
TRUMP IS PRESIDING OVER THE

00:01:52.622 --> 00:01:54.155
STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.358
AND THE TIMING OF THE SOCIALIST

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.293
EMBRACE IS EVEN MORE BIZARRE,

00:01:58.294 --> 00:02:00.495
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE SAME

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:03.265
PHILOSOPHY IS IN DEATH THROES

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:05.934
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.970
EUROPE'S ONCE DOMINANT SOCIALIST

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:12.774
PARTIES ARE ON LIFE SUPPORT.

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:16.211
REMEMBER IN 2017 WE SAW A

00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:21.516
DEVASTATING NEAR WIPEOUT OF THE

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:22.884
SOCIALIST PARTY IN FRANCE.

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:26.454
WE SAW CRUSHING DEFEATS OF THE

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.189
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS IN GERMANY AND

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.959
THE LABOR PARTY IN THE

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.927
NETHERLANDS.

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:35.063
IN ITALY, THEY IMPLODED AND

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:42.137
OPENED THE DOOR TO TWO POPULIST

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:49.411
PARTIES.

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:56.418
IN SWEDEN, THE REFUGEE ISSUE

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.452
DOMINATES POLITICS AND LOST

00:02:57.453 --> 00:03:05.760
SUPPORT LEADING TO A HOD --

00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:06.494
HODGEPODGE THERE.

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:10.665
IN BRAZIL, THE WORKERS PARTY

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:12.067
LOST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:13.768
TO A RIGHT-WING POPULIST.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.004
IN VENEZUELA, WELL, OF COURSE,

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.106
THAT'S A COMPLETE DISASTER ON

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:22.277
THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:24.212
PRESUMABLY, AOC AND SANDERS ARE

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:26.514
AWARE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS.

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:28.283
IS THEIR ARGUMENT GOING TO BE,

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:30.518
DON'T WORRY, TRUST US, BECAUSE

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.153
ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES GOT

00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:35.457
SOCIALISM WRONG, BUT WE'LL GET

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:37.025
SOCIALISM RIGHT?

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:39.327
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A PHENOMENAL

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:41.429
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.397
CONVERSATION HE STARTED ABOUT

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.499
SOCIALISM AT THE STATE OF THE

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.799
UNION.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.105
AND AS LARRY KUDLOW SAID AT CPAC

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:50.639
YESTERDAY...

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.341
&gt;&gt; JOIN US TO PUT SOCIALISM ON

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.544
TRIAL AND THEN CONVICT IT.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.614
&gt;&gt; AND BE THE WAY, LARRY WILL BE

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:00.882
WITH US LATER IN THE HOUR.

00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:03.451
YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:04.019
APPEARANCE.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.720
BE CONSERVATIVES, REPUBLICANS,

00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:08.690
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEY'RE NOT

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.458
GOING TO PANIC ABOUT IT.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.627
THIS IS A MOMENT.

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:14.295
WE SHOULD RELISH THIS MOMENT.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.330
THEY SHOULD SPEND THE TIME TO

00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.266
LISTEN TO AND SPEAK WITH YOUNG

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:19.901
PEOPLE, LATINOS,

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:22.270
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHOM THE LEFT

00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.206
IS TARGETING, BECAUSE UNDER

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:29.278
SOCIALIST POLICIES, THEY'LL BE
