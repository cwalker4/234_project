00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.230
I'm glad you're here so
we can talk face-to-face.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.940
That's really nice.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.910
We can have a real conversation, because
people don't do that enough anymore.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
Everybody walks around with their nose
in their phone and they don't use words,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.435
they just use smiley faces,
and thumbs up, and eggplants.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.300
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But I say, if you can't beat them,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.870
join them, so I came out with my own
emoji app and you can download them.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.188
It has 150 emojis, over 150 actually.

00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:26.270
And unlike Pokemon, you get them all
at once, you don't have to catch them.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.763
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, you're welcome.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:35.334
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; It's not dangerous to have my emojis,

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.535
plus we're adding new ones all the time.

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:41.325
The app is called Ellen's Emoji Exploji.

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:44.935
And some of them are my own
versions of classic emojis.

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.039
Here I am with hearts
on my eyes right there.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.513
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Probably, I saw a baby goat and

00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:50.494
I'm just happy.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:51.040
I don't know.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.468
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You can use that for different things.

00:00:52.468 --> 00:00:55.460
Some of them are puns and
pictograms like this one right here.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.670
Which is, do you know what that means?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.000
Can you figure that out?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.608
Cool cucumber, that's right.

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:05.296
It could be, cool as a cucumber,
it could also be, bad ass pickle.

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:11.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I wanna show you some others and help

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.030
you learn what they mean, so we're gonna
play a game where you have to figure out

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
text messages using my emojis, and it's
time to play Explainy the Emoji Exploji.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.170
Okay, who's who?

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.150
Which one are you?

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.250
&gt;&gt; I'm Chrissy Valesario.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.900
&gt;&gt; Hi, Chrissy, where do you live,
what do you do?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.710
&gt;&gt; I live in San Luis Obispo,
and I'm a cosmetologist and mom.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.731
&gt;&gt; Wonderful, and, a mom to how many kids?

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.585
&gt;&gt; I have two kids,
a six-year-old and a four-year-old.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:34.760
[LAUGH] I know, I'm still not sure.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.810
&gt;&gt; Well, you don't miss them, do you?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.910
Because-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.320
&gt;&gt; You don't even know how old they are.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.170
All right, and you are?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.663
&gt;&gt; I'm Sarah, I live far away.

00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:44.100
I came from Austin, Texas.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.834
I live there, I just moved there.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.380
I'm finishing school so
I can graduate from A&amp;M.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.270
And I'm finishing online but currently, I
work at a software company called, Yardi.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.070
&gt;&gt; Wonderful, all right, and you are?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.070
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Steven.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.456
&gt;&gt; Lindsay, where do you live,
what do you do?

00:01:56.456 --> 00:02:00.707
&gt;&gt; I live in Utah and I'm a stay at home
mom to three little boys that are crazy.

00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:03.399
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So I'm glad to be here.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.110
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.775
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're glad to be anywhere, I think.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, wonderful.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.238
Let's start the game, it's really easy.

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:16.167
All you're gonna do is you're gonna look
at a sentence, and you have buzzers there,

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.731
and the first one to buzz in to know what
that sentence means using the emojis.

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.698
You're gonna let me know and then
you'll win points that I just make up.

00:02:23.698 --> 00:02:26.273
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, here's your first sentence.

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:30.668
[SOUND] You're Chrissy, right?

00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:31.428
&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.

00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:32.446
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:37.319
&gt;&gt; Okay, you are on fire,
like a board [LAUGH] because you

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.318
like to dance and French kiss and
watch Netflix on ice.

00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:43.251
Yes.

00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:52.217
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My God,

00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:55.845
I was so worried this game
was gonna be too easy and I-

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:56.705
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.105
&gt;&gt; You are on fire like a board?

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:00.745
Is that what you're-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.473
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's not how youse compliment

00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:04.304
somebody.

00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:05.470
Yes, Sarah?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.247
&gt;&gt; You're hot, would you like to dance,
French kiss, and Netflix and chill?

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.005
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:15.709
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.756
&gt;&gt; Unbelievable.

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:20.597
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Boy, you're on fire like a board.

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:24.865
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'll do better next time, yeah,

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:25.648

&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; You got it.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:29.221
&gt;&gt; That's a new way to say it.

00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.271
Next time, somebody sends you that,
they mean you're on fire like a board.

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:34.841
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, let's see the next one.

00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.781
Sarah, yeah.

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.942
&gt;&gt; I hear through the grapevine that

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:46.854
watching cute videos on TV is the what?

00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:47.686
&gt;&gt; Nope, nope.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.428
[SOUND] Yes, Lindsay?

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:52.654
&gt;&gt; I heard through the grapevine that
watching cute videos on Ellentube

00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:53.447
is the key.

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:55.670
&gt;&gt; Dang it.
&gt;&gt; Period.

&gt;&gt; I got this.

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:05.233
&gt;&gt; All right, do you?

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:06.163
Let's go.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:10.128
&gt;&gt; I heard through the grapevine that
watching cute videos on Ellen YouTube

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:11.493
is the key to happiness.

00:04:11.493 --> 00:04:13.446
No, on Ellen-
&gt;&gt; EllenTube.

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:14.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.967

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Happiness.

&gt;&gt; All right, so

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:30.235

&gt;&gt; Yes, Chrissy?

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:44.069
&gt;&gt; Seal of approval.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.066
Do I have to say it all together?

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:45.733
&gt;&gt; Yes, say the whole thing.

00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:48.968
&gt;&gt; Okay, wine and tequila get Ellen and
Portia's seal of approval.

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:49.594
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:50.567
Seal of approval.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:53.544
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:53.544 --> 00:05:00.426
It's kind of a tie, but Chrissy, you're
gonna get some wine and tequila right now.

00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:03.456
That is-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:09.565
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:15.024

00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:23.700
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:32.734
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Now

00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:36.679
since this is the third year in a row
that we're partnering with TCL,

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:41.113
America's fastest growing TV brand,
I am gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

00:05:41.113 --> 00:05:42.974
I am gonna put one more
sentence on the screen.

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:45.699
If anyone in the audience
can figure it out,

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.142
you're gonna all go home with a prize.

00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:51.650
But don't yell it out, you'll have
to stand up and I'll call on you.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.913
So if you think you know what it is,
stand up.

00:05:54.913 --> 00:05:57.231
All right, here it is.

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.841
[MUSIC]

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.922
Yes?

00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:06.763
&gt;&gt; Holy horses,
is that an avocado wearing a hat?

00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:07.856
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Did you say-

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:09.706
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:12.026
&gt;&gt; Holy horses?

00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:15.407
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Hold your horses?

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:17.814
&gt;&gt; There's no holes in those horses.

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:19.659
Yes, you'll try?

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.037
&gt;&gt; Hold your horses!

00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:23.249
Is that an avocado wearing a top hat?

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.835
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:33.835
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
