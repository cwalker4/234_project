00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:07.904
Ritu (Questioner): Namaskar Sadhguru.

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.328
My name is Ritu.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:10.800
My question is –

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.456
what according to you, is being successful in spirituality?

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:16.516
Sadhguru: In spirituality or life?

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.986
Ritu: In spirituality.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:20.976
Ritu: And will I know it before I die?

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:30.346
Sadhguru: See, what this entire contrived ideas about what is spirituality –

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.290
what’s happened is,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.581
people think if they are seeking god, they are spiritual.

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.640
What you need to understand is –

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.134
you have already made an assumption

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:46.221
and then you’re trying to concretize your assumption.

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.073
You want a guru to tell you,

00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:51.070
“Yes, god is there, seek him.”

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.045
Seeking means this –

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.266
you don’t know whether god rules this existence

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.138
or devil rules this existence

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.220
or it’s simply un-ruled like India (Laughter).

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.260
You don’t know,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.412
that’s why you want to seek. You…

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:11.160
Seeking means you do not know and you want to know.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.893
If one has to be successful,

00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:15.212
as I said earlier,

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.471
the most important thing is,

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:21.616
your intelligence is not identified with anything,

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:24.653
because the nature of the intellect is this –

00:01:24.653 --> 00:01:27.105
the moment you take on an identity,

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:31.068
your intellect will work hard to protect that identity.

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.285
You just have to tell yourself three times,

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.615
“I’m an Indian,”

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.438
suddenly everything Indian looks nice,

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:39.041
everything across the border doesn’t look nice.

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:41.172
You just have to tell yourself, “I am this”

00:01:41.172 --> 00:01:44.461
and immediately it only protects that and nothing else.

00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:46.221
This is the nature of the intellect.

00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:49.221
In fact, that is the work of the intellect because

00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.353
intellect is a tool of survival,

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:54.127
intellect is not ultimate intelligence.

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:58.418
Unfortunately, because we are too much under European influence

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.551
and somebody there said,

00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:02.646
“I think, so I exist,” (Referring to philosopher Rene Descartes’ statement, “I think, therefore I am”)

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:04.252
we just lost it.

00:02:04.252 --> 00:02:06.497
In India, in the yogic system,

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:12.073
we do not ascribe too much significance to your thought, first of all.

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:17.608
So once we do… Why we do not give significance to thought process is –

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:21.692
it can only happen from the limited data that you have gathered.

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:23.420
What you call as thought,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.416
whatever kind of thought you have,

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:29.669
is just recycling the limited data that you have gathered.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.115
You may think about gods,

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:32.839
you may think about pleasure,

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.222
you may think politics,

00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.002
you may think money –

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.712
it is only the data that you have, you’re recycling.

00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:43.313
You are not… You are not touch… See, you may be thinking whatever,

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:44.613
so I’ve been telling…

00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:46.949
This is a hard thing to do with people,

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.104
constantly telling them, tch,

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:57.126
“If god appears in your meditation, you just have to ignore him.”

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.094
“Ah but Sadhguru, if Shiva comes?”

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:03.374
“Especially if he comes” (Laughter)

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:10.682
because Shiva is coming only because of the calendar images that you have seen.

00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:12.552
If you were born elsewhere,

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:15.106
somebody else would be coming.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:18.106
So this is the old data playing up,

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:19.460
so whatever plays up…

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.146
See, you cannot…

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:23.461
you cannot think god,

00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:25.334
you cannot think money,

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:27.896
you cannot think ocean or the sky.

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.832
You’re only recycling the limited data.

00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:35.171
So we don’t acknowledge thought process as a great form of intelligence.

00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:40.319
It’s a wonderful instrument for handling your survival in the material world.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.619
But if you want to pursue something,

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.240
there are other dimensions of intelligence within you.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.320
To put it very, very simply,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.971
today afternoon, whatever you had for lunch –

00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:52.324
let us say you had a chapatti -

00:03:52.324 --> 00:03:56.419
a chapatti turns into a wonderful woman like you

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.649
because you ate the chapatti.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:02.194
If Suhel ate this chapatti, it will turn into a man.

00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:03.133
If a dog eats this…

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:04.500
Suhel Seth: But I’m a man (Laughter).

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.848
Sadhguru: That is why, I’m saying.

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:06.870
Suhel Seth: Ah, okay, that way.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.114
Sadhguru: You’re not getting it.

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:11.144
What I’m saying is – if a dog eats the chapatti,

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:12.524
it turns into a dog

00:04:12.524 --> 00:04:15.778
So very intelligent chapatti, you think?

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:16.692
No,

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:18.216
this is programmed.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:22.736
In your system, there is a certain volume of memory and intelligence,

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:26.541
which is capable of turning a simple chapatti into a human being.

00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:28.527
When I say ‘a human being,’

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:32.853
I’m talking about the most complex mechanism in the universe

00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:35.373
that we know of.

00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:36.698
There may be others

00:04:36.698 --> 00:04:40.817
but this (Referring to oneself) is the most complex mechanism in the universe that we know of.

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:44.945
What have you manufactured such a complex machine with?

00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:48.772
With chapattis, bananas, dal and this and that –

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:50.323
just about anything you eat,

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.510
gets transformed.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.148
So there is an intelligence within you, which is the very source of creation.

00:04:56.148 --> 00:04:58.605
Instead of finding access to this,

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:01.684
you are too lost in your own thought process.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:03.926
Once you get lost in your thought process,

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:06.854
your identities become super strong.

00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:09.333
When they become super strong,

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:11.654
you have a sense of confidence

00:05:11.654 --> 00:05:14.192
but all your clarity will go away.

00:05:14.192 --> 00:05:15.567
Unfortunately,

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:19.283
the very foundations of the so-called religions of the world,

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:21.324
is about building confidence –

00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:23.084
“Don’t worry, god is with you.”

00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:24.871
You know, there are some bank…

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:26.873
there are some bank advertisements, you know,

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:28.624
“I’m with you” (Laughter).

00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:31.829
You know how a banker is with you (Laughter).

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:38.107
So, this is a confidence building process.

00:05:38.107 --> 00:05:42.309
But confidence without clarity is a disastrous process.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.424
What you need is clarity.

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:48.556
Confidence means you can’t see but you’re confident.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:51.085
This is a dangerous way to go.

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:52.207
This is what…

00:05:52.207 --> 00:05:53.810
This is a continuous disaster.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.995
See, it doesn’t take thousands of years to figure out simple aspects of life.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:02.310
I’m saying… Now Suhel is going at these things –

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.608
anger, hatred, all kinds of prejudice against each other –

00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:08.289
with great vehemence about it.

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.719
What I’m saying is,

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.348
these are simple things in a human being.

00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:14.603
After million years of living here,

00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:16.851
if you can’t figure it out,

00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.795
which way to be out of it,

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:23.146
obviously your intellect is not doing well enough, isn’t it?

00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:25.210
You need other dimensions of intelligence.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.244
People ask me,

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:32.211
“Sadhguru, all other gurus are doing so many miracles. You don’t do anything.”

00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:37.803
I say, “You want me to pull a pigeon out of my pocket (Laughter)?

00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:46.360
If I do that, you will have a bird and I’ll have a shitty pocket” (Laughter).

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.760
Suhel Seth: But no, let’s stay with this.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.726
But you do acknowledge that there are many such people

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:59.139
who are actually defrauding the emotions of a large population,

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.059
by doing this kind of nonsense?

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.460
Sadhguru: See,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:09.655
corruption is not the prerogative of only spiritual people (Laughter).

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:11.571
There are corrupt politicians,

00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:13.088
there are corrupt lawyers,

00:07:13.088 --> 00:07:14.781
there are corrupt policemen,

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:16.221
there are corrupt doctors,

00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:16.910
there are corrupt

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.148
‘every kind of profession,’ okay?

00:07:19.148 --> 00:07:22.080
It has entered every sphere of life.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.126
It is just that

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:28.720
when a person who claims to be a spiritual guide or a guru turns corrupt,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.104
it stands out glaring

00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:34.229
because today, if you go to a police station,

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.872
you’re expecting him to be corrupt,

00:07:36.872 --> 00:07:39.464
unfortunately.

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.555
If he’s not corrupt, you’re surprised.

00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:44.174
That’s when you talk about it,

00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:45.535
“Oh my god, I went to the police station,

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.795
they didn’t… the guy didn’t ask for a buck.

00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:50.659
He did the job for me, you know” (Laughs).

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:52.593
But when you go to a doctor,

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:54.587
if he is corrupt, you are little hurt

00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:57.543
because you placed your physical self in his hands.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.077
But when you go to a guru, you placed your entire life in his hands.

00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:04.980
If he is corrupt, you’re very profoundly hurt, all right.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.879
So, the integrity that is necessary to perform different levels of activity

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:15.211
is definitely more demanding when more trust is invested in that.

00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:17.001
But unfortunately,

00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:21.512
spiritual enterprise has started, okay?

00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:22.929
It’s an enterprise.

00:08:22.929 --> 00:08:27.109
If you read two pages of Gita, you can become a guru in the country.

00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:29.481
You don’t have to read the entire thing.

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:31.751
Two pages and go on repeating the same two pages

00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:34.505
in a language that other people don’t understand,

00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:37.947
you will become a guru (Laughter/Applause).

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:41.457
Sadhguru: So, about being successful with her spiritual process,

00:08:41.457 --> 00:08:42.940
this is all you have to do.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.140
Tonight, when you go home, sit on your bed,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.682
look at yourself –

00:08:47.682 --> 00:08:48.703
what is you,

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:51.496
what you gathered, okay?

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:54.377
You have a home - you gathered it.

00:08:54.377 --> 00:08:57.203
You have people - you gathered them.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.593
You have clothes - you gathered this.

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:01.844
You have a body - you gathered this.

00:09:01.844 --> 00:09:04.150
The content of your mind, you gathered it.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.222
See, before going to bed, close your eyes

00:09:07.222 --> 00:09:10.025
and see if you can keep all that aside,

00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:11.204
even intellectually.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:14.105
Just try to keep it aside and go to bed every day.

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:16.469
You will see, one day you will wake up

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:19.023
in a way you have not believed possible –

00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.750
truly awake (Applause).
