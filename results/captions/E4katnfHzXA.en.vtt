00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.220
Thank you.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.320
I love nutritional science.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.520
I've had a passion about nutrition
since I was young.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.390
I remember

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.440
that my father suffered
with medical problems and pains,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.120
conditions the medical profession
couldn't help him with,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.860
and he searched for answers.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.480
Finally, he changed his diet,
lost 50 pounds and got well.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.789
In the process of seeing him
suffering and searching,

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.049
I found excitement and developed
interest in the subject.

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.330
He'd brought 50 nutritional books
into the home, and I read them all.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.149
Then, in the early 1970s,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.879
I was on the United States
world figure skating team,

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.419
and I got hurt, and I couldn't
walk for over a year.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.129
I spent some time in a natural health,

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.769
in a kind of natural health retreat

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.669
watching people get well
who changed their diet styles,

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.550
and I got excited about what I saw.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.319
I remember at my sister's
graduation party from college,

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.229
I met an attractive young woman

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190
who told me she applied
to go to medical school.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.410
And I debated with her.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.869
I said, "What do you want go
to medical school for?

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.440
Doctors mostly prescribe
medications for conditions

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.510
that are a result of the toxic diet
Americans are eating."

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.495
It's like hitting yourself
with a hammer every day

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:42.520
and giving your hand a big smash;
then it gets swollen and full of pain.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.150
Then you go to a doctor
and get pain medications for it,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.739
and the next day you take
a big hammer and smack it again!

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:51.879
It's the toxic American lifestyle

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.939
that's resulting in all these diseases
driving people into the doctors' offices.

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:02.510
The toxic foods we're eating
are the hammer.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.250
You don't want to go to a doctor

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.730
if you've breathing problems
from smoking cigarettes,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.079
and he gives you a drug
to help you breathe better

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.660
and you still continue to smoke;
that's what Americans are doing.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.900
So this young woman said to me,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110
"If you're so passionate 
about this subject,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.910
why don't you go to medical school?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.250
Why don't you change things?
Why don't you help people?"

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.390
I obviously thought about that and said,
"You know, I've got to do that."

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.280
I quit my job as an executive
in my family's chain of shoe stores.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.290
I went back to the postgraduate
premedical program

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.400
at Columbia after college.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.130
I went to medical school,
and I'm here to tell you

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.460
about the excitement,
the rewarding experience,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.040
and to give you a taste of the things
I've seen and the fun I've had.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.780
I want to show you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.200
six representative cases 
of people who changed their life,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.320
to show you the power
of a "nutriterian diet."

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.490
But before I do, let me give you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.700
maybe a two-minute overview 
of what a nutriterian diet is,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.410
because a nutriterian diet 
is a diet style that's designed

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.840
to be rich in nutrients and full
of antioxidants and phytochemicals.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.810
It's a diet style with a high
nutrient-per-calorie density.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.130
Your healthy life expectancy

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.580
is determined on the foods
you choose to eat.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.890
You have to get sufficient nutrient
bang for each caloric buck.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.850
But you know, when you do so,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.340
when you flood your body
with the nutrients it needs,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.520
it doesn't just make you healthy
and live long or prevent disease,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.490
it stops food addictions
and food cravings,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.310
normalizes your appetite,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.680
and makes your body gravitate
towards your ideal weight, effortlessly.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.450
It's the secret for most of what ails us.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.130
A nutriterian diet, sure,
it's rich in nutrients,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.570
with an adequate amount
of what we need nutrient-wise,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.680
but it is also very different

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.270
from the style Americans
are eating right now.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.869
Americans are eating a diet

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:20.009
that's dramatically
nutritionally deficient.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.650
Americans are eating a diet

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.500
with 55% of calories
from processed and refined foods

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.840
that don't contain vitamins,
minerals and phytochemicals,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230
and 30% of animal products.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.720
A diet with less than 5% of calories
from fruits and vegetables

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.619
and natural, nutrient-rich produce
aside from white potato -

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:46.009
we're only eating about 5%
of vegetation and produce -

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.400
couldn't be better designed
to create a nation full of diseases

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.920
like heart attacks, strokes,
dementia and cancer,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.499
had it be designed by Al-Qaeda.

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.499
(Laughter)

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.250
Besides the fact of what it's lacking,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.090
a "nutritarian" diet is also designed

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.850
to be low in those hormones 
that promote cancer and aging,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.410
hormones like excessive amounts of insulin
and excessive amounts of IGF-1,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.639
that's Insulin-like Growth factor-1,
the primary hormone that promotes cancers

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.730
like breast cancer and prostate cancer.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.420
I say, "The whiter the bread,
the sooner you're dead,"

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.760
(Laughter)

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.709
because the more you eat
sooths like sugar and white flour,

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:35.010
the more it promotes
weight gain and cancer.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.640
And I say, "The more you eat green,
the more you get lean,"

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.400
because if you eat more greens
and beans and less meat,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.539
it lowers IGF-1, which stops
cancer in its tracks

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.135
and doesn't promote
the progression of fat on your body

00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:51.595
and cancer-cell proliferation.

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:57.549
We have a unique opportunity
in human History, today,

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:01.009
with the exponential advances
in nutritional science

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.330
that have given us the power,
the power of G-bombs -

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.000
G-B-O-M-B-S -

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.160
these foods I call our
"Immune System Special Forces" -

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.729
greens, beans, onions,
mushrooms, berries and seeds -

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.119
these foods that inhibit
fat storage on the body,

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.910
foods that prevent cancer,
foods that prolong our lifespan.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.259
The details of that is not my message
or the purpose of this presentation.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.089
These people are.

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:39.979
Let me show you the power
of what a nutritarian diet can do.

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.820
Here's Robert. I never met Robert;
he just read one of my books.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.560
Robert was in a wheelchair.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.349
Today, not only is he not in a wheelchair,
he can work all day on his feet.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.580
Robert had rheumatoid arthritis
and was on four highly toxic drugs

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.910
to reduce his pain
from rheumatoid arthritis.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.630
Today, he has no rheumatoid arthritis.
He's off all his toxic medications.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.920
He no longer has diabetes,
heart disease and high blood pressure.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.100
He's off those medications too.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.300
The main story here is not merely
that he lost 200 pounds,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.960
the story is that Robert
no longer has medical conditions.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.320
He no longer has rheumatoid arthritis
like millions of Americans do.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.710
The point here is you don't have
to be sick and be suffering

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.610
and be tied to medications
for the rest of your life.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.669
Take Heather.

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.809
Heather is another person
who suffered most of her life.

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:48.950
She suffered with terrible, horrible
headaches and migraines most of her life.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.539
She even took pills that cost $100
for each single individual pill,

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.770
and she still had headaches all day long.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.830
She suffered of course with allergies
and insomnia and anxiety

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.270
and was also on multiple medications.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.215
Heather lost 75 pounds.

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:11.445
She wrote me a letter,
an email, and she said,

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:13.270
"You know, I'm all better.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.060
It's the greatest feeling in the world,
never to suffer of headaches anymore.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.270
I don't have insomnia; I don't need pills
for depression and anxiety anymore.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.560
I'm well. I don't have menstrual pain."

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.720
She said, "The wonderful thing
is when you fix the whole body,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.040
everything gets taken care of
simultaneously."

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.159
It makes you think of all the people
that are suffering and have been told

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.628
they have to be on medication for the rest
of their life with no way out.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.160
Then, there's Donna from Kentucky.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.250
Stories like this,
I hear a hundred times a month.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.650
She was in so much pain, she couldn't
get out of bed or off the couch.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.770
When she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia,
her rheumatologist told her

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.080
that she'd have to take these medications
for pain for the rest of her life.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.699
Of course, Donna Depp got well.
She lost 62 pounds in the process.

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:16.690
She is feeling well,
and she made the effort

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.130
to take the drive from Kentucky
up to New Jersey

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.870
where I was having one
of my weekend immersion programs,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.640
she came up specifically to meet me
and to talk to me and thank me.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.140
It is so rewarding, wonderful and warm

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.940
to meet these people
who have recovered their health.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.830
She said to me, "I was a food addict.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.860
You know, for 20 years
I tried one diet after another,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.950
and I knew I was in a downward spiral
I couldn't get out of."

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.309
Her life was unhappy and she felt
completely hopeless with it.

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:55.199
She said she felt like
she was a failure, and I said,

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:57.819
"Donna, you're not a failure.

00:09:57.819 --> 00:10:01.230
It's the information you were given
that has failed you.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.809
With the right information,
you have the ability to be set free,

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:08.239
to take control of your life,
to get rid of your food addictions."

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:11.329
It's wonderful to meet these people.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:14.610
You see their happiness
and their gratitude.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.570
Sometimes, you can almost feel
like your tears come to the eyes

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.920
when you hear some of these stories.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.350
Here is Ronnie from Texas,
a perfect example.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.490
Ronnie had a heart disease

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.520
and had a bypass surgery
about six years ago.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.230
Within four years
after his bypass surgery,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.380
his vessels clogged up again
and got fully occluded with plaque.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.040
Then he proceeded to have angioplasty.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.610
Within a few months after angioplasty,
he could develop restenosis

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.640
and now he all couldn't walk,
had tremendous chest pain,

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:58.239
was on multiple medications;
he was literally sent home to die.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:00.650
I'd never met Ronnie either.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.370
He read my books and he communicated
with me through the website.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.200
Ronnie lost 140 pounds in one year,
which isn't the story.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.090
The story is that
his chest pains went away,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.570
he's now fit, healthy,
has no heart disease.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.030
He doesn't have high cholesterol
but great cholesterol and no drugs.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.420
He has normal blood pressure.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.710
He's not on three medications
like he used to be,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.210
but on no blood pressure medications.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.420
His weight is normal. He is feeling well.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.650
He achieved these numbers
to protect himself

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.520
without the use of medications,
that's how we know now he's protected.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.220
He truly reversed his condition
and knows he's protected for his future.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.450
The message here
is that scientific studies show

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.550
that angioplasty and bypass surgery
don't enable people to live longer.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.390
Those who go through those procedures
don't live longer than those who don't,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.630
with the same degree of disease.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:04.190
They don't prevent future heart attacks,
they're just a temporary band-aid

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.180
to make people feel better
for a temporary period of time.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.000
Why aren't people told this?
Why don't people know?

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.870
Why doesn't everyone know
they don't have to have heart attacks,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.680
they don't have to have strokes,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.200
that these diseases
are reversible relatively easily?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.550
Ronnie was set free.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.970
Jodie from nearby here,
right in North Carolina.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.220
Jodie suffered with psoriasis
for many years.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.850
Actually, she suffered
from psoriatic arthritis,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.550
which is like a mixture of psoriasis
and rheumatoid arthritis

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.190
that could involve itchy rash
over your whole body plus joint pains.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.660
By the time Jodie was 50 years old,
she had the rash over her whole body,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.110
including an itchy rash
inside her ears, from head to toe.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.270
She was on multiple medications, including
Prednisone, Plaquenil, Methotrexate,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.470
to try to suppress
the autoimmune conditions.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:11.110
Autoimmune diseases like this
affect 24 million Americans.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.820
The most prevalent one is psoriasis,

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.080
which affects more
than 7.5 million Americans.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.580
Jodie has been well for the last 12 years.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.720
She doesn't have psoriatic arthritis
nor psoriasis anymore, her skin is clear.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.510
By the time she first got diagnosed
with psoriasis when she was a teenager,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.479
soon after, she got diagnosed
with lupus, Sjogren's syndrome,

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:40.429
and eventually, the joint pain
of psoriatic arthritis.

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:44.129
After being in pain
for more than 25 years,

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:46.919
being on medications
that hardly gave her any relief,

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:50.499
she found out how she could
finally get well, and she did.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.559
I remember we have these health getaways

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:54.899
where I take a lot of people
on these vacations.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.329
We eat healthy and teach
them about nutrition.

00:13:57.329 --> 00:14:00.759
Jodie came with us to Utah
to climb the Red Mountains.

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:04.929
We took a bunch of people,
and we walked up this huge mountain.

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:07.179
We got to the top,
and it was like a thrill

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.459
to see the beautiful countryside
at the top of this mountain.

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:14.369
Jodi got to the highest point of that peak
and put her arms up in the air

00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:19.149
like a "V" for Victory, and she said,
"Look at me, I'm a medical miracle!"

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.989
I said to Jodie, "You know Jodie,
I'm so proud of you,

00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:28.369
but it's not a medical miracle.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:32.959
It's the inherent
self-repairing, miraculous,

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:36.919
protective self-healing machine
the human body is already

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:39.219
when it is fed optimally.

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:43.299
Your body takes care of itself,
just like when you cut yourself.

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:47.269
It's the health that you
always had the right to

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:49.609
that was taken away from you."

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:56.199
And number six, the last person
we will talk about, is John Polikowski.

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:59.089
And I bring him up, John from New Jersey,

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:01.339
because my office
is in New Jersey, and again,

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:05.029
I saw him as a patient more than
20 years ago when he was 72 years old.

00:15:05.229 --> 00:15:07.709
He too had triple vessel
disease in his heart

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:11.039
and chest pain where he couldn't walk
without significant pain.

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:13.189
He actually had worked
with a cardiologist,

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:15.839
and the cardiologist set him up
for a stress test,

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.639
a cardiac catheterization,

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:21.049
and he was scheduled for angioplasty
and stent placement.

00:15:21.359 --> 00:15:23.389
I pleaded with him and I convinced him.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:26.859
I said, "John, give me
12 weeks of your life

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.459
to show you that you can get back
in good health again,

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:32.839
because once you put those stents in,
you're never going to be the same.

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:34.889
It's going to be a source of inflammation,

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:39.159
it's going to promote more stenosis
and more plaque in your heart.

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:43.540
Let's get rid of it, here's our chance!
Give me 12 weeks."

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.090
In 12 weeks time,
his chest pains were gone;

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.400
he lost 40 pounds;

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.780
he didn't have high blood pressure
and his three medications had dropped too.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.450
He went back to see his cardiologist.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.560
The cardiologist says to him,
"Oh my goodness, John,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.950
I've never seen anybody reverse
heart disease nutritionally,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.450
and have it melt away like this,
this is amazing!"

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.990
Can you imagine a cardiologist,

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.750
who does nothing except
see patients with heart conditions,

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.470
never once ever saw a patient reverse
their heart disease with nutrition?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.130
When that's all I see: every patient
gets better relatively quickly.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.240
You know ... What's the story
here with John?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.480
The story is, now, 20 years later,
John is 92 years old.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.930
Over the years, he's gotten
healthier and healthier.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.760
He doesn't have any heart disease now.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.910
He chops wood. He climbs up
and fixes his roof.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.040
He enjoys his life.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.260
He doesn't take medications in his 90's
that he needed in his 60's and 70's.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.570
You follow that? He has normal blood
pressure now, normal cholesterol.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.790
He's earned these things. 
He hasn't been well for 90 years.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:02.120
My point is that water runs off
the waterfall and hits a rock.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.889
Then after 20,000 years,
the rock breaks in two.

00:17:04.889 --> 00:17:07.120
But the rock didn't age.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.500
It got hit by water
day after day for 20,000 years.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.449
When you develop the problems
that most Americans get,

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.959
you get those problems
because day after day,

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.899
you've put stresses on your tissues 

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:22.530
from eating the wrong foods
that we shouldn't be eating,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.150
from living a diet style
and a lifestyle of stresses

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.730
that impact you negatively
day after day, year after year.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.560
This is not the natural
consequence of ageing.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.700
Heart attacks, strokes and dementia
doesn't have to happen.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.510
We don't have to have heart disease.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.030
All of us could be free of that
if we so choose.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.830
As a matter of fact,
most cardiologists can then become

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.030
lawyers, electricians and plumbers!

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.110
(Laughter)

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.180
Nevertheless, here's the point.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.840
My message to you today is that, sure,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.810
nutritional science has made
exponential advances in recent years -

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.380
I love nutritional science -

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.510
but the point is it's not just preventive.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.900
Sure, we don't have
to have heart attacks,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.480
we don't have to have strokes
or get demented.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.590
And yes, we can win the war on cancer:
we have the information right now

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:25.850
in the studies that show
the body is protective against cancer.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.960
We can make these choices
and have better health

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.200
than ever before possible
in human History.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.680
And my point for today

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.540
is that nutritional excellence,
a "nutriterian" diet,

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.910
is therapeutically more effective
than medications

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.670
for almost every medical condition,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.550
and the results can literally
touch your heart.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.005
And that's my message for today.

00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:57.100
And you know? 

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.980
That woman, that pretty young woman

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.600
who spurred me on to go
to medical school, back 35 years ago?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.510
Well, I married her.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.270
(Laughter)

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.290
Now, I am married for 32 years.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.140
I've four wonderful children.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:23.700
And I am on a mission to share
the power of nutritional excellence.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:30.930
So I'm wishing you all you reach
your dreams and pursue your passions,

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.180
and have much happiness
and great health always

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.670
because it can be yours.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.500
Thank you.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.530
(Applause)
