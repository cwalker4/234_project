00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.887
hey everyone welcome back to emerging
alternatives

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:07.920
this is the second video and as promised
it is the van build video

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.100
alright first let's roll the intro and then straight onto the video

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.520
enjoy guys!

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.480
and this is my new Renault Master, 
it's from 2007, it has 200,000 kilometers

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.460
and it's bright red. Let's see what we
can do with it.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.840
and first order of the day

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.000
we'll start with the windows

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.700
so there we go, first window in.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.000
Next
we're gonna go on the other side and do 
 the second window

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.920
all right and that's done

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.880
also don't forget to give you a little
swipe on the inside

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.080
because there are some particles from the cuts and those rust
very quickly

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.660
alright so now that the windows are in place

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.160
I'll start on the
inside. I'm going to take that out

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.400
Well, that's much brighter now!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.960
Alright the floor is in.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.220
We have, at the
very bottom the strips of a foam (Polystyrene)

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.380
and then two centimeters of insulation - foam insulation.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.414
then we have, the...

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.020
let's call  it bubble wrap

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.126
And then we have the one
centimeter plywood

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:21.940
And that will be the floor of the van.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.960
And we're back now, the
floor is finished and we're getting onto the electrical.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.560
The solar panels are
going to end up about here.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.080
The cables will arrive from the roof and I'll get them
directly to the floor, where I'll put my battery

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.820
And we're on the roof of the van.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.040
we're putting the air extraction in

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.700
which will be... right about here. This is just above what will be the kitchen area

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.340
I always double, triple measure
everything. And that's the 95 mil

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.220
Alright that's good

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.720
The problem is that I can't actually turn

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.580
so this is going to have to be plan B

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.020
Plan B is from the inside, but....

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.100
all right so it doesn't work much better from the inside

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.020
oops that was my only blade.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.240
alright and
we're on to plan and "C";  my blade broke

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.960
so I'm gonna do it by hand

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.980
this is the inside of the ventilation - the extraction

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.600
yeah it's perfect.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.480
That was pretty tough, I'm tired!

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.880
and we're back on the roof and we are
passing the cables through the roof

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.780
for the solar panels, using those those
little metal thingies.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.120
we're all done. The cables are through
now just a little bit of cleanup and we're good.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.980
Shall we insulate the van today?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.280
getting onto the walls so this is the wool that I have

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.720
This is mineral and
I think the other one that I have is is glass wool

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.940
all right, so I finished most of the sides
here. as you can see with mineral wool

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.140
and I will be covering that later on
with our multi-layer; reflecting multi-layer

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.540
which will start at
the bottom and go in one piece all around.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.780
As you can see the
multi layer is on at the back of the van

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.060
I have put the side panels that came
with the van when I bought it.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:35.340
It's a process. It takes some time, but i'm happy to do it and it's it's taking shape 
 slowly so yeah it's quite good.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.090
then
we're moving on to the side windows and

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:47.780
before putting the insulation in I will
put a frame, a wooden frame to go around the window

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.860
not to reinforce it but to
create a nice finish for the inside

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.300
and let's test this. see how it fits...

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.740
That's pretty good

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.280
That's a perfect cut.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.820
pretty happy right now
that's pretty cool. it took me a while to do all this

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.260
Now I can take it apart and
and put the insulation in.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:31.420
I've glued the wooden frame to the side of the van. and
it's now drying and I'll be able to put

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:38.660
the insulation in, all around and then
put the multi layer and then I'll put the side panel

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.740
and finally we're all
done with the insulation on that side and the ceiling

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:50.340
now let's move on to the
ceiling. this is my line to to get the the center right

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:48.380
and we're getting close to finishing on
the  ceiling and as you can see

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.820
those little cables coming outside are
going to be for the lights.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.160
They're the LEDs from Ikea that i'll try to hook up.
and they're pretty flat.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.680
And you just screw them onto the ceiling.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.000
What are
we on to today?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.060
basically the installation is almost finished except
on doors

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.110
I decided to add some pallet wood

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.675
because it's much easier to do the
finish

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.580
and i just screwed on the pallets wood onto the wall.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.660
and cut out the opening for the window

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.280
and i will do the same on this side as well. it doesn't need to go that low

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.860
it just needs to go till the height of the
bed

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:41.760
and we also have the wires coming out of the wood

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:47.480
so I can get a switch
here for the lights and otherwise that's it a nice finish

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.780
hey guys I'm in the
process of building the bed frame

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.970
What I'm trying to do is figure out one spot
on that side and find out the exact same

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:03.270
spot on the other side to make sure the
bed is in the middle

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:09.300
the car isn't leveled on the ground the
ground isn't leveled and the van isn't square at all

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.980
so it's like building
something in a boat you know it's it's pretty tricky

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.520
this is the bar that
will be the main structural part for the bed

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:28.400
it comes from my student
bed and this was the bar that was in the middle

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.790
and it's adjustable so I just
put it to the right size

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:40.800
so there's some wood all around so I can screw in
directly the boards that will come on top directly in there

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.120
and on the inside
at the back I have two pieces of wood

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.060
and one piece of metal on the inside
that prevents it from bending

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.120
so that's solid as well

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:14.760
this is the top part of the bed, the top
half and there's going to be a board

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.800
sliding on top here and making it a
full-sized bed

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.860
and when it's like this this will be a couch

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.820
so we'll see how it goes I had it like

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.780
mostly I have a something in my mind
about what I wanted the van to look like

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:37.820
but I kind of make it up as I go
I face some problems and I basically

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:43.870
try to find solutions to whatever I have
to make and sometimes there's an easy way

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:49.390
and sometimes it's a hard way and
and most often I go for the easy way

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:54.720
because, you know, I'm not
a carpenter and I try to make things as

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.520
solid as I can in the easiest way that
I can as well.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.600
this isn't some Japanese way of attaching would I put a screws everywhere

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.540
so there is screw there is glue there is everything I can find; so yeah  it's not perfect

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.880
it's not always beautiful but it is what
it is and it's holding so that's that's the main part

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.880
when you're building a van,
just don't be surprised everything

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.360
like each piece of wood has to be made
individually

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:38.280
you use your eye more than you use your logic and meter so you just
if it looks good then then it is good

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:20.420
the structure for the kitchen cabinets
is done. And we ill have a drawer on each side.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.900
A big drawer here and here we'll have some
doors

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.740
I hope everything works

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:32.640
it should be alright I've added this little bit in
the middle just so everything stays into place

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.800
when they're sliding in and out. and those as well

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.580
I move down to the kitchen cabinets
which I've made.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.840
I haven't really filmed that because it's quite
straightforward you know it's a couple

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.360
of boards together. I'm gonna show you
but... there's no handles yet

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.000
so i have to grab on the sides to pull them
out.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.980
So yeah, they're uh they're made out of

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:06.420
of what is it like like IKEA kind of
material like, you know like wood and glue

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.980
I don't know the name in English.
This one which is like massive come on

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:21.340
there you go it's nice it's bulky it's
heavy it's gonna be here for the next thousand years

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.820
Nice sound as well.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.460
I've made some boxes to
go underneath the seating area. those are

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.340
the boxes that will support the weight
of the bed

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.860
when you're making boxes and

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.250
they're exactly the right size they only
go one way they get in and they never

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.810
get out yeah
I always forget to get those one or two

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:50.750
mils so they're actually they can
actually slide and I did the mistake on

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.600
the first box and I had to take
everything apart and I almost didn't do

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:04.720
it on the second one everywhere there's
like two mil except on the width and

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:14.340
yeah still doesn't fit so I need to take
it apart again and and get those two mils out

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.390
and today the van is in a bit
of a mess as you can see full of

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:28.700
little off cuts of wood and the thing is
I'm trying to fit a box here so I can

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:35.460
finally put some insulation into this
so-called oven that is just above the

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:41.340
driving seat. When the Sun reflects
here is just horrible this is just

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.270
horrible the whole van just becomes a sauna. So the goal is to put as much insulation

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.560
and some reflecting insulation to be
able to reflect some of that heat

00:16:51.560 --> 00:17:04.520
outside and make a box so I can put some
stuff in there and yep that's it

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.180
What i've  done here
I'm not finished everywhere I still have to

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.980
work it out on this side but it was a
bit of a mess here

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.310
and I took a piece of wood that I put
underneath and stuck some of this

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:27.790
blanket from Ikea into it so this is
jammed underneath using one of these and

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:35.740
and on the other side it's um it's
jammed underneath the piece of wood so

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:42.640
the piece of wood comes here and holds it
on the ceiling which makes it pretty nice finish

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.140
So I'm going to try to do
a lot of the van like that, the non accessible

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.670
parts like where I can't really put any 
pieces of wood. so I try to do it like maybe

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.940
with double sided tape for now it has
worked pretty well.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.220
I will start painting

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.820
I'll start with the walls so everything
will be white for now and I will put

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.730
some lasure so it's not too too thick and
we can still see the wood through it

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:20.180
then I move on to some white paint and
I'll do the frame the frames here the

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.900
frames here and the side of the boxes
as well

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:43.060
so i'm on to the bed now I have screwed
those boards to this parts over here the

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:49.740
goal is to put that metal bar and nail
it so it stays on perfectly and holds

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:57.040
the boards together and it's going to be
easier for the boards to slide it in and out

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.980
So the Box become the support

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.600
and slides all the way until the the
angles get into one another and

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:24.640
everything becomes flat and does it
slides back in that is the question. Shall we try?

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.440
And pushing. And it should lift - perfect

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.020
And now. I need handles

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.480
it's was kind of hard getting a gripp on the
bed when I pulled it out to test it so

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.519
what I'm going to do is put some handles
and for that i'll be drilling some holes

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:52.269
and I'll be using some good old rope so
I have two nice handles that I can use

00:19:52.269 --> 00:19:56.620
to pull the bed and hopefully it works

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.480
How cool i that?

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.200
Yep adopted

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.220
There we go, the doors are fully insulated

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.000
this is wool, this is foam board, this is wool

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.120
Everything is jammed on the side as well as far as can

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.980
so yeah, good enough

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.900
an now i can put some wood on it

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.940
and plug the drill

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.160
alright and now i'll drill the other side

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.920
so i might want to check from time to time that I'm

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.160
not going through the doors. which is what i'm going to do now

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.000
and we're good. And the doors are done

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.940
looking good

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:16.080
and I'm doing a bit of the finishing so
it looks good on the back of the van

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.010
putting some carpet on and it's pretty
easy so I'm not gonna show it in details

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:27.010
but I'm using double-sided tape and cut
the piece to size and just tape it and

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.540
just jam everything that I can in
between the wood and the metal and

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.440
that's about it alright

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.960
so I went in
bougth some colors for the doors and

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.510
basically all the openings so the doors
here

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:47.050
the window frame over there and the door
over here will be blue I'll give it a go

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:53.380
see how it looks it's the first first
layer anyway if it looks good I'll leave it like that

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.820
if it doesn't I can always
paint another color over it but yeah

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.640
it's taking shape a little bit
the van is starting to look pretty good

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.540
I'm happy about it

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.610
I've always been
pretty bad putting paint only on the top

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:12.240
of the brush and I always end up putting
paints everywhere up to my hand which

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.530
isn't the best so i'll try to stay clean here
alright let's go

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:26.600
oh that is very blue
all right I've done like two boards with

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.640
blue and it's very very blue it would
probably be a good idea to put a bit of

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.640
white in there. I'm gonna try to do a
bit of a color mix. see if I can get

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.160
those blues a little lighter so I put
a little bit of white in an old paint box and

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.920
I'll add some blue. see how it looks like

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.100
what do you think?

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.180
I think I'm gonna put a little bit of
white in it not not like this this is

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:08.890
too too light this might be a little too
light as well but that's that's too dark

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:16.640
that's too dark for me all right let's
mix some white this is my blue, this is my white

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.460
you ready?

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.300
feeling like Tom Cruise in
cocktail

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.580
let's check it out

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.220
Well, it is still
blue that's for sure

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:54.540
it is a little better I think I can work with that
let's paint

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:31.830
and we're done with the doors everything
has been sanded down so the color isn't

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.710
too bright anymore which is good and it
looks a little more rustic nice it's the

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:44.280
same on the other side also I've put
those in so I need to paint those white

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:51.000
as well. there we go
I need one of these here as well and oh

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.780
here I have added some bars with a little
bit of an angle here so you can see the

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:04.280
cut and so I can have a nice grab and I
can now slide those in and out easily

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:12.840
same this needs to be painted white
those holes are for my electrical stuff

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.530
so that's gonna be like the charge
controller USB charging 12 volt charging

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:25.190
and this will go right here so there
will be a lock here lock here that will

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:31.500
prevent the bed from moving anywhere
while I'm driving it shouldn't anyway but

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.340
if I break really hard it might just fly
out

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.180
I just need to drill a hole now

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.000
let's do it

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200
so I just put those in drilled some

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.680
holes put a little bit of pain so it
doesn't show too much and so I'm not

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.390
gonna close it right now because
obviously the paint it's wet but yeah it

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.160
does fit and so all good next

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.520
obviously it would have been easier to do it before I

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.980
put the ceiling on but I thought I was
going to put some linen oil and just be

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.360
done with it and when I put the linen
oil the ceiling turned yellow so I

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.100
decided to paint it so here we go

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.940
It's going to be brown blue and white

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.660
and moving on to the door

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:40.830
the side door which i've been
neglecting for the past few weeks and

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.740
I wanted to do something else than just
insulating so I've been doing some painting

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.660
yesterday I've done the frame
yesterday afternoon

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.740
which actually takes a fair bit of time
and I painted it before I put it in which

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.780
is a lot easier and yesterday I've done
as well some insulating here I put in

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:05.400
some wool fitting in some wool and slide
these closing those

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:11.680
insulation, insulation and then cladding everywhere
until the bottom and then we'll paint it

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:18.020
white yep that's it let's do it

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.800
and we're three boards in I put this

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.380
one first because I want it to be
aligned with the window and so far so

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.130
good it works well

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:38.650
see there's a I mean there's a fair bit
of space here the tight space is here

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:44.350
but I will have enough as well so I
should be fine

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:52.540
putting some lasure on the side door

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.680
It pretty much takes the yellow out of the wood

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:04.880
and I'll be sending this and changing
the color to gray instead of brown

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.030
because I'm gonna do those gray and you
can't really have like ten colors in the

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.900
same like tiny space

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.187
What do you like better ? brown or gray ?

00:28:17.187 --> 00:28:19.740
yeah I like gray better

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.080
not the same light but it
worked i shave my beard as well

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.080
Today i moved on to the floor so that's how it looks right now it's actually not too

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.610
bad but I will put this floor in. star over here

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.440
strip the paper press it in

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:19.160
i'm happy this morning it's freezing cold
but work gets done

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.360
and now I can finally

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:28.090
put the LEDs on you know those IKEA
thingy that I installed the cables for

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.880
and now I just have to plug them screw
them and connect them to the battery and

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.360
it should work

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.670
ok I think I got it and the van is
almost done and most of the things are

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:54.740
in as you can see the lights everything
is painted those are in as well I just

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.180
need to put the LEDs that I haven't
received yet I've decided to reinforce

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:05.640
the bed so when the bed is open it's it
was a little soft I didn't want it to break

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.360
Bonsoir

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.600
I'm also working on reinforcing
the inside just to make sure everything

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:20.600
is nice and strong so I'm adding this
vertical here and over here as well I

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.190
have space for the bicycle and then the
space for my storage which is good and

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.660
this is my battery mess I'm still
working out the cables finally receive

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:35.960
my LEDs and they will go right here
and on the other side so I've gotten

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:41.520
some monochrome LEDs 60 LED/m

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:56.920
I've just cut the LEDs to size and I'm
going to glue them on to the wood

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.360
over here and around

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:20.920
awesome and I can dim little eyes as
well 50% 25% or 100% I can make them

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.760
blink and all but you know I'm never
gonna use that what I have here for the

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.710
back cause I want to put some lights in
here so when it's dark I can access my

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.720
stuff a little bit of tape

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.560
you have the
connection to the battery cable and we

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.980
have the connection to the switch and
the connection to the LED now we just

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.280
have to set it up

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.840
okay so I've finished hooking up the
LEDs in the back of the car they are

00:31:59.869 --> 00:32:07.309
hooked up as well to the main line and
they're connected together with the LEDs

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.880
on the ceiling that's a switch and the
LEDs here we can just turn it on

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:21.600
and then I can adjust
I think the brightness that's the one

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:30.360
until it turns off or not now I need to put
all those cables nice and tight because

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.720
like everything here is a bit of a mess
so I'll be hooking them up with those little things

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:49.470
this on the floor is going to be the
deck on top of the van on the roof and this is old

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:55.260
pallet wood and that's what I've used on
the inside so I will burn it as the

00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.420
Japanese do and it's called shou Sugi Ban it's basically like burnt lightly

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:06.510
burn the wood on top and surface and it
just prevents it from molding or getting

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.110
damaged with the weather so that's what
I will try to do and then I'll put it on

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.320
the roof of the van all right let's do
it

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:43.400
the boards are ready I've waited about
a week, two weeks actually a little more

00:33:43.409 --> 00:33:46.889
so it's rained on it
to make sure everything is clean and

00:33:46.889 --> 00:33:53.669
doesn't get any black anywhere and I'm
pretty happy with the finish and now is

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.160
the time to put them on and they'll go
on there

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.800
so that's going to be the time for the
first solar panel

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.440
I've connected both of the solar panels together

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.310
and connect those to
their cables running down to my van

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:49.040
so the plan is here these i'll put a bolt a
spacer and put it through

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:57.840
put a bit of old tubes to prevent
anything from moving with the vibrations

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:16.040
the roof is done look at that nice deck

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.240
so the van is about ten years old and
the plastics are becoming gray

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.480
so what  I'm doing is I'm using some product for
bringing the plastic bag as they were

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:36.180
afterwards I'll be able to put some
polish on the car and make the red come

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.760
back as well as you can see the
difference here and here

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.640
I've been going at it for a couple of hours now

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.640
and i'm polishing the car. it's shiny

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.720
nice and shiny now. and see the red is coming back nicely

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.580
if you compare like this is done and this this isn't

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.619
done so you can see the difference over
here over here over here oh yeah

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:15.200
done not done done not done done

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.600
i mean it's the final touch so i'm quite happy cause you know it all means that I'm getting towards the end

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:28.280
my job is nearly done for the van so
quite happy where I finished putting the

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:35.640
polish on and the car is kinda shiny hey nice and red

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.680
