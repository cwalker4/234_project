00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.490
Three of the most influential
human beings in the history of the world

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.170
all agreed on one thing...

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.050
This is the most powerful,
natural healing solution ever.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.395
One that's been used by all cultures
all over the world

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:18.005
and one that's virtually
forgotten today.

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:19.996
What am I talking about?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.057
Fasting.

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:31.250
What is fasting? I can feel your eyes
rolling in your head right now.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.253
I get this reaction all the time.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.051
You're going to starve people?
That's your solution?

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:37.804
No, that's not my solution.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.850
Fasting is not the same as starvation.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.850
Fasting is the controlled voluntary
abstinence of food for different reasons.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.330
You can do it for spiritual reasons,
you can do it for health reasons,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.890
you can do it as a political protest...
any reason.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.930
It is still called fasting.
It's not the same as starvation.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.610
In fact if you look back
through all of recorded human history

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.490
people have always fasted.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.850
We can start with Hippocrates who is
considered the father of modern medicine.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.269
He famously said,
"Our food should be our medicine,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.490
our medicine should be our food."

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170
But to eat when you are sick
is to feed your sickness.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.890
What is he talking about is this idea
that we have a fasting instinct,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.981
that this is something
that we instinctually do.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.010
Think about when you get sick.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.650
When you have a cold,
when you have a flu, whatever.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.410
The last thing you're thinking about
is eating at a big buffet.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.193
It's something that naturally comes to us,
our bodies are designed to fast.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:43.130
They're designed to store food
in times of availability

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.752
and during times of scarcity
to release it.

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:48.370
And that's just what comes
naturally to us

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.010
and it's not just us,
but all animals have the same ability.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.810
So is not something unnatural,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.650
is not something that we're
just trying to force on our bodies.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.450
This is something natural and good.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.410
Other people that liked fasting
include Benjamin Franklin,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.690
who was world-renowned as one
of the smartest men who had ever lived.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.850
What he said was very wise indeed.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.810
He said the best of all medicines
are resting and fasting.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.370
Now that's very profound!
Think about that for a second.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690
Resting, which is freedom from stress,
relaxation

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.330
and fasting which is designed
to cleanse the system,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.450
which is what used to be called
the cleanser or purification.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.050
Well, those are the two best medicines.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.465
Not drugs, not surgery.
Resting and fasting.

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:35.139
Amazing!

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:41.166
Mahatma Gandhi also said a genuine fast
cleanses the body, mind and soul.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.328
Jesus Christ said Satan and his plagues
may be cast out only by fasting and prayers.

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:48.730
So if you look at the Christian faith

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.708
you can see that there are many,
many prescribed periods of fasting

00:02:51.717 --> 00:02:53.530
all throughout the year.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.610
Yes, there are going to be times
when you are going to be feasting

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.330
or when you're going to be celebrating,
and that's balance.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.730
But these periods when you're fasting
to cleanse the body, to cleanse the soul.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.010
Buddhist monks also do the same sort of thing,
but they do that on a daily basis.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.090
Very typically they'll fast from noon
until sunrise the next day.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.250
So every day there's
a very prolonged period  of fasting.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.610
In addition to that they also have
periods through the year

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.290
when they'll only have water-only fast

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.810
and that will help them
cleanse themselves for the year.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.490
The Muslim faith has also very profound
believers in fasting.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.530
The prophet Mohammed said
fasting brings us to the door of his palace.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.610
Many people have heard
of the holy month of Ramadan.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.410
During that period Muslims would fast
from sunup until sundown

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.170
every day for an entire month.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.330
All of these religions did not prescribe
fasting to their believers

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.450
because they wanted to harm them.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.290
In fact that's something
that's deeply intrinsically beneficial

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.413
and we know this from the science
that there's so many benefits.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.410
Benefits for weight loss,
benefits for insuline sensitivity,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.370
and type II diabetes, for heart disease,
for cancer, for liver disease,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.810
and also just to feel better,
for mental clarity.

00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:10.930
There's so many amazing benefits.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.130
Everybody's always
worried about fasting.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.530
They're always worried,
"Well can I really do it?"

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.890
Well, think about this for a second.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.880
Consider all these religions,

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:24.579
Christians, Muslims, Buddhist, Mormons,
all of these people...

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:29.570
All of these people are fasting
on regular basis

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.090
every year for their entire adult lives.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.810
So can you do it?

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.810
Well, millions and millions
and millions of people do it.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.970
There's no reason why you can't do it.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.088
So there's lots of people
who will tell you not to fast.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:48.730
Who? Well, this guy, Ronald McDonald,
he doesn't want you to fast.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.207
And this happy little mermaid,
she doesn't want you to fast.

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.730
They're not going to make
any money. Right?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.210
They need you to eat.
There's profits, shareholders, right?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.716
In the end you really got ask yourself

00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:06.554
when it comes to your health,
to your well-being,

00:05:06.564 --> 00:05:08.719
who are you going to trust?

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.339
Jesus Christ or Col. Sanders?
