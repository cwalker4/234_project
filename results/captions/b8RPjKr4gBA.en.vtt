00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:04.187
- [Interviewer] Cheryl and
Sam, we're here in Los Angeles.

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.813
You've been living
outside for far too long,

00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:08.230
tell me about it.

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.465
- Well, you start first.

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:12.991
- No, go ahead.

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.577
- No, I just feel like they're not right

00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:18.908
with the homeless because
they don't give us opportunity

00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:20.750
for bathrooms, and the don't
give us the opportunity

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.000
for certain things that we really need,

00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:26.696
like necessities and all that stuff.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.946
So I feel like it's wrong in some ways.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.341
- [Interviewer] How long
have you been out here?

00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:37.125
- I've been out here for almost a year.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.280
- [Interviewer] And you Sam?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.397
- I've been out here two
years, and I turned homeless

00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:43.902
because I went through a bad divorce.

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:46.985
And since I can't pay for my housing,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.370
so I stay at Path, but I
stay with her out here.

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:58.910
I should be getting my
apartment though by August.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.270
As far as for her, she
hasn't got the assistance

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.354
that she needs.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:05.279
- And I feel like we should have showers,

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.034
opportunity for showers and stuff.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.731
- [Interviewer] So why
are you getting help, Sam,

00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.037
and Cheryl isn't?

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:13.265
- Well that is a question
that I can't really answer,

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:17.446
but I feel that she has been
kind of discriminated in a way

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.545
because they won't accept her some places.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.010
Even though she been, I don't
want to talk about it that...

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.427
She's a victim of some crime.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.783
- I'm a rape victim.

00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:29.484
- [Interviewer] She was
telling me domestic violence,

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:32.206
but you're safe now. And
you got Sam protecting you.

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:34.616
- Yeah, I got Sam protecting
me, so I feel better now.

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:35.744
- [Interviewer] 'Cause
otherwise I wouldn't do

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:38.919
a domestic violence story,
unless you know you're safe.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:40.844
- Yeah, I'm safe now.

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:43.026
- [Interviewer] So how
do you survive out here?

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:47.365
- It's kinda hard, it's
hard really for us.

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:50.649
We just try to make it
the best way we can.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.787
We get up in the morning,
try to eat breakfast,

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:55.660
and then try to go take
a shower in the evening.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.975
But we have to find places
where we take showers at,

00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:00.275
that's what really bugs
me, and the bathroom part.

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:01.329
But we don't have bathrooms.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.279
And we don't have a trash.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:04.625
They expect us to throw our trash,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.509
but where we gonna throw it out,

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.376
we don't have no dumpsters.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:12.491
So, there's a lot of
things that we need still.

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.156
That I think they don't benefit us.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:17.149
They just put us down.

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.705
- [Interviewer] What would you want people

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.705
to know about homelessness
that they don't know?

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:28.643
- What would I want them to know...

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.100
They don't know how it is to be homeless

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.767
unless they've been there, so...

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:40.463
- I mean I've always had
money, I've always had work

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:42.540
Before, I used to down
look at homeless people.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.125
I said, "You look at them, they're crazy."

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.212
Because I had money, I had
a bank account of $40,000.

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:49.676
And that was the lowest I had.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.227
And now, I don't have a single penny,

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:55.950
and I live this style, and we're human.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.725
We're homeless, and other people treat us

00:02:57.725 --> 00:02:59.475
like we're not human.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.007
People with money, they down look at you.

00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.219
- We try to survive.
- It could happen to them too.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.396
In my story, I lost everything

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:11.616
because my wife took everything.

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:13.199
She took the house.

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:15.832
I owe child support,

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:20.060
which is something that is my
obligation, my responsibility.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.950
But I can't pay for my rent,
you know what I'm saying?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.976
'Cause I have eight kids. Seven kids.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:30.160
Long story short, I do need
assistance by the government,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.171
but they won't give it.

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:33.112
They say you need a job.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.057
Even if I get a job, I still
ain't gonna be able to pay

00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:36.837
for my apartment with all those kids.

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:41.226
I know they're my obligation,
my kids, but there needs

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:44.756
to be more funds to help
people that are in need.

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:48.404
- It's hard for homeless. It's hard us.

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:51.692
- [Interviewer] So what is
homeless like in Los Angeles?

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:53.578
- I think it's hard.

00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:56.141
I think it's like, there's
not very many people

00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.558
that are giving, and it's
hard to make a dollar here.

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:05.618
Well we go hustling cans
and stuff, but it's hard,

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:08.910
a lot of people don't want to give.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.787
I don't know, I think it's hard.

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:13.656
- [Interviewer] Do you see
homeless numbers growing?

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:17.656
- Yeah, I see more homeless
people than I see...

00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:21.740
Yeah, everywhere.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.611
- [Interviewer] Sam, you're
going to be in housing soon,

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:27.620
then what?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.611
- Then I get overnight
business for my children.

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:35.137
- [Interviewer] You glow when
you talk about your children.

00:04:35.137 --> 00:04:36.943
- That's...yeah.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:41.034
- He's fighting for his
children. Mine are grown.

00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:43.037
- [Interviewer] So
what's your future like?

00:04:43.037 --> 00:04:47.427
- My future? Well, us, as
together? I don't know.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.450
- Hopefully we stay together.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.326
- We argue like cats and dogs,
but we're always together.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.985
- We're trying to work together.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:59.944
Being homeless is a struggle,
because not having bathrooms,

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:01.912
I blame him for a lot of stuff.

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:03.648
Not having a bathroom,
not having a trash can,

00:05:03.648 --> 00:05:04.628
not having a shower.

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:05.824
- [Interviewer] Take
the stress out on him?

00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:08.747
- Yeah I get stressed out,
just not taking a shower.

00:05:08.747 --> 00:05:10.166
- [Interviewer] I'll pray for you, Sam.

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:14.784
- So, I wish they would
give us an opportunity,

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:17.941
the homeless people, to have
a bathroom and a shower.

00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:19.185
- [Interviewer] Good hygiene?

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.685
- Yeah, that's it.

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:23.022
- [Interviewer] Well,
if you had three wishes,

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.076
what would they be?

00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:28.210
- If I had three wishes?
Mine would be a bathroom.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.750
- [Interviewer] I had a feeling
that was going to be yours,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.539
a bathroom and a shower.

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.481
- She'd be there all day 'cause,

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:36.723
when we go to the public
one man, she takes forever.

00:05:36.723 --> 00:05:40.100
And when I get in, I bust straight out.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.350
- [Interviewer] Just like
relationships in a house.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.727
- I would like to start working

00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:49.974
so I can get back on my feet.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.057
Get a job, you know? I do need a job.

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:57.663
And see my kids more often.

00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:01.268
- And one thing I don't like,
when they tell us we gotta

00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:04.249
get up and get our stuff and get out.

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:06.840
They only give us 15 minutes,
and I feel like that's wrong.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.982
- [Interviewer] Where at?

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:12.649
- When the law comes
in. What's that called?

00:06:16.288 --> 00:06:18.072
- [Interviewer] Oh, they make
you, when they're cleaning

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:18.905
or something?

00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:20.964
- When they're cleaning
they make us leave.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:21.991
- [Interviewer] They
only give you 15 minutes

00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:22.824
to move your stuff?

00:06:22.824 --> 00:06:25.095
- Yeah they only give us 15
minutes to move our stuff.

00:06:25.095 --> 00:06:27.466
I feel like we lose a lot of,

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:31.119
they throw everything
away of our belongings.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.711
That's wrong. They're
not supposed to do that,

00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:36.258
but they come and do it anyways.

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:39.880
- I feel like they should make a facility,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.304
where you can put your tents, but it has,

00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:44.598
of course, rules that
you have to have agreed.

00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:45.997
- [Interviewer] Sanction tanks.

00:06:45.997 --> 00:06:47.760
- And whoever starts trying
to fight or something,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.740
you're out, like security.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.918
- [Interviewer] Other cities have them.

00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.073
- They should have a tent city.

00:06:55.073 --> 00:06:57.656
Because not everyone has money.

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.455
- [Interviewer] This is affordable housing

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:01.967
in Los Angeles anymore.

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:04.506
- Sometimes they get our
stuff without us knowing,

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:06.154
and they dump it.

00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:07.806
When we're not here.

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:09.781
And I feel that's wrong.

00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:12.789
- [Interviewer] Well, thank
you very much for talking me,

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.738
it was an honor to meet you both.

00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:16.238
- Okay, thank you.

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:20.528
(light, jazzy music)
