WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO
THE LATE SHOW.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.369
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:05.838 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW--
(APPLAUSE).

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.873 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.675 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, I HAVE MET DONALD
TRUMP.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
BUT I WOULD NOT SAY THAT WE ARE
FRIENDS.

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:18.317 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
AND I THANK THE LORD FOR THAT

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.088 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE TODAY HAS BEEN A ROUGH
ONE FOR THOSE CLOSE TO THE

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.256 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.792
LET'S START WITH FORMER TRUMP
CAMPAIGN CHAIR AND MAN WITH

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:30.596 align:start position:0%
RESTING INDICTED FACE PAUL
MANAFORT.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:37.804
EARLIER TODAY A FEDERAL JUDGE
SENTENCED MANAFORT TO 47 MONTHS

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.373 align:start position:0%
IN PRISON, OKAY.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.842 align:start position:0%
S THAT HE'S NOT EVEN FOUR YEARS,
OKAY.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.813
SO NOT QUITE FOUR YEARS BUT WITH
GOOD BEHAVIOR HE IS INCAPABLE OF

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.414 align:start position:0%
GOOD BEHAVIOR.

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
THE 47 MONTHS MANAFORT GOT IS A
SHOCKINGLY LENIENT SENTENCE

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:58.057
CONSIDERING THE SENTENCING GUIDE
LINES CALL FOR A PREBT TERM OF

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start position:0%
19.5 TO 24 YEARS.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.895 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.401
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I TELL YOU
WHAT, I GOT TO SAY, THAT HALF,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.636 size:84% position:42%
THAT HALF HAS GOT TO STING.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.837 align:start position:0%
IS THAT NECESSARY?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.711 align:start position:0%
THAT'S LIKE HEARING YOU ARE
SENTENCED TO DEATH AND COMMUNITY

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:19.912 align:start position:0%
SERVICE.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:23.649 align:start position:0%
BUT MANAFORT'S LAWYERS TRIED
EVERYTHING TO GET THEIR CLIENT A

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:27.954 align:start position:0%
REDUCED SENTENCE EXCEPT
REPRESENTING AN INNOCENT MAN.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:36.129 size:88% position:44%
MANAFORT EVEN WENT ON TV AND
FREAKED OUT ON GAYLE KING.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.332
MANAFORT'S LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM
THE SENTENCING GUIDE LINES WERE

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.702 align:start position:0%
UNFAIR SINCE HE WAS A FIRST TIME
OFFENDERS.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start position:0%
AS PROSECUTORS POINTED OUT THAT
FOR OVER A DECADE MANAFORT

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.542 align:start position:0%
REPEATEDLY AND BRAZENLY VIOLATED
THE LAW.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:53.379
HE WASN'T SO MUCH A FIRST TIME
OFFENDER AS A FIRST TIME GETTING

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:54.613 align:start position:0%
CAUGHTER.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:59.852 align:start position:0%
AND THE BAD NEWS KEEPS COMING
FOR PAULIE NUMBNUTS BECAUSE NEXT

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.488 size:88% position:44%
WEEK MANAFORT WILL RECEIVE A
SECOND JAIL SENTENCE FROM A

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.792 size:84% position:42%
DIFFERENT FEDERAL JUDGE FOR
WITNESS TAMPERING AND MONEY

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:07.993 align:start position:0%
LAUNDERING.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.729 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW ARE YOU IN TROUBLE WHEN
THE ONLY TIME YOU GET OUT OF

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:14.033 align:start position:0%
JAIL IS TO GO GET SENTENCED TO
MORE JAIL.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.802 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF PEOPLE--

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.539 align:start position:0%
(APPLAUSE)
I GOT YOU.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.909 align:start position:0%
I GOT YOU.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.711 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT
LOOKS LIKE PAUL MANAFORT WILL BE

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:29.615 align:start position:0%
IN THE SLAMMER FOR THE REST OF
HIS LIFE BUT MAYBE HE CAN

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:32.752 align:start position:0%
CONVINCE THE PAS ROLE BOARD TO
LET HIM OUT EARLY IF HE'S A

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:33.986 align:start position:0%
SMOOTHER TALKER.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.190
&gt;&gt; SO TO BE CLEAR, MR. TRUMP HAS
NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.025 align:start position:0%
ANY RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.627 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; IF THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.299
THAT'S WHAT I SAID-- THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE OPPOSITION

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.333 align:start position:0%
IS.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.168 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S GOING TO BE
IN THERE A LONG TIME.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.338 align:start position:0%
IT'S BEEN--
(APPLAUSE).

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.841
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NEVER, NEVER-- I
LOVE THAT, I LOVE THAT FOOTAGE.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.075 align:start position:0%
SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.447
IT'S ALSO BEEN A BIT OF A ROUGH
DAY FOR FORMER TRUMP FIXER AND

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
MAN WATCHING HIS SOUL RIDE OFF
ON A VESPA, MICHAEL COHEN.

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:10.389
COHEN HAS BEEN TESTIFYING FOR
THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN CONGRESS

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.592 align:start position:0%
AND THERE IS ONE THING HE WAS
VERY CLEAR ABOUT.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:18.164
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR NOR
WOULD I ACCEPT A PARDON FROM

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.232 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.602 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CHECKS,
REIMBURSING ME FOR PAYING OFF A

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:23.736 align:start position:0%
PORN STAR, HE YES.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.370 align:start position:0%
PARDON, NO.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:27.573 align:start position:0%
I HAVE MY DIGNITY.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:33.145 size:88% position:44%
BUT AND ITS HE'S A BIG JUICY
BUT, ACCORDING TO "THE WALL

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.648 align:start position:0%
STREET JOURNAL," ACCORDING TO
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," COHEN

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:41.787 align:start position:0%
INSTRUCTED HIS LAWYER TO INQUIRE
ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.921 align:start position:0%
OOOOOH.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.525 size:88% position:44%
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL A PERSON
WITHOUT DOES SOMETHING LIKE

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.361 size:84% position:42%
THAT, REPRESENTATIVE GOSAR.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.162
&gt;&gt; LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE.

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:54.767 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, SIR.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.136 align:start position:0%
RECLAIMING MY TIME, RECLAIMING
MY TIME.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.506 align:start position:0%
COHEN'S LAWYERS ARGUE THAT
COHEN'S TESTIMONY WASN'T A LIE

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:04.877
BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD
NEVER ASK FOR A PARDON, HE WAS

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.947
TALKING ABOUT THE PERIOD WHERE
HE HAD MADE HIS DECISION TO TELL

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.452
THE TRUTH AND THAT NEW MICHAEL
COHEN AUTHORIZED THEM TO SAY

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.354 align:start position:0%
PUBLICLY HE WOULDN'T ACCEPT A
PARDON.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:22.795 align:start position:0%
THAT IS A TRICKY, TRICKY
DISTINCTION TO SELL, DUG, YOU

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:24.530 size:88% position:44%
SAY YOU NEVER CHEATED ON ME.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.432
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T, THAT WAS OLD DOUG.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.700 align:start position:0%
I'M NEW DUG.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:32.838
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, HAVE
I TO GO PAY OFF A BOOKIE BECAUSE

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:36.809
OLD DOUG BET OUR MORTGAGE ON THE
KNICKS AND GOONS ARE COMING FOR

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:38.344 align:start position:0%
NEW DOUG'S KNEE CAPS.

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:41.847 size:84% position:42%
NOW IF IT SOUNDS LIKE OLD
MICHAEL AND NEW MICHAEL HAD

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.585
QUITE AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE OVER
WHETHER TO GET A PARDON, I'M

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:50.256 align:start position:0%
BEING TOLD RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE
FOOTAGE OF BOTH MICHAELS

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.428 align:start position:0%
DEBATING WHETHER HE WANTS A
PARDON.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:05:00.900
&gt;&gt; TRUMP, WE WANTS A PARDONSES.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:06.672 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, TRUMP IS WICKED
TRICKSTER, ELYS, ELYS!

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:09.942 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT MASTER TRUMP IS OUR
FRIEND!

00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.078
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
NO ONE WHO WORKS FOR TRUMP HAS
FRIENDS!

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
WITHIN YES, BUT HE IS THE
PRESIDENT.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:31.097 align:start position:0%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANDY SERKIS DOES
IT AGAIN.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:36.902 align:start position:0%
THIS REVOLUTION IS CRUCIAL
BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES COHEN, A

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
WIT WHENS HAS PRODUCED COPIES OF
DONALD TRUMP'S CHECKS,

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:44.377
REIMBURSING HIM FOR PAYING OFF
PORN STAR STORMY DAN YEMS WHICH

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.012 align:start position:0%
WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN FINANCE
VIOLATION.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:50.549
NOW TRUMP FIRED BACK AT THAT
CHARGE THIS MORNING ON TWITTER.

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:55.955 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT A CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTION, AND THERE WERE NO

00:05:55.988 --> 00:06:03.729 align:start position:0%
VIOLATIONS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE
LAWS BY ME, FAKE NEWS.

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:08.634
SIR, ARE YOU PASSIONATE BUT JUST
SAYING IT WASN'T ME, IT WASN'T

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:12.037 align:start position:0%
WHAT IT WAS IS NOT A STRONG HE
DEFENSE.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.243
I MEAN AFTER ALL ATTICUS FINCH
DIDN'T DEFEND TOM ROBYN SON BY

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:24.717 size:81% position:41%
SAYING OH NO HE DI'S N' T.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.953
ONE, ONE REPUBLICAN HAD A CLEAR
DEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT, I'M

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:32.691 align:start position:0%
TALKED ABOUT SOUTH DAKOTA
PRESIDENT AND STOCK PHOTO OF A

00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:36.128 size:75% position:38%
STOCK PHOTO MIKE ROUNDS.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:39.131 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT LOVES HIS
FAMILY AND I THINK IT HAS AS

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:42.568
MUCH TO DO WITH TRYING NOT TO
HAVE PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.737
SOMETHING THAT IS FOR HIM A
PRIVATE MATTER THAT HE DIDN'T

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.972 align:start position:0%
WANT TO HAVE TO DISCUSS WITH HIS
FAMILY.

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:49.775
HE LOVES HIS FAMILY AND I DON'T
THINK HE WANTED HIS FAMILY TO GO

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:50.976 align:start position:0%
THROUGH THIS.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.948 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, WHILE TRUMP
WAS BEING SPANKED WITH A COPY OF

00:06:55.981 --> 00:07:00.352 align:start position:0%
FORBS MAGAZINE BY A PORN STAR,
HE WAS THINKING OF FAMILY.

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:05.524 align:start position:0%
AND I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THEY
WERE ON THE COVER OF THAT

00:07:05.557 --> 00:07:06.959 align:start position:0%
MAGAZINE.
