00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.701
The Vice President: Well, thank
you all for being with us.

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.204
Thanks to the members of
the National Space Council.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:06.673
And why don't you join me
in thanking the President

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.442
one more time for his
leadership and hospitality,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:18.718
you know?

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:19.486
(applause)

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.588
We're honored to be
at the White House today.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.456
And the presence
of the third meeting

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.960
of the National Space Council
here at the White House

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.763
surrounded by members
of our council

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.365
as well as by members
of our user advisory group

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.134
and other industry leaders

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.569
and our distinguished
panelists I trust

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.204
is a reflection
of the priority

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.207
that you just heard
in the President's words,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.677
that the President
and our entire administration

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.582
are placing on American
leadership in space.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.718
I do want to --
I do want to say thank you again

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.620
to all of the distinguished
guests who are here,

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.824
to members of the user
advisory group,

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.960
but also to distinguished
members of Congress

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.195
who've already
been introduced.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.830
We are grateful
for your leadership

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.133
and grateful for your presence,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.470
but not surprised
by your presence today.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.906
And so, join me in thanking
these members of Congress

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.007
who've already been introduced.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.542
We appreciate them very much.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:20.480
(applause)

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.216
We have a great lineup
of panelists today,

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:26.386
three panels that
will all be working

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.657
under the umbrella
of our conversation

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.726
about the Moon, Mars,
and worlds beyond.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.829
And the focus today will be on

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.533
how we continue to move forward
to permit greater --

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.402
a private development of space

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.204
as you just heard
the President reflect on,

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.740
but also how we revive

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.743
and continue to expand
human exploration in space

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.113
with American leadership
and American platforms.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.717
We're going to begin
with reports

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.387
from members of
the National Space Council.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.590
And to all the cabinet members
who are with us today,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.025
I want to thank you
for the efforts that you've made

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.728
and all the agencies
that are represented here.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.464
It represents the very best
of the kind of teamwork

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.767
that the President relies on
in this administration,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.202
and we're grateful for it.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.373
And with that, to kick things
off, Secretary Ross,

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.175
if you could provide us
with an update

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.177
on the work of
the Commerce Department

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.680
implementing the President's
Space Policy Directive-2.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.549
We'll begin there.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.951
Secretary Ross: Mr.
Vice President and members

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.820
of the National Space Council,

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:37.490
it's an honor to be
with you again today

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.859
and to have joined
President Trump

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.029
as he signed
Space Policy Directive-3.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.798
Since we last met
in February,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:49.903
Commerce has been working hard
to meet industry needs,

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:54.173
conducting regulatory
reforms critical

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.009
to commercial space growth

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.180
and making America the flag
of choice for space commerce.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.716
My staff and I
have met with dozens

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.885
of space-related companies,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.756
from the large to
the small launch providers

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:15.161
to the satellite data collection
and Earth observation companies

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.598
and the innovators
who plan to bring mining

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.134
and manufacturing into space.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.803
We always hear the same thing:

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.207
America is leading
in space once again

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.910
under the leadership
of President Trump.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.580
There's a booming economy,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.883
an actively engaged
and supportive President,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.153
and a cabinet committed
to cutting red tape.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:46.426
Space Policy Directive-2, signed
by President Trump last month,

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.597
directed the Department
of Commerce and other agencies

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.398
to execute regulatory

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:57.570
reforms that will advance
business opportunities in space.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.039
Commerce has much to report.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:06.379
On May 24th, the same day
President Trump signed SPD-2,

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:11.050
we announced our plans
for a new space policy

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.622
advancing commercial enterprise
or space administration

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.924
under my direct supervision.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.594
Commerce's existing
Office of Space Commerce

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:25.565
and the Commercial Remote
Sensing Regulatory

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.266
Affairs Office,

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:32.105
both now buried deep within
NOAA, are being consolidated.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.608
Our establishment of
the Space Administration

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.779
will not create
more government bureaucracy.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.414
Just the opposite.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.550
The Space Administration
will consolidate

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.786
and streamline activities

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:50.423
previously spread
throughout the department

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.924
and the executive branch.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:55.528
Our space commerce
reforms are led

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:59.165
by the department's
regulatory reform officer,

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:02.735
a position created
by President Trump's

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:09.108
executive order 13771
to direct deregulation efforts.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:13.446
The new space administration
will be a one-stop shop

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.548
within the department

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.984
for promoting,
administering,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.754
and regulating commercial
space activities,

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:26.325
including remote sensing,
export controls,

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:31.698
GPS, spectrum policy,
business and trade promotion,

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.033
and standards in technology,

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.904
and now space traffic
management as well.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.741
This week, ahead of schedule,

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.178
the department will also
submit to the White House

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.749
Office of Management and Budget
a legislative proposal

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:55.054
to solidify our industry-focused
Space Administration.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.424
I'm also excited
to announce now

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:02.528
a new director of the Office
of Space Commerce,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.264
a presidentially-
appointed position

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.767
that's been left vacant
for about a decade.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.437
Under the leadership
of Kevin O'Connell,

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:14.707
the Office of Space Commerce
will once again

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:18.678
be the government advocate
of the U.S. space policy.

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:22.148
We look forward to having
Kevin on board soon.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.985
He's spent 35 years
in government

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:29.255
and private sector
leadership roles,

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:33.426
working in national security,
intelligence, and commerce.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.696
He is the perfect man
for the job.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:41.300
Space Commerce is getting
dedicated attention

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.269
at the department once again.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.472
In line with the
President's directive,

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:50.910
Commerce is also reforming
the 25-year-old

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.313
commercial remote-sensing
regulatory environment.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:59.519
Regulations must keep up
with advancing industry,

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.120
not slowing it down.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:06.626
Last week, as promised,
the department submitted to OMB

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.895
our advanced notice of proposed

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:12.031
rulemaking on remote sensing.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:15.768
It will be posted in the
Federal Register this week.

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:22.475
This proposal seeks industry
feedback on streamlining

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.311
and simplifying
the commercial remote

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.280
sensing approval process.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.883
New regulations are needed
to accommodate

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.919
changing technologies

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.487
and business activities.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.390
After the 60-day
comment period,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.028
Commerce will issue a new
proposed rule this fall.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.264
We've already made
significant improvements.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.533
Commerce has signed an agreement

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:53.072
with the departments of Defense,
State, Interior,

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:56.609
and the director of
National Intelligence to reduce

00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:01.214
wait times on satellite
remote-sensing applications.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.985
The agreement sets more
definitive decision timelines

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.486
for licenses,

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:11.891
elevates decision-making
to senior government officials

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.893
if the deadlines are not met.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.996
Before its implementation,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.066
the average time
to receive a NOAA

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:23.736
license was 210 days.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.473
Now, the average time
to grant licenses

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.075
has been reduced

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:33.346
by more than 50 percent
to an average of 91 days.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.048
Over the last couple of months,

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:41.320
we've shown that government can
and must work together to adapt

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.556
and enable new
business activity.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:50.062
Earlier this year, SpaceX, like
many other launch companies,

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:52.632
was not previously aware

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.534
that the second-stage
camera recording

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.804
and live video feed
of its Falcon 9

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:02.375
launch were regulated
under the National

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.877
and Commercial Space
Programs Act.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:12.051
The law requires authorization
of camera activity from objects

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.586
in Earth orbit

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:16.122
to protect national
security interests.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:21.727
On May 3rd, we approved
a blanket remote license

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:25.231
for SpaceX's future
rocket launches.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:29.802
The license grants
SpaceX permission to image

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:32.972
while in the second stage
of their launches.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.441
A first of its kind,

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:39.445
this license is valid
for all launches

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.948
with certain specified cameras

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:46.485
and is valid through
January 1st, 2019.

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:51.157
The license was processed
through an expedited review

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:56.262
with interagency partners
in only 23 days.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:02.101
This license permits SpaceX
to publicly livestream imagery

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:05.805
from space providing
certain parameters are met,

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.974
including time and position.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:13.846
The Department will pursue such
blanket license opportunities

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:17.950
for all similar companies
to alleviate the need

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.120
for repeated,
onerous applications.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:25.658
This is a great example
how government can work quickly

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.693
when it wants to.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:31.797
Next week, we will begin
interagency discussions

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:35.868
to implement space
export control reform.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:39.472
And our National
Telecommunications

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.008
and Information Administration

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.744
is coordinating with the FCC

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.880
to conduct spectrum
management analyses

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:52.418
essential to the future
success of space businesses.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:57.623
And finally, as announced
this morning in SPD-3,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.726
we will begin to take on a role

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:05.931
as the civil agency interface
for space traffic management

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.567
and space situational awareness.

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:13.072
I commend President Trump,
Vice President Pence,

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.373
and the Space Council

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:19.178
for finalizing the first
comprehensive policy

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:21.147
on space traffic management.

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:23.449
It is really needed.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:29.922
Over 600,000 bits of space
debris fly around the Earth

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:32.691
at tens of thousands
of miles per hour.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.695
Amidst the torrent
of space debris,

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:41.901
there are over 800 operational
American satellites

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:45.471
critical to U.S.
national security,

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.373
Earth observations,

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:51.610
weather forecasting,
public safety, and GPS.

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.213
Their solar panels

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.048
are especially vulnerable

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.917
to space debris.

00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:02.455
And there are thousands
more satellites on the way soon.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.258
These devices are
the magnificent result

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:10.463
of billions of dollars of public
and private investment,

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:13.399
and efforts must be
taken to protect them.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.471
We will work closely with DoD
and other departments

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.507
to meet the challenge
of increased commercial

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.042
and civil space traffic.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.813
The transition will allow DoD

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:30.483
to concentrate
on its main objective:

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.186
defending and securing
the United States

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:37.957
from threats here
on Earth and in space.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:42.728
At Commerce, we're well-suited
for these new responsibilities.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:47.933
Most objects now going into
space are in fact commercial.

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.570
And as a friend
of business agency,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.874
we act as a facilitator
of business,

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.410
not as a typical
old-fashioned regulator.

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:02.848
We already engage industry
on a host of issues,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.687
stretching from export
licensing to trade promotion

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:11.190
to licensing abuse in space.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.793
Commerce will immediately
begin working with industry

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:21.100
to determine what basic SSA and
traffic coordination services

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.135
are needed by
private companies.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:27.740
And we'll use our
preeminent SSA technologies

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.909
and improve government services

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:32.645
to incentivize more companies

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.980
to launch under the U.S. flag.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:39.084
These efforts and others
to come from President Trump

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.853
and the Space Council

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:43.989
will make new activities
in space possible,

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:49.228
but only because of the
ingenuity and innovative spirits

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:50.963
of the people in this room.

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:56.001
Non-traditional activities
like space tourism,

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:59.705
asteroid mining,
space manufacturing,

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:03.409
and lunar habitation
will soon become a reality.

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:07.012
Commerce is driving
in today's space race.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:11.884
And the department looks forward
to working with all of you

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.287
as we expand upon
the bounds of humanity

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:19.992
and develop the last
new business frontier: space.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.026
Thank you.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.128
(applause)

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.697
The Vice President: Good job.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.931
Is Kevin O'Connor here?

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:26.865
Secretary Ross: Pardon me?

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.100
The Vice President: Is
Kevin here?

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.469
Secretary Ross: No.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:34.907
The Vice President: Thank you,
Secretary Ross.

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:37.676
Thank you for all
of your efforts

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:38.944
so carefully enumerated

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:42.548
about how we make
the American flag

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.950
the flag of choice
for space commerce.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.054
Well said. With that,
Secretary Chao,

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:51.557
the President's Space
Policy Directive-2 assigns

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:54.860
some ambitious goals for the
Department of Transportation.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.930
Would you please
give the council an update

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.164
on your ongoing work?

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.399
And let me thank you in advance

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.234
for all of your efforts

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.104
moving together

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:07.172
the President's agenda
to really streamline

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.775
and advance
the development of space

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.077
on a commercial basis.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.812
Secretary Chao: Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.081
As the President
mentioned six years ago,

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.283
the U.S. was third.

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:20.853
Today, we are number one
with 15 commercial launches

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.222
in just the first
six months of 2018.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:27.393
The department is committed
to building upon this momentum

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:29.962
by streamlining
and updating its launch

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:33.098
and re-entry licensing criteria

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.933
in accordance with
the President's directive.

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.170
That will give commercial
space operators

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.239
the approvals
that they need more quickly

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:42.374
and help to make
the United States

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.443
be an even more
attractive place

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:46.312
for commercial
space enterprises.

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.414
Here's an update
on what we're doing.

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:53.852
First, the department will
release new proposed regulations

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:55.654
for licensing commercial launch

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:59.124
and re-entry activities
by February 1st, 2019.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:03.762
The new rules will enable
a single license framework

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:06.298
and replace many prescriptive

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.301
and sometimes
unnecessary regulations

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:12.538
and requirements with
performance-based criteria.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.240
We're working closely
with the industry,

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.309
our government partners,

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.011
and the National Space Council

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.979
as we develop these
new regulations.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:26.051
Second, the department
has created an aviation

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:29.188
rulemaking committee
consisting of industry,

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.123
our government partners,

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.925
and other important
stakeholders.

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.195
And as a result,
this committee has provided

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.397
a comprehensive set
of recommendations

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.699
to help us better understand

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.668
what the new rules
should look like.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:46.205
We have also met with
our partner at the Air Force

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.573
and NASA

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:49.375
to discuss how the department

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.143
can better enable
commercial space

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:55.347
launches without impacting
adversely national security.

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:58.784
I'm happy to report that
we're making good progress.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:03.555
Third, the Commercial Space
Transportation Advisory

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:04.490
Committee

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.992
has been revived
and met last week.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.828
It will provide
continuous insights

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.930
that will help shape policy

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.767
and enhance the
department's approach.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:19.037
Fourth, as the department
moves forward

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:22.841
on this extremely important
regulatory streamlining effort,

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:27.379
we have remained very
focused on continuing

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:30.749
to make timely
determinations for licenses.

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:36.155
And fifth, the department is
studying new technologies

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:39.825
to help meet increased
demand as commercial space

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:44.329
launches move through
our country's busy airspace

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:46.165
managed by the FAA.

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:51.970
As an example, the Space
Data Integrator Project

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:57.543
has tremendous potential to help
reduce the amount of air space

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:01.914
and time that must be blocked
off for commercial launches.

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:06.785
This will facilitate the safe
and efficient integration

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:11.323
of commercial space
flights into our airspace

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:15.594
while minimizing the impact
on other airspace users.

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:19.631
And finally, the department
has chartered

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:23.936
two additional aviation
rulemaking committees.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.941
The first addresses
airspace access priorities,

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:32.511
and it will provide a forum
for commercial space

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:36.381
and traditional
aviation stakeholders

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.317
to work with the FAA

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:40.986
to minimize airspace conflicts

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:45.257
and to propose criteria
that may be used

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:49.828
to ensure fair access
given more demand.

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:55.367
The other committee addresses
spaceport categorization.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:58.904
Spaceports support
different operations.

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:03.175
New opportunities
from aircraft-based

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.345
launches are changing
the definition

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.280
of what it means
to be a spaceport.

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:12.117
So, this committee
will be a forum

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:17.055
where the aviation and space
communities can come together

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:22.127
to discuss a spaceport
characterization

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.862
and categorization scheme.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:29.635
This will provide clearer
information on safe operations

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:33.038
to perspective
spaceport enterprises,

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:36.675
nearby aviation
infrastructures, and the FAA.

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:41.313
So taken together,
all of these actions

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:45.284
send a very clear message
to companies around the world.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:50.088
If you want to license
a commercial space operation,

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.292
America is the place to do it.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:58.597
A recent study concluded that
the commercial space industry

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:03.669
will triple in seven years
to $27 billion annually.

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:07.839
If America wins
a significant market

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.575
share of this new industry,

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:13.078
it could help drive
economic growth,

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:16.848
technical innovation,
and job creation.

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:21.153
So the department
is committed to fully

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.089
and safely integrating
this growing sector

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.925
into our
National Airspace System

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:31.196
by streamlining
licensing approvals,

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:34.333
removing unnecessary
regulatory burdens,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.436
leveraging new technologies,

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:40.572
and working closely
with stakeholders,

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.974
all stakeholders.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:45.510
The department has
a roadmap in place

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.048
to help ensure that America
remains number one

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:52.651
in the commercial space sector.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:53.852
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:59.124
(applause)

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:03.528
The Vice President: Great job,
(inaudible).

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:04.696
Well, thank you,
Secretary Chao.

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:12.304
Thank you for your tremendous
efforts and let me also --

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:17.275
let me also say that I know
the Department of Transportation

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:23.015
took very strong steps to reach

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:27.185
that February 1st, 2019 deadline

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.454
regarding commercial
launch and reentry.

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:32.824
And why don't you all join me
in thanking the secretary

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:35.661
and her whole team
on hitting their marks --

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:36.294
Secretary Chao: Thank you.

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:38.597
The Vice President: -- on new
regulations and deregulations.

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:41.166
(inaudible)

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:42.334
Secretary Chao: Thank you.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.037
The Vice President: Great job,
great job.

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:50.442
With that, the new
NASA administrator

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.677
has already been called out

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.080
and recognized warmly
by this crowd,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.082
but let me add
my congratulations

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:58.250
to Jim Bridenstine

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.585
as the new
administrator of NASA.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.053
Jim Bridenstine: Thank you, sir.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.554
The Vice President: We are
grateful to have you --

00:22:02.554 --> 00:22:03.188
Jim Bridenstine: Thank you.

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:05.490
The Vice President: --
on the team and in this council.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.794
I'm going to welcome you
to your first meeting

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:12.164
in the National Space
Council and grateful

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:13.799
to have you sitting
in the chair and at --

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.935
representing NASA
in this conversation.

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:21.907
Last December, the President
signed Space Policy Directive-1,

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:24.843
which directs NASA to return
American astronauts to the Moon.

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.846
We have discussed
that at some length

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.115
privately and with your team.

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:33.051
To the Moon first,
and as the President said today,

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:33.952
eventually to Mars.

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:36.288
I know you've been diligently
working with your team

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:38.457
to develop a strategy
to implement

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.025
that space policy directive.

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.593
And I wanted to invite you

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.995
to give the council
an update on your work.

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:44.529
Welcome.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.097
Jim Bridenstine: Yes, sir.

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:46.364
Thank you.

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:47.666
First of all, sir, it's an honor

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:50.902
to serve my country in this
capacity, honor of a lifetime.

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:52.471
And I'd like to thank you
and the President

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.473
for this opportunity.

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:57.476
I would also like to thank
your executive secretary here

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:59.144
on the Space Council,
Scott Pace,

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.747
who, when all
the lights are off --

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.749
I hear some --

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:11.089
(applause)

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:12.057
Jim Bridenstine: -- when 
all the lights are off

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.325
and the cameras aren't rolling,

00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:15.193
he works overtime
to make sure this group

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.996
is focused on a whole of --

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:20.999
a whole-of-government approach
under your direction.

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:22.033
So, thank you, for that, sir

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:24.636
and thank you to the executive
secretary, Scott Pace.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:26.938
I'd be remiss if I didn't
also mention Jared Stout,

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:29.407
who worked side-by-side
with Scott Pace on these issues.

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:36.648
(applause)

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.049
So, we are underway,

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:41.119
executing the President's
Space Policy Directive-1,

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.588
which is our effort
to return to the Moon.

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:46.525
And interestingly, we heard
the President give his speech.

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:48.794
He talked about it
being sustainable.

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:51.029
I wrote a few notes down
of some things he said.

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.465
He said that we've had
a number of opportunities

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:56.268
to go back to
the Moon since 1972.

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:58.336
He didn't mention
them specifically,

00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:00.472
but the space
exploration initiative,

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.207
the vision for
space exploration,

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.576
and each of these efforts got,

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:08.146
in essence, undermined,
the words he used were,

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.682
"by bureaucracy and politics."

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:12.317
And so, our objective now,

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:14.753
following the direction
of the President

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:16.721
is to get back to
the surface of the Moon

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:20.525
and back to orbit around the
Moon in a sustainable way.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.396
And he said --
if I remember right, he said,

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:27.132
"We want more than just flags
and footprints this time."

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:29.868
He also said,
"Rich guys love rockets."

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:31.703
And I've heard him
say that before.

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:33.371
That's an important
thing to recognize,

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:35.774
because the architecture
that we're building now

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:39.177
is entirely different than
any architecture we've ever

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.646
built before in an effort
to get to the Moon.

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:44.382
And the reason is we have
more capabilities

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:46.551
now than we've ever
had as a nation,

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:49.721
largely because of the efforts
of many people in this room.

00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:52.390
The idea that we have
reusable rockets

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.259
to bring down the cost of launch

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:57.996
and give us more access at
a lesser cost than ever before,

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:00.198
the miniaturization
of electronics,

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:04.035
these capabilities enable us
to do more, in fact, with less.

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.904
Although, thanks to you
and the President,

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:07.405
we're doing more with more,

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:09.507
which is a good thing
for the NASA budget,

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:11.309
and we're grateful for that.

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:15.046
So, the opportunities
before us are immense.

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:18.350
And initially, when we
go back to the Moon,

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.619
there's a number of things
that we need to do.

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:25.657
We need low Earth orbit to be
driven by commercial enterprise.

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:27.492
And that's underway right now.

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:29.094
Under the President's
budget request,

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:34.165
the International Space Station
will no longer receive

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:37.168
direct support in the year 2025.

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:40.505
In some ways, that's a big
challenge for us at NASA.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:42.240
And we understand
the challenge before us,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.642
but for the first time,

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:46.278
we're having very
serious conversations

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:49.714
about how to make low
Earth orbit commercialized.

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:52.284
We want --
we don't want any gaps

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:54.419
in human activity
in low Earth orbit,

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.421
and that means
commercialization is the key.

00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:00.025
Then we can take our resources
at NASA and go further.

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:03.728
In other words, to the surface
of the Moon and then on to Mars.

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:06.431
The first program that we have
getting to the Moon

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:08.133
is called CLPS,

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.368
the Commercial Lunar
Payload Services.

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.437
What we called it in -- at NASA,

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.906
what we talk about
is taking shots on goal.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.542
Commercial Lunar
Payload Services,

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.344
these are not
expensive missions,

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:20.946
and they're not carrying
heavy payloads.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.514
But we're going to give
commercial companies

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:25.483
an opportunity to land
on the surface of the Moon,

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.186
and we would be
a customer of that.

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:30.355
They would have
other customers as well,

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:32.724
but we would be
one of many customers

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:35.760
in a very competitive market
with as many as six

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.863
or even more providers
for our access

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.165
to the surface of the Moon.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.200
The reason this is important

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.469
is because
all of these capabilities

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:47.172
in a competitive
environment result,

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.910
in effect, not just
competition on price,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.745
but competition on innovation.

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:56.114
So we can do more than
we've probably ever done before.

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:58.583
It's also important to note,
Mr. Vice President,

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:02.620
that when we go this direction,
we are taking shots on goal.

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:08.393
Not every shot gets made,
so it is very possible

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:09.928
that some of our
commercial providers,

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:12.097
who we believe there are
a number of them that are ready,

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:13.832
but maybe some of them are not.

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:16.001
So there is -- there is a risk
that some of them

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.202
won't be successful.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:21.272
But what we learn through this
Commercial Lunar Payload

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.774
Services program

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:24.642
will be critical
for the next step,

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:26.745
which is heavier landers

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.847
not just capable of
delivering instruments,

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:31.549
but capable of delivering
prospectors,

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.084
things that can dig.

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:35.854
We know -- from NASA's
achievements back

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:38.390
in 2008 and 2009,

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.793
we know that there are
potentially hundreds of billions

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.495
of tons of water ice
on the Moon.

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:47.832
From 1972 until then in 2009,

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.768
we didn't know that there was
water ice on the surface.

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.635
We now know that.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:53.171
So that represents
an opportunity for us

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:56.007
to learn more about the Moon
than we've ever learned before,

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.043
because we're going
to go to the surface,

00:27:58.043 --> 00:27:59.110
and we're going to prospect.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.479
That means we need heavier
landers that can --

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:02.414
that can carry things

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.749
that can prospect
the surface of the Moon.

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.951
And then beyond that,
we need heavier landers

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:09.187
that can take humans
to the surface of the Moon.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:12.757
So, this is an iterative process
where we're building capability

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:16.094
that we really haven't
had, sir, since 1972.

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:20.398
While we're doing this,
we're also going to put in orbit

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:23.101
around the Moon
what we call gateway.

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.971
This is our opportunity
to have more access

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.374
to more parts of the Moon
than ever before.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:31.342
When you land on
the surface of the Moon,

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:33.244
you're in one spot
on the surface of the Moon.

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.981
But what we want is we want
access to the entire Moon.

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:39.484
We also want to make sure
that everything we develop

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.686
is reusable.

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:44.522
This ultimately
gives us more access

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:46.424
to our international partners.

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.026
It puts us in
a leadership position

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:49.994
where the standards
and interfaces

00:28:49.994 --> 00:28:52.430
are established
by the United States of America.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.500
And then the Landers that go
from the gateway to the Moon,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.236
the tugs that go from low
earth orbit to the gateway,

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.838
it's all reusable.

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.674
And it becomes a critical
piece of infrastructure

00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:06.878
that we can then capitalize on
with our commercial partners

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:08.580
and our international partners.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.215
Again, the goal here --

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:13.084
following the President's
Space Policy Directive-1,

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.320
the goal is sustainability.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.189
We do not want this to be Lucy
and the football again.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.725
When we go to the Moon,
we're going --

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.660
and as the President
said in his speech,

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.229
this time we're going to stay.

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:27.999
And the gateway gives us
that great opportunity.

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:30.201
It's also important to note
that as NASA develops

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.603
these capabilities,

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.639
each one of these
capabilities feeds forward.

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.541
The reason we go to the Moon

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.244
is because we want
to land Americans

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.945
on the surface of Mars.

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:43.581
And the technologies,
the capabilities,

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.717
the institute
research utilization

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:49.320
that we develop for the Moon
will ultimately get us to Mars.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.656
It's also why the gateway
is so important.

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.894
Having an orbital outpost
around the Moon

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.195
gives us more access

00:29:57.195 --> 00:30:00.732
to more parts of the solar
system than ever before.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:02.233
And all those technologies
are being

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.435
developed in and around the Moon

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:07.205
for the purpose of eventually
getting humans to Mars.

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:10.108
So, sir, I would say that
Space Policy Directive-1

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:11.476
is well underway.

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:14.179
We've got a long ways to go,
but we're started.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.680
And certainly, we want
to get back to the Moon

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.615
as quickly as possible,
thank you.

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.484
(applause)

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.618
The Vice President: Great.

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:21.819
Good job.

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:26.357
Really good, no notes.

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:30.762
You did all that
without any notes.

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:31.629
It's great to have you --

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:33.431
great to have you on board
and in your position.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.901
With that, he was just
acknowledged a few moments ago.

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.571
Dr. Scott Pace is the director

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.039
of the National Space
Council staff.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:47.378
And Dr. Pace, if you'd
give the team an overview

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:50.148
of today's
Space Policy Directive-3

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:53.284
and the implementation plan,
we'll take action on that

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:56.187
and then move very quickly
to our two upcoming panelists.

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:57.956
Dr. Pace?

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:59.224
Scott Pace: Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.326
It's an honor to be here.

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:04.395
Now that Space Policy
Directive-3 has been approved,

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:06.097
departments and agencies

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:08.266
are working to transform
that policy into action.

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:12.303
The interagency working group
has designated leads

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:14.038
and supporting
departments and agencies

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.241
for each of the goals
in the policy,

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:19.844
outlining key tasks necessary
to achieve that goal.

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:21.713
And they're establishing
implementing actions

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.915
that involve the lead
and supporting agencies

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:24.749
tracking progress

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:27.819
and reporting back to the
council at regular intervals.

00:31:28.653 --> 00:31:30.288
The interagency
working group planning

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:33.791
has been coordinated and
endorsed at the deputy's level.

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.528
And I should add that
this has been a very thorough

00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:39.764
and rigorous process
that has involved

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:41.065
all of the departments
and agencies.

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:43.768
And we very much appreciated
the really deep thought

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:46.271
that people have
given to that effort.

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.607
Mr. Vice President,
it's important to emphasize that

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.476
while there are roles
and responsibilities

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.945
outlined in Space
Policy Directive-3

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.780
and designated lead departments,

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.749
that doesn't mean that
government organizations

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:01.185
will perform all those actions
to achieve each goal

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:03.588
or that they will somehow
prevent U.S. industry

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:06.324
from contributing to
space situational awareness

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.159
and space traffic management.

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:10.395
In fact, the policy
and implementation plans

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.163
are intended to establish
an architecture

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.966
or a framework that encourages
commercial development

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.969
of enhanced space safety
data and services.

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:20.238
We want to take advantage
of the growing innovation

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:22.440
in the private sector
that's going to be so necessary

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.242
for this to succeed.

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:26.978
There's a copy of the plan
in each of your binders.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:28.713
And the last page of the plan

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:32.150
summarizes those implementation
actions and due dates.

00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:34.752
We are respectfully asking
the council to approve

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:37.455
this plan for implementation
of the President's policy.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.723
And with the council's approval,

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:41.893
we will initiate tracking of
the implementation actions

00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:43.461
and look forward
to providing updates

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:45.663
at future council meetings.

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:46.664
Thank you, sir.

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:47.565
The Vice President: Oh,
thank you, Dr. Pace.

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:49.534
Are there any outstanding
comments or objections

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.636
to the implementation plan
that's in your books?

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:57.208
Seeing no objection, I direct
the executive secretary

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.143
to enter the implementation
plan into the records

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:01.346
of the National Space Council

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:04.716
and to make publicly available
a fact sheet

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:07.618
on the policy
and on the plan.

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:09.287
I also direct
the executive secretary

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:11.222
to work with the members
of the National Space Council

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:15.860
to develop periodic updates on
the implementation of the plan.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.128
But thank you, Dr. Pace.

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:17.929
Scott Pace: Thank you, sir.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.931
(applause)

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:21.933
The Vice President: Great job.

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:28.306
I'm going to ask
our first panel to go ahead

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.908
and make their way
up to the table.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:34.645
For this first panel, we're
going to be discussing science

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.948
and exploration missions

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.816
and the vital connection
between the two.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.854
I want to commend
Administrator Bridenstine

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:45.356
and his leadership team
for the efforts

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.591
that you just reflected on,

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:49.927
strengthening the bonds
of cooperation and collaboration

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:52.330
between science and
human exploration

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.631
directorates at NASA.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.933
You're breaking
down the barriers,

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.903
and that's exactly
what the President and I

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.438
are hoping to see.

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:01.472
We're grateful to be joined

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.408
by three truly
distinguished panelists,

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:04.776
who are going to speak
in greater detail

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.844
about the important ways
in which our science missions

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:10.882
complement our exploration
missions and vice versa.

00:34:12.316 --> 00:34:13.718
I'll describe each
of the panelists,

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:17.622
and then I'll recognize you for
maybe five minutes of remarks.

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:18.923
And then we'll have
some questions from

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:20.425
members of the council.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.460
Our first panelist
is Dr. Louise Prockter,

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.563
director of the Lunar
and Planetary

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.365
Institute in Houston, Texas.

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:32.503
Our second panelist is Dr. Steve
Squyres, the James A. Weeks

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:36.874
professor of physical
sciences at Cornell University.

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:39.243
And our third panelist
is Mr. John Vellinger,

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.179
president and CEO of Techshot,

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:46.083
a space company based
in Greenville, Indiana.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.855
With that, join me in welcoming
this very distinguished panel

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:54.225
for coming and sharing
their perspective.

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:57.028
(applause)

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.930
Now, Dr. Louise Prockter
is recognized.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.932
And thank you for being here.

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:02.967
Louise Prockter: Mr.
Vice President,

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:03.734
members of the council,

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:06.204
thank you very much for
this opportunity to speak today.

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.406
Science and exploration

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.975
enjoy a powerful
synergistic relationship.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:14.045
Scientific research
drives exploration,

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.547
and exploration creates
new opportunities

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:17.882
for scientific discovery.

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.985
This synergy is no more
evident than at NASA,

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.588
which, in its almost
60 years of existence,

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:26.157
has been the embodiment
of humankind's need to explore,

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:29.427
to explain why we're here,
and why our Earth is so unique.

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:33.531
Throughout those six decades,
robotic exploration has proven

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.867
to be a fundamental
and essential component

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.168
of NASA's space program,

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:40.104
enabling incredible
scientific discoveries

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.006
about our solar system
and universe.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.675
In the beginning,
robotic spacecraft

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:47.678
also served as pathfinders
for the manned program,

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:49.447
with the many ranger
and surveyor missions

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:52.183
characterizing the Moon ahead of
the astronauts who visited it.

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:56.020
And since Apollo, robotic
spacecraft have continued

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.356
to feed the quest
to explore and learn.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.259
They have traveled
far beyond Earth's moon,

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:03.160
examining asteroids, comets,

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.230
and with the recent
successful flyby of Pluto,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.766
every planet in the
classical solar system

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.201
as well as many
of their moons.

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:13.070
Robotic missions are even
now being developed

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.039
to thoroughly examine
ocean worlds,

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.507
the few bodies
in the solar system

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:18.609
believed to harbor
the ingredients of life

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:20.077
and maybe even life itself.

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:24.882
Robotic spacecraft active scouts
going to hostile environments

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:27.084
that no human
can safely visit yet

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:29.220
and returning
scientific knowledge

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.756
that benefits our society
in innumerable ways.

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.792
Robotic exploration
stimulates investments

00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:36.193
in technology development

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:38.195
that are highly significant
in achieving national

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.097
and economic goals.

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:41.999
Space-exploration-related
technology

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:45.202
has resulted in advancements
in a broad range of areas,

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:48.005
including transportation,
public safety,

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:51.242
consumer goods, industrial
productivity, and health.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.347
We must not underestimate
the importance of education

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:58.516
in this marriage of science
and exploration.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.320
My own Institute was created
by President Lyndon Johnson

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.423
50 years ago for the specific
purpose of bringing NASA

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:07.224
and the university
community together.

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:10.027
It was realized
that the expertise

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.329
of scientific researchers

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.397
was needed in order to analyze

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.967
and interpret the treasure
trove of information

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:18.269
that was being returned
from the Moon around that time.

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.373
In addition to carrying out
cutting-edge research,

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:24.809
universities play a key role
as incubators

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.544
for highly-skilled scientists,

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:30.414
engineers, mathematicians,
technologists, and educators,

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:33.184
who then move into our nation's
workforce in many areas,

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:34.819
not just space exploration.

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.655
Hands-on science
and technical training

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:38.856
is just as important today

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:40.858
as we plan the return
of humans to the Moon

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.694
and beyond as it was when
we first met that challenge.

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.064
The U.S. civilian space program

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:49.734
pushes our scientific
and technological limits,

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.869
making the seemingly
impossible possible

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:54.405
and driving the creation
of new partnerships

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.742
with government, commercial,
and academic organizations.

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:00.478
NASA's accomplishments
capture the attention

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.713
of citizens
and nations worldwide,

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:05.549
emphasizing the U.S.'s
global leadership in space

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.752
and creating opportunities
for peaceful

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:10.788
and mutually beneficial
international collaboration.

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.758
Thank you.

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:27.738
The Vice President: Thank you,
Dr. Prockter.

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:32.276
Next, I'd like to hear from 
Dr. Steve Squyres

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:34.178
of Cornell University.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:35.946
Dr. Squyres, you're recognized.

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:37.114
Steve Squyres: Thank you.

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.916
Mr. Vice President,
members of the council,

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.117
it's a real honor
to be here today.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.721
For almost 60 years,
the U.S. space program

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.590
has been an inspiring example
of American ingenuity.

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:49.026
Throughout that time,
exploration and science

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:50.795
have gone hand-in-hand.

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.963
Robotic precursor missions
provide crucial data

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.799
for designers of human missions

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:57.968
and define the scientific
goals for human explorers.

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:00.538
I'm a robot guy.

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:03.340
I've spent my career designing
and operating robot explorers,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.110
but I firmly believe
that the human explorers

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.412
can achieve far more science
than robots ever will.

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:12.049
I also believe that the humans
versus robots debate

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.784
that we sometimes here
in space circles

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.853
is based on a fundamentally
false premise.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:18.322
Humans and robots
are complementary

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:19.590
in their strengths
and their weaknesses.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.759
And a well-designed
scientific space exploration

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.260
will always use both.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.696
Our nation's civil space program

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:28.099
is at a pivotal moment
now in its history.

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:31.635
Space Policy Directive-1
clearly articulates the goal

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:34.371
of sending humans back
to the Moon and on to Mars.

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:37.408
This goal is clear,
compelling, and achievable.

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.278
A return to the Moon
is valuable before proceeding

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.880
to more challenging targets.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.049
It's been more than 45 years

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:47.118
since astronauts have ventured
beyond low Earth orbit.

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:51.021
The Moon is an ideal place to
validate the new technologies,

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:53.157
vehicles,
and operational procedures

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.859
that will be needed
to send astronauts

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.794
beyond the Earth-Moon system.

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.429
The Moon also offers exciting

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.364
scientific exploration
Steve Squyres:

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.599
-- in its own right.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:04.235
Preserving in its rocks
a record of the earliest events

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.636
of the Earth-Moon system,

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.538
as well as possessing resources

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:10.274
that could enable ventures
deeper into the solar system.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.678
Now, beyond the Moon, exciting
targets for exploration beckon.

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.414
Foremost among these is Mars.

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:21.085
Forty-plus years
of scientific observation

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.053
by Mars obiters, landers,

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.488
and rovers have revealed

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:27.291
a world of enormous
diversity and complexity.

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.994
Most importantly,
we have learned that Mars,

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:32.730
alone among the planets,
is enough like Earth,

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.431
the conditions that
its surface might once

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:36.100
have been capable
of supporting life.

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:39.603
So, the goal for human
exploration of Mars is,

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:43.207
therefore, compelling and
very easy to articulate.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.143
It is to send humans
to the planet to learn

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.411
if life ever took hold there.

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:50.581
This is a goal worthy of a
great national space program.

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.317
So, a guiding principal
in designing

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:54.718
our nation's lunar exploration

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:57.688
should be that
it also simultaneously

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:58.889
lays the groundwork

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.392
for the still more
challenging goal

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:03.027
of sending humans to Mars.

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:05.429
And at the same time
as humans and their robot

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.964
helpers focus
on the Moon and Mars,

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.465
more advanced robotic missions

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.701
can press deeper
into the solar system.

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:12.870
Important targets
include the ocean world

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.904
to the outer solar system,

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:16.907
especially Europa,
a moon of Jupiter

00:41:16.907 --> 00:41:19.210
that appears to have
a deep ocean of liquid water

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.378
that might be capable
of supporting life today.

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:26.116
New technologies also now
allow return of samples

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:27.985
from a wide range
of planetary bodies.

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.654
These include Mars and comets,

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.723
and this allows us to bring
the full capability

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.425
of Earth's best laboratories

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.726
to bear on the solar system's

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:37.394
most important
scientific questions.

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:42.166
Now, a compelling program
of scientific space exploration

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.500
of the Moon, Mars,

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.637
and beyond will be
neither easy nor inexpensive.

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.241
Committed international partners
really can make an important

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.543
contribution
to an American-led program.

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:56.714
But more importantly, commercial
enterprises in the United States

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:59.850
can partner with the government
to spur innovation

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.352
and reduce cost to the taxpayer

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.454
while adding value
to the program.

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:06.457
The scientific exploration
capabilities offered

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.293
by potential
commercial partners, to me,

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:10.995
represents the most important

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:13.497
and enabling space
development in recent years.

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.267
Thank you for the opportunity
to address this council,

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.668
and I look forward
to the discussion to come.

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:26.343
(applause)

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.411
The Vice President:
Thank you, Dr. Squyres.

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:30.981
And Mr. John Vellinger
of Techshot is recognized.

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:33.250
John Vellinger:
Vice President Pence,

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.253
distinguished members of
the National Space Council,

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.155
it's an honor to appear
before you here today

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:39.890
at the White House.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.926
I'd like to describe
how Techshot,

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:45.362
the company I cofounded
in Indiana nearly 30 years ago,

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:48.966
is an innovative engine
that uses space

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:52.169
to help make life
better here on the Earth

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.772
while also enabling
deep space exploration.

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:58.142
One of our most
exciting projects

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:01.111
focuses on 3-D
bioprinting in space

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:03.247
with the goal of
manufacturing human tissues

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.682
for patients here no Earth.

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:09.687
Right now we are building the
Techshot BioFabrication Facility

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.256
which will launch to the
International Space Station

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.024
early next year.

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.327
We will start with
simpler tissues,

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:20.164
such as patches that can
help heal damaged hearts,

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.967
and steadily increase
in complexity

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:26.337
until we are biomanufacturing
whole organs from space.

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:30.040
The bioprinter may also
play a critical role

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.575
in deep space exploration

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:34.678
where it could be used
to make food items,

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:37.081
or function as
a compounding pharmacy,

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:40.517
enabling the remote formulation
of drugs optimized

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:42.653
for each crew member.

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:44.455
Besides our own use
of the system,

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.256
we will also allow
others to use it.

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:50.160
It will join our catalogue
of Techshot-developed equipment

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.929
currently onboard he station,

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.931
which we provide
as a commercial service.

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:59.169
For example, researchers from
Eli Lily, Novartis, and UCLA

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:02.673
have used our bone densitometer
X-ray machine in space

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.509
to study new drug treatments

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:08.612
for osteoporosis
and muscle-wasting diseases,

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:12.916
both of which affect people
here on the Earth and crews

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:15.152
in deep space during
long-duration missions.

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:18.489
Astronaut Terry Virts
actually got to operate our bone

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.657
densitometer on
the International Space Station.

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.459
So, thank you, sir.

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.727
I believe that NASA and its

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.596
Commercial Space
Utilization Program

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.466
and the Center for the
Advancement of Science in Space

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:32.436
are successfully
increasing demand

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:35.773
for low Earth orbit
and commercial space services.

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:38.175
And Techshot is providing
many of the picks

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.078
and shovels
that researchers are using

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:44.415
in the 21st century
goldrush to space.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.653
Beyond the commercialization
of low Earth orbit,

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.789
our contributions
to exploration

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:54.625
currently focus on other
new technologies

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:57.628
that enable mission
success into deep space.

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:00.764
Techshot is prototyping for NASA

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.333
a machine we call
the Techshot FabLab,

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:06.437
which is capable of 3-D
manufacturing metals,

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.005
ceramics, plastics, and more.

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:11.842
It can even print complex
electronic assemblies.

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:14.211
If the agency
likes our approach,

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:16.680
the technology will be
refined for testing

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.682
aboard the
International Space Station

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.651
and eventually deployment aboard

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.719
the Lunar Orbital
Platform-Gateway

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.621
that the NASA administrator
just mentioned.

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.724
Techshot's FabLab
will also be used

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.293
in austere environments
here on Earth,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.462
such as onboard submarines

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:34.298
that must remain submerged
for months at a time.

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:38.635
President Trump,
Vice President Pence,

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:40.671
under your leadership
the United States

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:44.274
is entering an unprecedented
golden age of space flight,

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:47.611
which is presenting
multiple opportunities

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:50.848
to advance global
American competitiveness.

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:54.418
Techshot is proud to be
playing a critical role

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:56.954
in this unique time
in space history.

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.823
For this opportunity,
I thank you.

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.959
(applause)

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.961
The Vice President:
Good job.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.801
Well, thank you to
all of our panelists.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:15.405
I will begin by asking
one of our panelists to amplify.

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:18.308
And then I'll go to General
Dunford for a question

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:24.715
and then to our Deputy Assistant
Chief Technology Officer

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:25.816
of the United States, Michael,

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:27.151
and any other members
of the panel.

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.721
Let me start with
Dr. Squyres, if I may.

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.190
You said you're a robot guy.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.991
Steve Squyres:
Yes, sir.

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:35.993
The Vice President:
And we already knew that.

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.896
Steve Squyres:
(laughs)

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.831
The Vice President:
But I'm really fascinated

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.232
at the way

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.734
you described an appreciation.

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.269
It's not -- in your mind,

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.271
it seems that
we have gotten away

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:49.740
from human space exploration

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.209
and the President's
vision and directive

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.510
is to return America

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:56.547
to a preeminent role
of space exploration

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.081
of the Moon and Mars,
as you described.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:04.354
How important is it for us,
in your mind again?

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.657
And I know you addressed this,

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.960
but I'd love for you
to amplify the point that we,

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.229
even while we continue
to develop

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:14.198
all these robotic technologies,

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:19.002
that human space exploration
could be central

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:22.439
to what we do on the Moon,
and on Mars, and beyond.

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.574
Steve Squyres:
It's tremendously important.

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.609
If I may, let me tell you
a very brief story.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.545
When we were first developing
the Mars exploration rovers,

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:30.914
we had a robotic precursor rover

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.583
that we could take out
into the Mojave Desert.

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.152
And I was out there,
and we were operating the rover,

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:36.620
and the rover broke down.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.789
And so, we had a little
time on our hands.

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:42.226
I had a bunch of very capable
field geologists with me.

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.194
And so, I sent them off
and I said,

00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:46.630
"Go do some geologizing, okay?"

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.099
And I sat there with
a stopwatch and a notebook.

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.567
Didn't tell them
what I was doing.

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.569
And I watched as
they would look around,

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.639
walk over to a rock,
pick it up, break it open,

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:57.507
and look at it
with their hand lens.

00:47:57.507 --> 00:48:00.143
And I timed how long
it took them to do that.

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:03.880
What our magnificent state
of the art robots,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.017
like that one the model of which
is on the table in front of you,

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:11.221
can do in a day, these people
were doing in about 30 seconds.

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.256
Okay?

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:14.391
So, humans offer far,

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:18.161
far, far greater
capability than robots,

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.863
I believe, ever will.

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:23.166
The other thing is that humans
have a capability to inspire

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.669
that is tremendously
important, okay?

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:29.439
I grew up in the '60s and '70s
like everybody else on my team

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:32.676
watching Mercury, Gemini,
Apollo on T.V.

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.878
and dreaming of sending
spaceships to Mars someday.

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:36.546
And now we do.

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:38.248
And so, I think that capability

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:40.150
to use

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.052
uniquely human talents
to explore

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:46.256
and to inspire other humans
to follow their dreams

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.659
is something that is just
fundamentally important.

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:49.593
The Vice President:
That's great.

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.229
And our next panel will be
three courageous astronauts.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.998
We'll hear more from them
about just that topic.

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:56.633
But I thought I'd give
a robot guy (laughs)

00:48:56.633 --> 00:49:00.904
a chance to talk about how
important human exploration is.

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.173
General Dunford?

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.441
General Dunford:
Hey, thanks, Mr. Vice President.

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.143
My question is
for Mr. Vellinger.

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:09.346
The Defense Department
is partnered on bioprinting

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:11.415
and biomanufacturing
with obvious interest

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.983
for our wounded warriors.

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:15.552
And so, you're comments
kind of caught my attention.

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:18.188
What are the advantages
of doing bioprinting

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:19.923
and biomanufacturing in space?

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:22.059
The implications
for maybe the speed

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.660
with which we can approach that?

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.528
There's a lot of promise.

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.797
And of course, academic
institutions, and so forth.

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:28.965
But we haven't
necessarily been able

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:31.068
to deliver it
at scale to date.

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:31.902
John Vellinger: Great question.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.003
Thank you, sir.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:35.339
In space, we have
a unique opportunity

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.307
because of microgravity.

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.343
Here on the ground
when we bioprint,

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.578
we have to actually include
a scaffold structure

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:43.480
into the tissue
that you're printing.

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.049
In space, you don't
have to do that

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.818
because you don't have gravity.

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:51.088
So, you can use a lower
viscous bioink material

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.591
which helps cells
vascularize easier in space.

00:49:55.092 --> 00:50:01.098
So basically, you eliminate what
actually causes more difficulty

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:02.699
to do bioprinting
on the ground.

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:06.203
You eliminate that process
when you go to microgravity.

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:09.106
And you have the opportunity
to create different structures

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:11.541
that can vascularize and help,

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.610
you know, human beings
here on Earth

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.045
with tissues and organs.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:19.116
General Dunford:
Thanks.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:21.451
The Vice President:
Michael, go right ahead.

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:21.952
Deputy Assistant Kratsios:

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:23.253
Great, thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:25.555
Just to build on that,
Mr. Vellinger, just a follow-up.

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:29.526
I mean, we see a pretty
incredible potential

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:32.596
for pharmaceutical
and medical breakthroughs

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:35.265
made possible through research
in low Earth orbit.

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:37.134
I guess the question
for us on stage here

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:40.437
is what can we as a government
be doing better

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:43.974
to encourage and foster
more of that research

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:46.543
and expediate
the ultimate fruits

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.844
of this incredible research?

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:49.413
John Vellinger:
Thank you, sir.

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:52.582
I think access
to space is important.

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:55.852
The repeatability to be able
to do these projects

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.621
more often is very,
very important.

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:00.891
Being able to have
the ability to interact

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.059
with the crew,
the astronauts,

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.195
to be able to advance
the technology

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.798
and work within real time
is really important.

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.267
And so, I think, you know,

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:13.637
interaction with the crew,
access to space,

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.038
and just support
of the technology.

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:20.410
The Vice President:
That's great.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.712
Any other members of the panel?

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.247
Jim?

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:24.981
Administrator Bridenstine:
Thank you, sir.

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.250
I couldn't let Dr. Prockter
go without a question.

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:32.255
So, we know that -- based on
what NASA has already done --

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:35.325
we understand that Mars
used to have an ocean.

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:35.926
Louise Prockter:
(affirmative)

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.060
Administrator Bridenstine: 
Potentially as big as two-thirds

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.496
of Mars was covered by water.

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.665
We know that it used
to have a magnetosphere.

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:44.267
And we know that it used
to have a thick atmosphere.

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:47.904
And we know that at some
point billions of years ago

00:51:47.904 --> 00:51:49.239
all of that changed.

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.808
And now it is seemingly barren.

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:55.445
We also know --
although not definitely barren.

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:57.881
Hopefully, we'll be able
to find some biosignatures.

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:01.117
We also know,
if you look at Venus,

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:03.787
it's experiencing runaway
green house effects.

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.689
Can you share with us?

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.791
As a NASA administrator,

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.793
I hear a lot that every dollar

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:12.062
we spend studying other planets

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:14.931
is a dollar we don't spend
studying our own planet,

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.766
which I believe is
critically important as well.

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:19.603
Can you share
how important it is?

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.638
Or what we can learn
by studying the Moon?

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.206
What can we learn
about our own planet?

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.674
What can we learn
by studying Mars?

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:26.910
What can we learn
about our own planet?

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.378
Louise Prockter:
Yeah, and actually I would

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:29.913
completely disagree
with that statement

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:32.215
that every dollar spent
exploring other planets

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:34.851
is not a dollar spent
exploding the Earth.

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:36.386
Everything we learn
about the solar system

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:38.054
tells us something
about our Earth.

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:42.459
You can think of the solar
system as a giant laboratory.

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:44.594
If you want to know what happens
if you change gravity,

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:45.762
you can go to
a different planet.

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.696
If you want to know what happens

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:49.966
if the climate runs
out of control,

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:51.501
you can go to Venus.

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:53.637
So, every time we explore
another body

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.772
we learn something
about the conditions

00:52:55.772 --> 00:52:57.974
that make our own planet
so very special

00:52:57.974 --> 00:52:59.843
and so hospitable to life.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:03.313
Particularly with --
the other thing about planets,

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:05.215
they don't have trees.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.316
They don't have
buildings on them.

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:08.251
You know, a lot of
the surfaces are pristine.

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:10.320
Or they have evolved
in certain ways

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.455
that are similar
to our own planet.

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:15.158
So, essentially
everything we learn

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:17.260
throughout the solar system
and also from small bodies

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.796
and from other solar systems.

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.965
Now we're starting to look at
axillary planets and understand

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:22.866
again

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:25.302
what makes the conditions
just right for our Earth

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:28.538
to be where it is in this
very special place and time.

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.941
So, it's really a very
cost-effective way

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.577
of looking back in time
at our own Earth

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.045
and understanding
how we got here.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.782
Administrator Bridenstine:
Thank you.

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:41.451
The Vice President:
Well, join me in thanking

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:43.453
Dr. Louise Prockter

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.655
and Dr. Steve Squyres,
and Mr. John Vellinger.

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.557
Thank you so much
for your testimony today.

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:48.992
Very helpful and very well done.

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:51.161
(applause)

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.163
Well done.

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:59.469
Next, I'd like to invite
our next panel to step forward.

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:04.107
We're honored to be joined today
by three American astronauts.

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:09.012
And we'll now, having spoken
about the interrelationship

00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:12.115
between scientific exploration
and human exploration,

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:14.651
now we will talk about
getting your perspective

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:18.254
on how we accelerate human
exploration of the solar system.

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:21.791
Before I do that, I thought
it was noteworthy today,

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:27.931
June the 18th, to acknowledge
that it was 35 years ago today,

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:33.103
on June 18th, 1983,
that Sally Ride made history

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.606
when she stepped on
to the Space Shuttle Challenger

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:40.944
and became the first American
woman to venture into space.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.545
Sally Ride is an American hero

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.015
whose courage
and pioneering spirit

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.851
continue to inspire
countless young Americans

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:50.387
across this country
to pursue their dreams.

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.054
Earlier this year,

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:53.123
the U.S. Postal Service
unveiled Sally Ride

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.525
Forever as a stamp,

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:59.496
and I know all of you
join me today

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:01.498
in honoring her memory

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:04.401
and celebrating her legacy
at this meeting

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:09.639
of the National Space Council.

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:15.612
(applause)

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:21.051
As I mentioned, we are joined
by three exceptional Americans,

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:25.555
heroes all, members
of the Astronaut Corps.

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.890
And we are grateful.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.825
Grateful for your service
to the country and grateful

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:31.895
for you bringing your
insights with us today.

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.731
And they're not
the only astronauts here,

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:36.266
but they're the only ones

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.234
that haven't been
introduced much yet.

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:39.836
So, let me do that.

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:42.672
Our first panelists
are Colonel Eileen Collins,

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.708
the first female
pilot and commander

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:47.444
of a space shuttle mission.

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.546
Colonel Collins, it's an honor
to have you here today.

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:51.548
Thank you so much.

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:56.653
(applause)

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:59.122
Our second panelist is
colonel Terry Virts,

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.657
a veteran of the shuttle program

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:03.793
and a former commander of
the International Space Station.

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:06.196
Colonel Virts, thank you
so much for your leadership

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.198
and your insights today.

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:12.469
(applause)

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:17.774
And Dr. Scott Parazynski
is a veteran of five flights

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:19.309
on the space shuttle

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:22.912
and a deeply respected member
of the Astronaut Corps.

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:25.115
Thank you so much for
your presence here today.

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:30.019
(applause)

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:33.356
With that, we'll ask
each of the panelists

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:34.924
to share for a few minutes.

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:38.294
And then we'll move on to
questions for this final panel.

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.863
And Colonel Collins,
you're recognized.

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:47.103
Colonel Collins:
Good afternoon.

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.872
And tying, Mr. Vice President

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.974
and members of
the National Space Council.

00:56:50.974 --> 00:56:52.776
It's really an honor to be here.

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:55.178
Thank you for the invitation.

00:56:55.178 --> 00:57:00.183
Scott, and Terry, and I are part
of a group of about 500 people

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.018
who have flown in space.

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:06.055
We have had
the unusual perspective

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.724
of viewing the Earth from orbit.

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:11.494
We've lived aboard the space
shuttle and the space station.

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:15.665
We've conducted
rendezvous space walks,

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:18.635
science experiments,
and robotics.

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.738
We saw our planet from
a different perspective

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:25.241
in an environment
that forced us to think

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:28.478
creatively about
how things are done

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:29.746
and what things can become.

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:34.050
So, I became interested in space
flight at a young age

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.053
when I first learned about the
Gemini and Apollo astronauts.

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:39.255
They inspired me
to become an explorer.

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:42.158
And eventually
to join the Air Force

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.194
and become a pilot
and a test pilot.

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:48.031
As I look back over the decades
of human space flight,

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:53.303
the daring launches of Mercury
and the incredible bravery

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.904
of the men
that flew to the Moon,

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:58.575
I'm so proud of what the
United States has accomplished.

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.311
Some say that we could
have done more.

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.579
We could've been to Mars by now.

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:06.249
But what is important now
is that we have a strategy

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.852
and we're looking forward,
we stick to our plan,

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:10.787
we don't quit.

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:15.491
And of course, we remember
the lessons learned

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:17.327
from the mistakes of the past.

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:21.064
We must keep our missions
as simple as possible.

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:25.501
We must keep the costs
as low as possible.

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.005
Occasionally I have to
remind myself of an old

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.974
saying that I heard
from the Apollo program.

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.277
Better is the enemy
of good enough.

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:38.181
So, it doesn't all have
to be the latest technology.

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:42.652
But it does have to be safe,
reliable, and mission focused.

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.288
So, I'll mention
a few priorities

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:47.023
for the future
of human space flight.

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:49.125
First, reestablishing
our country's ability

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:51.594
to launch astronauts
from within the United States.

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:53.529
It's been almost seven years now
since we last saw

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.998
an astronaut launch
out of Florida.

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:56.866
Now, for safety reasons,

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:59.035
I certainly don't think
this should ever be rushed.

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.803
We're on a good track now.

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:03.506
But I believe we need
to keep an eye on the future

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.575
and have a future strategy

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:08.311
to avoid us getting back
in this situation again.

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.948
Second, I support
the long-term goal

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.783
of landing astronauts on Mars.

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:15.785
For this to be successful,

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:18.154
any critical equipment
that's destined to Mars

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:21.457
should be tested first
on the surface of the Moon.

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.460
In my written statement
I reference a study

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.262
from the National
Academy of Science

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.932
entitled "Pathways
to Exploration."

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:33.269
Now in that report they cite
10 critical technologies,

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:34.604
and I'll mention the top three:

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:38.875
Mars entry, descent,
and landing; radiation safety;

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:41.644
and power and propulsion.

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:44.414
But another notable technology
is the life support equipment,

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:48.318
which includes systems
that recycle air and water.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.453
Now, these are being tested
right now in the space station.

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:57.593
But the Moon provides a more
advanced test environment

00:59:57.593 --> 00:59:59.162
due to it's similarity to Mars

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:03.166
in radiation environment
and in dust.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.837
And third -- this is
almost a no-brainer --

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:10.840
but I support
the commercial partners

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.376
and the international partners.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.712
This is really essential
for our space program.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.815
And by the way, I believe --
I personally believe --

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.884
that space tourism someday
will be hugely successful.

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.188
And finally, just as
I was inspired

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.789
by the Apollo astronauts,

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.224
a new generation of young people

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:30.893
will want to study science
and engineering in an effort

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.295
to be part of this
great journey.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.865
And they will also wonder
what is out there?

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:39.569
What discoveries
are waiting for us?

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.304
And can I go?

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:53.082
(applause)

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.117
The Vice President:
Thank you so much,

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.385
Colonel Collins.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:57.086
Great words.

01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:59.255
And Colonel Terry Virts
is recognized.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:00.890
Thank you for being here.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.324
Colonel Virts:
Thank you, sir.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.226
Mr. Vice President
and distinguished members

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:06.095
of the National Space Council,
thank you for inviting me today.

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:07.463
It's an honor.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:10.299
For several decades, America's 
human space program was focused

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.501
on low Earth orbit.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.837
And for years, we have not had
a clear long-term vision

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.140
or goal for human
space exploration.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.975
However, these are
exciting times

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.944
and we now have the opportunity
to clearly define such a vision.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.281
I believe that we should use
the Apollo model

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.649
as an example
of how to proceed.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.752
However, Apollo
was actually the sum

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:32.121
of three distinct
programs, as you know.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.824
Mercury, and then Gemini,
and then finally Apollo.

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.827
Project Mercury demonstrated
that flying in space

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:39.562
was possible.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.798
Gemini developed and
tested the technologies

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:44.400
that we would need to go
to the Moon eventually.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.169
And Apollo was, of course,
the final mission.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.939
And that Apollo mission was
very clear to land on the Moon

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.374
and return safely to Earth.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:55.244
The President's recent Space
Policy Directive-1 calls

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:58.114
for returning to the Moon
to establish a foundation

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.383
to eventually enable
missions to Mars,

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.285
a plan that
I strongly agree with.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.521
Today, our top priority
needs to be turning

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:09.425
this high-level vision
into very specific goals

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.094
so that we can plan and execute

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.528
an architecture
that will achieve them.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:16.432
Using the Mercury, then Gemini,
and then Apollo paradigm,

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:19.102
the ISS has already
fulfilled the Mercury role,

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.472
demonstrating that humans
can live and work in space

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:23.706
for extended periods of time.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.210
And now is the time
to establish a program

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.744
that will fill
the role of Gemini,

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.115
developing and testing
the technologies

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.484
that we will need to return
to the lunar surface

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:35.751
and eventually fly to Mars.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.155
Unfortunately,
the recently proposed

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.790
Lunar Orbital
Platform-Gateway

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:42.625
does not fill
that role of Gemini.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.927
It essentially calls
for building

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:48.097
another orbital space station,
a skill that my colleagues

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.200
and I have already
demonstrated on ISS.

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.769
Gateway will only slow us down,

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.371
taking time and precious dollars

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:58.574
away from the goal of returning
to the lunar surface

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.643
and eventually flying to Mars.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.147
I believe that we need
to refocus our efforts

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.415
to align with these
long-term goals.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.684
The next steps that
we take should leverage

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.453
the international partnerships

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.989
that we have built over
the past two decades on ISS.

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.658
And of course, they should
also take advantage

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.727
of our significant
commercial capabilities

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.465
that have demonstrated very
recently a level of innovation

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.966
and agility

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.668
that government simply
does not possess.

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:30.907
And most importantly,
any future exploration plan

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.208
must be bipartisan.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:37.013
Unless these efforts are truly
bipartisan from the beginning,

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.016
they will be doomed
to eventual cancellation.

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.286
You see, getting back
to the Moon

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:46.389
and eventually to Mars does
not depend on rocket science.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:47.924
It depends on political science.

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.726
Thank you, sir.

01:03:50.726 --> 01:04:00.203
(applause)

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.038
The Vice President:
Nice, I'll come back to that.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.040
(laughter)

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:04.874
Great statement.

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.609
Thank you so much, Colonel.

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:11.080
And Dr. Scott Parazynski
is recognized.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.548
Thank you so much
for being with us.

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:13.449
Scott Parazynski:
Mr. Vice President

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.850
and distinguished
members of the council,

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.586
thank you so much
for the honor and opportunity

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.221
to share my views
with you here today.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.456
And it's also great to share
the panel with my good friends,

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:22.091
Terry and Eileen.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.993
I grew up in the shadow
of the pilot program.

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.629
My father actually
worked to help design

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:28.464
and test the mighty
Saturn V boosters

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.833
that went to the Moon
in the late '60s, early '70s.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.636
And so, I never grew out
of that boyhood dream

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.071
of one day flying in space.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.772
And it turned okay
for me, I guess.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.642
I feel so fortunate to have
been born at a time

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.912
and a place when such a lofty
trajectory was possible.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.148
As a kid, I wanted
nothing more than

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.484
to set the first
boot prints on Mars.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.753
But I'm fiercely proud of the
work that my NASA coworkers

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:54.757
and I did to help the stage
for this inevitable journey.

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.293
It's an incredibly exciting time

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.694
to be engaged in
the space business

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:00.663
in what I call
the barnstorming era

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.064
of commercial
human space flight.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.967
With so many pioneering
American companies

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.669
leading with innovations
and investments.

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:11.207
That said, the space age
2.0 needs to overcome

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:13.409
some enormous challenges
if we aim to be more than

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:14.810
just transient lunar

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.646
and Martian guests.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.948
We'll need to engage the public
in very different ways

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:20.182
to sustain their support.

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.053
Building long-duration
planetary habitats

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:28.424
and shielding them from the
devasting radiation exposure,

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.694
not to mention developing the
technologies to extract water

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:33.462
from the near absolute
zero temperatures

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.097
of the South Pole of the Moon

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.199
will challenge engineers
to their limits.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:40.703
Living off of the land
in self-sustaining colonies

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:43.472
there will help us become even
better stewards of planet Earth,

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.676
something that deeply
concerns young people today.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.745
Based on rigorous
peer-reviewed science,

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:50.980
they understand the impact

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.581
humanity's having
on their oceans,

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.418
coral reefs, atmosphere,
and rain forests.

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.986
And they want to do
something about it.

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.888
They have a vested interest
in the health

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:01.057
and well-being of Earth
and can really appreciate

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:04.093
the value of pursuing
planetary exploration

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.262
as a means to understand
the future of their home planet.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:09.865
Moreover, many in
the general public,

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:11.567
and especially young people,

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.602
are as excited about space
as I was as a kid.

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:16.038
But the possibilities
are even wider.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:19.875
It's still incredibly cool
to work at NASA, of course.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:23.279
But they can also now work
at SpaceX, and Blue Origin,

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.880
and Boeing, and Virgin Galactic,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.415
and many other
wonderful companies.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.951
In the near term, I believe
that there will be

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.720
tremendous opportunities
to engage

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.154
and inspire the public

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:35.391
with the establishment of
a significant lunar outpost akin

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.293
to the South Pole Station
in Antarctica.

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.297
Owing to political realities
since Apollo, however,

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.733
I'm frustrated with
our national failure

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.134
to comment to a sustained,

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.002
bold exploration
beyond Earth orbit.

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:49.572
Sadly, we could
probably stack up

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:51.674
all the NASA studies
that've been done over the years

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:56.746
on NASA's next steps into
to space and attain lunar orbit.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:02.017
I believe that the way you
climb an enormous mountain,

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:02.785
like Mount Everest,

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.621
which is somewhat that I also
know a thing or two about,

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:10.626
is to take the long view,
prepare to your utmost,

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.561
and then take it one
rope length at a time.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.097
Sometimes even one
breathless step at a time.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.700
Understanding that it'll be
harder than you ever imagined,

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.603
it'll likely take longer
and cost more, too.

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:23.939
I propose a true
decadal approach

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.841
to ambitious human
space flight goals,

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.344
similar to that taken by
NASA's space science community.

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:32.214
I suggest to you that this
human space flight decadal plan

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.717
needs to be free
of appropriations earmarks

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.952
to particular space
centers or companies.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:40.122
But rather latched
to the long-term goal

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.258
of achieving lunar
and then Martian presence.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.261
Set the goals,
then let NASA choose

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.762
and fund
the very best solutions,

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.365
irrespective of which
congressional district

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.933
the work is conducted in.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.135
Measure and reward successes.

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.870
Acknowledge and cut failures.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.606
But then keep moving
forward towards the prize.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.943
So in closing, I just
suggest to you

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:02.545
that one of the greatest
accomplishments

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.847
of the International
Space Station program

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.215
has been bringing
together nations

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.850
for the common good of humanity,

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.086
pooling resources
and the best minds,

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:12.655
and bringing the world
closer together.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.691
I'm convinced that the first
Martians have already been born

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.794
and they're already preparing
for humanity's next giant leap.

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:21.130
It's my greatest wish
that this journey

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.898
will be led by Americans.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.967
But I also hope that we'll take
those first steps in peace

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.636
and partnership with colleagues
from around the world.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.638
Thank you very much.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:37.913
(applause)

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.315
The Vice President:
Thank you, Scott.

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:40.749
Very inspiring words.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.452
Did you say one
rope length at a time?

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.787
Is that?

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.791
Very sage.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.460
It strikes me that
each of the panelists

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:56.599
talked about the importance
of not only a plan

01:08:57.433 --> 01:09:01.604
but the ability to sustain that
plan over a long period of time.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:06.876
And Terry I was
struck by your words,

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.878
but the wisdom
of your words that said

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:11.981
this is as much about
political science

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.449
as it is about rocket science,

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:18.354
in terms of getting America,
as the President has announced,

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.723
back to the Moon
and then onto Mars.

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:26.362
And Eileen, you mentioned
those three questions.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.763
I remember the last one.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.398
What is out there?

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:30.900
What were the three
questions again?

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.203
Colonel Collins:
What is out there?

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.305
What discoveries
are left for us to make?

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.706
And can I go?

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.741
(laughter)

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:39.575
The Vice President:
Yeah.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:40.809
I know the answer
to third one for me.

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:41.477
So.

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.678
(laughter)

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:46.649
I guess I'd throw the question
out to the panel as a whole.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:51.820
And that is other than
your inspiring example

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.355
in your words today,

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:57.326
which will make their way across
the country from this forum,

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.665
how would you advise
the National Space Council

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:05.935
to continue to build
the momentum

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:10.539
behind a renewed
commitment to America

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:14.276
leading in space exploration

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:18.347
and, particularly, in human
exploration of the moon and Mars

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.516
and beyond.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:21.016
Eileen?
Colonel Collins:

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.551
Well, thank you, sir,
for the question.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.054
I think we can
all chime in on that.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.755
But I would think, initially,

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:29.224
we have got to get the support
of the American people

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:31.760
by getting the message
out to people.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.365
And we all speak at schools
and colleges and Rotary Clubs.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:39.201
People love the space mission.

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:41.103
And it's something
that brings us together.

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:42.371
And not only students show up,

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.773
but parents, teachers;
people come.

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:48.143
If we, on the National
Space Council, can get --

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:53.716
somehow use the media --
I say the "mass media"

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.484
because we want to get
our message out --

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.153
we all hear our message.

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:01.423
You know, here in this room
and within the space industry,

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.358
we all hear ourselves,

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.493
but we don't want to be
just echoing our own remarks.

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:05.894
We want to get that out.

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.831
So, one of the things I think
we can do is work very hard

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.933
on connecting
with mass media.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.436
Colonel Virts:
Yes, sir, I think --

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.772
I agree with Eileen,
but I think we really need --

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:19.842
and it's probably your job
to set specific goals

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.176
of exactly what
we're going to do

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.646
so that we know
what we're doing.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.714
And, then, if we can make
the bipartisan, like I said.

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:27.549
Otherwise, it will be
on that stack

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:31.754
of what NASA's happened
in the past few decades.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.222
And another really
important thing,

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.890
if you remember
in the early '90s,

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.593
the Space Station passed
Congress by one vote.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.561
And the reason it did was

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:41.096
because it was an
international program.

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:43.065
And that was kind of --

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.333
we weren't allowed to cancel it

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:45.601
because we had commitments.

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.003
And, I think, making that
international commitment,

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.538
just by the nature
of our democracy,

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:52.441
it's very easy
for things to change.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.243
And having an
international partnership

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:57.346
adds a little stability
that doesn't make it nice,

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.881
or it doesn't make it
less expensive,

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:01.884
it actually makes it
either possible or not.

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.886
I think, if we don't have
international partners,

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.388
just looking into the future,

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:08.824
I can foresee things
being much easier

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:12.194
to cancel than they would be
given a strong partnership.

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.496
And using what our
international partners

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.866
can contribute can actually make
the project less expensive

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.535
and, you know, more successful.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:24.373
Scott Parazynski:
I think taking the long-view,

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.742
having a long-term
established goal

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.411
and inexorably
working towards it

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.815
is something that needs
to be communicated well.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:35.384
And, I think, young people
will understand

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.286
that there is a place for them.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.822
And I would just differ
slightly to say

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.424
that I think space
exploration is nonpartisan;

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.727
I think it's something
that's in the American spirit

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.395
and the human spirit to explore.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:50.599
And if you go to any school,
any community,

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:53.535
there's a strong support
for continuing

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.671
to press the boundaries
in exploration

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.973
because it benefits
all of our walks of life.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.477
The Vice President:
Well, I thank you for that.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:05.514
I'm going to recognize
Secretary Chao for a question,

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:07.182
but I --

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.884
would all of your agree
the importance

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.419
of having our own platforms

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.222
to be able to reach space?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.624
When you see the excitement
being generated out

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.259
of the commercial
space industry,

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:20.562
but very soon the United States
will have the ability

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.132
to put courageous astronauts

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.701
like you back in space
on our own platforms.

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:29.972
Is that -- do you see that
as an important part

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.241
of generating the connection

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:36.011
between the popular support
across the country

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.780
and the reality of support

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.782
that translates

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:44.920
into a sustainable commitment

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.122
to leadership in space?

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.690
Colonel Virts:
I think we all agree (laughter)

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.159
very strongly
by that statement, yeah.

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.661
American leadership
and the world looks to us,

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.596
and, you know, Europe
and other countries

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:55.931
look to America
for that leadership.

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.367
And I think we need
to lead, for sure.

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.602
It's a big part
of what America is.

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.771
The Vice President:
Right, good.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.740
Okay, Secretary Chao.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.407
Secretary Chao:
Gosh darn it,

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.276
the Vice President
asked my question.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.076
(laughter)

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.812
But, I have another one,

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.947
and that as a former
Secretary of Labor,

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:15.250
I'm always very concerned
about workforce development.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.821
So, Dr. Parazynski, there's been
a lot of discussion about,

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:21.523
you know, the future
of STEM studies --

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.291
Scott Parazynski:
Yes.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.458
Secretary Chao:
-- in our nation.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:26.728
How are we on the right path?

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.130
Do you think we're doing better?

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.699
Or do you see the need
for any course corrections

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.434
and how to get more
young people excited?

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.236
Scott Parazynski:
When I talk to young people,

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.604
I tell them that it's important

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.739
to learn a couple
of foreign languages;

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.875
and not the traditional
languages that you might expect.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.877
I tell them that the two
most important languages

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.646
that they need to learn
are math and science.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:48.584
To be competitive in the future
industries in robotics,

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.385
as Steve is engaged in,

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:54.089
but in so many different aspects
of our future society

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:56.625
and technological growth.

01:14:56.625 --> 01:15:01.763
And so, that's the message
that I would put forward.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.700
Colonel Collins:
Could I add something to that?

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.235
Secretary Chao:
Of course, Colonel Collins.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.669
Colonel Collins:
I think, maybe,

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:08.570
the federal government

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.806
does help students go out

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.140
and get a college education

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:16.678
with whatever degree
they would like.

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.614
But if we could
incentivize them,

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.183
financially,
in some of the programs

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.887
to go towards math
and science, technology,

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.588
engineering,

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:27.422
I think that would help.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.925
Secretary Chao:

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:31.493
Mr. Vice President,
before I hand it over,

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:34.930
I want to that all these
three for their service

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.832
to our country,
how exciting.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.834
Thank you.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:46.541
(applause)

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.510
The Vice President:
Secretary Ross.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.844
Secretary Ross:
Thank you.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.313
I'd like to ask
each of the panelists,

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:55.751
how could we better facilitate
commercial participation

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:58.053
in the activities
you're describing?

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.721
Each of you talked
about the need

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:03.325
for partnerships
and collaboration,

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.694
are there one or two
specific things

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.696
that government
could do better

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:10.165
to encourage
commercial cooperation?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.601
Scott Parazynski:
I can start.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:15.771
One of the things
that I've known

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.906
from my prior life in industry

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:21.677
is just the difficulties through
the federal acquisition process.

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.211
It's a very long pathway

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.646
and if there are ways
to streamline

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:27.049
that to make it
more entrepreneurial,

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.884
quick turnaround,

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.852
as I think one of
the prior panelists said.

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.955
It's important to have
access to space,

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:35.190
to be able to fail,
to get back up and go again.

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:39.094
And so, we need to have
frequent access to space

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:41.897
and, I think, one of the ways
to make that possible

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:46.468
is to figure out ways to shorten
the acquisition process.

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:48.804
Colonel Virts:

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.806
Yes, sir, I'll just add,
I've got very good friends

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.441
and former crewmates
that work at

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.910
Blue Origin and SpaceX
and Boeing and other companies.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:59.514
And the speed that they can
do innovation is really amazing.

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.049
And, I think, if the
government can come up

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.853
with ways to contract with them

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:06.655
with very minimal
requirements --

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.056
there's this thing called
"requirements creep"

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:10.125
and that is the killer of all --

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:11.994
the Wright brothers
probably had to suffer

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.228
through requirements creep

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.696
(laughter)
100 years ago.

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.865
If we can figure out a way
to get those contracts made,

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.768
and let them innovate;
tell them what we want

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:22.070
and then let the companies
do the work,

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.472
I think we can get things done.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.508
And I know we're in the process
right now of doing that.

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.176
So, I think we need
to continue that process

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.812
and we'll get
to the moon and Mars

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:31.847
a lot quicker if we do that.

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:34.182
Colonel Collins:

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:36.785
Yes, sir, the NASA administrator
had mentioned earlier

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.687
about the incentives
right now that

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:42.791
NASA is giving small companies
to go to the lunar surface

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:46.294
and, you know,
starting small, small landers

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:49.064
and then building up from
there to larger landers

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:53.001
and maybe, eventually,
the human lander on the moon.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.070
So, I -- NASA's doing this now.

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.372
It's small, but I think
if it's successful,

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.907
we should expand on that

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:01.343
and give more incentives;
just turn them loose.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.178
Don't tell them,
"You have to do it exactly

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.147
this way per the requirements."

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:07.349
But tell them,
"This is the end goal,

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.184
figure out how to get there,

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:11.720
here's your financial incentive
to get you started."

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:14.222
I think that those
programs be successful.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:16.191
And, we'll keep an eye on them,
but I think we can --

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:17.826
we'll eventually
be doing more of those.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:19.995
Secretary Ross:
Well that's good,

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.430
I think it's really impressive

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.765
that you can not
only be astronauts,

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.434
but have very thoughtful views

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.002
on how commercial secretary

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:28.637
can help, thank you.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.672
The Vice President:
Very good.

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.574
Let me recognize
our NASA administrator

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:33.942
for the last question
for the panel

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.610
and then we'll move
toward wrapping up.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.913
Jim Bridenstine:
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:41.016
In the previous panel, I talked
about how some people say

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:43.518
that every dollar we spend
studying other planets

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:46.354
is a dollar we're not spending
studying our own planet.

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:49.691
Similarly, I hear frequently
that every dollar

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:52.327
we spend studying the moon
or going to the moon

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.996
or developing the technologies
and capabilities for the moon,

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:58.500
those are dollars that we're
not spending going to Mars.

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:02.938
And Colonel Collins,
I heard you very clearly say --

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:06.274
you mentioned the Pathways
Report, which, of course,

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.944
came out when I was still
serving in the Congress.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:12.481
And, of course, it was chaired
by another famous Indianan,

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.583
Mitch Daniels.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.985
And I was wondering
if you could share with us,

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:20.422
"How do you see our effort
getting to the moon enabling,

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.858
ultimately, our path
to get to Mars?"

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.294
Colonel Collins:
Well, as a former test pilot

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.964
(laughter), I believe
in the buildup approach.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:32.134
So, to get somewhere
as safe as possible,

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.768
you want to write a test plan,

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.237
and you want to have
a buildup approach.

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:38.773
So, to control what
you're doing, you test it

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.375
and then you add a variable,

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:43.078
you test it, you add
another variable, you test it.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.113
So, I think by, you know,

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.284
we can use the moon
as a stepping stone.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.922
Right now we're testing on the
Space Station which is critical.

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:57.926
But the Space Station doesn't
have dust, for example,

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:00.061
so, how do we know that
this life support equipment

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.830
isn't just going to fail

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.332
because there's too much
dust in the valves

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:07.536
or in the equipment;
the radiation environment?

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.438
So, the moon is
a stepping stone.

01:20:10.438 --> 01:20:11.506
To me, it's just critical.

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.608
If I'm going to go
to the moon and live there,

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.344
I would like to know
that this equipment

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:17.879
that's keeping me alive

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:19.514
has worked on the moon.

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:21.183
So, that's the reason
I said that.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:23.118
Jim Bridenstine:
The Pathways Report

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.753
specifically referenced the moon

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.222
as "the quickest way to get to
Mars," is that correct?

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:32.160
If I remember right, either way?

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.662
Colonel Collins: Well,
I think you're saying that.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.230
I think, yes,
that's true.

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.032
Jim Bridenstine:
Yeah.

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.034
Colonel Collins:
I do believe that.

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.970
Although, I would say,
I was thinking of --

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.806
the 10 critical technologies.

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:47.375
And I believe the vast
majority of those

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.677
can be tested on the moon.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.812
And I'm trying to remember
what they are all right now.

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:53.582
Like, for example,
one of them is the suits

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.784
that the astronauts will be
using on the surface,

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.919
got to be tested
on the surface of Mars.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:02.624
The habitats are another one;

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.826
tested on the surface
of the moon before Mars.

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:11.266
So, that's -- as far as whether
or not it's the fastest way,

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:14.736
that I would say
would be up to debate.

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:15.503
Jim Bridenstine:
Okay.

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:16.104
Colonel Collins: And it 
would need to be

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.305
studied a little bit more.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:21.243
But I would take it from
the experts that it would be,

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.246
probably, the safest way.

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:25.046
Jim Bridenstine:
Got it.

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.047
Colonel Collins:
I definitely believe

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.716
it would be the safest way.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.017
Jim Bridenstine:
Got it.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.685
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:32.120
The Vice President:
No, thank you, Jim,

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.455
thank you very much.

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.789
And join me in thanking

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:36.625
this outstanding panel
for their remarks

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.660
and also their service
to the country,

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:47.235
great job.

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:47.669
(applause)

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.938
I also wanted to mention
that these are not

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.573
the only astronauts in the room.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.209
This is an extraordinary
group of Americans,

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:58.880
but we're also joined today
by three astronauts

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.682
that I wanted to recognize.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.585
One is a member of the
Council's Advisory Group

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.154
which will be meeting
for the first time tomorrow,

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:10.191
he's flown in space four times,
walked in space seven times,

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.695
and he happens
to be from Indiana,

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.630
astronaut David Wolf is with us.

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.898
David we're honored,
please stand up.

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:23.071
(applause)

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.839
Also, the President
mentioned these two,

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.107
but they didn't
get to stand up.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.077
Jack Schmitt was
the first geologist

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:31.646
on the moon in Apollo 17,

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:33.415
a former Senator
from New Mexico,

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.549
and, Jack, I want
to promise you

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:36.551
that we're going to
put more geologists

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:37.952
and scientists on the moon.

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:41.356
Jack, please stand up and let
us thank you for your service.

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.757
Thank you, sir.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:46.461
(applause)

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:49.364
And, lastly, one of the
heroes of my youth,

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:52.200
although you may not 
like me saying that.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.035
(laughter)

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.705
He was a Gemini astronaut,

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.040
second man on the moon,
Apollo 11,

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.575
and is one of
the greatest voices

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:04.412
for getting America back
to the moon and on to Mars.

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:08.116
The incomparable Dr.
Buzz Aldrin is with us today.

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.085
Thank you, Buzz.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:18.026
(applause)

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.327
Let me, before I close,

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.196
I wanted to recognize
two members of the cabinet

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:24.032
who are with us today
for a few brief remarks

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:30.038
on what they gleaned from this
presentation and their focus.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:32.540
Dan Coats is the Director
of National Intelligence

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.641
for the United States.

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.610
And, Mr. Director, 
you're recognized.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:36.745
Director Coats: Well, 
Mr. Vice President,

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.480
thank you for the opportunity to,

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.050
first of all, the honor,
to be part of the Space Council.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:46.621
This is quite an extraordinary
experience today

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.624
with an awful lot
of promise ahead.

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:51.893
And I thank you for that
opportunity to be part of it.

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.931
I've been around long enough
to go all the way back

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.099
to the launch of Sputnik,

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:02.270
the first piece of now
debris in space.

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:05.840
Joining tens of thousands,

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.976
if not hundreds of thousands
of pieces of debris,

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:11.713
that's one of the questions
that we have to deal with.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.615
Because as an
intelligence agency,

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.617
we do develop,

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:20.455
build, launch satellites

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:22.991
and instruments into space.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:28.997
We collect from a realm
of ground, sea, air,

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.698
up to a certain altitude

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.834
and now the realm of space

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:35.470
and it's incredibly
important for us

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:39.274
because we provide information
from those collections

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.977
that provide security and safety
to the American people.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.780
And so, it's a very
essential piece.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.383
We join with General Dunford
with the military

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:50.518
in terms of providing
war fighters the need --

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.487
the intelligence they need

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.423
that can be garnered
from assets in space,

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:59.027
as well as our citizens
in our country

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:01.963
in terms of what we do up there.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.799
I could give you
some exciting examples,

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:07.235
but it's classified, 
so I can't do it.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.636
(laughter)

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.138
But just trust me;

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.040
it's something that's
absolutely essential.

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:15.343
And to be part of this effort
in joining from --

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:18.947
with the perspective from
the intelligence community

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.416
is a true privilege.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.954
I think most of us
in this room reach back

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:29.524
to that day with a launch
toward the moon.

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.393
The message that came back,

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:38.833
that was one of the most
exciting times of my lifetime.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:43.071
And I think we're now on the
cusp of moving into a new era

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.673
where young people
will be growing up

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:49.911
looking at some phenomenal
things happening in space.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:52.113
And this is a great way
to kick it off.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.815
Thank you Mr. President --
Vice President.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.283
The Vice President:
Thank you, Dan, great job.

01:25:55.283 --> 01:26:01.322
(applause)

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:03.057
The Director of the Office
of Management and Budget,

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:03.958
Mick Mulvaney.

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:04.893
Director Mulvaney:
I just wonder how often Coats

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:05.894
has used that line

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.729
about wanting to tell us
something, but not being able to

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.030
because it's classified, so --

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.031
(Laughter)

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:11.065
-- Mr. Vice President,
thank you for doing this.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.070
I always, when we do these,
the takeaways for me --

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:19.574
the aspirational concepts here,

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.476
the aspirational rhetoric
is absolutely critical;

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:22.377
there's no question about it.

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.311
There is no -- nothing --

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.280
there is nothing
more aspirational

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.748
than what we've talked
about here today.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.817
At the same point, it's very
practical analysis

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:30.351
that we're doing.

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:33.288
So, that the practical takeaways
are what the value is to me,

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:35.890
so, to have folks that
who actually are in the industry

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:38.593
and come in and challenge
us on specifics.

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.229
I think it was Colonel Virts
who said,

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:45.266
"Well, maybe the gateway
is not something

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.634
that helps us
get to Mars faster.

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:47.902
Maybe it is,
maybe it isn't."

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.771
But there's a practical
takeaway from that

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:51.873
that helps spur this debate
which we have to have.

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.542
I also heard Colonel Collins
talk about,

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.311
"keeping missions simpler,"

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.880
and trying to find technologies
that are more readily available.

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.182
Those are the practical
kind of takeaways

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:02.650
that I think are helpful to me.

01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:04.919
I also like it when people say
there's way to do it cheaper.

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.590
You all didn't say that nearly
enough, but that's okay --

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.223
(laughter)

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.091
-- we can get to
that part later.

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:11.359
So, thank you for doing it

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.328
because I do think
that at the end of the day

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:14.762
this is more than just
a group of people

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.230
getting together
and talking about something

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.032
that they all have
a common interest in;

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.601
this is actually something
that moves the ball

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:21.102
in the right direction
and I appreciate you doing it.

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:29.510
(applause)

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:30.945
The Vice President:
Well, seeing that no other

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.216
members
of the National Space Council

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:37.385
seeking recognition
let me thank you all

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:40.488
for your time and your efforts.

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:43.091
These are extraordinarily
busy people

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.828
and we also want to not only
thank the cabinet members

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.596
who are here,
but the deputy secretaries

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:50.565
and the undersecretaries

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.567
who adjoin us, as well.

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.103
Little bit of housekeeping.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.571
For National Space
Council members,

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.972
if you have an
outstanding assignment,

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.974
please work with
our executive secretary

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.210
to complete them.

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:03.845
Dr. Pace and his staff
are going to ensure

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.581
that you have what
you need to follow-up

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:09.951
on Space Policy Directive-3.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.753
And we'll be working
energetically before

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:14.288
the next Space Council
meeting to move forward.

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:17.525
With that mention,
let me invite the room

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:21.062
to thank Dr. Pace
and Jared Stout

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:23.331
for their work putting together,

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.401
for all the space content.

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:33.107
(applause)

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:35.143
You can see a rather
memorable picture of myself

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.111
and the President and the staff

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:40.048
in the National Space Council
in the Oval Office

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:42.183
when they've stopped in
to tell the President

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.851
about the plans for this
upcoming meeting

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:47.021
and our plans to have it
here at the White House.

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:51.526
And he promptly ushered them
behind the Resolute desk

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:53.895
and took a photograph
and then sat them down

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.730
for the better part
of an hour to talk about

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:58.433
(laughter) the space program
and his enthusiasm

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:00.435
was evidence again today.

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.004
Second to last,
let me thank members

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.640
of the National Space Council's
Users' Advisory Group

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.941
who are here with us today.

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:09.510
The President
recognized many of you,

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.713
but the men and women
who are gathered here

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:15.349
coming out of private
enterprise and public life

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:18.586
really represent the bull work
of some of the greatest

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:21.556
and the most innovative
minds in organizations

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:25.026
in and around the space
enterprise in the United States.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:27.128
And I know that tomorrow
the User Advisory Group

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.530
will meet for the first time.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:30.865
And I just want to assure you

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:34.669
that all the members
of the National Space Council

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:38.172
see your input and your council

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:44.445
as vital as we revive
American leadership in space

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:49.117
and ensure that the Presidents'
vision for the moon, Mars,

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:51.652
and beyond becomes a reality.

01:29:51.652 --> 01:29:53.321
So, if everyone would thank me

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:55.456
in joining the User
Advisory Group members

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:57.024
who are here with us today.

01:29:57.024 --> 01:30:04.031
(applause)

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:06.200
Lastly, allow me just to
thank the President

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.635
for his hospitality.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:13.074
I think by hosting us here
at the White House

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:17.245
the President
sent a clear message

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:21.516
about the priority of
American leadership in space

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.252
to not only all those
gathered here,

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:27.088
but those looking on
and people across the country

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.322
and in the wider world.

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:30.324
I want to thank all of you
for being a part of this,

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:33.161
thank our panelists again,
but truly grateful

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.196
for the President's leadership,

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.131
for his vision, for his energy.

01:30:37.131 --> 01:30:39.934
I think thanks to the efforts
of all of you,

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:43.004
and thanks to the leadership
of President Donald Trump,

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:47.008
American is leading
in space, once again.

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:49.811
So, thank you all very much.
We'll go right back to work,

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:50.978
and we'll see you
at the next meeting

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.079
in the National Space Council.
