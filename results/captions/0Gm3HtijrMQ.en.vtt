00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.150
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new chapter has recently
been added to the story of one of America's

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.070
most historic leaders.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.260
Jeffrey Brown visits Thomas Jefferson's home
and explains how a visit through the past

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.070
now brings with it an updated understanding.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790
It's the latest in our Race Matters series.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.689
JEFFREY BROWN: Sally Hemings, no portrait
exists, so we don't know what she looked like.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.039
But now this silhouette and a new exhibition
here at Monticello bring a largely hidden

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.430
story into the open and make a definitive
public statement about her decades-long relationship

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
with Thomas Jefferson, the man who owned her
and this plantation.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.770
Niya Bates is Monticello's public historian
of slavery and African-American life.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.790
NIYA BATES, Monticello Public Historian of
Slavery and African-American Life: We, as

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.910
Americans, don't address some of the more
complex issues of slavery, of sex, of power,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.150
of ownership.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.440
And that is what is really interesting about
Sally Hemings and her story

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.439
We want people to see now that Sally Hemings
is a real person and that she had a real legacy.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.300
JEFFREY BROWN: Monticello, built between 1768
and 1808 in Charlottesville, Virginia, was

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.639
home to Jefferson, third president of the
United States, writer of the Declaration of

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:24.369
Independence, enlightenment thinker, and slave
owner of more than 600 people.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.609
Visitors have long come here to see and admire
his mansion and its many wonders.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.659
The first tour to focus on the enslaved people
here only began in 1993.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.939
But over the last several decades, Monticello
has slowly expanded the story beyond Jefferson,

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.450
through research and archaeological work,
to include the vast majority of those who

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.979
lived and worked here.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.319
At a site about a half-mile from the main
house, students in a summer program dug trenches,

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.740
sifted dirt, and found ceramics, nails, and
other artifacts of slave life.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740
Fraser Neiman is Monticello's Director of
archaeology.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.240
FRASER NEIMAN, Monticello Director of Archaeology:
It's kind of the undeniable physical remains

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.830
of the people who were the vast majority of
residents here.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.420
They didn't leave behind the tens of thousands
of letters that Jefferson did, but they did

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.970
leave behind thousands of pieces of trash
and artifacts that we can begin to learn a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.970
little bit more about.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.950
JEFFREY BROWN: The restoration of Mulberry
Row beginning in 2011 opened a window onto

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.400
the workplaces and houses of enslaved artisans
and domestic workers.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340
LESLIE GREENE BOWMAN, President, Thomas Jefferson
Foundation: I think Monticello is a microcosm

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.160
of the American story, right?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.080
How willing have the American people been
to acknowledge slavery as their history and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.600
not someone else's history?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.340
JEFFREY BROWN: Leslie Greene Bowman is president
of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.740
owns and operates Monticello.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.750
In 2000, Monticello published a report on
DNA and other evidence of Jefferson's paternity

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.720
of Hemings' six children, four of whom survived
to adulthood.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.920
That and work by leading scholars helped bring
public acceptance.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.730
Some doubters remain, but experts and Monticello
itself now consider this a settled matter.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.360
LESLIE GREENE BOWMAN: Monticello says that
he's the father of her children.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360
JEFFREY BROWN: No question?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.460
LESLIE GREENE BOWMAN: No question.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.370
JEFFREY BROWN: This summer the foundation
opened six new exhibits, including the plantation's

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.780
first kitchen.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.860
The archaeology uncovered a stew stove of
the kind Jefferson found and admired in Paris,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.710
where he served as U.S. ambassador to France
in the 1780s.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.500
Sally's brother, James Hemings, was trained
in French cooking in Paris and used the stove

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.510
here at Monticello.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.040
But the main new addition in what until now
was a public restroom for visitors is a display

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.820
on the life of Sally Hemings in one of the
two rooms researchers now believe she lived

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.820
in.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.660
Part of her story is told in the words of
her son Madison who gave an oral history of

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.070
life at Monticello in 1873.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.590
Sally Hemings was just 13 or 14 years old
when she went to Paris as a maidservant, and

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.590
the relationship with Jefferson, then 43,
began.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.060
When Jefferson returned home, she could have
stayed in Paris as a free woman, but negotiated

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.620
terms for returning to Monticello, that her
future children would be freed at age 21.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.810
NIYA BATES: What we have been trying to do
here is to give our visitors everything that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.810
we know.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.710
We have given the basic biography, her birthday,
her death day, the days that she was in Paris,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.540
what she was doing, the type of work, where
she lived.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.220
But we have also been able to have some of
those more complex conversations, again, about

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.620
the nature of the relationship.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.670
Was it consensual?

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.160
Was it love?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.590
We don't actually know the answer to the question.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.360
JEFFREY BROWN: Outside the room, a plaque
asks, without answering, "Was it rape?"

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.250
NIYA BATES: Oh, it absolutely had to be asked.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.900
There's no way that we could talk about Sally
Hemings and Thomas Jefferson and not talk

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.540
about the power dynamic between the two of
them.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.280
He did own her.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.410
And it wouldn't be acceptable for us to tell
this story and not address that power imbalance.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
JEFFREY BROWN: An oral history project called
Getting Word has been another key part of

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.780
the new effort here, bringing in descendants
of the Hemings and other enslaved families.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.500
Seventy-year-old Diana Redman is a direct
descendent of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.460
Andrew Davenport, 28, is the great-great-great-great
grandson of Sally's brother Peter.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.084
DIANA REDMAN, Descendent of Thomas Jefferson
and Sally Hemings: When I look around Monticello,

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:41.490
I see the labors of the enslaved community
and what they were able to do.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.100
Jefferson might have had the vision, but the
enslaved community operated, acted upon that

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.130
vision and built this edifice.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.360
We had been part of everything that is Monticello.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.160
Knowing that I had enslaved relatives who
were here who were involved in the carpentry,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.730
who were involved in the cooking and the gardening
and the nailery, this is where my ancestors

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.139
lived and labored.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.900
So, that gave a -- it made it feel different
for me.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.460
JEFFREY BROWN: Can you describe the difference?

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.460
What did you feel?

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.300
DIANA REDMAN: I won't say it was a sense of
ownership.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.919
It was a sense of being.

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.570
JEFFREY BROWN: A sense of being?

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:24.640
DIANA REDMAN: Yes, being where my ancestors
had been before me gave me that sense of,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.270
OK, we're part of this country, we're part
of this growth, we're part of a bigger picture,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.460
and I can lay hands on things that they did.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.480
ANDREW DAVENPORT, Descendent of Sally Hemings'
Brother: It's my identity.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.060
Surely, I'm white as well, but this is part
of our story.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.990
And I would be denying a significant part
of my history and our history if I didn't

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.340
own up to the fact that, yes, I may pass as
a white man or whatever you see in me -- that's

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.419
up to you -- but I have to identify as having
African-American history, and this is my story.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.720
JEFFREY BROWN: How do you see both the injustices
to and the contributions of your ancestors

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.720
who were here?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.220
ANDREW DAVENPORT: That's the hope, that we
can begin to share these stories with the

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.830
wider world, so that we understand, regardless
of the institution of slavery, individuals

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.850
thrived, personally, within their sphere.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.780
And they made life and love here, too.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.180
So this is as complex as it gets.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.400
JEFFREY BROWN: What about when you actually
walk in that room?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.510
DIANA REDMAN: Well, I see the image, and I
would love to know what she looked like.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.510
But that's not meant to be.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:40.530
And I think that's a sadness, but that's a
sadness for many descendants of enslaved families.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.280
JEFFREY BROWN: Monticello officials are also
hoping the new exhibits will help attract

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.250
Americans of all races to view their common
history.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:54.590
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jeffrey Brown
at Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.070
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online, we have an extended
conversation with the Monticello descendants

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.480
we featured in our story there.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.920
That's on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
