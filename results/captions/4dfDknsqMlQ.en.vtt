IT’S POSSIBLE IT COULD PRODUCE A BILLION CLIMATE REFUGEES, AS

00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:38.107 line:92%
BILLION CLIMATE REFUGEES, AS MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN NORTH AND

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.342 line:92%
MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA COMBINED BUT IF WE

00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.010 line:92%
SOUTH AMERICA COMBINED BUT IF WE GET ALL THE WAY TO FOUR DEGREES,

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:43.646 line:92%
GET ALL THE WAY TO FOUR DEGREES, WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A GLOBAL GDP

THAT’S 20 TO 30% SMALLER THAN IT WOULD BE WITHOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:48.418 line:92%
WOULD BE WITHOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT’S AN IMPACT TWICE AS DEEP

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.153 line:92%
THAT’S AN IMPACT TWICE AS DEEP AS THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND IT

00:05:50.154 --> 00:05:50.920 line:92%

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:51.955 line:92%
WOULD BE PERMANENT. THERE WOULD BE PARTS OF THE

WE WOULD HAVE TWICE AS MUCH WAR AS WE HAVE TODAY, AND THAT’S

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:02.265 line:92%

BECAUSE CLIEMTDMATE CHANGE IS NO ONE ISSUE AMONG MANY BUT ONLY

00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:06.736 line:92%
ONE ISSUE AMONG MANY BUT ONLY AFFECTS PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT

00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:11.775 line:92%

SOMETHING WE CAN ESCAPE OR PLAN AWAY FROM.

00:06:21.085 --> 00:06:21.885 line:92%
AWAY FROM. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL AFFECT

FORWARD IN AMERICAN POLITICS AND A TALK ABOUT THE COST, RIGHT?

00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:40.037 line:92%
A TALK ABOUT THE COST, RIGHT? ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID THE

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID THE COST OF DOING NOTHING WILL BE

00:06:41.973 --> 00:06:44.508 line:92%

CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO TAKE CLIMATE BUT

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:03.927 line:92%
GOOD TO TAKE CLIMATE BUT EXPENSIVE.

00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:05.896 line:92%
EXPENSIVE. THAT’S A REASON WE HAD SUCH SLOW

THAT’S A REASON WE HAD SUCH SLOW PROGRESS ON CLIMATE EVEN AS WE

00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:08.298 line:92%
PROGRESS ON CLIMATE EVEN AS WE KNEW IT WAS A LOOMING PROBLEM

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.234 line:92%
KNEW IT WAS A LOOMING PROBLEM OVER THE LAST DECADE OR TWO.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.236 line:92%
OVER THE LAST DECADE OR TWO. BUT THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.570 line:92%

THE CALCULOUS THAT EVEN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN MAKES, WHICH IS

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.462 line:92%
AVERAGE CITIZEN MAKES, WHICH IS TO SAY WE CAN FIND A MORE -- A

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:40.631 line:92%
TO SAY WE CAN FIND A MORE -- A FUTURE THAT IS BOTH PROSPEROUS

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:43.868 line:92%
FUTURE THAT IS BOTH PROSPEROUS AND SAFE FROM THE DEEPEST ESTEST

00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:45.469 line:92%

00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:52.777 line:92%
BOTH OF THE PATHS ARE THE SAME AND WE SHOULD CHOOSE TO TAKE

00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:53.077 line:92%
AND WE SHOULD CHOOSE TO TAKE THEM.

00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:54.278 line:92%
THEM. THE ONLY REASON WE WOULDN’T, WE

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.580 line:92%
THE ONLY REASON WE WOULDN’T, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENCE TO

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:57.481 line:92%
WERE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENCE TO INTEREST LIKE THE COAL INDUSTRY.

00:07:57.515 --> 00:07:58.382 line:92%
