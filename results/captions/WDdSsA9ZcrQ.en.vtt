YOU IN YOUR WRITINGS, IT WAS

00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:19.338
GRADUAL, BUT, WHY WAS THAT?

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:23.342
WE HAD NOT SEEN A RIGOROUS PUSH

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:23.643

HE SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE IN A WAY

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:15.361
THAT WAS REFRESHING.

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:17.330

00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:42.815
WE THINK THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS

DON'T LIKE THE LACK OF GRATITUDE

00:07:01.114 --> 00:07:04.517
OR TRASHING OF THE SYSTEM OR OR

00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:06.051
ANCESTORS THAT GAVE US THE

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:06.585

MARK: FREEDOM IS A TREMENDOUS

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:23.235
THING, BUT THIS GIVES

00:07:23.236 --> 00:07:25.237
OPPORTUNITY FOR VERY EVIL PEOPLE

00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:28.307
TO USE FREEDOM TO DESTROY

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.877
FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION WERE

00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:33.813
TRYING TO PREVENT.

00:07:33.814 --> 00:07:36.816
THEY INVESTIGATE THIS -- CREATE

00:07:36.817 --> 00:07:38.551
THIS REPUBLIC, THERE IS A

00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:41.887
CONSTANT ATTACK AT THE

00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:43.956

00:08:13.353 --> 00:08:15.020
THE FRAMERS WERE UP TO, THEIR

00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:17.089

00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:38.003
SYSTEM.

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:39.305
BUT THEY SAY, NO, NO.

00:09:39.306 --> 00:09:41.206
WE DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT

00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:42.341
POVERTY OR WEALTH CIRCUMSTANCE

00:09:42.342 --> 00:09:44.310
WE WANT

00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:45.311
-- WANT

00:09:45.312 --> 00:09:45.344
-- IANT

00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:45.377
-- IS T

00:09:45.378 --> 00:09:47.179
-- IS WE WANT EVERYONE TO BE

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.081
EQUAL WE WANT EVERYONE MAKING

00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:51.583
20,000 A YEAR, AND POOR MAKING

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:58.023
50 AND SOMEONE MAKING A MILLION.

00:09:58.024 --> 00:09:59.892
MARK: EQUALITY IS THROWN AROUND

00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:02.461
ALL OF THE TIME, WE KNOW WHAT

00:10:02.462 --> 00:10:03.996
FOUNDERS MEANT.

00:10:03.997 --> 00:10:06.198
OF JUSTICE.

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.801
THEY DONE MEAN EQUALITY OF

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:10.069
ECONOMICS, THAT WOULD BE ABSURD,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.137
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:10:12.138 --> 00:10:14.873
HUMAN BEINGS, WE PRIDE OURSELVES

00:10:14.874 --> 00:10:17.443
OWRK

00:10:17.444 --> 00:10:17.476
UNRK

00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:19.645
UNIQUE HUMAN BEINGS AND

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.113
INDIVIDUALED, CREATED BY GOD,

00:10:21.114 --> 00:10:22.514
ONE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER,

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:24.483
BUT IN CIVIL SOCIETY WE ARGUE

00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:25.985
THAT THE LAW IS THE LAW,

00:10:25.986 --> 00:10:28.087
EVERYONE SHOULD BE TREATED AS

00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:29.722
BEST AS WE CAN EQUALLY IN FRONT

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:33.225
OF A COURT, IN FRONT OF THE LAW.

00:10:33.226 --> 00:10:37.429
BUT THIS NOTION OF RADICAL.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:44.536
REALLY IS A EUROPEAN IMPORT.

00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:47.639
WHICH IS ALIEN TO OUR FOUNDERS.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.507
&gt;&gt; IT IS.

00:10:48.508 --> 00:10:51.343
IT HAS SOME PRECEDENCE IN

00:10:51.344 --> 00:10:53.812
ANCIENT WORLD.

00:10:53.813 --> 00:10:57.449
ARISTOTLE A CRITIC OF THIS, HE

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.885
ASSUMES HE CAN BE EQUAL IN EVERY

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.221
OTHER ASPECT, PLATO SAID THAT

00:11:02.222 --> 00:11:07.693
PROJECTRY OF DONKEYS AND DOGS IN

00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:09.061
ATHENS HAVE TO VOTE.

00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:11.930
BUT, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT TAKES UP

00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:18.437
SPEED, IT BIFURCATES, WE THOUGHT

00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:25.577
WE WERE SAFE, ANGLO-SCOTTISH

00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:28.614
TRADITION WAS MORE.

00:11:28.615 --> 00:11:32.117
AND EUROPEAN MODEL IS ONE THAT

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:33.919
PROGRESSIVES CHOOSE.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.988
WE'RE BORN TO CHAINS, THAT

00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:37.289
CHURCH, COMMUNITY, FAMILY, DUTY

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.158
OF GOVERNMENT TO TAKE OFF THOSE

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:41.193
CHAINS, AND LET EVERYONE BE

00:11:41.194 --> 00:11:43.195
LIBERATE, AND THEN WE'LL BE

00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:43.495
HAPPY.

00:11:43.496 --> 00:11:46.231
WHICH IS OUR COLLECT OF COLLECTV

00:11:46.232 --> 00:11:47.166
WHICH IS OUR COLLECT OF COLLECTE

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:47.800
NIGHTMARE.

00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:51.303
WE'RE HEADED TO A RADICAL

00:11:51.304 --> 00:11:56.942
SOCIETY, AND ASPECTS THAT

00:11:56.943 --> 00:12:02.681
TRANSCEND POLITICS.

00:12:02.682 --> 00:12:09.655
MARK: ADVANCE THIS NOTION, OF

00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:10.856
POPULISM.

00:12:10.857 --> 00:12:13.792
WHEN THIS IS AUTHORITARIANISM,

00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:18.297
PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY HAVE

00:12:18.298 --> 00:12:19.998
DEMOCKTIZE SOME PROGRAM, SOME

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:29.408
ISSUE, WHEN IT IS NOT

00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:30.876
DEMOCRATIZED AT ALL.

00:12:30.877 --> 00:12:34.780
THEY ARE NOT INTELLECTUAL

00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:36.682
ELITES, THEY LIKE TO THINK THEY

00:12:36.683 --> 00:12:38.217
ARE, WHO ARE THEY?

00:12:38.218 --> 00:12:40.519
WHY ARE THEY ELITES?

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.087
BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTED?

00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:45.224
THEY ARE MEMBERS OF UNION?

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:46.592
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY ARE

00:12:46.593 --> 00:12:47.793
SO ELITE?

00:12:47.794 --> 00:12:50.129
&gt;&gt; THEY THINK THEY WENT TO A

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.531
PARTICULAR -- BRANDED LIKE

00:12:52.532 --> 00:12:54.099
CATTLE, THEY THINK THAT IVY

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.969
LEAGUE BRAND WILL ALLOW CERTAIN

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.369
PRIVILEGES.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.638
BUT YOU LOOK AT SILICON VALLEY,

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:01.206
WITH A GATE KEEPER THAT DECIDE

00:13:01.207 --> 00:13:02.875
WHAT IS HATE SPEECH, WHAT IS

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:04.710
NOT, THEY CONTROL THE

00:13:04.711 --> 00:13:06.278
EXPRESSIONS OF 7 BILLION PEOPLE

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:09.181
ON THE PLANET, BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:13:09.182 --> 00:13:10.949
MORALLY BETTER THAN WE ARE, YOU

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.253
TURN ON PUBLIC TV OR CABLE TV

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.121
YOU GET ANGUISH ABOUT THESE

00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:21.293
PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW THE DEPLORE

00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:23.328
DEPLORABLES, THE CLINGERS, I

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:25.597
THINK THEY USE WORD EAST

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:27.499
GERMANS, I HEARD THAT SAID, I

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.967
THINK THAT JOHN McCAIN CALLED

00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:31.703
THEM WACKO BIRDS, THERE WAS A

00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:32.838
REAL CONTEMPT FOR PEOPLE THEY

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:35.374
DON'T FEEL THAT PROPERLY KNOW

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:38.110
HOW TO USE THEIR FREEDOM, AND

00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:39.578
THEIR ECONOMIC CLOUT, THEY TOO

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.047
SPHEUP

00:13:42.048 --> 00:13:42.080
STHEUP

00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:42.114
STUPUP

STUPID STUFF, THEY BUY JET SKIS,

00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:49.221
THEY GO SNOW MOBILING AND THEY

00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:55.060
POLLUTE THE UNIVERSE.

00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.395
THEY CAN SAY, YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.530
DOING IT FOR YOU.

00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:00.232
AND THROUGH OUT HISTORY, WE HAVE

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:01.800
SEEN THESE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE ONE

00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:04.570
THING IN COMMON, THEY ARE ALL

00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:06.905
EXCUSED OR NOT SUBJECT TO THE

00:14:06.906 --> 00:14:08.574
RAMIFICATIONS OF THEIR OWN

00:14:08.575 --> 00:14:08.941
IDEOLOGY.

00:14:08.942 --> 00:14:12.211
MARK: I WANT TO ASK BUT
