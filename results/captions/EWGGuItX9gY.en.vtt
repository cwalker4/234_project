00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.019
gave a list of questions
to Trump's legal team.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:23.389

- But you can tell from this
tweet that the president

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.916
is really mad.
First off,

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.851
because he says none
of Mueller's questions

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.453
are about collusion,
which is not true,

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.188
because 14 of the questions

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.389
are about collusion.

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.558
But I guess if you round down,
14's basically zero.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.460
And second--second,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.196
he's really mad because he
believes that Mueller's team

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.364
leaked these questions
to the press.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:06.632

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:31.217 line:0%
I don't see any reason
why it would be.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.018
- Really?

00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:36.655
You don't see any reason not
to trust Vladimir Putin?

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:39.625
The man was a top KGB spy.

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:41.093
He'll steal the shirt
off your back.

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.562
Hell, he stole the shirt
off his own back.

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.197
You can't trust this man.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.567 line:0%
- The President chose Russia
in front of everyone.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.336 line:0%
- You cannot cut deals
with the devil,

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.971 line:0%
and you can never
trust Russia.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.378
- Now, look, President Trump
is no stranger to criticism.

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:02.681
Right? But it's not often
that even his closest allies

00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:03.883
slam his actions.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.584
Even Newt Gingrich,

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:08.187
former Speaker of the House
and swollen Mike Pence,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.090
tweeted that this was
"the most serious mistake"

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:13.025
of Trump's presidency

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:15.861
and that he must clarify
what he meant.

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:17.830
So, just like after Trump
praised

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.064
the Charlottesville Nazis,

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:21.600
today the President
was forced to come out

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.202
and pretend to believe
something

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:24.904
different than what he said.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.972
And I don't know if you guys
believe in omens,

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:29.041
but watch what happened.

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:31.644 line:0%
- Let me begin by
saying that,

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.912 line:0%
uh, once again,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:36.348 line:0%
full faith
and support for America's

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.083 line:0%
intelligence agencies.

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.818 line:0%
I have a full faith

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:42.021 line:0%
in our intelligence
agencies.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.722 line:0%
Oops, they just
turned off the light.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.791 line:0%
That must be
the intelligence agencies.

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:46.992 line:0%
[laughter]

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.827 line:0%
There it goes.
Okay.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.229 line:0%
You guys okay?

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:51.564 line:0%
Good.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.365 line:0%
That was strange.

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:55.234
- I like how he's checking
if everyone else is okay,

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:56.468
but if you look at his
body language,

00:08:56.501 --> 00:08:57.636
he was like,
"I have full faith--"

00:08:57.669 --> 00:08:58.637
and when the lights come on,
he's like,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.072
"Everyone else okay?

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:02.575
"I'm cool. I'm cool.
You guys okay? I'm cool.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.511
I wasn't scared at all.
I'm cool."

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:06.879
But that was insane.

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:10.149
Trump tried to claim that he
believes the intel agencies,

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.051
and then the lights went off.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.054
It's like even electricity
is tired of Trump's bullshit.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.555
It was just like, no.

00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:18.190
Like, I wouldn't be shocked
if one day,

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:19.458
Trump just starts floating

00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:21.026
because gravity's like,
"Enough of this.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:24.129
I'm out. I'm out.
I can't deal with this guy."

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:25.898
He said when it came
to hacking,

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:28.300
"I don't know why
it would be Russia."

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:29.368
Would be.

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:30.803
Then he flies back to America

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.571
and all of a sudden
that's changed.

00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:34.873
How do you convince people
that one flight

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.375
changed your mind completely?

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.711
Well, the answer is,
not like this.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.145 line:0%
- I thought it
would be obvious,

00:09:40.178 --> 00:09:41.614 line:0%
but I would like
to clarify,

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.549 line:0%
just in case it wasn't.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.318 line:0%
At a key sentence
in my remarks,

00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.089 line:0%
I said the word
"would" instead of "wouldn't."

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.690 line:0%
The sentence
should have been,

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:54.793 line:0%
"I don't see any
reason why I wouldn't--

00:09:54.826 --> 00:09:56.762 line:0%
or why it wouldn't
be Russia."

00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:58.364 line:0%
So...

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.765 line:0%
just to repeat it,

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:02.301 line:0%
I said the word
"would" instead of "Wouldn't."

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:03.602
[laughter]

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:06.171
- Oh, you know what...

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:07.740
no, you know what?
That--that makes sense.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.975
I actually believe Trump
on this,

00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:11.310
and I...

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:13.979
hold on, sorry, let me just
check my notes.

00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:16.248
Oh, sorry, what I meant
to say was,

00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:18.050
"Get the [bleep] out
of here, man."

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:20.486
[cheers and applause]

<i> [Russian folk music]</i>

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.025
Michael Cohen.
Up until recently,

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:28.093
he was known as Donald Trump's
personal attorney,

00:10:28.126 --> 00:10:30.663
right-hand man, and a guy
who you're pretty sure

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.331
swallows a lot of bees.

00:10:32.364 --> 00:10:34.733
But as loyal as Cohen
was to Trump,

00:10:34.766 --> 00:10:37.136
everyone always suspected
that he would flip on him

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.671
if it came down to it.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.439
Well, now we're down to it.

00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:42.474
And Cohen is doing somersaults.

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:45.010 line:0%
- Michael Cohen claims that
then-candidate Trump

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.412 line:0%
knew in advance

00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.080 line:0%

00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:00.693
- Wow.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.261
That is shocking information.

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:05.330
Donald Trump had an actual,
in-person conversation

00:11:05.363 --> 00:11:07.032
with one of his sons.

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:09.702
[laughter]

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:10.936
Also...

00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:13.439
[cheers and applause]

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:16.642
Also, this--this Russia thing
is pretty big, I guess,

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:17.776
but, I mean...

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:20.045
yeah, because if they--
if they can prove

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:21.714
that Trump knew that his
campaign was meeting

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:22.782
with the Russians,

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.217
it would go a long way
towards proving collusion.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.454
So Trump
knows that he needs backup,

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:31.423
which is why he immediately
sent out the Bat signal.

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:32.558
Unfortunately,

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.927
all he got was the Bat Boy.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.128
But the thing about Rudy is,

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:39.098
just when you think he's
backed into a corner,

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.067
he finds an even tighter
corner.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.836 line:0%
- Cohen, you know,
always goes too far.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.804 line:0%
When you're lying,
there's always a trap for you.

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:47.973 line:0%
So he said there was
a one-on-one meeting,

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:49.475 line:0%
that Donald, Jr. came in

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.543 line:0%
and told him about the meeting
that was about to take place.

00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:54.179 line:0%
Well, there are two witnesses
who say it didn't happen.

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:55.714 line:0%
- The President and his son?

00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:56.715 line:0%
- All right.

00:11:56.748 --> 00:11:58.183
- All right.

00:11:58.216 --> 00:11:59.384
All right.

00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:00.686
All right, fine.

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.654
You got me with your
very first rebuttal,

00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:04.556
and that has completely
destroyed my argument.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:05.958
All right, all right,

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.292
I see how any thinking person

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:09.161
could parry that attack I made,
all right.

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:10.229
I see.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.363
Because, come on, man.

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:13.432
I mean, props.
Props to Giuliani for trying.

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:15.934
But the reasoning can't be
that the crime didn't happen

00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.703
because the people
accused of the crime

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:18.704
say it didn't happen.

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.372
That's not what a witness is.

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:21.540
That's not how it works.

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:22.775
You can't be like,
"Well, Your Honor,

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.409
"I witnessed myself

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:27.513
"not robbing the bank,
so cased closed.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:29.248

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.256
[laughter]

00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:14.426
Is admitting that he lied

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:16.795
about Trump's real estate
dealings with Russia.

00:13:16.828 --> 00:13:19.631
And these aren't like your
typical Trump real estate lies,

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:21.600
like, "Of course we installed
smoke detectors."

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:24.303
No, this lie is way more
important,

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.971
because it puts Trump's contact

00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:28.440
with Russia much closer
to him being president.

00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:30.909
Right? In January 2016,

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:33.312
Trump was just one of 17
possible morons

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.113
who could become the GOP
nominee.

00:13:35.146 --> 00:13:36.348
But by June,

00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:38.050
he was the only moron

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:40.052
who could become the nominee.

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:42.821
Why deal with Russia at all

00:13:42.854 --> 00:13:45.290
while you're running for
President of the United States?

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.893
Why not just avoid
the conflict altogether?

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:50.729
Well, turn to page bullshit
to find out.

00:13:50.762 --> 00:13:53.932
- I was running my business
while I was campaigning.

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.468
There was a good chance
that I wouldn't have won,

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:59.004
in which case I would've gone
back into the business,

00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:01.406
and why should I lose
lots of opportunities?

00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:03.008
- Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, whoa.

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:05.377
Wait, did you hear
what he just said?

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.412
Wait, he said the reason that
he didn't stop

00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:10.015
his business dealings is
because he also thought

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:11.450
he would lose.

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.552
He just said that. He said,
"There was a good chance--

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:16.221

to do the same thing.

Trump downplays his
connection to them.

00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:39.417
That's what he does.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.353
You know, it's like how Trump
said that Paul Manafort

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.388
was barely on the campaign

00:18:43.421 --> 00:18:46.191
or that George Papadopoulos
was a coffee boy

00:18:46.224 --> 00:18:48.827
or Jared Kushner was just
his [bleep]-blocker.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.730
But Trump might have
a harder time

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.965
dismissing Roger Stone,

00:18:53.998 --> 00:18:55.367
and not just because
Stone dresses

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.002
like he crashes
British weddings,

00:18:57.035 --> 00:19:00.038
but also because a big question
in this investigation

00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:03.074
is whether the Trump campaign
coordinated with WikiLeaks

00:19:03.107 --> 00:19:05.210
to release Hillary's
hacked emails, right?

00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:06.411
And in his indictments,

00:19:06.444 --> 00:19:07.879
Mueller says that Roger Stone

00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:10.081
was directed to contact
WikiLeaks

00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:13.251
by someone in the Trump
campaign.

00:19:13.284 --> 00:19:15.687
Now, was that someone
Trump himself?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.088
We don't know.

00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.992
you would expect his people
to just come out and say so.

00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:23.295
