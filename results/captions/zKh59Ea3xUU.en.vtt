MARIA: AND WE'RE BACK WITH

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:04.484
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:05.318
BOLTON, AND BEFORE WE WENT TO

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.454
THE BREAK, SIR, I MENTIONED THE

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.557
CULTURE, THAT WE ALL KNOW, IS

00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:12.192
CHINESE, AND THAT IS THE IP

00:00:12.193 --> 00:00:13.560
THEFT, I MEAN I'VE GOT A LIST

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.162
OF COMPANIES HERE, WHO HAVE SUED

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:17.831
HUAWEI AND ZTE FOR STEALING

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.499
TRADE SECRETS AND THEN SETTLED

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.733
LAWSUITS WITH THEM INCLUDING

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:22.969
CISCO AND MOTOROLA AND T-MOBILE,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.703
MICROSOFT ET CETERA.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:25.405
HOW DO YOU MOVE THE NEEDLE ON

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:25.705
THAT?

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:27.640
&gt;&gt;  WELL IF I WERE BACK AT THE

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:28.441
AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:30.477
AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, I

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:31.911
WOULD DISCUSS THAT AT LENGTH.

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:33.112
I'LL JUST SAY THIS.

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:34.848
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:35.915
IDENTIFIED EXACTLY THE STRUCTURE

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.084
ALL ISSUES THAT YOU'VE REFERRED

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.619
TO, THE ENORMOUS DAMAGE, THAT'S

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.854
BEEN DONE TO THE UNITED STATES

00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:44.290
OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES BY

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:45.725
CHINESE STEALING INTELLECTUAL

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:48.161
PROPERTY AND FORCED TECHNOLOGY

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.696
TRANSFERS THIS IS CRITICAL

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:50.797
REVERSING PATTERN TO GET THIS

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.632
RIGHT IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, SO I

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.734
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.070
SURPRISING THAT IT'S COMPLEX AND

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.638
THAT CHINA IS FACED WITH SOME

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:59.806
VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES HERE

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:01.641
THAT'S WHAT OUR NEGOTIATORS HAVE

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:03.176
BEEN PURSUING AND THAT'S REALLY

00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:05.612
MUCH OF THE WORK THAT REMAINS TO

00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:06.012
BE DONE.

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:07.714
NOT ONLY HAD TO REACH AN

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:08.882
AGREEMENT ON THESE ISSUES BUT

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.050
HOW TO ENFORCE THEM OVER THE

00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.450
LONG TERM.

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.019
MARIA: WELL THIS IS THE KEY AND

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.320
THIS IS WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT

00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.855
MOST RECENTLY SOME KIND OF

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:16.023
ACTION THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:18.291
CAN COME UP WITHIN TERMS OF

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.227
ENFORCEMENT, AND ENFORCEMENT

00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:21.762
ACTIONS SHOULD THE CHINESE TURN

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:23.263
AROUND AND NOT KEEP THEIR

00:01:23.264 --> 00:01:24.498
PROMISES WHICH OF COURSE WE KNOW

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.533
THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST MANY

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:26.833
TIMES.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.869
WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.604
THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE HERE TO

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.406
MAKE SURE THAT BEIJING FOLLOWS

00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:34.408
UP WITH THESE PROMISES?

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.778
&gt;&gt;  WELL I DON'T WANT TO STEAL

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:38.879
BOB LIGHTHIZER'S THUNDER ON THIS

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.748
THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:42.649
NEGOTIATIONS NOW, THERE ARE

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.384
GOING TO BE MORE TALKS NEXT WEEK

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:45.719
CERTAINLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.554
OF THE GOVERNMENT, WE'RE WORKING

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:50.958
AS HARD AS WE CAN TO PURSUE THE

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.392
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA HERE.

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:54.127
MARIA: WOULD YOU PUT PARIS BACK

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:54.661
IN PLACE?

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:55.863
&gt;&gt;  SURE THAT WOULD BE A

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:57.064
POSSIBILITY, THAT'S ONE WAY OF

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.699
DOING IT THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.833
OPTIONS THAT'S OUT THERE AND

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:00.934
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:02.135
HONESTLY LOOK I'M A FREE-TRADER

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:04.071
BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:06.206
PRESIDENT I THINK WAS RIGHT AND

00:02:06.207 --> 00:02:07.441
IMPOSING TARIFFS ON CHINA IS

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:08.742
THAT IT GOT THEIR ATTENTION, AND

00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:10.077
I THINK THAT'S BEEN ALL TO THE

00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:10.377
GOOD.

00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:12.713
MARIA: BUT I WANT TO ZERO IN ON

00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:13.647
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES

00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:14.948
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.584
GIVE US SOME IMPORTANT COLOR ON

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:18.119
THIS, AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.588
NOT JUST ECONOMIC WARFARE.

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:22.556
THIS IS ALSO MILITARY AGGRESSION

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.091
S, THEY ARE, YOU KNOW,

00:02:24.092 --> 00:02:25.893
SETTING UP ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:26.627
CHINA SEA.

00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:27.962
THEY'RE PUTTING MILITARY BASES

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:29.163
ON THOSE ISLANDS.

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:30.498
THEY'RE PUTTING MILITARY BASES

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.166
ACROSS THE WORLD RIGHT ON THE

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:36.871
BORDERS AND THE PORTS AS FAR AS

00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:37.705
JABUTI, ACCORDING TO THE FORMER

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:38.973
HEAD OF INTEL COMMITTEE DEVON

00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:40.341
NUNES WHOSE BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:41.342
MANY TIMES CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:42.577
THE MILITARY AGGRESSIONS AND IF

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:43.811
THERE'S ANYTHING THE U.S. CAN DO

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:44.479
TO STOP THAT?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.514
&gt;&gt;  LOOK THE WAY TO HANDLE CHINA

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:50.785
FOR THE UNITED STATES, I THINK,

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:52.487
IS THE EXISTENTIAL SECURITY

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:53.621
QUESTION OF THE 21ST CENTURY AND

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:55.657
IT'S IDENTIFIED AS SUCH IN THE

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:56.391
PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.293
STRATEGY AND ITS BEEN A FOCUS OF

00:02:58.294 --> 00:02:59.527
MUCH OF THE PREPARATION OF THE

00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:00.828
BUDGET REQUEST THAT WILL BE

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.664
ANNOUNCED HERE SHORTLY, WE'RE

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.098
LOOKING EXACTLY AT THINGS LIKE

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.234
WHAT CHINA'S DOING IN THE SOUTH

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:08.870
CHINA SEA, CONTRARY TO EVERY

00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:10.672
PLEDGE ITS MADE BEFORE, TO

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:13.541
ENGAGE IN PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS,

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:14.676
TO RESOLVE TERRITORIAL CLAIMS.

00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:17.278
IT IS TAKING OVER THESE ROCKS

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.913
AND ISLANDS BUILDING MILITARY

00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:20.949
BASES ON THEM, IT'S COMPLETELY

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.382
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:23.084
IT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO DO

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:24.819
FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION EXERCISES,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.523
AND LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO STOP

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:29.991
THIS EFFORT IN EFFECT TO CREATE

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.192
A NEW CHINESE PROVINCE.

00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:32.794
PEOPLE MAY SAY BUT THE SOUTH

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.229
CHINA SEA IS SO FAR AWAY.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.065
IT'S TWICE AS BIG AS THE

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.500
MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND BETWEEN 40

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.336
AND 50% OF THE WORLD'S SHIP-BORN

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:42.470
E COMMERCE GOES THROUGH

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.272
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA SO IF THEY

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:46.408
CHANGE IT TO CHINESE TERRITORIAL

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.842
WATERS IT'S A HUGE SHIFT FOR

00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:49.044
SOUTHEAST AND EAST ASIA.

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:50.879
MARIA: ON THE ECONOMIC WARFARE

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.014
IT'S NOT JUST THE OBVIOUS FORCE

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:54.416
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY WHEN

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.551
BEIJING SPENDS A LOT OF THEIR

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:58.286
MONEY TO ACQUIRE AN ENERGY

00:03:58.287 --> 00:03:59.521
COMPANY OR A FINANCIAL SERVICES

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:00.922
COMPANY A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN

00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:01.456
THE U.S..

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:03.458
IT'S ALSO ABOUT ACADEMIA.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.793
CAN THE U.S. DO ANYTHING ABOUT

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:05.193
THAT?

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:07.329
WE'VE TALKED A GREAT DEAL ON

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.432
THIS PROGRAM ABOUT CONFUCIOUS

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.066
CENTERS THESE

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.934
INSTITUTES WHICH CALL THEMSELVES

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:15.136
THINK TANK NON-PROFITS BUT IN

00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:16.905
FACT CAN ACT AS ANOTHER CENTER

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:20.408
THAT IS SUCKING UP U.S.

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.842
INTELLIGENCE.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.077
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT THESE?

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:24.780
&gt;&gt;  VERY WORRIED.

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.015
THIS IS AN EFFORT BY CHINA TO

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:28.717
INFLUENCE OPINION IN AMERICA

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:30.452
THAT MAKES THE ELECTION HACKING

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:32.888
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BY

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.221
RUSSIA.

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.223
LOOK, AS ONE SENIOR U.S.

00:04:35.224 --> 00:04:35.791
OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.460
CALLED IT, THE JV EFFORT.

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:39.795
WHAT CHINA'S DOING WHAT VICE

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:41.029
PRESIDENT PENCE EXPLAINED SOME

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.831
MONTHS BACK IN A VERY IMPORTANT

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:45.367
SPEECH ABOUT THESE EFFORTS,

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.302
REALLY, IS FAR GREATER IN

00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:49.338
MAGNITUDE THAN ANY OTHER FOREIGN

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:51.573
EFFORT WE'VE SEEN IN HISTORY TO

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:53.575
INFLUENCE AMERICAN OPINION, AND

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:54.910
IT'S NOT JUST CONFINED TO THE

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.610
UNITED STATES.

00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:58.246
THEY'RE DOING IT IN AUSTRALIA,

00:04:58.247 --> 00:04:59.081
OTHER COUNTRIES, CLOSE FRIENDS

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:02.517
OF OURS SO THIS REALLY GOES TO

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:03.852
THE CORE OF HOW YOU MAINTAIN A

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:05.487
FREE AND OPEN SOCIETY IN THIS

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:06.788
COUNTRY WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.023
TRYING TO INFLUENCE IT THE WAY

00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:09.024
THAT CHINA HAS.

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:11.260
IT GOES WELL BEYOND JUST

00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.394
ELECTION HACKING, ALTHOUGH WE

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.395
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.130
ABOUT CHINA DOING THAT AS WELL.

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:16.732
MARIA: JOHN CAN YOU GIVE US AN

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.166
UPDATE ON SYRIA?

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:19.601
I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS BECAUSE I

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:22.838
WANT TO GET AS MUCH IN WITH YOU

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.573
AS POSSIBLE THIS MORNING ON THE

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.074
HEELS OF THE U.S. JOURNAL STORY

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:27.709
THE U.S. IS HUNTING FOR ALLIED

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.777
COOPERATION IN SYRIA.

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:29.444
THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:31.413
SECURE COMMITMENTS FROM KEY

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.581
EUROPEAN ALLIES TO SEND MILITARY

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.116
FORCES TO SYRIA PASSING THE

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:34.950
TARGET SET FOR FRIDAY.

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:35.617
WHERE ARE WE?

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.354
&gt;&gt;  WELL I THINK THE JOURNAL MAY

00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:39.088
BE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.291
CURVE ON THAT I CAN TELL YOU

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:43.259
I'VE SPOKEN TO MY BRITISH AND

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.993
FRENCH COUNTERPARTS THIS PAST

00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:46.362
WEEK AND THEY ARE LOOKING TO PRY

00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:47.697
AND PARTICIPANT, WE HAVEN'T

00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:49.432
FORMALIZED IT YET A LOT OF WORK

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:50.466
REMAINS TO BE DONE CHAIRMAN OF

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:54.103
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF JOEY D

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.171
UNFORD AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT

00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:56.339
THE PENTAGON HAVE BEEN MOVING

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.542
HEAVEN AND EARTH TO TRY AND GET

00:05:59.543 --> 00:06:01.411
THIS ACCOMPLISHED WE'RE STILL

00:06:01.412 --> 00:06:02.645
OPTIMISTIC WE CAN DO IT BUT IT'S

00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:03.780
STILL MOVING IN THE RIGHT

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:04.147
DIRECTION.

00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:04.881
WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:06.883
THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT.

00:06:06.884 --> 00:06:08.518
MARIA: WELL, THE PRESIDENT WOULD

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.753
LIKE OUR ALLIES TO PAY UP, IN

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:14.324
TERMS OF THE U.S. TROOPS ON THE

00:06:14.325 --> 00:06:15.325
GROUND, HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:19.195
RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT'S

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:19.562
PROPOSALS?

00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:20.597
&gt;&gt;  WELL WE'RE DOING A LOT AS

00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:22.232
YOU KNOW IN NATO TO GET THE

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:23.266
ALLIES TO INCREASE THEIR

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:25.168
SPENDING TO MEET THE COMMITMENT

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.637
THEY THEMSELVES MADE IN WALES IN

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.973
2014 TO GET TO 2% OF GROSS

00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:32.075
NATIONAL PRODUCT BY 2024 AND

00:06:32.076 --> 00:06:34.510
THAT WASN'T AN ACCIDENTAL

00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:36.746
DECISION AT WALES IN 2014.

00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:38.381
IT WAS AFTER THE RUSSIANS MOVED

00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:39.916
INTO EASTERN UKRAINE AND OUR

00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:41.017
FRIENDS IN EUROPE BEGAN TO

00:06:41.018 --> 00:06:42.352
REALIZE THAT THE HISTORY HAD NOT

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:43.253
ACTUALLY ENDED.

00:06:43.254 --> 00:06:44.687
IT WAS STILL GOING ON AND THEY

00:06:44.688 --> 00:06:46.422
WERE LIVING ON A CONTINENT WITH

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:48.157
A REAL THREAT, SO THIS IS ALSO

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:49.959
TRUE IN TERMS OF BASE RENTALS

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.694
AND OTHER COSTS THAT THE

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.863
PRESIDENT HAS LOOKED AT.

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:54.964
I THINK HE'S FOLLOWING THROUGH

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:56.900
ON MANY OF THE THINGS BARACK

00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.836
OBAMA SAID, HE'S JUST BEING MORE
