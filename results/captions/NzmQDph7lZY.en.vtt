00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.639
what is going on everyone happy new year
I thought we'd go big to start off the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.849
new year and seeing that everything's
bigger in Texas we might as well start

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.690
2019 off they're the same that
everything is bigger in Texas likely

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
originated as a reference to the
enormity of the state's geographical

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
area in terms of square miles
Texas is only second to alaskan size and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.859
it's the largest of the contiguous 48
states others say it has to do with the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
rugged and big-hearted people that live
in this great state Texas is a great

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.660
state and there's no denying that great
economy great history great sports

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.890
entertainment and great cities some of
the country's best cities are in the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
state of Texas they also have some
not-so-great towns in this state

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.050
sprinkled throughout the Lone Star State
you have towns that seem to have missed

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.129
out on that Texas magic and that's what
today's list is all about so sit back

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.829
kick off your boots and watch my top ten
Wars towns in Texas number 10 Laoghaire

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.549
Texas leery is less than 20 miles away
from the Arkansas border any of you know

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.799
anything about Arkansas that's not
always a good thing

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
leery has about 700 residents who are
bored all the time the town is mainly

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.140
used as a truck stop Leary has a
McDonald's a travel stop an RV and truck

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
wash and a barbecue restaurant if the
residents need anything more they'll

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
have to venture out to Tex Arkana
which is about 15 minutes away which

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
isn't too bad of a drive most the time
if you have a californian in front of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
you on the highway and they see an
armadillo all bets are off the overall

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.299
crime rate in Leary is 48 percent higher
than the national average number 9 elsa

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.320
texas elsa is in the southern section of
texas not too far from Mexico and the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.799
Gulf of Mexico else is not a place you
feel safe living in not even a place you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.299
feel safe visiting driving by or looking
at this is because the crime rate is 93

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.990
percent higher than the national average
while you're an Elsa you have a 1 in 18

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.399
chance of being involved in a violent
crime the year-over-year crime rate has

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.200
risen a hundred and four percent this is
one of those places where if a friend

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.610
moves to you sort of forget they exist
you normally hide them from your

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.970
facebook page because their posts just
get really depressing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.380
number eight Redfield Texas Redfield
Texas has ranked the 16 hundred and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.490
eighty second best place to live in
Texas out of two thousand that's not a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.430
good number
this place isn't the type of place you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.790
move to if you don't like the heat and
it's also a place you don't move to if

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.819
you don't like the cold the summer
months can get up in the triple digits

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.140
for weeks at a time and the winters can
stain the 30s for weeks at a time that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.980
is not good and the cherry on that
depression Sunday is the crime rate

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.670
Redfield's overall crime rate is 77
percent higher than the national average

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.459
and statistically their schools suck too

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.480
number seven Lorraine Texas between
Abilene and Midland Texas Shuaib

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.080
Lorraine Lorraine is a super small town
of only five hundred residents and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.040
there's nothing here worth while this is
the type of place you end up if you were

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.510
a total a-hole in a past life you had to
have done something like saying Motley

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.900
Crue's shout at the devil in front of
the Pope or something at the Vatican the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.380
overall crime rate in Lorraine is about
65 percent higher than the national

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.600
average making the whole town safer than
only about 8 percent of the US cities

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.489
while you're in the town you have a 1 in
20 chance of being involved in a crime

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:32.130
and it's just boring here number 6 Lone
Star Texas Lone Star has about 1,800

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.390
residents who struggle to make ends meet
or even find a job the unemployment rate

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.590
here is 11 percent while the poverty
rate is about 23 percent the good news

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.090
is they beat their numbers from 2017 the
unemployment rate then was twelve point

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.250
four percent of the residents who do
work they only make an average of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.820
$18,000 a year the good news is it
borders the Ellison Creek Reservoir

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.989
which helps if you need to go fishing
for your dinner number five Barstow

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.150
Texas Barstow Texas is more depressing
than Barstow California which up until

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.290
this week I didn't think was possible
this is the type of place that you see

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.900
from the interstate and think to
yourself I could probably make it to the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.209
next gas station and keep driving
Barstow is ranked the 1727 best place to

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.560
live in Texas there's something to be
proud of I wonder what the founder of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.159
this little lump of coal and the Texas
Prairie would say if he saw his town

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.970
today
I'm sure there'd be a lot of profanity

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.199
the poverty level in Barstow is 73
percent higher than the national average

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.849
don't live here

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.169
number 4 carlsbad texas carlsbad is not
a place you want to live if you care

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.099
about your safety or the safety of the
people around you I would be concerned

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.690
about my goldfishes safety in Carlsbad
Texas the population is only about 800

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.650
with the overall crime rate being around
79 percent higher than the national

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.270
average while you're in the city limits
you have a 1 in 21 chance of being

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.159
involved in a violent crime in Carlsbad
Texas no data on goldfish crime but I'm

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:10.630
sure it's high number three Detroit
Texas Detroit Texas isn't as bad as some

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.330
of the other towns on this list
it's actually ranked the thirteen

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.949
hundred and seventy second best place to
live in Texas god that was rough that's

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.599
not good what else isn't good is the
crime and poverty stats the crime rate

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.009
in Detroit is 48 percent higher than the
national average and the poverty rate in

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.550
Detroit is forty percent higher than the
national average what got them on this

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.180
list is they couldn't come up with an
original name I mean come on I know a

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.300
lot of places in the country are named
after other places but this is bad if

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.169
you're gonna pick a name for a place
why Detroit Detroit sucks right now but

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.370
it was never great whoever named it must
have named all the places all along us

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.050
82 our towns that ripped off other
places name you got Paris Texas Reno

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.849
Texas and New Boston Texas probably the
most insulting of all of them number two

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.349
more station Texas more station is out
in the Prairie southeast of Dallas aways

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.550
that's the best part about this place
your only one Greyhound bus trip away

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.449
from a new life I have a friend who told
me all about this place she grew up in

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.289
Chandler Texas which isn't too far away
from Moore station she explained that

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.310
this place is the backwoods type place
the type of place a first cousin is

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.180
considered a good option for a full
service prom date those are her words I

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.080
have to admit I will probably use the
phrase full service prom date any chance

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.469
I get the rest of my life
that was great crime is out of control

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.130
here the crime rate is actually 77
percent higher than the national average

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.490
if less than four hundred people how
come they can't get it together

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.710
and number one la presa Texas now this
one's a sad story this little area south

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.910
of Laredo was started in the early 1970s
when a company bought some land from a

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.910
developer the company starts selling off
tracts of land now here's where the bad

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.930
news started company didn't survey the
land and the sleazy salesman took it a

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.590
step further the normal sleazy salesman
start breaking off the Lots in little

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.640
areas and they were never surveyed they
were overlapping and some people own

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.420
parts of each other's land it's just a
big nightmare and it has been for about

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.980
40 some-odd years now since they can't
get utilities the community in some

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.970
cases banded together and like ran
extension cords to the houses that were

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.110
unable to get utilities it just went on
forever so basically for forty some odd

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.770
years some of the people from la presa
lived without electricity potable water

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.810
and adequate sewage around 2010 some of
the houses started receiving power and

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.470
sewage and water from a project started
by some state officials the press that

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.820
has a long way to go and this one's like
a tragedy these people have been living

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.570
like early settlers for about forty some
odd years like I said but hopefully

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.560
someday they'll turn it around I don't
know it's out in the boondocks you never

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.050
know I think you should probably just
pick up and move that's what I would do

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.560
alright see that's my top 10 worst small
towns in Texas hope you guys enjoyed it

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.240
there's a lot of other towns in Texas
that could've gone

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.419
this but these are probably the top ten
I found hope you guys enjoyed the list

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:03.569
don't forget all the links below leave
me comments tell me I missed one that

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:06.300
you think should have it on here I'd
love to hear it everybody have a great

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.120
