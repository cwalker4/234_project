00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
So here's how it goes,
so basically, Twitch

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.860
is going to read a category,
like three types of trees.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.267
And I'd say, elm, oak, olive.

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.100
And then you hit it.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.780
So we would see how
much time I have left.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.196
You have to do it
in five seconds.

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:15.710
All right, Ellen,
besides coffee,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.630
name three things you
can get at a coffee shop.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.660
A cinnamon, and a
napkin, and cupcakes.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.860
[BUZZER] Oh, out of
time, I didn't make it.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.570
OK, Cher.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.278
Are you just trying
to make me look good?

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:31.410
No, I really, I haven't
been at a coffee shop.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380
I don't know what they have.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.048
But you can get your hair
washed in a bowl in your house?

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:36.548
Shh.

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:39.038
Queen.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.030
Shh.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.160
OK, Cher.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.660
OK.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.530
Name three celebrities you'd
want to do a duet with.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.740
Oh, Adele, Pink,
and not Madonna.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.980
[BUZZER]

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.652
Well, all right miss negative.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:57.360
What did I cheat?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.580
Yeah.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.100
Did I cheat?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.140
Yeah, that's not, he
said would you want to,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.404
it's not who you
wouldn't want to.

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:05.287
Well I took license, I
took a little license.

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:05.870
Yeah, you did.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.170
OK.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.470
OK.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.490
But you got two of them.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.300
All right.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.530
OK, Ellen.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.420
Three favorite body parts.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.990
Oh stomach, legs, and arms.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.343
[BELL]

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.049
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.557
On you or somebody else?

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:22.140
Somebody else.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.930
OK.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.710
I don't have any
favorites on mine.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.610
OK, Cher.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.460
Name three terms for hooking up.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.927
Oh, I don't even know those.

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:31.510
I don't know--

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.259
Just make some up.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.690
OK.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.620
I can't think of it.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.500
[BUZZER] I'm totally losing now.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.000
Yeah.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.580
OK.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.205
Knocking boots is one.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:40.780
Yeah?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.962
I don't know that one.

00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.170
You don't know knockin boots?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.070
No.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710
What would you call it?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.930
Just hooking up?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.430
Uh-uh.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.720
I wouldn't even call it that.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.320
What would you call?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.980
I don't know.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.960
OK.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.021
You just go come here?

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:53.520
Yeah.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.860
No, I don't, I don't, I don't.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.360
All right.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.860
OK.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
Ellen, name three things you'd
do if the power went out.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.630
I would light a candle, I
would just go, when happened?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.050
And I would-- [BUZZER]
[LAUGHTER] And I'd just sit

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.570
around.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.862
Oh, I'm bad at this.

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:13.820
Well what do you mean--

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.370
You said this was gonna be fun.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.100
--when the power went out.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.840
Yeah it is fun.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.410
OK.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.045
It's fun for them to watch us.

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:18.915
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.560
Not for us but it's entertaining
them and that's what matters.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.900
OK, OK, OK.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.470
Cher, what are three shows you
watch but don't like admitting?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.690
Oh, let's see.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.030
Well I don't watch shows
I don't like admitting.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.050
OK, hold on.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.640
I watch Fox News
once in a while.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.620
[BELL] Oh, I just
gave myself one.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.190
And I don't know, I
can't think of it.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.140
I like all of, all the
shows I watch, I like.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.510
I don't have guilty that.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.520
No, you don't have
Bachelor in Paradise?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.349
I don't, no.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.390
Oh you should watch that.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.840
No.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.034
It's like The Bachelor, I
don't watch that either.

00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:51.450
Yeah, no but,
Bachelor in Paradise

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.860
is better than The Bachelor.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.443
Or any of The Housewives in East
[BLEEP],, I don't watch them.

00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:56.406
It's different.

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:57.780
They don't have
East [BLEEP] yet.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.490
They haven't made that one.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.000
OK.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.420
That's a good one, though.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.097
The Housewives of East [BLEEP].

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:05.382
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:06.300
Last round.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.050
Last round.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.720
Oh good.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.491
All right, so last me, then you.

00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:09.990
OK.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.490
OK.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.720
Ellen, three things
that turn you on.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.410
Oh, music, sweetness,
and chocolate.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.362
[BELL] Choclate doesn't.

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:21.300
I just made that up.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.250
I was thinking in a
whole different place.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.860
Really?

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.290
Yeah, what were you thinking?

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.770
I was thinking, you know,
handsome, tall, sweet.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.480
Yeah.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.860
Did we both have sweet?

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.760
Yeah, I said sweet.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.570
OK.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.320
Chocolate doesn't.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.611
I just made that up so I'd win.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.340
Does chocolate turn anybody on?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.870
Really, like, mm,
really you eat?

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.750
And you--

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.250
I love it.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.699
I don't get it much, but
I love chocolate and cake.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.990
You eat chocolate and you're,
like, you're in the mood?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.520
No, no.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.050
It's like, I don't
get to have cho--

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
I mean, look, I'm working on
my body and I just don't--

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.400
I have chocolate, I'm lying.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.920
Yeah, see?

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.070
Yeah.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.240
And then it turns you on?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.480
No it doesn't turn me on.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.354
You just said it did.

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.620
No, I didn't mean
it in that way.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.270
OK.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.770
Bitch.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.330
All right.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.454
Give my guest, Cher, the
last category, Twitch.

00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:12.953
OK.

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:18.459
[LAUGHTER] OK, Cher, name three
ways to make money really fast.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.810
Oh singing, hooking, and and--

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.936
[BUZZER] acting.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.385
[BELL]

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:35.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:37.147
All right.

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.860
We both lost and we'll be right,
I'll be right back, she won't.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.510
Oh, very nice.
