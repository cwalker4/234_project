00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.210
Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.540
Groucho Marx said about his pen pal T.S. Elliot after his death that he was a nice man

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.010
ant that that was about the best that could be said about anybody

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.160
when, 100 years from now, Groucho Marx dies they will say about him

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.260
that he made a lot of people happy

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.880
and that's my version of the best thing that can be said of any man. The m movies are classics

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.850
Animal Crackers, A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races, Go West. After

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.020
the movies he went on to do a couple of scenarios and to act as quiz-master

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.680
quiz-master of his own T.V. program which won all the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.860
awards. His specialty on that T.V. show

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.900
was impudence and a fairly genial rudeness

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.440
which he has practiced all his life and which he has

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.260
collected in his most recent book, The Groucho Letters, in which we are made

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.000
privy, a word by the way he doesn't by the way like, to an exchange of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.020
lucubrations between him and the elite:

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
artists, politicians, poets of the english speaking world

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.970
In a letter to Eddie Cantor in that irresistible volume, he records that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.310
the two greatest laughs he ever got, or rather

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.190
the most reliable laughs he ever got on vaudeville,  were in response to the line:

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.080
"The garbage man is here." To which his reply was, " tell him I don't want any."

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.630
And to the line, "I'd like to say goodbye to your wife." To which the reply was, "Who wouldn't?"

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.770
I'd like to begin by asking, Mr. Marx—do you mind if I call you Mr. Marx?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.320
Groucho: I'd wish you'd call me Groucho, and I'll call you Willy.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.400
Groucho: It's good enough for Somerset Maugham I don't know why it isn't good enough for you.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.480
Buckley: I certainly wouldn't want you to start being polite on my show. Whether the laughs those two lines got on Vaudeville

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.060
is a cue to the question, "Is the world funny?"

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.770
Mediator: Ladies and gentlemen, in a moment we shall hear Mr. Marx's answer to Mr. Buckley's question.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.360
Mediator: My name is C. Dickerman Williams and I shall act as act as chairman

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.630
of this discussion between Mr. Marx and Mr. Buckley

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.700
the subject of the discussion will be, "Is the world funny?" Mr. Marx,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.180
will you answer Mr. Buckley's question—is the world funny?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.210
Groucho: He didn't ask me, you just asked me.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.300
No I don't think it's terribly funny. I don't think it's ever

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.720
terribly funny sometimes there are isolated  pieces of the world

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.070
that is funny, but generally it's a pretty serious world it always has been...

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.160
people struggling for a living, and starving, and all kinds of riots

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.810
and particularly a couple of weeks ago.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.510
No I don't think the world is funny. That's like saying is a man funny—even a professional comedian

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.300
can be funny perhaps, eight minutes out of a twenty-four hours.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.100
But a comedian isn't they're the dreariest people in the world.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.630
You should talk to my wife sometime, which is more than I do  (Buckley: Is that an invitation?).

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.390
Mediator: Mr. Buckley what's your view?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.300
Buckley: Well, I've read Mr. Marx's book and—a couple of his books

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.240
and I've seen all of his movies, and I think that he does his best to make the world

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.540
funny and occasionally succeeds

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.500
but it does seem to me that there is a strain of something  going

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.640
through your last book for instance

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.830
all of those letters that you write to those famous people and all of those letters that your receive from all of those famous people

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.510
and that theme is something very close to misanthropy, it's related to the whole notion

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.080
that everyone would like to say goodbye to their wives, that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.300
the world doesn't appreciate you, that the world is like a perpetual ambush (Groucho: No, I never said that. No.)

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.580
Groucho: Pardonne—that's a french world isn't it?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.880
No, I never said the world doesn't treat me well.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.680
Buckley: Page 108 from your book: "The only reason my appearances are rare, and this is something I don't usually disclose,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.970
is because nobody asks me oftener."

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.480
That sounds to me pretty plaintive, doesn't it to your Mr. Chairman? ( Groucho: Yes it is. I am essentially a very sad man)

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.980
Groucho: So why do you ask me if this is a humorous world we're living in?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.280
Buckley: Well, because you've devoted your professional career to trying to stress the humorous aspects of it .

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.550
Now, is this a circle squaring expedition? (Groucho: I have constantly failed in amusing the general audience)

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.830
No, but you haven't—you haven't. Now maybe this is just you feeling sorry for yourself again, but when you get letters

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.990
from perfect strangers, each of them celebrated as a— (Groucho: Threatening is the word)

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.680
No , it's hardly threatening when they ask you for their picture. (Groucho: No, I'm kind of a lovable old ****)

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.140
Well, why are you so lovable?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.140
Groucho: It's because I'm essentially a bastard. No, "seriously folks," they always say that, you know.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.600
in television they always say, "seriously folks," when the comedian

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.400
has deliver and joke and hasn't had a laugh, and he says "seriously folks" to try to avert this joke

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.400
and get on to something more interesting, hoping the next thing will be a joke.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.850
I'm through for the day now you go ahead (Buckley: Well, seriously folks, what I'm trying to say is:)

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.610
Buckley: isn't it true, that this sort of spontaneous fraternity

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.510
of Groucho Marx fans

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.850
grew up on account of the fact that you successfully stressed certain aspects of the world

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.970
and made them perhaps funnier than they are

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.630
now do you regret having succeeded in doing so? Do you consider it a profanation of reality?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.550
I would say that I am a kind of a alter ego

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.890
I think, between what I have invented myself and

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.920
what the writers have written for me over the years, I have said the things that no one else has dared to say, publicly.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.030
Buckley: Why? why? (Groucho: because the audience loves it)

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.770
Groucho: If you had a general, like I had General Bradley on the quiz show, he's a nice man,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.340
a very nice man, and might even conceivably be a good general

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.620
but I kiddin' him all through the show because they don't get a chance to do that

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.820
to mayors, or politicians, or bank presidents, people like them—people enjoy that

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.780
because nobody else does that (Buckley: Well...)

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.680
it doesn't even have to be funny has it has to be a lack of respect for somebody who is important

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.790
Buckley: yeah, but it's very healthy, isn't it? (Groucho: Yes it is, there's not enough of it)

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.640
That's right, because that is the way things in fact are, right?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.570
your point is that five star generals can under certain circumstances be ludicrous, right?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.220
Groucho: Well they are when they're engaged in battle (Buckley: yeah, or on your show)

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.500
Mediator: Mr. Marx, is your point that mockery is basically funny?

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.920
Groucho: Is basically funny? (Mediator: yes) Yes, I think so, but I don't think there's enough of that—I think most comedians

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.800
go on a stage in order to please their audience, and I never did.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.700
I said what I wanted to say and it was up to them if they liked it and if not go to another theater.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.040
Buckley: Yeah, but your point is that what you wanted to say

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.340
was things about the world as you understood the world—roughly speaking, the truth, correct? (Groucho: uh huh)

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.520
Why did you write in one of you letters, "Actually the cigar is a phony,  so is the mustache,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.720
incidentally so am I"?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.720
Groucho: I don't recall saying that and you as the judge here at this moment having a legal background

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.480
I wish you—I'll take a fifth on that

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.380
Mediator: Are you going to object as incompetent an irrelevant? (Groucho: Yes, I'm saying, "Strike that out!")

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.290
Buckley: It was a letter written to Elaine Dundey (Groucho: I said what?)

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.020
That's right. That's right. But anyway, maybe you were feeling, uh

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.270
odd that day (Groucho: Particularly morose, perhaps)

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.110
Which raises the interesting question, why did you include it a collection ten after you wrote it?

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.900
Groucho: I don't remember. I don't remember how I felt ten years—I don't remember how I felt this morning

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.590
while I was waiting for a crust of bead in a Chinese restaurant

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.140
they think a crust of bread is a bag of  rice

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.040
It may be true at a wedding but its not when you want to have breakfast

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.380
Buckley: Well its terribly important to forget some of those things though, isn't it?

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.300
Groucho: To forget things? I think its one of the most important contributions you can make to your own existence.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.040
 

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.070
 

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.870
 

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.810
 

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.290
 

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.840
 

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.190
 

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:00.320
 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.560
 

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.460
 

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.390
 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.720
 

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.600
 

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.120
 

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.160
 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.330
 

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.270
 

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.870

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.820
