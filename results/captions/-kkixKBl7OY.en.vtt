00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.304
- So we're heading to a--

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:09.008
heading to a fight in progress,
several people at a bar.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.811
They're reporting
that it is physical.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.979
It's not an argument.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.949
So we will see what
happens here on this one.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.183
[music playing]

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.486
What's going on?

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:23.690
- They all started a big
old brawl in the bar.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.991
- OK, was you involved?

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:25.792
- I was not.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.026
I was trying to break it up.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.495
- How did your shirt
get all tore up?

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.430
- Because I was
trying to break it up.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.198
- What happened?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.734
- All I know is another
girl charged her.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.835
- OK.
- OK?

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:36.903
- OK.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.304
- And I was trying
to break them all up.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.339
- OK.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.607
- I was trying to
look for my glasses.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.175
- Where's the other girl
that got in a fight with her.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:42.976
- She's gone.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.810
- Oh, she's gone?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.711
- She's gone.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.578
- OK.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.714
- She's over 65 years old.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.483
And if any one of those women
hit my mom, I'm sorry sir,

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:52.485
but I would have
socked that woman.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.586
I don't care.
- And I was--

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.654
- I don't care.
- --holding everybody back.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.955
- He hit my mother-in-law.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.690
- And if you were in this
situation, 60, 65-year-old--

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.025
- She was at our table.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.127
- 65 year old woman, your
mama, what would you have done?

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.262
What would you have done?
- The other girl charged her.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.630
- I can only listen to
one at a time, though.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.734
- The other girl charged her,
and everything was a bust.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.702
- So how did she
get a black eye?

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.838
- Yeah, because she's
the one that rushed him.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.139
- OK.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.541
And what happened with you?
Are you OK?

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.642
You need medical attention?

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:16.543
- I was just sitting
there having a drink.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.844
That's it.
- OK.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.446
Did you get your ID out?

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.647
Did you get your ID out?

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.848
- He's already
working with her--

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.049
- Did you get your ID out?
- Yeah, I got it out.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.250
- So we got it?
OK.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.853
- All right, so Tiffany,
Austin, Darren, and Tina.

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.154
- Tina, yep.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.024
- OK, so under NRS 207-200,
you are hereby trespassed

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.559
from the Hideaway Bar.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.927
If you come back here--
- Cool.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.928
- Yeah.
So hold on.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:35.762
Hold up.
- That's--

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.830
- So you're hereby--

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.664
you're trespassed.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.631
So if you come--

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.233
Darren, listen,
it's very important.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.601
Darren, listen,
it's very important,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.169
so you don't get arrested.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.971
So if you come back,
you're subject to arrest

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.440
or misdemeanor citation, OK?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.441
Do we all understand?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.242
- Yes, sir.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.510
- Yes?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.478
- A couple of them came out.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.846
We tried to diffuse
the situation.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.683
The bar ended up
trespassing them from here.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.018
And one thing led to
another, where, everybody

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.653
was calmed down, ran everybody.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.589
Let's go home.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.457
All right, don't--
don't drive, OK?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.959
- What are we doing now?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.193
- I got-- I'm on a quad.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.228
- What's that?

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.363
You can't drive your
car drunk, either.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.699
You can't drive drunk.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.133
If she would have hit
my mom, I don't care.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:14.934
I am going to jail.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:15.935
- She-- she tried to.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.070
- I would have
been going to jail.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.338
I don't [bleep].
- Sorry, but--

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.572
- I would have [bleep] up.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:20.406
- Sorry--

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.509
- My mom's over 65 years old.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.309
- Tina.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.677
- My quad didn't even start.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:25.678
- But you tried it.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:26.479
Get off the quad.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.313
- Tina.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.314
- My quad isn't even starting.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.249
- Tina.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.350
- Get off the quad.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.150
- Yeah.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.252
- My quad is not even--

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.187
- Get off the quad.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.054
- If you drive--

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.356
if you--
- I know my rights.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.024
- If you drive that quad--
if you drive that quad,

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:38.958
I got your rights.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.293
Your rights are
directly to jail.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.427
- My rights-- it's not my quad.
I haven't even started it.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:41.995
- OK.
- Stop.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.162
Go.
- OK?

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.197
My rights are--

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:44.998
- We'll give you a ride.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.132
- --not even my quad.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.500
It's not even started.
- We'll give you a ride.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.434
- Stop.
Stop.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.102
- Stop.
You stop.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:49.903
- Tina.
Hey, Tina.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.603
- Come on.
- Real quick--

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.237
- No, I know my rights.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.071
I know my rights.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.606
- Tina, I know your rights too.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.375
And you're working
at a quick jail ride.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.509
For a ride to jail.
- You know what?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.544
What-- what's my right?

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.678
- So what-- so let's
get off the quad.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:02:59.746
- And what are you going
to take me to jail for?

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.680
- No, we're not going
to play this game.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.648
So why don't we--

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:02.348
- Oh, you guys want
to play a game?

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.216
Let's start.
- Stop.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.017
- We--
- Tina.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.218
- What's going on?

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.519
- What's going on is you
need to get off this quad,

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.620
and find another way home.
- Tina.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.888
- I'm going to get a ride home.
- Tina.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:09.889
Tina.
Listen.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.024
- This is my ride
home, right here.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.525
- OK, then go.
- And shut up, and listen to me.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.326
- No, listen.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.295
- Shut up and listen to me.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.030
Shut up, please.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.731
No, shut up and
listen to me, please?

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.866
- OK.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.100
- My dad is on our way
to come pick us all up.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.135
- Yeah, I know.
I know.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:23.770
- Then get off the quad, please.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.837
- Oh, no, I'm not on the quad.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:25.872
- No, but mom--

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.041
- I'm just sitting
on my [bleep] quad.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.642
And these guys want
to [bleep] arrest me.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.543
- No, no.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.078
- No, no, no, no, no. no, no.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.313
- Tina.
- Stop!

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.347
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.748
- To stop someone
from going to jail.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:36.883
- Stop.
- Tina.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.284
- No, no.
- Come on, mom.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:38.985
- Tina, Tina.
Listen to me.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:39.619
- Calm down.
- No.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.853
- Let me hold her.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:41.788
Shut up.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.789
- We're going to jail.
- Shut up.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.890
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.224
- It's too late.
It's too late.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.225
- We're going to jail.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.193
- The deputy has
already made the call.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.461
- Wait!
Wait, no, why is she going--

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.662
- She's-- she's too drunk.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.597
- No, there ain't no
reason to take her to jail.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.331
- No, no, no, no.
- Whoa, come on.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.398
Come on.
Just walk away.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.733
- There's no reason
to take her to jail.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.735
- Hey, you both are
going to go to jail.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:56.769
- Somebody's got-- somebody's--

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.204
- You've got no reason.
- Hey!

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.005
- You got them there.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.006
- Come on.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.641
Stop fighting.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.776
What are you doing?

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:04.677
I got her.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:05.478
- Hey!

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.412
- Get her over.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.213
- I got her.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.081
[shouting]

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.850
- Huh?
What about that?

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.151
- Stop, just--
- What about that?

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:12.952
- Are you clear?

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.520
Are you clear?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.222
- You're the man
now, aren't you?

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.523
You're a man now.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.791
[shouting]

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.562
- You're a man now.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:23.796
- You can believe what you want.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.797
- You ready for the other one?

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:25.665
- Yep.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.567
- Tina!

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.136
- Don't move.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.170
- Take them.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.073
- What the [bleep]
just happened?

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.676
Holy [bleep].

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:39.045
- Yeah, you're a [bleep] bitch.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:39.979
- Is he detained?

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.014
- Yeah.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:41.814
- 792.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.650
Detained.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.320
- Two people are going to jail
for obstruction, resisting,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.390
and I believe we got both
of them on battery on PO.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.891
- You [bleep] bitches.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.927
Hope you sleep good tonight.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:55.962
- I will.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.665
- Go [bleep] take
the tweakers, bitch.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.400
[police radio chatter]

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.768
- Don't fight.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:02.568
- Just let it go.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.770
We'll get you.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.171
- Would have been nice
if they'd just went home,

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.374
but you know, eventually
the alcohol really shows up,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.077
and it's just sad.
