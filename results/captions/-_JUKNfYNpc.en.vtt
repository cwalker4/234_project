00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.080
Set...

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.960
It's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.360
The old adage is true for
every sport in the Olympics,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.840
be it taekwondo...

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.800
..table tennis...

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
..or triathlon.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040
While a good start
in any event is important...

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.760
..the real glory is at the end.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.320
A gold medal may be the
ultimate glory in the Olympics.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.680
But sometimes something
remarkable comes along

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.040
to remind us of the true
Olympic spirit.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.000
Something that shows Pierre
De Coubertin's original vision.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.520
In 1992, British athlete
Derek Redmond

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.640
was one of those taking
part in the 400 metres.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.400
Derek had missed
out on taking part

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.800
in Seoul 1988 by mere minutes.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.200
An injury meant that he
withdrew

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.720
and watched from the sidelines

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.440
as Steve Lewis won gold
for the US.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.640
But that was in the past.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.760
By Barcelona 1992,
Derek was injury-free

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680
and determined to win
a place on the podium.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.000
That wasn't something
unfeasible either -

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.200
he had already shown
he was no stranger to winning.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.400
The year before, in 1991,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.960
he was part of the British
4 x 400m relay team

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.120
that had won gold
at the World Championships,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.520
and Derek was confident

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.120
he could add to that success at
the Olympics.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.080
His first heat was a solid run,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.920
with his quickest time
in the last four years.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.080
A great start to the Games.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.440
By the second heat, Derek was
starting to find his groove.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960
He won his heat again,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.440
and looked like he still had
plenty of gas left in the tank.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.960
Once it was time for the
semifinals,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.520
Derek was confident he would
be racing in the 400m final.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.360
He just had to get through
this last test.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.200
I had a great warm-up, stride
and everything went well,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.520
came out on the track, put my
blocks down, no problems,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480
told us to strip down,
stripped down.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.680
Then you have the little bit

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.200
where you're standing
in your lane

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080
and they come and shove
a camera in your face

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.400
so everyone can
see who you are,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.840
blocked that out
and everything.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.480
He said, "On your marks,
get set..."

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.160
Listos...

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.320
The race started well.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.680
I couldn't believe that
I was running that quick.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.800
It's hard to tell positions
in the 400m

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.800
due to the staggering
of the athletes,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.880
but Derek was holding his own,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.240
well within the time he would
need to qualify for the final.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.680
Then it happened.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.400
The next thing I heard
was a funny pop.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.360
Derek knew immediately
that he was in trouble.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.680
The funny pop had been
his hamstring tearing.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.520
A few more steps and
he fell to the floor in agony.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.920
In severe pain, Derek could
only hold his head in his hands

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.600
as the other competitors
sprinted to the finish.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.520
DEREK: I watched them
go over the line,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.080
and obviously I knew it was
over.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.840
Four years of hard work and
waiting,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.840
and it was all over in the most
painful way possible.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.800
But Derek had not travelled all
this way

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.480
to not finish another race.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.840
The bitter memory of
missing out in Seoul

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.080
had stayed with him.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.400
As medics came
to help him off the track,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.800
Derek refused to go out
without a fight.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.200
Obviously in pain, he was going
to finish this race,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280
no matter what it took.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.360
But Derek wouldn't have to
finish this race on his own.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.600
Barging his way through the
stands came his father, Jim,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.840
desperate to help his son
in any way he could.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520
Derek struggled through the
pain

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.560
to embrace the man who had
done so much for his career.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.160
The pair continued
down the last 100m.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.680
Back in Derek's home town,
Northampton,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.240
the sight of seeing her brother
and father

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.920
struggle so dramatically

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.800
sent Derek's pregnant sister
into labour

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.000
earlier than expected.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.600
In great pain,
and struggling to move,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.280
Derek was in floods of tears
as he finally crossed the line.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.840
But the crowd roared the pair
on.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.720
And while Derek may have failed
in his bid to win a medal,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.200
finishing the way that he did
made him an instant celebrity.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880
The sight of Derek
using his father as a crutch

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040
has become one of
the enduring Olympic images.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.440
People gave Derek messages of
support from around the world,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.680
praising his sportsmanship
and perseverance.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.960
It was the ultimate show
of the Olympic spirit.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.520
Competing against the pain,
despite the heartbreak,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.440
not for the glory of winning,
but to cross that finish line,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.000
and proving you don't
have to be a gold medallist

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.760
to be an Olympic hero.
