00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.300
- I once accidentally bought a horse.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.300
- Sorry? You bought a what?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.760
- A horse.
- A horse. Sorry, I missed the s.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.240
LAUGHTER

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.080
You claim that you once accidentally bought a horse, am I right?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.280
- You're right.
- Fine. We're all clear.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.600
Under what circumstances? What did you think you were buying?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.720
Erm... I never thought I was buying anything, I thought I was renting.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.600
LAUGHTER

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400
Did you think you were renting a horse?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.760
- Yes.
- So you paid to rent a horse and then at the end when you tried

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.600
to return the horse they said, "What the hell are you doing?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640
"I've been trying to get rid of Psycho for years."

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.560
That's pretty much it.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.300
How long had you imagined that you were going to rent it for?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900
- We thought we were going to rent it for 25 minutes.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.760
Stephen Mangan: And did they charge you?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160
It was in Bulgaria, on holiday.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.520
OK, and so what did it cost in local Bulgarian currency?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.840
What is the local Bulgarian currency?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.320
Er...

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.160
LAUGHTER

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.760
It was...it was 200 Lev. Lev. L-E-V. I don't know how you pronounce it.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.080
- How much is that in sterling, roughly?
- Roughly...
- At the time.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.080
At the time, I think about Â£90, so we thought it was a good deal.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.920
- Â£90 for 25 minutes. 
- For 25 minutes on a horse.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.560
- But you said, "We thought we were going to rent it for 25 minutes. 
- There was me and my friend.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.880
- It was a lad's holiday. We were 18 and thought, "We'll go horse riding. 
- In Bulgaria?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.560
Did you question the odd sort of time slots they were going for?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.280
I mean, I've never been pony trekking, but I imagine

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.920
they sort of rent you the horse for perhaps a couple of hours. Or at least a solid half hour.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.720
You get 25 minutes, then the horse needs a break for five minutes...

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.680
Then you keep the horse forever.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.480
- Well, I never knew that. 
- What happened when you tried to take it back?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.680
The guy explained to us that... The guy was gone.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.240
LAUGHTER

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.520
Never say the phrase on this game

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.920
"The guy explained to us that he'd gone"?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.880
Never say that.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.800
There were two different guys.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.040
You have to go through me if you want to speak to my client.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.040
- There was Guy A. Guy A.
- Guy A? That's a Bulgarian name. 
- It's very well known.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520
The most famous Bulgarian name.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.440
The guy, Dimitri, I think that... No, Guy A...

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.480
LAUGHTER

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.400
- And Guy B, right?
- Right.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.760
We thought we were going horse riding and we were heading towards

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.160
- the place where you actually hire the horse...
- Stables!

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.040
The stables, right?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.440
I think he's making it up and I'm on his team.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.800
Bit of patience, Brian, come on.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.560
We met a guy on the way who had a horse and we thought he was doing

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.440
that thing in Asda when you've got a shopping trolley,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.200
you're taking it back, somebody else needs a trolley and you say, "Want this one?"

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.080
So we thought the guy was saying...

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.680
- "No need to go all the way to the actual stable. I'm from the stable..." 
- Yeah.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.200
"So just hire this horse..."

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.840
- That's what the guy said.
- Yeah.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.160
So there was a bit of a communication breakdown.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.960
There was a Bulgarian guy trying to speak English and two Scottish guys trying to speak English,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.240
so we thought the guy had given us the horse to ride and come back...

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.000
Were you not surprised? I mean, I've never been on holiday to Bulgaria,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920
but I imagine that things would be a bit cheaper in Bulgaria than in Britain.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.880
Were you not surprised it cost you the equivalent of Â£90 to hire a horse for 25 minutes?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.760
Well, it was 25 minutes each. There was two of us.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.320
So we chipped in for the horse.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.120
For 25 minutes each.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.560
But still, if you thought you were going to get 25 minutes each, that's a lot, isn't it?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.120
It's an hour. You need to give the horse a break, as I said.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280
Let's forget about the 25 minutes.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.360
Just forget about the horse.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.080
That's absolutely, obviously bullshit.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.760
You take the horse back,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.720
Guy B, who is the guy you met on the way to the stables...

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.960
He's gone. He's gone, no sign of him.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.440
So you say to Guy A, "Well, we hired this as part

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.800
of your not bothering to actually go to the stables, but getting a few hundred yards away scheme.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.160
"We hired this horse for 25 minutes at an extortionate rate. Nevertheless, here it is.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.360
- And what did he say? 
- We went back to the place where we picked up the horse.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.400
- Oh, so not to the stable.
- No. 
- But to the random point in the road.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.760
Couple of hundred yards from the stables. Bewilderedly, "Where has the mysterious man gone?"

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.300
I would have thought, logically, when you were returning it, having thought that he'd have come from

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.000
the stable that you'd been lucky not to have to walk to the stable before hiring it,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
- you might nevertheless have thought, "Well, the stable's where it's got to go back to"
- Yeah.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
..rather than, "Well Sod 'em, this is where we picked it up from. That's your fatal mistake.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.680
I'm going to stand here 300 yards away from the stables,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.160
"Come over here! Come and get your own horse!"

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.440
At which point, locals start waving, "No. You keep."

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.360
- Kevin, look at me, look at me. You're taking the horse back... 
- "Look at me"?!

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.520
What happened next?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.840
Come on, Kevin, come on.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320
So where are we taking it up from?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.720
- You're taking the horse back. 
- No, let's go back to the start.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.960
Kevin Bridges, for the love of God,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.480
please tell us what happened.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.760
Right.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.000
We bought a horse, we thought we'd rented the horse, we did the horse riding,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.200
- took it back to the actual place we picked up the horse...
- Yes.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.840
Locals explained we'd been to a counterfeit horse guy who wasn't an official horse riding stable...

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.280
This is a counterfeit horse?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.600
This wasn't a genuine horse, this was maybe two guys in a costume.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.120
That would explain the 25 minutes. I can only do 25 minutes.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.000
The giveaway was after 25 minutes, when one went...

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.320
"Right, let's crack on, lads."

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.120
So, David's team, what do you think, truth or lie?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.920
LAUGHTER

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.520
I mean, the trouble with this game is it plays tricks with your mind,

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.360
but I don't think it's true, you don't really think?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.920
- It's got to be, hasn't it? 
- It's got to be a lie.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.240
- It's got to be.
- Yeah. 
- You're saying it's a lie.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.600
- So here we go, this really is... 
- This is the moment.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.120
This is more than any other episode I've done of this show

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.080
this is the moment we're waiting for.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.160
Kevin Bridges, is it true or is it a lie?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.520
It's true.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.680
CHEERING

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.160
Unbelievable.
