00:00:00.756 --> 00:00:02.255
( fire crackling )

00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:03.589
Littlefinger:
This is for you.

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:11.088
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:12.922
but your mother
fought him off.

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:23.755
The other dagger,

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:26.421
the one that
took her life,

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.630
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.047
if I could have.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.756
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:40.463
But I am here
for her now

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:43.171
to do what she would have done,

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:45.130
to protect her children.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.630
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.964
you need only ask.

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.171
Do you know
who this belonged to?

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:01.879
No.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.713
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:10.129
In a way, that dagger made
you what you are today.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.004
Forced from your home,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.505
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:19.256
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.838
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:36.463
only to find such chaos
in the world,

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:37.505
I can only imagine...

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.464
Chaos is a ladder.

00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:45.631
( door opens )

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:51.838
( exhales )

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.755
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:56.172
I'm not Lord Stark.

00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:09.672
What's that?

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:11.672
Maester Wolkan built it for me

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.213
so I can move around
more easily.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:15.047
It's a very good idea.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.756
You're leaving.

00:02:21.047 --> 00:02:22.713
I don't want
to leave you,

00:02:22.714 --> 00:02:25.713
but when...
when they come,

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:27.422
I need to be
with my family.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.505
And you're safe.

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:32.381
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:35.714
You don't
need me anymore.

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:38.339
No, I don't.

00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:43.918
That's all
you've got to say?

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:46.964
Thank you.

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:50.421
Thank you?

00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:52.089
For helping me.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.213
My brother
died for you.

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:58.921
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.256
I almost died for you.

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.089
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:11.588
Not anymore.

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.755
( crying )

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:17.046
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark,

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:20.548
but I remember
so much else now.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.256
You died in that cave.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.839
( crows cawing )

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.173
You came home.

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:43.048
I saw you
at the crossroads.

00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:46.213
You saw me?

00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:48.713
I see quite a lot now.

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:53.546
Bran has... visions.

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.713
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

00:04:55.714 --> 00:04:57.963
So did I.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.838
Why would you
go back there?

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.422
Cersei's on
her list of names.

00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:15.838
Who else
is on your list?

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.589
Most of them
are dead already.

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:31.047
Where did
you get this?

00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:32.464
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

00:05:33.756 --> 00:05:36.005
Littlefinger?
He's here?

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:37.880
He has declared
for House Stark.

00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.755
Why would he
give you a dagger?

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.255
- He thought I'd want it.
- Sansa: Why?

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.963
Because it was
meant to kill me.

00:05:43.964 --> 00:05:48.838
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.713
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:54.755
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:55.921
He's not
a generous man.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.297
He wouldn't
give you anything

00:05:57.298 --> 00:05:59.214
unless he thought he was
getting something back.

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:04.588
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.505
I don't want it.

00:06:10.797 --> 00:06:11.839
Are you sure?

00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:14.546
Arya:
It's Valyrian steel.

00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.922
It's wasted
on a cripple.

00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:34.422
( people chattering )

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.630
( bleating )

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:56.213
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

00:06:56.214 --> 00:06:58.588
You kept your vow.

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.005
I did
next to nothing.

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:01.921
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.505
I'm not a...

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.298
Thank you, Podrick.

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.505
( raven cawing )

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.380
( waves crashing )
