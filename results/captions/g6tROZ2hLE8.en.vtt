from the howard hughes medical institute

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:30.339
the two thousand five holiday lectures
on science

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.380
this year's lectures evolution

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100
constant change and common threads

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.970
will be given by doctor shaundy carol

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.410
howard hughes medical institute
investigator at the university of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.490
wisconsin madison

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.820
and doctor david m kingsley

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.050
howard hughes medical institute
investigators at stanford university

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.550
school of medicine

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.610
the first lectured is titled

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.540
endless forms most beautiful

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.060
and now it to introduce our program

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.280
the president of the howard hughes
medical institute

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.150
doctor thomas check

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.520
welcome to the howard hughes medical
institute

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.620
and to our two thousand and five holiday
lectures on science the thirteenth in

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.990
our annual series

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.410
where webcasting here live

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.810
uh... from our

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.190
h_ h_ m_ i_ headquarters and chevy chase
maryland and with us in the audience are

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.590
two hundred high school students from
throughout the greater washington d_c_

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.970
area

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.860
the mission of h h m i is to make
discoveries in biomedical sciences and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.770
to foster uh... vibrant science
education and nothing brings these two

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.259
activities together as well as having

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.920
argues investigator speaking to a local
high school students

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.060
to learn more about the institute go to
our website h h_m_o_ i dot pork

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.630
are important topic for these lectures
is evolution it's safe to say that all

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.229
of the h h_m_o_ eyes

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.950
research activities

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.590
depend on the central unifying concept
of evolution

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.029
evolution is as fundamental

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:19.519
and its central to modern biology as the
law of gravity or the law of

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.239
conservation of energy is to physics

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.829
in the year two thousand

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.709
i had the opportunity to travel through
the galapagos islands and to see the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.609
sparse landscape in the exotic

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.299
plants and animals

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.120
that inspired are charles darwin's great
idea

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.959
and similarly a lot of researchers who
are particularly drawn to evolution tend

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.930
to enjoy natural history and feel
biology our lecturers for this series

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.109
sean carroll and david kingsley are no
exception although they are in their

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.480
bread and butter

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.379
in the research laboratory

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.289
they also spent time in the field
hunting fossils chasing animals studying

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.019
habitats

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.389
our first speaker sean carroll

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.549
is in a trait shammai investigator at
the university of wisconsin in madison

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.000
sean trained

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.510
in molecular biology

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.979
and became interested in how genes
control embryonic development

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.629
as shawn's work and developmental
genetics progressed he began to

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.680
appreciate the key role

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.979
that the same genes played in the
evolution of species and he became one

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.689
of the

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.219
main contributors to a new field called
evoke devo

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.490
which stands for evolutionary
developmental

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.379
biology his passion forty vote devo

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.960
let him recently

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.820
too right

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.419
a popular book

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.109
endless forms most beautiful

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.340
and in fact this is the title

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.489
that he's chosen for his first lecture

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.489
here to introduce our speaker is a short
video

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.459
i think my interest in science started

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.189
as a little kid

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:22.760
i would like to stroll out into the
backyard and flip over lawns

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.199
and i just like

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.860
looking for critters

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.409
and i love the vessel thrill you got

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.679
flipping over a longer turning over a
rock and seeing and we had never seen

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:32.999
before

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.530
and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.419
depreciating how they live their
patterns their body forms is that i

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.110
always had the sense that i was going to
be interested in biology

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.009
and as i started to learn about how
biologist worked

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.110
and then as i entered college and had
the opportunity working nights and all

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.439
that i knew i was

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.569
on the right path

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.189
ait was clearly interested in
understanding

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.419
machinery of how major works

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.370
uh... how cells were calgene's work

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.870
and so the first phase of my career was
devoted towards understanding some of

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.649
the

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.440
mysteries and going in

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.039
field called developmental biology which
is the study of how

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.150
adults developed

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.909
uh... but i understood also there's a
deep connection between that area

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.939
and the evolution

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.900
because all four levels by changes in
the bells

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.389
some interesting development

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.690
you understand something about them

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.590
i'd been working at that interface

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.010
all of the ideas about evolution at work

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.319
human health

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.219
because we are living species

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.520
we are variable we have been and are
subject to

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.199
forces like natural selection

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.309
part of our genetic makeup has been
sculpted by battles in the past with the

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:50.580
pathogens that we've encountered as
human spread across the globe so we are

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.460
involved in still evolving

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.919
species

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.180
in the most practical aspects

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.469
uh... our medical

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.439
lives are intertwined revolution because

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:06.009
reconnaissance arms race with the
pathogens

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.580
affect us michael for the holiday
lectures is too

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.399
arouse interest

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:20.399
natural history

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.080
evolution is the big ideas

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.060
in biology

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.770
lifeless course to be experiment on

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.900
so there's really no bigger idea to get
your head

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.370
and for those of us who spend a couple
of decades

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.039
trying to understand

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.539
what individual organisms dealing with
species are how they change

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.069
found one of the relationships to each
other

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.060
very march

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.309
and still extending subject

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:53.999
good morning

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:55.710
journey here a lot about evolution

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.020
for next two days

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.710
i think you hear a lot of new things
about evolution next two days

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.649
in doctor king's denied agreed that
perhaps

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:07.940
the vast majority of what you hear is
not even text books yet

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.090
and it's a sign

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.299
of the figure an evolutionary science in
two thousand five

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:16.000
but all of the five has deep roots

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.960
improves that started

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.409
you know very dramatic way in the
nineteenth century

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.959
and so our discussion of evolution
today's going to begin with charles

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.180
darwin

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.490
for as we'll see is contributions

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.129
were announced

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:32.639
and they've endured

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.220
and then expanded upon now for a hundred
and fifty years

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.300
i think his contributions

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.189
scientists

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:43.219
don't realize the scope of his work
until you actually dig into the many

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:45.559
books many contributions at uni

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.509
over life's work

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.379
so in this first lecture

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:50.710
i would tell you about

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.959
darwin's key ideas and how he arrived at
them

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:58.169
and in the following lectures dr king's
and i are going to focus on

00:07:58.169 --> 00:07:59.960
the expanding understanding of how

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.889
evolution works

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.169
so let's start

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:04.539
with charles darwin

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:08.039
i'll say perhaps in the mist undead most
misunderstood characters in the history

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:11.259
of science i hope the next fifteen or
twenty minutes you gain a better

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:14.689
appreciation of just who this person was

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.439
was this greatest of all naturalists

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:21.809
always destined for greatness

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:24.579
now among the high school students here
in the audience how do you work

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:27.830
pondering a medical career some sort
show here

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.870
very high percentage of k

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.450
so was charles darwin

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.910
in till he saw surgery for the first
time

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.670
and surgery in the early nineteenth
century was

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.860
not the very sterile process that you
see on television two thousand five

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.060
it was in very our rapid process because
without the anesthesia the idea was to

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.700
uh... get it over with quickly before
the patient uh... rejected too

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.930
strenuously

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.939
so are

00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:57.129
darwin now he wasn't covered with
surgery he was a couple of the site of

00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:00.310
blood he had a fairly queasy stomach

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.210
so after two years of medical school
that he started at age sixteen

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.320
he washed out

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.040
and it was clearly not going to be the
thing for him

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.510
any change colleges he moved to the
university of cambridge

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.650
and he took up

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.009
some of his passions

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.410
which were natural history

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.070
beetle collecting

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.830
running around the countryside he was a
good shot

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.880
is a good horsemen

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.690
he enjoyed a lot of hobbies

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.480
he was brought up in a fairly wealthy
household the son of a physician

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.440
he enjoyed certain advantages

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.850
he likes reading

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.270
and he read about specifically earlier
british nationalists who had explored

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.530
the tropics

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.370
and being in danger

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.910
graying dreary cold windy

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.810
unheeded

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.230
he wanted to go to some warmer more
vibrant places

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.940
his wealthy father fearing

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.980
his son was amounting to nothing

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.880
uh... just enjoying himself and that
setting his talents to anything serious

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.630
his options were relatively limited
netday nations he wasn't gonna be a

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.150
physician and the more respectable
option would be

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.800
for example for charles to join the
clergy

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.920
and so that's what

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.030
darwin's father chose for him that he
would enter divinity school at cambridge

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.690
study divinity

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.940
and become for example a country parson
and he would be able to then

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.750
uh... take his national history pursuits
living out in the country sort of as a

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.090
hobby

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.440
so that was the plan yes the clergy
that's for darman his head

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.810
fate intervened

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.840
and darwin while he's preparing a study
divinity

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.260
was unexpectedly offered the chance

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.680
to avoid jazz as ships naturalist with
the british navy

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.700
being only twenty-two

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.340
financially dependent

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.120
fresh out of college

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.790
he had to ask a stance permission

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.580
anne was turned down

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.210
his father had many reasons and i went
out of these reasons down and this is a

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.230
copy of it than original document
darwin's notes

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.399
of his father's objections to this
voyage

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.120
louise your to redeem in this version

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.830
so what were his father's objections
with his voyage would be disreputable to

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.030
his character is a clergyman hereafter

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.380
that it was a wild scheme

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.210
that made the navy must have offered the
job too many others before him

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.460
the place naturalist this was true

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.930
darwin was not the first choice

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.059
because it was not accepted there must
be something wrong with the vessel

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:33.690
or the expedition

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.240
that he would never settle down to a
study life here after

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.160
that his accommodations would be most
uncomfortable this was definitely true

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.940
that he doctor darwin would consider it
things again changing his profession

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.500
blitz which ones from medicine to the
clergy

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.330
and they would be about early useless
undertaking

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.670
and darwin

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.640
in a systematic manner that was sort of
the his whole approach to life that it

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.960
as well as science believe in marriage

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.390
he worked on a rebuttal a point-by-point
rebuttal of each of these injections

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.340
consulted with his own corn with able to
finally persuade his father to let him

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.600
go

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.830
so it just aged twenty two

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.590
he set off on a voyage that was claim to
be a two-year voyage around the world

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.450
it wound up

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.840
taking five

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.340
so he left england and never saw his
family for five full years

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.179
most of that time spent on a rickety
wooden boat called the h_m_s_ beagle

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.840
in cramped quarters

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.200
experiencing

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.090
storms at sea

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.150
earthquakes imports

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.460
and for darling

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.790
sea sickness for the entire forage

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.170
queasy stomach haunted him not only

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:47.860
for medical school through this wage but
his entire adult life

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.770
so off they went

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.729
and on board

00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.760
with these relatively limited amount of
space

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.680
darwin had to figure carefully what was
going to take on this voyage

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.710
well he brought supplies it a natural
sweden and he brought

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.019
pickle jars and he brought notebooks and
he brought all sorts of

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:06.410
uh... pens and pencils and things to
draw specimens and

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.340
other supplies you need to ship
specimens home because he was gonna

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.040
carry all this stuff

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.610
for this multi year voyage with him he
was going to ship some back on british

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.730
ships we're going home that they passed

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.970
on the sea routes

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.010
well among the things he had won the
most important were couple books one

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.250
book

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.429
charles lyle's principles of geology

00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:30.289
a brand new book at the time that
offered a pretty dramatically new vision

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:31.720
of geology from

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.680
of the wisdom of the recent decades

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.020
and darwin

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.660
uh... was very keenan geology he had a
lot of experience that while at

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.820
cambridge of going across the english
countryside which has lots of

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.439
interesting geological formations in
darwin took

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:48.230
extra care to learn about them

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.720
second bookie had with him was the holy
bible

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.000
who's gonna study for the clergy
considered this book

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.830
his authoritative reference on all
matters of morality

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.520
and he would quote

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.630
onboard ship

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.380
literally directly from the bible and
and read through that some of the

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.540
sailors

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.210
the geological background aren't having
his grasp of geology

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.140
was absolutely critical

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.749
to his future success is a naturalist

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:18.529
this is one element that he had running
through his brain

00:14:18.529 --> 00:14:20.519
that other naturalists of the time

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.260
perhaps did not

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.470
what darling

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:28.400
understood from reading while from some
of his personal experiences

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.130
that landforms change

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.820
that was a relatively new idea at the
time

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.070
secondly

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.580
he began to understand the immensity of
time

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.370
at the earth was much bolder

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.450
than he'd been first led to think

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.319
so just those ideas were percolating in
his mind as he started

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:49.480
to voyage around the world

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.770
one of the topics he first started to
think about

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.640
prompted by the my scene interestingly
informs us they passed by indigenous

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.740
people

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.510
was how to some of these forms actually

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.260
uh... develop

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.350
and i'm showing you here a picture from
the pacific ocean

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.190
of a series of islands

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.490
uh... the fuel in the background are act
also they're just a little dunes

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.419
surrounded by reams of coral

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:17.290
in the foreground ec pretty familiar
looking island again surrounded by coral

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.210
ring

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.499
now at the time

00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:22.640
and reading while the fought on how
coral reefs formed

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.470
was that every core we can use our adat
ho like that that that that was choral

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.850
that had been built on the edge of a
volcanic crater

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.400
but are we thought this was really
unlikely

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.720
you know underneath the seat on his just
walking away after talking with the

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.280
volcano just pack right up against each
other

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.120
he just didn't think that was right

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.230
and so we thought about this more and he
knew that

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.579
major landforms would sink

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.290
under their weight

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.780
land

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.980
winforms would change over time

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.100
he thought no i don't think that

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.910
coral reefs are all built on the ridges
of volcanic craters that when i look at

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.800
the different types of coral reefs that
exist in the world i see this is all

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.110
different

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.540
stages of the same process

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.699
and darlings first great theory

00:16:07.699 --> 00:16:11.170
wasn't about animals and organisms and
all it was about

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.340
the formation of coral reefs

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.400
and this was his model

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.990
his idea was that

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.900
when for example of all can a guy who
was tossed up out of the ocean

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.510
and the corals would grow around the
shallow water surrounding that island

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.430
that would form what would be called a
fringe in grief

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.600
and then as the women started to sink
shown here in the center of the slide

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.890
overblown would form

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.560
between

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.459
outside reef and land

00:16:36.459 --> 00:16:39.710
and that outside reef would be barrier
reef

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.959
and that is the lansing completely out
of sight

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.180
that's when you have

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.810
these apples formed

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.330
so different stages of the same process

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.560
so long before the book for which he's
most famous

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.400
darwin road an entire book on the
structure and distribution of coral

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.850
reefs putting forth

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.250
his first great theory

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.930
and this

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.790
turned out that i was very contentious
for decades

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.400
to be right

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.750
what this demonstrated wistar one's
ability

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.360
the theorized on a grand scale

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.140
to take a few observations ruminate on
them

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.920
stretches line a little bit more go out
of the boundaries of conventional

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.049
thinking

00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:16.850
and come up with a grand explanation

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:17.720
in this case

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.150
for the four entire

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.699
range of coral reefs that we see in the
world

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:25.140
now what do you see in terms of living
forms

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.620
well darwin's voyage to come to a lots
of interesting places and as soon as he

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.620
got the opportunity get off that boat he
went

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.960
they got on horseback by whatever way
necessary he proved a deep

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.500
jungles of south america

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.280
in these generals he whispered
absolutely delighted absolutely uh... in

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.190
heaven

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.890
to be studying all these

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.470
if i were the colored and diverse forms

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.670
but there were some strange things
things that started to

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.490
making think about

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.260
nature in a different way

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.720
when you see

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.710
he saw flightless birds

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.730
that's peculiar

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.970
every bird he'd seen in england could
fly

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.150
a good fully functional wings

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.070
he saw flightless birds

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.200
he also found in the rocks

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.570
looks very carefully at the geology very
area

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.540
he found fossils

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.090
in this case for example giant fossil
grounds law

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.490
now he knew the worse loss in south
america he saw the slots but these

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.010
fossils box they were huge they were
catholic sides

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.450
much bigger

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.870
and stone started depreciate alder

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.460
than anything he saw around south
america time

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.960
so this is starting to plant some seeds

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.600
and of course he continued on

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.520
west coast of south america

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.390
to the galapagos islands

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.440
and he saw some very unusual creatures
their the prompted a lot of his thinking

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.570
and we have a little video

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.410
about those animals

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.170
swimming lizards

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.010
the famous marine iguanas

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:57.320
giant tortoises large enough for darling
to ride

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.800
there also a good source of meat

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.020
seals seal that were so tame you cook
the sailors could walk right up to them

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.610
they had no predators so they have no
fear of man

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.810
and of course

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.400
the finches

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.820
so as darling sorted piece this together

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.940
he started to develop the notion that
may be contrary to what you've been

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.179
taught

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.350
purchase landforms change

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.880
that species change

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.240
and so is he returned home to end it

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.190
with thoughts of

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.549
flightless birds and

00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:33.280
giant ancient ground swamps and streams
wizards

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.270
he started to connect the dots

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.250
of what he'd seen over the course of
five years

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.310
and really

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.350
from that voyage of five years he had
enough questions the last in five

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.830
decades and it was five incredible
decades of work that followed

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.490
darwinian return england

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:53.779
started a phase it he refers to his own
autobiography is mental writing

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:57.730
what was the meaning of all these things
he'd seen he'd seen many more things

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.560
in any naturalist beforehand

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.100
he had to study these things very
carefully had five years to think about

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.840
them

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.500
all that time on the ship for example

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.349
but he knew that this idea about species
changing

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:10.730
was dangerous

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.180
it was heresy

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.570
it was absolutely contrary to the
doctrine of the anglican church at the

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.590
time

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.020
sardar when u

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.529
he fear eyes

00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:22.400
at great risk

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.960
he kept his thoughts private

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.320
he started writing

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.030
in secret notebooks

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.670
he letter these notebooks that he
finished when he went on to the next so

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.090
we see police these are actual specimens
of organs original notebooks

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.159
some of his writing shown below

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:38.230
in in these ste

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.440
secret notebooks

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.950
he was developing phiri species
formation

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.080
you'd be a long time

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.820
before anyone read these theories

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.750
why secret notebooks why was he
suppressing this

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.410
well told him

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.629
that emu to bill in the species was

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.570
the doctrine of the time

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.840
darling at that time was getting
tremendous praising attention from

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.570
the scientific community in england he'd
been shipping the specimens back and

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.660
the paleontologists were studying the
fossils in the ornithologist for

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.820
studying the birds

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.110
and the mileage is we're setting the
mammals are having a fantastic time

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.460
and our own was a hero when he was
getting all sorts of honors all sorts of

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.820
invitations

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.510
and he knew that he

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.240
what set forth his ideas

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.020
he'd lose

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.510
all these privileges that he was in
joint

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.730
he worried about dishonor to his family
the good darwinian

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.399
if he spoke this heresy

00:21:33.399 --> 00:21:36.870
eventually he also had another another
reason which was he married

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.289
uh... emma his his first cousin

00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:42.809
and he was very sensitive to her
religious devotion

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:44.690
so he knew he would need more evidence

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.030
much more evidence

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.880
and so

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.450
and as he settled down

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.809
he set up really won the most fantastic
whole natural history stores

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:53.940
you could ever imagine

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.970
all sorts of experiments going on

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.600
all based unsworth at home

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.030
he became a pigeon breeder

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.470
it was a rage at the time in england

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.340
and he

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.799
actually frequented various pubs were
pigeon breeders hung out and talk about

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:09.130
their secrets

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.060
darling with mixed very very well five
years onboard ship was sailors taught

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.789
him a good love social

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:16.520
lubrication

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.590
so he did very well

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.760
what darling understood from the pigeon
breeders

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.000
is a fantastic variety can be derived
just with the art of the breeder

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.760
deciding which animals to bring

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.980
anne correctly inferred that all these
wild varieties carrier pigeons in this

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.090
old dutch variety and many more that
were in england at the time

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.740
were all descended from a fairly clean
looking wild rock cajun shown here at

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.100
the time

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.460
and darwin started to think

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.820
well if

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.750
the pigeons can be so different

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.890
descended from an ancestral stock

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.980
one of the actual species

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.500
me things back to the glock abyss
finches

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.460
he learned it

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.149
the finches it he collected were
actually very different from each other

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:59.170
each unique species from different
islands

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.039
than a different beat shape

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:01.999
that dependent

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.940
affected how much of a diet they had
whether the eight knots or fruit

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.030
etcetera

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.770
i thought well if

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.820
and maybe finches are all descended from
some common ancestral stock

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.860
anneke idea enters his mind this is a
page out of one of the secret notebooks

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.620
he conceived the idea that life

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.890
species are connected as in a family
tree

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.750
the ancestors give rise to descendant
species little bit different from

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.399
mrs

00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:27.990
this notion of of of

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.669
life is a tree know when it had before

00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:33.820
and if that's the right description he's
the one understand why wind with life

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.560
branch out to the tree

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.190
and he was reading

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.860
a much colder essay from forty years
earlier this is uh... a quote from his

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.480
autobiography in eighteen thirty eight
fifteen months after he had

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.850
started this inquiry upon his return to
england he happened to read for

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.070
amusement

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.350
malta some populations

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.650
now martha said put forth this idea that
they would be tremendous competition for

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.060
resources now being ultimately lead to
human growth

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.890
will darwin said being well-prepared to
appreciate the struggle for existence

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.910
which everywhere goes on

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.040
from long continued observation of the
habits of animals and plants at what

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.450
struck me under these circumstances

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.100
favorable variations would tend to be
preserved

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.420
unfavorable wants to be destroyed

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.130
when there's competition

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.700
there will be winners than losers

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.279
and that process

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:22.860
would give him a mechanism that would
drive species to be different

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.540
so this is a high at last i have a
theory with each to work

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.590
but no one would hear about this theory

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.500
for twenty more years

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.380
well the states must take hold you must
be very high he had lots of reasons he

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.360
was still young man he was only roughly
thirty when you can see this

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.549
he saw that he has his scientific state
would be

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:50.019
so we kept working and he kept working
kept working but eventually

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:52.790
events in life intervened

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:57.330
prompted him to go public we tell you
about two of those events

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.560
darwin father ten children

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.280
he was very much a family man he based
all his work at home he was

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.430
because of his illnesses he had this
queasy stomach all the time

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.770
he really was a home body

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.150
working all day

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:14.440
and among this menagerie of animals
plants controlled

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.460
well his

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.710
firstborn daughter

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.080
he was very very very attached to

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.480
uh... any darwin

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.630
was very very attached to his father
they had a very sweet relationships is a

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.270
very loving child

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.559
uh... she developed

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:29.350
an illness

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.240
despite all the interventions that

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.720
her mother and father took

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.499
she gradually declined

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:38.220
and died before darwin's fairy eyes

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.700
shattered

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.419
absolutely shattered

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:44.059
now he was a more of a middle-aged man
in him

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:45.710
i think this experience

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.180
they don't think well what could be
worse than losing his daughter

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.150
and he was

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.500
flew fearing

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.790
the repre conscience of the scientific
work less

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.250
and then a few years later

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.539
again as he kept working on this massive

00:25:58.539 --> 00:26:00.540
development of the species theory

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.270
a package arrived in the mail

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.000
and it was from a naturalist working

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.590
and the malay archipelago alfred russel
wallis

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.780
wassup walls have gone in

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.639
to the tropics

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:11.420
almost a dozen years earlier

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.559
he had developed a furious species
formation

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:17.970
and knowing darwin's eminence is a
naturalist who sent it to dark

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.060
this he for darwin's approval for
darwin's recommendation of how to

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.620
publish it

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.050
on goodness there's darwin looking at

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.450
in short form

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.390
his life's work

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.930
penned by another scientist

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.210
so he was afraid he was going to be
scooped

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.050
it was terrible timing he had a two year
old son charles junior who was dying of

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.020
scarlet fever at the time

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.520
but darwin's friends his allies which
included the great geologist charles

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.549
lyle and many others

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:49.020
made sure that both wallace's

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.620
and darwin's theories were presented
together tuzla named society in eighteen

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.370
fifty-eight and this was the first
public airing

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.450
on this idea

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.140
that species change

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.750
and that natural selection is a force

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.590
so that's why we talk about our own and
wallace dot wallace always deferred to

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.490
darling

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.899
as having done the greater larger

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:14.050
and more original earlier work on
species formation

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.560
wallace was always humble about that

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.690
so after the appearance of these papers

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.960
darwin pushed on

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.390
in in the next year working anna fiedler
spinach he finally completed

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.270
that everyone is most familiar with

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.620
the origin of species

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.750
it is the amazing book

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.640
still very readable today

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.809
a masterpiece of evidence an argument

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:42.200
he nellie puts forth all of the evidence
he sees financial history four evolution

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.830
in fort snack in his arms

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.370
buddy puts forth all the arguments
against

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:52.409
and by sex that instead all thinking
from arguing with his father

00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:56.100
evidence an argument

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.590
his lectures are largely to focus on two
main ideas in the origin of species

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.210
and our understanding today and how

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.880
evolution works

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.619
but darwin understood to make

00:28:08.619 --> 00:28:10.539
these new ideas

00:28:10.539 --> 00:28:11.380
attractive

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.679
inspiring to a new generation

00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:16.340
you do more than just put forth the raw
facts

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.380
the or just bcs contains all sorts of
poetic passages in the closes with these

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.320
words

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.269
from so simple beginning

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.090
endless forms most beautiful and most
wonderful

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.120
have been

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.800
and are being of all

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.299
and i'm a talk about that we take a long
time for questions

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:33.260
those two main ideas in this book

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.129
and eventually

00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:35.139
how we've learned

00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:37.500
how the process of endless forms of all

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.049
actually occurs

00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:40.799
swiss take a little break

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.659
and open up the room too

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:46.080
some questions

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.400
device publish anything else for the
east d

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.290
prevalence wallace did not become
anywhere near as prominent as darman

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:00.549
wallace published lots and lots of
papers he wrote the great deal

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:05.380
but on his writings never captured the
popular audience that darlington

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.410
and darwin's books themselves inspired a
lot more writers so there were more

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.789
people in the decade following darlin

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:15.730
took up the pen andrew their accounts of

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.790
evolution of their accounts of geology
inspired by the theory set forth by

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.270
so we really don't have a literature
from wallace to read anywhere near as

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.090
extensive as from

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:33.880
and haven't family nine he said he
interest-sensitive has

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.700
when the and thank you

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.360
is that need to find out when he

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.190
nottingham

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.929
that's one question so what about our
one's family

00:29:44.929 --> 00:29:46.500
darling was very

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.250
tender he was very careful because his
wife were so close

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:54.270
and they were so close the playback in
every night for their entire life in

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.270
darwin

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.850
being somewhat compulsive kept track of
the lifelong score i don't remember what

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.630
approx

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.510
they had ten children seven of who
survive to adulthood

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.690
they raise this menagerie together

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.600
he was always very careful of her
feelings

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.279
and she

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:15.029
e she would let her read these things
now in the early eighteen forty three

00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:16.590
first put this

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.150
theory together in sort of outline form

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.010
he let her read it and then asked her to
put it in a drawer and publish it after

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.470
he died

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.330
he changed his mind when he lived lot
longer than expected

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.769
uh... she was well aware of his thoughts

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:34.150
in all she hope for was that it would
not

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.830
his theories would not

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.320
disqualify them

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.860
time and have been together

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.920
there's a lot of very tender
correspondence between the mets on the

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.710
record

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.370
little notes that she would scroll to
him little notes that he was crawl back

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.190
to her

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.460
so it was understood he did not pay the
price that he feared

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.310
with his family whatsoever

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.250
or have to wrap up will save some of
those questions where another question

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.640
answer session after ike

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.679
financial talk here about

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:05.509
what was in the origin of species so
thank you for those questions

00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:08.720
and i owe you a teacher

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.230
so let's move on

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.289
to what's really

00:31:11.289 --> 00:31:13.580
even the origin of species

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.280
new main ideas

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.119
tylenol six hundred pages

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:21.549
it's great reading i really incursion of
sometime take the time to read the real

00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:22.620
thing

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.150
but i would adjust focus point two ideas

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.940
here's the first

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.190
dissent with modification

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.419
darwin said we'll just take it right out
of the origin of species several classes

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:33.450
of facts

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.860
seem to me to proclaim so plainly

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.220
at the end numer both species generated
families of organic beans with which

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.750
this world is peopled

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.970
have all descended

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.620
each within its own classroom group from
common parents

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.480
and all the modified in the course of
dissent

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.239
this

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:53.000
was a huge idea this idea that all life
is connected

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.970
through ancestors back further and
further and further and further into

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.430
time

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.130
it was a bold idea

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.659
very very bold

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:03.690
ever really built on at the time

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.600
a modicum of evidence

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.549
but nonetheless and youth agreement
theory

00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:15.070
dot represents this idea really with his
tree of life this is the only figure

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.970
in the origin of species not a very
happily host rated book

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.659
one figure

00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:22.760
and darwin points out that this great
real life

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.950
fills with its data broken branches
across to the earth

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.380
uncovered the surface whatever branching
and beautiful ramifications

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.050
now if powell wrote like this today all
of my peers would just

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.710
wipe me out

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.860
you're just not allow this kind of
poetry in scientific journals alright

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.980
but i was trying to get people to
understand the inspirational view the

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.710
grand jury of his view of life

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.580
and that's why he talked about filling
the cost of the earth and covering the

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.730
earth with it's broken

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.110
it's beautiful ramifications well what
do you mean by filling the data broken

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.590
branches of the course of the earth

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.000
he's talking about fossils

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.320
he had good first-hand experience

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.179
with fossils and of course fossil record
was one of the best sources of evidence

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.290
of the fact an evolution

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.919
darling as he

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:06.820
explored south america for example

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.609
he was exploring the mountain ranges in
the sea coast in

00:33:09.609 --> 00:33:12.470
to show you hear a couple of uh...
paintings that depicts

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.480
explorers from the beagle going across
south american mountain ranges and the

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.020
bottom is a drawing by darwin mapping
out some of the mountain ranges

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.250
while he was up on a road in the
mountains at thirteen thousand feet anne

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.559
siese fossil waster pants

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:27.370
at thirteen thousand feet

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.840
above sea level

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.550
of course the land forms have changed of
course

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.200
the species have changed

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.140
he understood that life at the surface
of the earth was far more dynamic and he

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.540
was first pot and that most of the world
believed at the time

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.659
so the fossil record is a tremendous
source and insight

00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:47.580
into the actual history the earth in
from about eighteen sixty two not

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.880
nineteen twenty

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.250
after the publication of the origin of
species was a golden era of in

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.960
paleontology christmas spectacular
deposits

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.560
were discovered

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.150
that gold key insights into life's
history

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.350
and the highlights for locations in
north america each of which can be

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.240
visited

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.279
that hold some of the oldest youngest
and most dramatic episodes

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:09.039
in the fossil record

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:11.869
so in a map of the show you some they're
all

00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:13.089
west of here

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:15.419
uh... but as i said some of our

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:17.720
more easily accessible now this is your
seat

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.239
from on some of the pictures of these
locations

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.629
summer start with one of the almost five
full deposits

00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:25.579
i don't talk about the burgess shale

00:34:25.579 --> 00:34:28.999
now this is in british columbia it was
discovered by charles walk on the early

00:34:28.999 --> 00:34:30.060
twentieth century

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.550
that's walcott on the right

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.429
at the quarry that he was working on

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.659
and what came out of the score east

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.379
where these little animals

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:41.509
some somewhat familiar to his trial
bites others it might look a little more

00:34:41.509 --> 00:34:42.479
uh... foreign

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:43.970
aside as an example

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:46.859
these are some of the earliest complex
animals

00:34:46.859 --> 00:34:48.879
in the fossil record

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.149
there over five hundred million years
old

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:53.229
jill specimens can be seen

00:34:53.229 --> 00:34:56.519
right at the smithsonian institution in
washington two-step right inside the

00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:57.889
hall of dinosaurs

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:01.010
and some glass cases right there you'll
see pieces of the burgess shale

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.509
with these very animals that you've seen
pictures of

00:35:03.509 --> 00:35:04.809
inside

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:07.349
so over five hundred million years old

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:08.880
bounce golden younger

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.989
the dinosaur national monument on the
border of colorado and utah

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:16.259
fantastic place both in terms of scenery

00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:17.269
as well as

00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:18.639
fossils

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:20.469
jurassic age deposits

00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:22.759
course drastic should probably ring a
bell

00:35:22.759 --> 00:35:26.719
golden age of the dinosaurs and in
dinosaur national monument early

00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:28.739
twentieth century

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:29.650
phone koris

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.359
were found

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:34.789
the main corey that you can see the
visitor's center at dinosaur national

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:37.250
monument contains attic somewhere over
two thousand

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.919
expose dinosaur bones

00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:42.169
and you see these things exposed like
skulls in major pieces of backbones

00:35:42.169 --> 00:35:44.250
accused dinosaur legs altogether

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.269
this is probably somewhere

00:35:46.269 --> 00:35:49.999
formed by some river washing lots of
bones down all been covered up in

00:35:49.999 --> 00:35:51.010
river sediment

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.649
and so you had just sort of this
hodgepodge of

00:35:53.649 --> 00:35:58.210
uh... dinosaur pieces but many falling
tax skeletons

00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.370
came out of this quarry

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.790
and they have been assembled in and
exhibited in all sorts of natural

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.069
history museums

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:07.149
uh... all over the world

00:36:07.149 --> 00:36:08.269
fossil butte

00:36:08.269 --> 00:36:10.380
this is a national monument this is a

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.639
uh... administered by the national park
service

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:16.399
foss abuse in southwestern wyoming

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:17.280
what you can see it

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.499
of your car these rock formations uh...
this is a very area to area

00:36:22.499 --> 00:36:23.750
uh... endings

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:27.289
layers that you can see here is sort of
a horizontal layers of what they were

00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:29.009
for to his horizons

00:36:29.009 --> 00:36:35.339
some of these horizons are extremely
rich and fossil deposits amazingly rich

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:36.559
and when uh...

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:39.160
the transcontinental railroad was going
through this region

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.170
and they were dynamiting your way
through the rock the workers were just

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.589
going to find

00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:44.940
rocks everywhere

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.419
full a fossil fish

00:36:47.419 --> 00:36:50.450
and the reason why therefore fossil fish
is that fossil butte

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.849
is part of an ancient lake bed

00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:56.139
uh... fifteen million years old and
enormously that covered that region at

00:36:56.139 --> 00:36:56.490
that

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.499
of the united states

00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:00.089
uh...

00:37:00.089 --> 00:37:04.409
in these leaks there would be some
annual dialogues media's as water levels

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:07.949
became lower oxygen levels became known
to be massive die-offs

00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:09.900
and as those fish became covered

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.919
insult

00:37:10.919 --> 00:37:12.169
and then

00:37:12.169 --> 00:37:14.589
protected from further erosion

00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:18.959
uh... for from further decay they became
fossilized and what you can find in

00:37:18.959 --> 00:37:22.209
layers of this rock almost like the
pages in the book that you crack them

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:23.729
open an open them up

00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:24.769
you find

00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:29.060
these mass fish kills mstislav alone
somewhere perhaps eighty fish

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.899
in a piece of rockets maybe

00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:33.599
uh... maybe six people

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:37.069
there other fantastic fossils of fossil
butte to tell us something

00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:39.659
about what the area was like

00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:42.509
this is not the sort of fossil if you
look at the current landscape of wyoming

00:37:42.509 --> 00:37:46.269
this is not the sort of thing you expect
to see perhaps but yes

00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:48.589
fifteen million year old palm trees

00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:52.179
beautiful fossils this one's probably
about eight feet tall

00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:54.079
of palm trees

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:57.940
palm trees are telling us this was a
tropical area semi tropical area

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.710
probably had a climate a lot like south
florida

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.000
fifty million years ago

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.609
very different course today

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:09.089
environments have changed

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.649
the animal forms of change

00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:12.759
platforms of change

00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:15.669
now moving to even very recent deposits
here's a picture

00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:17.349
from about nineteen ten

00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:21.659
of an area known as the low brea tar pit
from a steaming becos oil derricks and

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:24.059
what does or not there to doing is
they're extracting the petroleum

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:28.389
products out of this dead this bed is
full of this

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:29.469
gooey

00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:31.979
stinky

00:38:31.979 --> 00:38:34.880
a petroleum necessary tari sort of
substance

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.550
but had to use as a

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.939
uh... petroleum derivatives

00:38:38.939 --> 00:38:41.159
these carpets are now

00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:44.669
in the dead center of los angeles

00:38:44.669 --> 00:38:47.769
there you are surrounded by los angeles
skyscrapers but these targets have been

00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:49.299
set aside

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:54.149
and preserved as a park and as a museum
because they contain

00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:57.989
the most spectacular deposits icj
mammals

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:00.209
from twelve to fourteen thousand years
ago

00:39:00.209 --> 00:39:03.949
in these bone beds which as you look
down at the news lots of open bone beds

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:05.989
that you can view as you walk through
the park

00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:10.629
if you look in there you see just
powell's of boats and what happened was

00:39:10.629 --> 00:39:14.240
as animals became tracked inist hari do

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.299
let's say something like a mammoth

00:39:16.299 --> 00:39:18.590
scavengers would come along to feed on
it

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.500
and become trapped

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.899
in the target

00:39:20.899 --> 00:39:23.149
and scavengers would come by to feed on
them

00:39:23.149 --> 00:39:25.200
and become trapped in the terry do

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.640
so you just have this piece of the
equivalent of early l_a_ traffic jam

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.259
just a pilot

00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:31.829
of dead animals

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:33.559
forming in these targets

00:39:33.559 --> 00:39:36.720
or the other great benefit is this car
is an incredible preservative salah

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.720
takes a lot of work to clean it off

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.229
the bulls underneath are exquisitely
preserved

00:39:41.229 --> 00:39:42.779
so there's hundreds

00:39:42.779 --> 00:39:48.789
of beautiful skulls of saber tooth cats
in a dire wolves and full skeletons of

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:50.210
neomycin mastodon so

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.369
i like what happens when say a dinosaur
gets washed into rivers all broken to

00:39:53.369 --> 00:39:54.109
pieces

00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:56.380
these things were preserved as they fail

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.690
so spectacular intact fossil self

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.279
one xmas at the l_a_ i highly recommend
visit to a great art

00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:04.939
so what are these

00:40:04.939 --> 00:40:08.409
specimens from the fossil record telus
lee tells four main ideas

00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:13.629
first of all undoubtedly that animal and
plant forms have changed over time

00:40:13.629 --> 00:40:15.680
secondly the time span evolution

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.369
is immense

00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:20.069
i've shown you just the animal record
spanning more than five hundred million

00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:21.479
years

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:22.559
but also

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:26.229
most of the stuff that i'm showing is
not around it all not around anymore

00:40:26.229 --> 00:40:29.389
so extinction is the fate of most p_c_'s
it ever existed

00:40:29.389 --> 00:40:36.309
biologist at the press ninety-nine point
nine percent all species ever existed

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:40.779
environments of every locale has changed
often drastically cell

00:40:40.779 --> 00:40:44.930
fair burgess shale creatures i showed
you those were marine animals now found

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.629
above the tree-lined in british columbia

00:40:48.629 --> 00:40:50.170
those palm trees of course

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.050
look nothing like

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.399
the current landscape

00:40:53.399 --> 00:40:57.539
so environments change and one other
main messages theories i want to tell

00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:58.720
you so much about

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.289
darwin's geological observations and the
fossil record

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:04.450
revealed things

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:09.339
are occupying a planet who surface as
always changing

00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:10.420
hurricanes

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.320
earthquakes volcanoes

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.939
tectonic movement

00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:15.169
ice ages

00:41:15.169 --> 00:41:18.569
climate changes with the local or global
all of these

00:41:18.569 --> 00:41:20.940
keep changing the environments that
species are in

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.109
they are running

00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:23.039
to keep up

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:28.130
and most of the time

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.849
about birth history to understand life's
history with understand what's going on

00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:33.789
any particular place to appreciate

00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:38.859
what's going on in particular species

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:41.749
or record tells us that evolution has
happened but the main questions are

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:42.860
wanted to address

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.580
was how

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.669
and this is the second big idea

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.129
the second big idea

00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:50.339
is natural selection

00:41:50.339 --> 00:41:51.639
philomena

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:54.649
tell you about the whole childhood quote
here from georgia species kit contains

00:41:54.649 --> 00:41:57.080
every element every ingredient necessary
for

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.480
natural selection to work

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.269
as well as the clearest definition of
the process

00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:03.580
darlin says kenneth then we thought
improbable

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.960
but other variations useful in some way
to each being in the great in complex

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.399
battle of life

00:42:08.399 --> 00:42:11.719
should sometimes occur in the course of
thousands of generations

00:42:11.719 --> 00:42:13.549
the such do accordingly doubt

00:42:13.549 --> 00:42:17.129
remembering that many more individuals
are born they can possibly survive

00:42:17.129 --> 00:42:20.450
individuals having any damage however
slight over others

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.079
we have the best chance of surviving
appropriating their current

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:26.719
on the other hand when they feel sure
that any variation in the least agree

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:29.469
injurious would be rigidly destroyed

00:42:29.469 --> 00:42:32.890
this preservation of favorable
variations and the rejection of injuries

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.259
variations

00:42:34.259 --> 00:42:36.319
i call natural selection

00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.780
two sides to the cooling

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:43.439
rejection of things that are

00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:48.509
preservation of those things and more
favorable

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:51.699
one of these ingredients what we look at
the back darwin's quote

00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:53.639
he sang variation

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:54.429
there in red

00:42:54.429 --> 00:42:55.990
thousands of generations

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.319
time an advantage he means selective

00:42:59.319 --> 00:43:01.210
advantage

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.420
so these are the three ingredients this
is the fuel devolution

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.360
variation

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.029
selection

00:43:07.029 --> 00:43:09.400
if you want to think of it they get any
process

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.020
the produces a product

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.490
usually have raw material some work

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:14.470
overtime

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.140
the raw material is very asian

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.640
selection does the work

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.180
anti-nuke it takes a very smacks of time

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.069
for the process to happen

00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:24.779
so that illustrate this process of
natural selection i want to give you

00:43:24.779 --> 00:43:26.040
just one example

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.280
sort of a modern example but it you know
streets all the features that i want to

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.779
tell you about of i've seen these
ingredients of evolution

00:43:32.779 --> 00:43:34.029
and we think about

00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:38.859
the adaptation of a really modest humble
species to a changing landscape

00:43:38.859 --> 00:43:42.099
when showing here is allowable flow
across part of the desert

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:44.399
in american southwest

00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:47.519
over the last couple of million years
there's been a rupture users leads a lot

00:43:47.519 --> 00:43:49.670
of to uh... lava flows

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.599
when that lava cools it forms these
black rock formations

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.479
journal back premise or sandy

00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:57.049
dry soil

00:43:57.049 --> 00:43:58.779
in this habitat loose

00:43:58.779 --> 00:44:01.159
the humble rock pocket mouse

00:44:01.159 --> 00:44:04.269
and that rock pocket mouse occurs in two
varieties

00:44:04.269 --> 00:44:06.059
sandy colored mouse

00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:07.899
and a dark-colored men's

00:44:07.899 --> 00:44:09.210
and showing you these

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.959
animals on different colored backgrounds

00:44:11.959 --> 00:44:15.619
missed any mails that matches well to
the sandy color proc

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:18.459
the dark mouse that matches well to the
dark color rock

00:44:18.459 --> 00:44:22.309
and you can see the mismatch when into
the darkness is unlike rock or the like

00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:25.509
colored version is on dark rock

00:44:25.509 --> 00:44:28.670
and it matters this color matching
really matters with respect

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:32.399
to predators religious explained a
little bit about

00:44:32.399 --> 00:44:37.249
color matching in mice for the short
video

00:44:37.249 --> 00:44:39.009
so when that darkness

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.869
finds itself

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:43.779
white-collar habitat

00:44:43.779 --> 00:44:46.899
kicking me in big trouble

00:44:46.899 --> 00:44:49.279
natural predators are all

00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:52.980
but of course if we change the backdrop
dartmouth blends in well but the white

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.339
colored mouth

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:58.619
isn't running

00:44:58.619 --> 00:45:00.709
so we now know a lot

00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:02.959
about ecology

00:45:02.959 --> 00:45:03.999
about

00:45:03.999 --> 00:45:07.499
the genetics and about the evolution of
this pattern that's what i want to tell

00:45:07.499 --> 00:45:11.439
you the rock pocket mouse inhabits these
please lava flows in the surrounding

00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:16.519
rocks this color mansions importance to
a survival

00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:19.970
there's to forms of the mouse that's all
the same species and that

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:24.079
those two forms are determined by
genetic variation

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.559
there's a single gene

00:45:25.559 --> 00:45:30.799
it will be here called mc one r the
comes into alternate versions or reels

00:45:30.799 --> 00:45:34.420
and sammy colored mice have two copies
of the light at the wheel

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.679
for this gene

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:39.890
the duck mice have either one copy or
two copies

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.129
of the darco

00:45:43.129 --> 00:45:46.899
side of the university of arizona have
pinpointed the exact genetic basis for

00:45:46.899 --> 00:45:48.849
the color of the for color difference

00:45:48.849 --> 00:45:49.640
between

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.729
the two populations of months

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:56.779
let's consider how long would it take

00:45:56.779 --> 00:45:59.929
all-black master rise in the senate
colored population

00:45:59.929 --> 00:46:02.069
that lava flows happened

00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:03.200
how long would it take

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.530
isn't isn't connection selection really
do the job to allow population mice to

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.769
adapt to a new land for in this case
lava rock

00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:12.079
well the ingredients there

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:14.759
have to do the interplay between
variation in time

00:46:14.759 --> 00:46:15.950
and what i'm going to do

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.640
so to walk you through the variables in
milwaukee through quenching little bit

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.669
of the numbers

00:46:19.669 --> 00:46:24.989
and rather than take notes and
discouraging to just follow along

00:46:24.989 --> 00:46:27.630
watch the wash the board whatever don't
worry about the numbers we could always

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.080
go over them again later

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.230
but just follow along the logic of of
crunching the numbers of how these

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:35.269
ingredients of evolution in iraq

00:46:35.269 --> 00:46:38.529
so to know how often a black coat
mutation can arise that's gonna depend

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:40.069
upon three things

00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:42.039
the mutation rate

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:44.229
the reproduction rate in these mice

00:46:44.229 --> 00:46:47.989
and population size i mean my starter
how awfully reproducing

00:46:47.989 --> 00:46:50.530
but we know a lot about the mutation
rate from

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.959
decades of study

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:54.049
and the mutation rate in mice

00:46:54.049 --> 00:46:56.439
is about to mutations

00:46:56.439 --> 00:46:59.819
billion sites in d_n_a_

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:03.179
innate copying is highly accurate but
not perfect

00:47:03.179 --> 00:47:05.279
that was perfect there would be no
evolution

00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:06.430
we need variation

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.239
for the fuel evolution at work

00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:12.669
for about ten sites in the mc one r gina
can be mutated to cause this black type

00:47:12.669 --> 00:47:14.069
of appearance

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:17.249
and there's two copies of the mc one r
gene in every mouse

00:47:17.249 --> 00:47:19.859
we multiply all those together

00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:21.069
when we come up with

00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:23.649
is one in twenty five million mines

00:47:23.649 --> 00:47:24.859
eighteen months

00:47:24.859 --> 00:47:26.819
will have a black coat mutation

00:47:26.819 --> 00:47:28.439
one in twenty five million

00:47:28.439 --> 00:47:31.229
one teaspoon o does that mean

00:47:31.229 --> 00:47:34.400
one twenty five million is that a long
shot does that mean that that i can see

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.299
how this evolution would work

00:47:36.299 --> 00:47:37.379
not at all

00:47:37.379 --> 00:47:38.299
because now we have to

00:47:38.299 --> 00:47:40.219
introduced some other factors

00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:41.540
and those other factors

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.239
on the reproductive rate

00:47:43.239 --> 00:47:44.949
and the population size

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:48.949
so each femaleness population is having
at least five babies

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:51.669
at least five a_b_c_ here

00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:54.689
average population is about five
thousand females

00:47:54.689 --> 00:47:59.309
so about twenty five thousand pocket
mice being born here in this population

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:03.479
now from multiply twenty five thousand
babies times one in twenty five million

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:05.509
that means that we found in years

00:48:05.509 --> 00:48:08.919
there will be spontaneously

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:11.939
mouse born to sandy color parents

00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:13.619
one of thousand years

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:17.889
now let's put it into a logical factor
framework

00:48:17.889 --> 00:48:22.479
those lava flows and showing you summer
one point seven million years old

00:48:22.479 --> 00:48:24.190
so this mutation kind of a reason

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.899
seventeen hundred times

00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:29.509
independently

00:48:29.509 --> 00:48:30.710
plenty of time

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.489
for the raw material to relax

00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:34.819
seventeen hundred times over

00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:36.529
okay so how does this

00:48:36.529 --> 00:48:39.089
black coloration actually spread through
the population

00:48:39.089 --> 00:48:40.479
well that's elections job

00:48:40.479 --> 00:48:43.259
how long does it take for every mouse to
become black

00:48:43.259 --> 00:48:45.339
now we have figure some other variables

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.849
it depends on population size i mean my
southern the population

00:48:48.849 --> 00:48:52.589
and it depends upon something called the
selection coefficient we denote that is

00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:53.779
belittle s

00:48:53.779 --> 00:48:55.860
and that is the advantage

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.919
that allows carrying the black gene

00:48:58.919 --> 00:49:00.669
over my sweetheart

00:49:00.669 --> 00:49:03.609
that's a relative measure of fitness

00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:05.779
measures a product of reproduction

00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:07.569
and survival

00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:11.939
okay so if we put this in terms of if
black twice in general producing a

00:49:11.939 --> 00:49:16.109
hundred and one survivors for every
hundred mice produced by sony colored

00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:17.159
lines

00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:21.489
that's a one percent advantage in we
would write estes point no one

00:49:21.489 --> 00:49:25.489
you've got to see that one percent is
plenty of advance revolution to work for

00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:27.109
natural selection it work

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:29.369
and it is a five percentage

00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:32.469
okay we write dennis as point oh five

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.140
remember decide under one

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.249
two hundred

00:49:35.249 --> 00:49:37.499
compound in overtime

00:49:37.499 --> 00:49:40.529
you're gonna see how this works

00:49:40.529 --> 00:49:43.919
so it's so this in animated in in this
animation

00:49:43.919 --> 00:49:47.509
consider the southwestern united states

00:49:47.509 --> 00:49:49.029
sandy colored

00:49:49.029 --> 00:49:51.819
landscape until some water flows happen

00:49:51.819 --> 00:49:54.839
that lava cools

00:49:54.839 --> 00:49:56.190
and now that black rock

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.089
is gonna be invaded by the senate
colored lights

00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:04.469
once every thousand years or so black
now sister pop up

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:08.369
the owls are going to be there circling
overhead for eons

00:50:08.369 --> 00:50:11.759
and if we start with a population we're
just one else this black

00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:15.259
and we know and has just a one percent
advantage

00:50:15.259 --> 00:50:17.159
watch what happens

00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:18.669
over the generations

00:50:18.669 --> 00:50:21.039
than about a thousand generations

00:50:21.039 --> 00:50:24.439
ninety five percent of the monks will be
black

00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:28.499
that's just natural selection doing the
work one mutation one founding mutation

00:50:28.499 --> 00:50:31.379
can spread in ninety five percent of the
population

00:50:31.379 --> 00:50:34.229
in a thousand generations now what
happens if there's a ten percent

00:50:34.229 --> 00:50:36.869
advantage being black

00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:38.289
very quick

00:50:38.289 --> 00:50:41.529
and a hundred generations ninety five
percent mostly black

00:50:41.529 --> 00:50:44.589
it turns out from measurements in awhile
there's an even greater than ten percent

00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:45.530
advantage

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.520
of mike's being black on the black

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.569
lava flows

00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:50.710
natural selection

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.399
is very swift and

00:50:52.399 --> 00:50:55.689
and the amount of time that we have more
speaking on the geologic time scale for

00:50:55.689 --> 00:50:58.099
evolution at work is ample time

00:50:58.099 --> 00:50:59.680
for mutations to rise

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.539
and for selection to spread favorable
mutations

00:51:02.539 --> 00:51:06.059
throughout populations

00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:09.039
so what's the bottom line the bottom
line is

00:51:09.039 --> 00:51:11.569
that how long it takes for these first
street ste

00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:13.079
traits to spread

00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:15.899
it's a lot faster and most people
realize

00:51:15.899 --> 00:51:19.299
on the order for these things of maybe a
century irma landed and you can hear a

00:51:19.299 --> 00:51:20.749
lot more examples

00:51:20.749 --> 00:51:21.799
about this

00:51:21.799 --> 00:51:24.949
in doctor king's woodstock

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:28.589
suit understand more about the power
selection it's a pride so powerful

00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:30.539
that our civilization depends upon it

00:51:30.539 --> 00:51:32.959
you seemed more about that from dr
kingsley

00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:35.229
so it's raw material

00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:36.689
plus election

00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:37.679
overtime

00:51:37.679 --> 00:51:38.969
that's the formula

00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:41.759
and we see vivid evidence of natural
selection working

00:51:41.759 --> 00:51:43.420
and all sorts of cases

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.999
both natural and artificial

00:51:45.999 --> 00:51:47.919
so let's stop there

00:51:47.919 --> 00:51:50.239
i'll take some questions

00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:57.239
in the back right

00:51:57.359 --> 00:52:00.709
usually

00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:04.579
so the question is how does indication
rice mutation isn't completely random

00:52:04.579 --> 00:52:05.869
process so

00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:07.129
is

00:52:07.129 --> 00:52:08.810
sperm and egg are produced

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.139
for reproduction

00:52:10.139 --> 00:52:12.899
there are air is made in the copying a
d_n_a_

00:52:12.899 --> 00:52:14.019
that women

00:52:14.019 --> 00:52:16.349
these areas change the d_n_a_ code

00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:19.020
every and and and that creates random
variation

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.649
in jeans

00:52:20.649 --> 00:52:23.589
some of those genes control for color
i've told you the example of one of

00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:24.220
those

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.140
so at annual rate

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:29.920
one in twenty five million there are
mice born that look different than their

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.019
parents in terms of for coloration

00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:35.459
but that isn't highly product it just
became a call me to meet a shame that

00:52:35.459 --> 00:52:36.300
happens

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.449
as the billions of sites in d_n_a_ are
copied

00:52:39.449 --> 00:52:43.479
in every generation of us there's about
a hundred new mutations in you that were

00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:48.479
not in your parents for example

00:52:48.479 --> 00:52:54.109
raises money to use the flames and
reduces tonight

00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:56.139
was u

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:58.219
news

00:52:58.219 --> 00:53:00.279
arcane great question

00:53:00.279 --> 00:53:02.629
at overhead child care for him

00:53:02.629 --> 00:53:06.369
the uh... the question is if they were
if the black by steven do you see any

00:53:06.369 --> 00:53:09.330
habitat it's actually very easy to
inactivate this team

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:10.729
so it doesn't work

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.699
and that the mice are lightly pigmented

00:53:12.699 --> 00:53:15.640
possession lots of what ways you can you
take a chance of the frequency of

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.349
actually going black to white is even
higher

00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:20.669
than it is from going white to black

00:53:20.669 --> 00:53:24.109
and there are examples in nature of
where this has happened

00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:28.130
uh... for example there some bears on
the northwest coast of canada that are

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:32.040
all-white for and they have mutations in
this chain have been activated rather

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.529
make it

00:53:32.529 --> 00:53:34.039
form the black for

00:53:34.039 --> 00:53:36.909
so there are both directions are
happening in the wild i can tell you

00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:38.879
that the same gene i'm telling you about

00:53:38.879 --> 00:53:41.819
is responsible for the black color phase
of jaguars

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:44.140
for the black phase of snow geese

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.119
for the black phase a certain other
types of cats

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:50.919
uh... and for some black phases in
domestic dogs

00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:55.289
so this is a gene that have been called
upon repeatedly to end our mammals with

00:53:55.289 --> 00:53:59.559
dark for coverage

00:53:59.559 --> 00:54:05.519
g home resentment usually fine with the
blacking out of the communities on

00:54:05.519 --> 00:54:07.519
inordinately

00:54:07.519 --> 00:54:14.089
commonly found when the mormon just
because the and reforms could be the the

00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:15.259
bernadine

00:54:15.259 --> 00:54:17.959
that's a great question so the question
is about whether it matters with the k

00:54:17.959 --> 00:54:21.240
one or two copies of the of the gene is
released like the difference

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.229
it turns out there's a bit of an
additive effect of these

00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:25.389
of the annuals

00:54:25.389 --> 00:54:27.329
and so that the

00:54:27.329 --> 00:54:29.949
the mice carrying two copies are bit
darker

00:54:29.949 --> 00:54:33.789
they want those carrying one copy that
may be a selective advantage

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:37.019
so that you may be still favoring the
home as i get more than they had a

00:54:37.019 --> 00:54:37.810
recital

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:38.829
but still

00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:42.990
uh... in order to really know that we'd
have to prove pretty large population

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.849
studies

00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:47.659
to end and gina tribal homeland amongst
understand

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:51.639
relative contribution of those two gena
types in a while

00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:55.309
preparing for the camera

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:57.899
up north in the front first

00:54:57.899 --> 00:55:01.619

00:55:09.879 --> 00:55:12.489
just these two taxes just to please
instead

environment and planning

00:55:14.039 --> 00:55:16.709
his black asian

00:55:16.709 --> 00:55:19.109
i don't want to make it sound that
there's a coincidence that all the

00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:23.149
change in the environment courses
outside of the enormous control

00:55:23.149 --> 00:55:26.949
uh... but there are mutations that occur
in population than if you look through

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:30.819
this room at two hundred humans and you
consider our features

00:55:30.819 --> 00:55:31.810
that are visible

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:34.989
hair color i colored skin coloration

00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:38.919
uh... facial features it so you see
tremendous variation if you have that

00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:42.459
sort of a cutie in a mouse population
you'd also if you if you were looking at

00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:45.099
other night she'd say well there's a
little bit a small variation here you

00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:47.959
know friends got a little bigger had
little longer whiskers and color is it

00:55:47.959 --> 00:55:48.819
senator

00:55:48.819 --> 00:55:51.249
so there's tremendous variation in
populations

00:55:51.249 --> 00:55:52.899
now the inquiry here

00:55:52.899 --> 00:55:56.599
the selected pressures on for coloration
because of the setup between predator

00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:58.309
and background-color

00:55:58.309 --> 00:56:01.249
but if you want to say well look what if
the rocks were a little different color

00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:04.929
like say tanner settling back in the
senate with the sandy soil was pure

00:56:04.929 --> 00:56:05.569
white

00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:07.309
with their b advantage for being

00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:10.310
ten coloration in code the mice involved
that color

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.259
and i'd say absolutely

00:56:12.259 --> 00:56:15.569
different sets of mutations difference
elective process but eventually as this

00:56:15.569 --> 00:56:20.359
competition runs if there is an
advantage to particular for color scheme

00:56:20.359 --> 00:56:24.589
this will this process will repeat
itself again and again and again so the

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:28.669
coincidence really the mutations arise
at raymond but there's nothing random

00:56:28.669 --> 00:56:33.049
about selection selection is the
conditions that the animals living in

00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:37.889
and that even predators or for example
nate's impose upon it

00:56:37.889 --> 00:56:41.479
some after wrap up but i'm happy to take
some questions uh... while we have a a

00:56:41.479 --> 00:56:44.149
break you will have many more
opportunities to talk about

00:56:44.149 --> 00:56:47.279
uh... evolution in the process of
national selection over the next three

00:56:47.279 --> 00:56:54.279
lectures

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.059
thank you sean carroll forgetting our
lectures on evolution off to a really

00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:07.159
great start

00:57:07.159 --> 00:57:12.109
it's amazing to see how darwin's
insights continue to inform today's

00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:17.789
research and thank you students for some
really great questions now we're going

00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:23.949
to take of thirty minute break when we
resume david kay slay will focus in on

00:57:23.949 --> 00:57:28.809
this idea of the role of selection and
how it plays into evolution
