00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.500
As we said in our original list, the world
is a strange and mysterious place where anything

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
can happen.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.800
These are 10 more crazy “what if” situations
about everyday life, and even alternate history

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.439
scenarios.

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.080
10.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.560
What Happened if We Evolved Alongside a Competitive
Species?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.929
One thing that really helped humans become
the dominant species on Earth is that we became

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.940
technologically advanced and no other species
did.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.600
This raises the alternate history question:
what would have happened if another species,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.530
say chimpanzees, became technologically advanced
alongside us?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.739
It really shouldn’t be a big surprise, but
we would be constantly at war with them.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.370
Humans have been going to war with each other
over resources, ideologies, and nationalities

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.059
for thousands of years, so why would we treat
a completely different species any better?

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.770
William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist
at the American Museum of Natural History,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.980
says that perhaps, after tens of thousands
of years of war, we might be able to find

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.180
peace if we settled in different geographical
areas and used different resources, like humans

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.680
focused on animal husbandry and lived inland,
while “The Others” fished and lived on

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
the coasts.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.290
Harcourt-Smith points out that monkeys living
in the same tree usually ignore each other

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.600
unless they are fighting for resources and
humans act in a very similar way.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
9.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.110
What Happened if a Woman Took Viagra?

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.490
On Viagra’s official website, it clearly
states that women should not take Viagra,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.430
which is a brand name version of the drug
sildenafil.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.470
That being said, there have been a few studies
on the effects of sildenafil on women.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.390
One study found that it works in a similar
way that it does in men.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.700
In a study that was published in The Journal
of the American Medical Association, researchers

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.640
gave half a group of women who were taking
the antidepressant medication serotonin reuptake

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080
inhibitors (which are known to cause a low
libido) sugar pills.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.140
The other half were given sildenafil.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.229
They found that the women who took sildenafil
had better orgasms, but it didn’t do anything

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.530
to their sex drive.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.729
It should also be noted that the study was
funded by Pfizer, who happens to be the manufacturer

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.729
of Viagra.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.560
Also, sildenafil does more than just help
men with erectile dysfunction.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.060
It is also used to treat a form of high blood
pressure called pulmonary arterial hypertension

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.210
in both men and women, so technically some
women already use Viagra.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.340
For several years, many pharmaceutical companies
have tried to develop a female equivalent

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.340
to Viagra, but to no avail.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.930
And if Pfizer knew, or even thought that it
worked in females, extensive testing would

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.290
have been conducted and it’d be available
to be sold.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.290
8.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.250
What Would Happen if a Man Took Birth Control?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.230
This one is a bit more difficult to answer
because there are dozens of birth control

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.020
pills that act differently from one another,
because they contain different levels of the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.200
synthetic hormones estrogen and/or progestin.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.450
If the pills have high levels of estrogen,
it can lead to changes in the male body over

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.450
a long period of time.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.380
Some changes include a lower sex drive, having
problems getting and maintaining an erection,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.430
lower sperm count, and shrunken testicles.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.450
It also leads to muscle loss and may make
the bones weaker.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.590
Facial and body hair may become thinner as
well.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.780
It’s also possible that it could lead to
mood changes, like a more mild temperament.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.930
Of course, that is over a long period of time.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.540
If a male accidentally takes a few, he won’t
feel its effects.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.540
7.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.250
What Would Happen if the Internet Shut Down
for a Day?

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.260
It’s a beautiful morning, you’re lying
in bed and you reach for your smart device

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.130
to see what’s going in the world.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.220
That’s when you notice that your internet
isn’t working.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.130
You check with your neighbors and you find
out the internet is down for everyone.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.370
It turns out there was a solar storm that
knocked the entire internet offline around

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.370
the globe.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.570
What should you expect if this were to happen
in real life?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.319
Armageddon!

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.520
Break into your neighbor’s house, crack
their heads open and feast on the goo inside

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.060
because the downfall of humanity has begun!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.190
Actually, don’t worry, it won’t be that
bad.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.130
First off, getting everyone back online will
be every internet service provider’s top

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.090
priority, so the internet should not be down
for very long.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.180
If the outage lasts for a few days, the economy
may not even be too severely impacted.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.110
People will continue on doing the things they
normally would that don’t involve the internet.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.020
In fact, some companies may benefit from the
internet outage, as it will give them a chance

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.660
to get caught up on tasks they have been postponing
because they spent time goofing off online.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.110
Yes, online giants like Facebook and Google
will be hard hit, but what is everyone going

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.420
to do as soon as the internet comes back online?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.500
They’ll probably have more visitors in those
first few hours after the internet comes back

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.989
online than they do in a week.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.870
Scott Borg, who works at the non-profit organization
United States Cyber Consequences Unit, compares

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.060
a short term internet outage to the economic
depression during a long weekend, and the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.740
world’s economy is set up to handle the
occasional long weekend.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.900
Overall, it would essentially be like one
big snow day… albeit a very, very boring

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.030
snow day.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.030
6.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.750
What Would Have Happened if Neanderthals Didn’t
Go Extinct?

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.820
Neanderthals and humans started to branch
off from a common ancestor 700,000 years ago

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.520
and completely split apart about 300,000 years
ago.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.320
For reasons unknown, they went extinct about
42,000 to 30,000 years ago.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.620
But what if they didn’t?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.490
Would they have been a competitive species,
or would we have lived alongside them like

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.880
in the Geico commercials?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.590
Paleoanthropologist Will Harcourt-Smith says
that unless humans and Neanderthals actively

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.160
kept themselves separate from each other,
the Neanderthals probably would have been

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.190
assimilated.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.960
The problem the Neanderthals had was that
their population was much smaller than the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.210
human population.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.720
Evidence to back up his theory is DNA tests
show that humans and Neanderthals did interbreed.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.130
If you were born outside of Africa, there
is a good chance that 1.5 to 2.1 percent of

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.550
your DNA comes from Neanderthals.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.400
If the Neanderthals weren’t killed off because
of some other mitigating factors, like disease

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.960
or weather change, perhaps more Neanderthal
DNA would have been passed on to modern humans

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.860
and this could have led to more prevalent
Neanderthal traits in humans.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.860
5.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.160
What Happens if a Hole Opens Up on an Airplane
While it’s Flying?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.400
It is by far one of the biggest movie tropes
of all time: There’s a hole in an airplane,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.980
it sucks people out, and they fall to their
deaths.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.330
Since it’s been in so many movies, it has
to be real, right?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.660
First off, if a hole does open in an airplane,
it’s not going to be because someone opened

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.660
a door mid-flight.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.060
It’s physically impossible to open a passenger
door on modern planes while they are in flight

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.370
because the cabins have a higher pressure
than the outside, so there is around 6 pounds

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.170
per square inch of differential pressure against
a door that is hundreds of square inches.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.210
But what happened if, for whatever reason,
a giant hole forms in the side of the plane

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.520
that you’re aboard?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.820
If that’s the case, there would be an explosive
decompression, which would cause someone standing

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.860
next to the hole to be sucked out.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.270
If someone is buckled into their seat near
the hole, they won’t fly out because plane

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.440
seats are secured into the plane so that they
won’t fly out the hole.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.712
In other words: when the flight attendants
tell you to buckle up, do what they say.

00:06:34.712 --> 00:06:35.712
Now all you have to worry about is possibly
being violently thrown off a flight that you

00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:36.712
paid for so that the airline’s staff can
fly instead.

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:37.712
4.

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:38.712
What Would Happen if You Fell Into a Volcano?

00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:39.712
There’s pretty much no hope for this one.

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:43.669
You’d die, but the interesting question
is how would you die if you fell into a volcano?

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.389
Would you drown like Gollum in The Lord of
the Rings?

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.100
Or would you burn to death?

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.419
If you fell into a volcano, you’d fall onto
a pool of magma, which is molten rock that

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.670
is below the earth.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.610
The difference between magma and lava is that
lava is molten rock that has come to the surface.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.580
Nevertheless, magma and lava behave very similarly
when it comes to falling on it.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.870
Magma and lava are about two-to-three times
denser than water and it can be thousands

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.850
to millions of times more viscous than water,
so it isn’t as easily deformed.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.990
It would be like landing on wet cement.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.100
You’d make a small indentation, but wouldn’t
submerge or sink in.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.210
The good news is that you may be dead before
hitting the magma.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.520
As you fall and get closer to the magma, your
lungs could char or you might asphyxiate.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.110
If you aren’t killed while falling, then
hitting the magma at a high rate of speed

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.630
will probably break your neck or skull, which
should kill you.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.230
If you do survive all that, your body will
burst into flames the instant you hit the

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.850
magma and you’ll melt into the magma or
become specks of ash.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.270
So try to avoid jumping into an active volcano,
alright?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.270
3.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.580
What Would Happen if We Collided with Another
Universe?

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.919
In the multiverse theory, there are an infinite
number of universes running parallel to our

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:50.919
own.

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:56.500
And parallel is exactly how we want the universes
to run, because if one collides with our own,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.580
we’re in big trouble.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.570
The good news is that we won’t be able to
tell it’s happening because it will happen

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.570
so fast.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.070
In fact, the exterior wall of the other universe
will be traveling nearly at the speed of light

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.070
when it hits us.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:12.290
Anthony Aguirre, a physicist at the University
of California-Santa Cruz, says that if we

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.289
could slow it down, it would look like a giant
mirror crashing down on us.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:20.410
It would look like a mirror because the outer
boundary of the other universe would reflect

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.410
light.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.590
After that, we won’t feel anything because
we’ll no longer exist.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.060
Boy, isn’t this becoming one heck of a feel-good
list?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.060
2.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.910
What Would Happen if You Didn’t Shower or
Bathe for a Year?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.780
Obviously, you’d stink.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.919
Dead skin would accumulate on top of your
skin and part of that dead skin is a protein

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.750
that is really smelly.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.829
Also, bacteria would grow on your skin and
when it mixes with sweat, it gives off a terrible

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:44.829
odor.

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:48.600
Brown clumps will also grow in areas where
your body produces the most oil, like behind

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.860
your ears and under your arms.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.100
Your head would itch something fierce, because
of all the dead skin accumulated on top of

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
it.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.439
Acne and puss bumps will also become common.

00:08:58.439 --> 00:09:02.839
Your groin will also be another major problem
area because rashes could become common.

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:07.290
It’s even possible that the scum between
your toes will spread to your groin.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.860
One of the biggest problems you’d face is
infection.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.379
If you cut yourself, the first thing you’re
supposed to do is wash the cut so it doesn’t

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:14.379
get infected.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:18.800
So if you’re covered in bacteria, that means
you’re more likely to get a soft issue infection.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.959
Finally, if you wanted to return to normal
(and let’s be honest, who wouldn’t?),

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.139
the bad news is that it would take several
weeks.

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:29.660
That means if you want to try this experiment
– which we beg you not to do – you may

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.369
not want to set up a date within the first
month of showering again.

00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:34.369
1.

00:09:34.369 --> 00:09:37.990
What Would Happen if Every Species Became
Self-Aware and Intelligent

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.689
In the Planet of the Apes films, we have a
problem when one species becomes intelligent

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:42.999
and self-aware.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:47.249
But what would happen if all species suddenly
became self-aware and intelligent?

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:51.670
Innes Cuthill, a behavioral ecologist at the
University of Bristol, thinks that it will

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.350
be an all-out war between the species.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.079
Humans would probably set out to wipe out
any animals we’d view as threats like lions,

00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:59.079
tigers, and bears (Oh my!

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.079
Yeah, we know).

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.929
Next, we’d have to kill off the primates
before they got organized because if they

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:06.560
somehow got ahold of human technology like
guns or even computers and learned how to

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.009
use them, we would be in big trouble.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:12.689
Physically, they are much bigger, stronger,
and more agile than us, so if they became

00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:16.269
smarter and used technology it could be too
hard for us to overcome.

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:20.480
But in the end, there is a good chance humans
would win the early stages of the war because

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.260
there are so many of us and we’re already
armed, plus we have already access to technology

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.920
and – most importantly – know how to use
it.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.029
We just have to hope that something like bacteria
doesn’t gain intelligence, because a smart

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.860
bacterium could probably kill off all humans
(and everything else) and take over the planet.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.430
Even if a bacterium doesn’t gain intelligence,
the war of the species would be horrible for

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:43.019
anyone who survives because ecosystems will
collapse and only things like cockroaches

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:57.160
will survive.
