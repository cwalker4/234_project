00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.030
That’s Sonia Ruiz.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.800
She’s one of millions
of Venezuelans

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.160
fleeing economic
collapse and oppression —

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.725
and crossing over
here into Colombia.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920
We’re in the 
border town of Cúcuta,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.680
where there’s a tense standoff
over the future of Venezuela.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.330
The anger is focused
on humanitarian aid

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.150
that the U.S. has sent and
that Venezuela’s president,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.310
Nicolás Maduro,
refuses to accept.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.270
It’s a standoff that could
lead to a violent showdown.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.940
So, what happens next?

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.610
First, a quick recap.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.800
Tensions started to
build in early February,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.820
when convoys rushed 
U.S.-donated food supplies

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.870
across Colombia to Venezuela, 
only to be blocked at the border.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.330
Maduro sent his troops
to barricade the bridge

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.800
and stop the aid
from entering.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480
But Juan Guaidó, who in
January declared himself

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.280
Venezuela’s rightful president,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.690
promised to get
the aid through.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.220
Then, the United States
backed Guaidó with

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760
more aid shipments,
this time arriving

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.890
on military planes.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.290
But the donated
help is still stuck.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.180
It sits in a tightly
guarded warehouse.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.830
Beans, oil, pasta, diapers —
all packaged and heavily branded

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.420
by a country that has
sanctioned Maduro’s government

00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:00.380
“So in talking with people
crossing the border,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.950
it’s amazing how many
people travel hours

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.805
to cross the border
just for toilet paper.”

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:07.850
And here’s the thing.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.430
It’s not that
much aid, really.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.340
The basic foods here could
feed maybe 100,000 people

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.660
for one day.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.900
In a country of 30 million,
it’s a drop in a bucket.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.010
But it’s enough to strike
a nerve — and fuel dissent.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.380
There is a real
crisis in Venezuela.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.720
We came to Cúcuta last
year and saw thousands

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.240
of people crossing this
bridge on foot each day,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.970
looking for a job
or even just a meal.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.220
Today, things
appear to be worse.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.336
This food kitchen serves
about 4,500 meals a day

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:37.835
to migrants.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.870
Now, Guaidó has announced a
hard deadline of Feb. 23

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.610
to get the aid
across the border,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.830
even if it means
carrying it over on foot.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.580
But all of that hinges on whether
Maduro’s security forces

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.860
will defy his orders and
let the humanitarian aid in.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.210
It’s a tall order.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.040
This man knows.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.590
In January, Major
Sergeant Harry Solano

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.210
and dozens of his
fellow officers

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.775
revolted and declared
their allegiance to Guaidó.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.950
Their videos went viral.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.830
And Solano has been fleeing
from his life ever since.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.005
We met him on his first
day here, in Cúcuta.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.310
A Venezuelan human rights
group confirmed his case.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.980
It took Solano about two
weeks to escape to Colombia,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.170
relying each step of the
way, he said, on help

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.029
from sympathetic soldiers.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.619
We sit with him in the
lobby of the

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.950
Casino Hotel Internacional.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.970
The hotel has become
opposition central

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.760
for mobilizing efforts to
get the aid into Venezuela.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.650
Sergent Solono goes
to a local U.N. office

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.710
to apply for political asylum.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.200
We catch up with him later,
as the lonely reality

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.270
of his first night
in exile sets in.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.280
The U.S. appears confident, too.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.890
Senator Marco Rubio has
been the strongest advocate

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.165
for Maduro’s ouster.

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.830
“It’s not a one-time delivery.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.330
We’re not delivering
a refrigerator.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.260
We’re delivering food.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.955
People have to eat every day.”

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:55.010
President Trump urged
Venezuelan generals

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.815
to defect.

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:58.580
“You must not follow
Maduro’s orders

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.410
to block humanitarian aid.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.620
And you must not threaten
any form of violence

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.035
against peaceful protest.”

00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:08.425
Guaidó offered Maduro’s
officers amnesty.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.920
But Maduro has been
cultivating loyalty

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.870
among the military for years.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.060
He’s designated
over 1,000 generals

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.850
and given them lucrative ties
to the state-owned oil company.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.340
For now, they’ve stood by him.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.580
We see Solano again,
waiting in the hotel lobby.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.980
He’s received word from
an undisclosed source

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.540
about his family in Venezuela.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.790
Pushing the aid
across is a gamble,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.770
one that could force
a larger confrontation

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.700
inside Venezuela.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.140
Perhaps that, in the
end, is the point.
