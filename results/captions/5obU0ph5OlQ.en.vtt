00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.280
Top 10 Crazy “WHAT IF” Scenarios

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.950
The universe is a vast and mysterious place,
and there are so many scenarios where almost

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.230
anything can happen.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.020
Have you ever considered what would happen
if the Earth doubled in size?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.400
Or what would happen if the supercontinent
Pangaea never broke up?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.500
Even if you haven’t thought of those specific
questions, these ‘what if’ scenarios show

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.250
how amazing and mind boggling the Earth and
the universe can be.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.870
10.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.710
What Would Happen if Everyone Jumped at the
Same Time and the Same Place?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.940
In August 2012, The YouTube channel VSauce
posed a question that many of us have probably

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.760
only considered if we’re visiting Amsterdam
or Colorado.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.210
His question: what if we somehow gathered
up all seven billion people on Earth, stood

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.640
shoulder-to-shoulder, and then at the same
time, everyone jumped?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.670
While the logistics of the project would be
a nightmare, we actually wouldn’t need that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.159
much space; probably about the size of Los
Angeles.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.291
So when we all jumped a foot in the air, would
we be strong enough to move the earth when

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.291
we landed?

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.590
Or cause an earthquake?

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.920
Amazingly, we’d actually be powerful enough
to move the Earth.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.810
However, we wouldn’t notice.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.039
It would only move 1/100 of the width of a
single hydrogen atom and it wouldn’t even

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.740
last, because the earth would bob back up
again.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.169
So in terms of world projects, let’s scrap
this one.

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:32.169
9.

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:34.649
What Would Happen if the Magnetic Poles Reversed?

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.029
One of the most feared Earthly events (that’s
bound to happen sometime in the future) is

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.909
the reversing of Earth’s magnetic field.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.909
That means that the North Pole will become
the South Pole, and vice versa.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.549
We should also point out that this reversal
does not mean that the Earth itself will physically

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.630
turn over, just its magnetic poles.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.889
That means if you’re standing on the equator
with a compass, Canada and Russia will be

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:02.899
on the top of the Earth, but the compass will
say they are south, while Antarctica and Australia

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.559
will be on the bottom of the planet, but they
will be north according to the compass.

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.349
We know that this flip will happen because
it’s already flipped several hundred times

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.629
in the history of Earth.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.030
The last one happened 780,000 years ago.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.010
That means the reversal could happen again
at any time.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.680
How will this affect the Earth and us humans
who live on it?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.829
One thing to remember is that it isn’t like
flipping a light switch.

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.319
Instead, it’s a process that can take anywhere
from 1,000 to 10,000 years.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.050
So we won’t experience flooding or earthquakes
or anything like that.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.890
When it does start to happen, one thing that
we may have a problem with is a weakened electrical

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.890
field.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.709
That field helps block radiation from the
sun.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.260
In the weakened field, this may punch holes
in the ozone layer, which could increase skin

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.260
cancer.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.409
Also, another major problem would be satellites.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.260
They can be damaged by solar storms and a
bombardment of solar radiation might be too

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.860
much for them to handle.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.180
This could lead to disruptions with technologies
that rely on satellites, like smart phones.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.560
Either satellites will have to be developed
to deal with the solar radiation, or we will

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.330
have to find alternatives.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.349
8.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.760
What Would Happen If You Fired a Gun in Space?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.159
Modern guns and ammunition don’t need oxygen
to fire.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.239
That means they will work in space.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.900
If you did fire a gun in space, the smoke
will come out of the barrel in a sphere.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
The bullet will fly off forever because the
universe is always expanding.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.290
Well, unless it hits Sean Bean, which movies
tell us is probably inevitable.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370
Meanwhile, you will be pushed backwards because
of the kickback of the gun.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.349
This would be bad news because unless you’re
tethered to something, you will simply float

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.450
away because there is no resistance to stop
you.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.189
You would simply continue to float until you
died from lack of oxygen or dehydration.

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.280
It’s also possible to shoot yourself in
the back in space.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.029
If you are in freefall near a planet and you
shoot, the bullet can orbit around the planet,

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:01.560
and depending on where the kickback pushes
you, it’s possible for the bullet come back

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.349
and hit you in the back.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.970
Finally, we never want to encourage suicide…
however, if you happen to be on the moon with

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.170
a handgun and you need to shoot yourself in
the back, get to the top of a lunar mountain,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.650
fire a bullet that goes 3,560 miles per hour
at the horizon… and then it could come back

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.199
and hit you in the back.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.199
7.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.340
What Would Happen if the Moon Disappeared?

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
In
Despicable Me, the main character, Gru, plots

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.340
to steal the moon.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.300
Sure, it’s an ambitious plan, but would
it really affect Earth if the moon disappeared?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.040
One major thing we’d notice oceans is that
tides won’t be as strong.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.610
The reason the moon impacts the tides comes
down to Newtonian gravity.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.160
When you’re closer to something, gravity
increases.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.780
So when an ocean or loose earth is facing
the moon, it essentially reaches towards the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.050
moon and this draws water away from the shore.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.000
However, the tides wouldn’t completely disappear
because the sun impacts them too.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.259
Also, without the moon pushing the tides,
the rotation of the Earth will slow down.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.770
This, in turn, will make the days longer over
thousands of years.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.479
However, in the long run, the lack of a moon
would become an even bigger problem because

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.000
the moon helps keep the Earth stable on its
tilted axis.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.250
The moon helps prevent gravitational forces
from outside of the Earth, like from other

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.080
planets, from effecting Earth’s tilt.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.030
Without the moon, the Earth’s tilt could
vary by 85 degrees.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.120
That means, without the moon, the Earth would
change its tilt every few million years between

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.150
the sun rotating around the equator and rotating
around the poles.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.970
This would lead to dramatic shifts in climates.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.970
6.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.160
What Would’ve Happened if Pangaea Didn’t
Break Up?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.470
About 300 million years ago, the supercontinent
Pangaea formed from other continental units.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.840
It started to break up about 175 million years
ago and the continents slowly drifted to where

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.290
they are today, making it the last of the
supercontinents.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.000
However, what if it never broke up and it
stayed a supercontinent?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.160
Well, the bad news is that humans probably
wouldn’t have evolved.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.690
A major driving force in developing new species
from existing ones is geographical isolation.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.610
When a species is isolated, it leads to new
traits evolving because creatures experience

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.780
different selective pressures.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.379
Another problem for species diversification
is that most of the land on Earth would be

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.120
arid and hot because it would be centered
on the equator, and moisture carrying clouds

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.740
would lose their moisture going inland.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.190
This type of climate would be good for reptiles,
but not so much for mammals.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.190
5.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.880
What Would Happen if the World Doubled in
Size?

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.879
Let’s say you went to bed and woke up the
next morning, and suddenly the world had doubled

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.930
in size.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.340
This includes doubling in mass, as well.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.870
Providing your bed didn’t collapse under
you, the first thing you’ll notice is that

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.919
you feel really heavy.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.800
That’s because the Earth’s gravity would
double as well, and that means everything

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.140
is twice as heavy.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.440
That means you would have to start to walk
around and do stuff while, in essence, wearing

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.270
a body suit made up of your own weight.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.860
Depending on your size, your bones and joints
would struggle with the weight.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.940
Our hearts would also be in serious trouble
because with more gravity, our extremities

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.450
would pool with blood.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.870
In order to deal with the pooling, your blood
pressure would have to double.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.259
Eventually, humans would evolve and become
stronger, especially in the lower half of

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:09.259
the body.

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.160
Our legs would become much stronger to support
our weight.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.900
Another big thing you’d notice is that tall
trees would start to collapse because of the

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.830
weight, and they’d never grow again.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.410
With twice the gravity, it would be harder
to get water from the roots to the top of

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.410
the trees.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.110
Instead, small trees might grow, or trees
may never grow again.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.110
4.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.349
What Would’ve Happened if the Dinosaurs
Didn’t Go Extinct?

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:35.090
About 66 million years ago, 80 percent of
life on Earth was wiped out.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.789
This includes the dinosaurs.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:42.389
There are several potential culprits in killing
them off, such as a comet or an asteroid or

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:43.389
a supervolcano.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:45.009
Or possibly Jeff Goldblum.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:47.659
The point is, we can’t be sure.

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:52.099
However, the Cretaceous-Paleocene extinction
was most likely a combination event and the

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:57.439
death blow was a six-mile wide asteroid that
hit the Earth in the Yucatán Peninsula in

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.439
Mexico.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:02.289
This caused mass wildfires and a lot of ash
and dust got into the atmosphere, which cooled

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:05.370
the planet and killed off a lot of the vegetation.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.569
But what if that asteroid never hit Earth
and the dinosaurs weren’t killed in a massive

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:10.569
die off?

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:15.400
Well, according to Damian Nance, a professor
of Geosciences at Ohio University, there’s

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.449
a good chance they’d still be alive today.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:22.750
After all, dinosaurs ruled the Earth for 160
million years before they were wiped out,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.500
so unless there was another catastrophic event,
like the rise of a dinosaur disease, there

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.270
is a good chance they would have carried on
living at the top of Earth’s food chain.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.020
There’s even some speculation based on the
way dinosaur brains were evolving before the

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.730
extinction that if they had not died off,
dinosaurs could have evolved to have “human-like”

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.730
intelligence.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.640
As for humans in this alternate reality, there
is a good chance they wouldn’t have evolved.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.820
Mammals did live alongside dinosaurs, but
they filled in niches and never became bigger

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.420
than the size of rodents.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.500
They only evolved in the wake of the death
of the dinosaurs because there was more food,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.000
less competition for it, and fewer mammal-eating
predators.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
3.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.100
What Would Happen if the Sun Died?

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.850
If the sun were to stop working, it would
take a while for it to cool down, similar

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.310
to putting something warm in the refrigerator.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.270
The bad news is that we’d feel the impact
within a week.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.680
In 2015, the average temperature on Earth
was 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.570
Well, within a week of the sun dying, the
average temperature would drop to 0 degrees.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.770
Then, within a year, average temperatures
would drop to -100.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.420
This would kill most plant life and the surface
of the oceans would freeze.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.820
However, it would take hundreds of thousands
of years for them to freeze solid because

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.210
the surface ice would insulate the depths.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.670
After several million years, our planet would
be a constant, balmy temperature of -400 degrees.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.810
As for what humans could do?

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.760
We could live in nuclear or geothermal habitats,
or in submarines in the deepest parts of the

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760
ocean.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.560
Of course, food would become tough to come
by because vegetation needs the sun to grow,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.560
and on the surface, only large trees would
survive more than a few years.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.040
Finally, while the sun plays an important
part in heating the Earth, it’s also important

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.820
because it keeps us in orbit.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.510
If the sun were to die off, the Earth, which
would now be a ball of ice, would stop circling

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.590
and fly off into space.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.590
2.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.460
What Happened if You Jumped Into a Hole Drilled
Through the Middle of the Earth?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.590
We want to start this one off by saying that
it would be impossible to actually make a

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.100
tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.780
However, in theory, if we could dig through
the Earth and you jumped in, what would happen?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.090
If you ignore the rotation of the earth and
friction, and dropped into the hole, you would

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.880
start off at a speed of zero.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.380
You’d pick up speed as you got closer to
the center of the Earth, reaching speeds of

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.560
17,671 miles per hour.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.540
However, once you pass the center of the Earth,
you would decelerate, and by the time you

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.990
reached the hole on the other side of the
Earth, you’d reach a speed of zero again,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.370
and pop out of the hole.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.870
The whole trip would take you 42 minutes,
and hopefully you’d have a quip ready for

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.870
the people waiting on the other side, like
“I must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque!”

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.870
Or something else.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.870
We don’t know.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.870
You’d have time to think of a great line
while plummeting through the planet, is what

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.870
we’re saying.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.870
1.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.870
What Would Happen if You Fell Into a Black
Hole?

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.120
Black holes are one of the most perplexing
and intriguing mysteries of the universe.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.160
Have you ever thought what would happen if
you were to fall into one?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.870
Well, it’s one of those good news/bad news
type of scenarios.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.060
It will also be a much different experience
for people who may happen to see you fall

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.060
into the black hole.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.200
For people who watch you fall in, they would
see you get closer to the event horizon (which

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.860
is the point of no return), and as you did,
they would see you stretch and contort, and

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.910
then they would see you slow down.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.810
Then you’d freeze, as if someone hit the
pause button, and then they’d see you engulfed

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.640
by the heat of the event horizon and all you’d
leave behind is ashes.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.170
As for you, the first thing that would happen
is that you’d be cloned, and the clone would

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.170
be incinerated.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.730
That’s the “you” that your fellow space
travelers saw turn to ash.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.690
However, you wouldn’t know that you were
cloned and as you passed the event horizon,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.300
you wouldn’t feel anything; you’d be in
freefall because gravity wouldn’t exist.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.900
If you happen to fall into a small black hole,
the bad news is that the force would stretch

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.450
you like a piece of spaghetti.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.900
If it were a big black hole, like one that’s
millions of times the size of the sun, you’d

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.990
continue to freefall and beyond the event
horizon, the laws of physics break down.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.560
Time and space don’t really exist and you’ll
continue to be pulled towards singularity,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.800
which is a rupture in the space-time continuum.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.310
It is at the center of the black hole where
space becomes infinitely curved.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.390
What happens there is anyone’s guess.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:30.610
It could be another dimension, another part
of space, or even behind a bookcase in the

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:38.050
past.
