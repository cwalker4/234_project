00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.670
In 2015, there was a huge excitement in the
space community.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.960
That is because up until then, the best image
we had of the Pluto system was this.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.529
Hubble also squinted its lens at Pluto, but
it is so small and distant, the best it could

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.520
see was a few blobs of colour variation.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.609
But in 2015, this all changed.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.510
That is because after a nine year journey,
the New Horizons space probe flew by the dwarf

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.469
planet, giving us a detail and fidelity of
Pluto and its moons like we had never seen

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.559
before.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.719
So the question is, what did the New Horizons
probe see and discover during its flyby of

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.050
the Pluto system?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.729
I’m Alex McColgan, and you’re watching
Astrum.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.679
Stick with me in this video and I will show
you all the highlights from the New Horizons

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.570
mission to Pluto.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.329
Pluto was the last of the traditional 9 planets
to be explored.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.170
This was due to its distance from us, but
also because – can you believe this – it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.550
wasn’t considered a very interesting celestial
object.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.640
Thankfully, the New Horizon’s team pushed
hard for this mission to be approved, and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.009
in 2006, New Horizons launched as part of
NASA’s New Frontier’s program, for medium

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.429
budget space missions.

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.539
The goal of the mission was to get to Pluto
as soon as possible, and as such, New Horizons

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.729
was the fastest launch ever, it being a light
spacecraft on the most powerful rocket of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.409
the time – the Atlas V. It whizzed past
the moon in only 9 hours.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.579
The Apollo missions took 10 times as long.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.990
On its way to Pluto, it used Jupiter as a
gravity assist which shaved 3 years off the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.880
arrival time.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.280
It also used Jupiter as a trial run for its
systems, taking some remarkable videos and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.679
images of the planet and its moons.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.130
After this successful trial, New Horizons
went into hibernation mode to prevent wear

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.189
and tear of its instruments.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.960
Leading up to its approach in 2015, the team
turned the systems back online, and every

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.090
day the spacecraft sent back images of the
Pluto system.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.010
This was an incredibly exciting time for enthusiasts
following the story.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.060
We began to get hints of what Pluto could
possibly look like, and saw how different

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.629
Pluto was from its biggest moon, Charon.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.739
Every day, the resolution got higher and higher,
and more details could be made out.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.010
Yes, there were other scientific goals for
the mission, but the most interesting thing

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.069
to me was what it looked like.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.010
Soon there could be seen what looked to be
a heart shape on the dwarf planet!

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.170
On the 14th July, the New Horizons probe made
its closest approach, at only 12,500 km from

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.730
the surface of Pluto.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.120
However, mission controllers didn’t get
a look straight away.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.349
Firstly, the probe was too busy taking a lot
of photos during the flyby to send any back

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.120
immediately.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.579
Once data transfer commenced, they had to
deal with the slow uplink speed of only 1kbit/sec.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.500
Further to that, there was a 4.5 hour latency
between the spacecraft and the Earth.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.900
But what it saw and sent back was spectacular:
mountain ranges, ice plains, glaciers and

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.689
an atmosphere.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.459
It also had a good look at some of Pluto’s
moons.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.510
Let’s go into detail about what it actually
discovered during this flyby.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.159
One of the first things observed about the
Pluto is its unusual relationship with its

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.159
moons.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:47.379
For a start, Pluto’s biggest moon, Charon,
orbits very closely to Pluto, and is also

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.510
very big in comparison.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.290
This means that the barycentre of the two
objects, or in other words, their centre of

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.430
mass, is outside of the primary object.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.840
They actually both orbit around a point in
space.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.069
Not only that, but both objects are tidally
locked to each other.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.892
This means if you stand on one, the other
won’t move from that point in the sky.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:16.060
This is very unusual because while some moons
are tidally locked to their parent planet,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.200
the planet is not also tidally locked to the
moon.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.000
Charon is very different visually from Pluto
being much darker.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.790
This implies they are not from the same origin.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.910
The rest of Pluto’s moons are very small,
only being a few kms across.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.160
Their orbits are exceptionally circular and
are all coplanar with Pluto’s orbit.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.140
The geology of Pluto is very interesting.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.290
The biggest visible feature on Pluto is this
giant heart shape, which wowed the world when

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.470
it first came into view.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.060
It has since been named Sputnik Planitia.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.070
It is the size of Texas, and it has a strong
colour contrast to the surrounding area.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.170
This is because it is a giant ice plain.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.890
In fact, during the flyby, it was confirmed
that 98% of Pluto’s surface is comprised

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.830
of nitrogen ice.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.810
On average, the temperature on the surface
of Pluto is -229c, which means water ice would

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.640
be rigid and brittle.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.290
On the other hand, nitrogen ices at this temperature
act like water ice on Earth, meaning it can

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.520
flow as glaciers.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.280
This can especially be seen around the edge
of the heart, glaciers flowing into the gaps

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.040
around the craters and mountain ranges.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.410
The ice plains themselves have giant polygon
shapes across the entire area.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.930
There also are no craters, which means it
must be a relatively new feature, or a feature

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.510
that is being continually renewed.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.540
It is perhaps only 10 million years old.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.970
The polygonal cells show ridges on them which
are likely caused by sublimation, the process

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.620
of an ice turning directly into a gas.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.490
Although it’s not known for certain, Sputnik
Planitia could have formed from an impact,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.180
and ices filled the crater in from a potential
subsurface liquid ocean.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.330
This filled in basin actually causes a positive
gravitational anomaly.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.690
A gravitational anomaly is where the gravity
at one point is different from elsewhere on

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.330
the object.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.600
The ice plain is directly facing away from
Charon, which would align it up with the objects’

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600
tidal axis.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.600
Due to the short distance between Pluto and
Charon, tidal effects are very strong on both

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.990
objects.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.870
This could be the reason why Pluto is tidally
locked to Charon and the two objects can’t

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.830
look away from each other.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.210
Surrounding the ice plains are vast mountain
ranges made of water ice, which, when viewed

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.280
from the side on, look spectacular.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.830
Water ice is the only type of ice detected
on Pluto that would be strong enough to support

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.730
heights of several kilometres at this temperature.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.370
Among the mountains found on Pluto, there
might also be some which are cryovolcanoes,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.100
one of the most likely candidates being Wright
Mons.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.090
It is 4 kms tall, one of the highest peaks
on Pluto, and a big depression is found in

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.790
the centre.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.830
Cryovolcanoes could be a contributing factor
for Pluto’s young surface.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.090
Another obvious feature of Pluto is the dark
material that seems to be sprinkled on the

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.620
surface in some areas.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.030
The biggest such area is called Cthulhu Macula.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.390
It is weirdly reminiscent of a whale in shape,
as can be seen in this image.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:51.860
The dark colour is thought to be a deposit
of tholins, a kind of tar made up of hydrocarbons

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.220
that have interacted with sunlight.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.060
Similar deposits can be seen on one of Saturn’s
moons, Iapetus, so the process has been seen

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.860
elsewhere in the solar system.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.600
The region on Pluto is much more heavily cratered
than the heart, which implies the surface

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.500
there is much older.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.750
Mountain ranges can be seen in the middle
of Cthulhu Macula, topped with what is thought

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.530
to be methane ices.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.060
Methane apparently condenses as frost at higher
altitudes on Pluto.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.030
The last surface feature I will mention here
is this region called Tartarus Dorsa.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:34.020
It is an extensive, highly distinctive set
of 500-meter-high mountains that resembles

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.089
snakeskin or tree bark.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:38.380
They are thought to be Penitentes.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.370
If that is true, Pluto is the only place in
our solar system other than Earth where they

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.110
have been observed.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.240
Even on Earth they are very rare, but some
can be found in the Atacama desert and other

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.079
dry, high altitude regions.

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:59.130
The ones on Pluto are much taller and cover
a much vaster area than on Earth.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.510
We can only imagine what they look like close
up.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:08.279
For me, the most impressive discovery that
New Horizons was able to confirm was that

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.540
Pluto has an atmosphere.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.230
And not only that, but the images are incredible.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:19.050
Due to Pluto’s small size and weak gravity,
the atmosphere appears to extend high above

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.250
the surface of Pluto.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.459
Earth’s atmosphere, while being much more
massive and dense compared to Pluto, hugs

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:29.269
the planets comparatively tightly as the gravity
is a lot stronger.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:37.269
The atmospheric pressure on Pluto is exceptionally
low, however, roughly 10 microbars, or 100,000

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:40.689
– 1,000,000 times weaker than the surface
pressure on Earth.

00:09:40.689 --> 00:09:48.490
It is theorised that the pressure could increase
to as much as 18 to 280 millibars, three times

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:54.290
the surface pressure on Mars and a quarter
of the surface pressure on Earth, if the temperature

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.720
was to rise and the surface ices would sublime
into gases, the process which we’ve seen

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.750
in the ice plains.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:07.420
The last time Pluto was thought to have this
atmospheric density was 900,000 years ago.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.240
At this pressure and temperature, the conditions
could even be right for liquid nitrogen to

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.610
form on Pluto’s surface.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.749
Some evidence of this might be found here,
in what appears to be a frozen over lake.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:27.379
At any rate, within just one year, Pluto’s
atmospheric density can vary by a factor of

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:30.639
four due to seasonal variations.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:35.160
That is a massive contrast compared to other
solar system objects with atmospheres, which

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.440
generally stay pretty consistent.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.509
The atmosphere consists of the same ices found
condensed on the surface, namely nitrogen,

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.810
methane, and carbon monoxide.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:50.290
The other fascinating discovery New Horizons
made about the atmosphere is that it has up

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.520
to 20 haze layers.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.120
Haze layers themselves were not unexpected,
but the amount of them was.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.149
They can clearly be seen in some of these
images, acting like layers of a thin kind

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:05.170
of fog.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.010
Sunlight can be seen streaming through one
such layer in this photo, the shadows from

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.950
the mountains clearly seen in contrast to
the sunlight shining through the haze.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.009
The layers do not appear to be level across
the planet.

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:23.639
Here you can see this haze layer high above
the surface, but on this side of the image

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.910
it touches the surface.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:31.680
On a side note, to me these are the most breath-taking
photos of Pluto, and I purposefully saved

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.010
them until last.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.139
You can truly appreciate depth and the scale
of the mountain ranges; Pluto almost seems

00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:44.509
like a toy replica due to the extreme topographical
relief, but these mountains appear so high

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:49.319
because Pluto is so small, and its gravity
is not strong enough to pull them down.

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:58.050
This gives for a varied and impressive landscape
and a fitting end to the video.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.170
Did you enjoy what you saw today?

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.389
Watching videos is great, and if you want
to broaden and retain that knowledge, the

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:09.230
best way to do so is to actively grapple with
puzzles and problem solving.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:15.209
That’s why for these last two videos, Astrum
has partnered up with brilliant.org, a website

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:18.970
which is a great complement to passively watching
educational videos.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:24.149
You are likely here because you want to learn
more about Astronomy, and so Brilliant.org

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:28.040
could be exactly what you are looking for
to really challenge your knowledge and help

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.610
you learn more.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.249
Brilliant offers many well curated sequences
of problems that help you master all sorts

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:35.450
of technical subjects.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.790
You all like Astronomy clearly which they
have a dedicated course for.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:45.560
