00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:32.617
The Baikonour Cosmodrome

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:35.720
located in the middle of the 
deserted steppes of Kazakhstan

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.740
is the Russian space launch facility

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.439
used to start the journey towards
the International Space Station

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.450
It is a huge complex that comprises
several technical buildings:

00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:56.905
some for assembling
and preparing the rockets

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.063
and others to accommodate  the technicians
engineers and the crews

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.804
It was from Baikonur that Yuri Gagarin

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:20.562
began his extraordinary journey
around the Earth

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:23.162
more than 50 years ago!

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:28.362
Today every launch of the Soyuz vehicle

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.521
brings three new crew members

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.269
onboard the International Space Station

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.872
They prepare for their mission in Star City

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:41.948
the training centre of the cosmonauts
located near Moscow

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.886
Before stepping onto the launch pad

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:48.561
all the crew members have to undergo
hundreds of training hours

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:53.535
both theoretical and practical to be able
to operate and control
the Soyuz spacecraft

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.408
in any situation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.293
The practical part of the training

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.902
makes use of realistic models
of the spacecraft that allow

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:06.751
the cosmonauts to feel almost as
if they were in a real situation

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.585
They all follow the path of many others

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:13.712
who flew before them from Baikonour

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:19.307
Let's discover how a Soyuz rocket works

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.942
The rocket has a total length
of approximately 50 m

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.736
and a diameter of up to 10 m

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.188
The total mass is about 310 tons

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:32.418
It consists of 3 parts called stages

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:35.846
A mixture of kerosene
and liquid oxygen

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:38.523
is used in order to generate
 the required propulsion

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:41.964
On top of the rocket stands
the Soyuz spacecraft itself

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:46.221
encapsulated within the structure
of the rocket's nose

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.546
On the launch pad    four green arms

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:52.561
ensure that the rocket
is positioned properly

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:54.926
before lift-off

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:58.062
The arms will mechanically rotate away

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:00.443
to release the rocket while
it leaves the ground

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.045
The training being successfully completed
the crew members
are ready for the launch

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.243
and the rocket stands
on the launch pad

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.934
Two and a half hours
before lift-off

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.577
the crew finally enter the spacecraft

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:21.593
and start preparing it for the launch
in collaboration with
the ground controllers

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.997
They are now set for the launch

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:28.109
The cosmonauts are now sitting on top
of 300 tons of propellant

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.569
What happens if anything
goes wrong?

00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:35.863
The Soyuz rocket is equipped

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.132
with a robust and powerful system
designed to save the crew

00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:42.815
in case the rocket were
to start burning
or explode on the launch pad:

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.275
this is the
launch escape tower

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:48.246
The launch escape tower is itself

00:03:48.254 --> 00:03:49.889
a small yet powerful rocket

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:53.180
made up of several engines
which use solid propellant

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.783
It is capable of quickly extracting
the crew compartments from
the rest of the rocket

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.132
in case of an imminent
threat to the crew

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:02.751
like an explosion for instance.

00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:05.320
The mechanism may be
triggered automatically

00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:08.003
or upon command from
the ground controllers

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:14.836
On only one occasion in the history
of Russian cosmonautics was
this escape system put to use

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:16.694
In September 1983

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:19.852
while the rocket was ready to lift-off
to bring two Soviet cosmonauts

00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:22.551
to the Salyut 7 station
a valve failed to close

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:26.765
just 90 seconds before
final ignition

00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:29.426
causing kerosene to spill onto the pad

00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:30.585
and ignite

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.005
Fortunately, it was quickly realized

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:35.208
that the crew was endangered

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:37.764
and the ground controllers
activated the escape system

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.458
Explosive bolts fired

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:41.529
to separate the crew compartments

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.822
from the rest of the spacecraft

00:04:43.853 --> 00:04:45.844
and the escape motor fired

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.481
dragging the crew compartments
free of the boosters

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.555
Although the two crew members

00:04:50.578 --> 00:04:54.863
experienced an acceleration
of 14 to 17 g for 5 seconds

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:58.456
they  landed safely onboard
their capsule some 4 kilometres

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.656
away from the launch pad

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:02.933
The g-load is a
common way to express

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:05.858
the acceleration or in
other words the force

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:09.259
that the crew may feel
during changes in velocity.

00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:12.696
The two cosmonauts
Strekalov and Titov

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:15.544
would go on to fly several
highly successful missions

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:17.838
in later years

00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:20.251
This incident proved

00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:23.290
how reliable the launch
escape system really is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.958
Let's go through the
launch sequence now

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.056
At T-:00 We have lift-off

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.759
Full thrust is provided
by the 4 side boosters

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.109
and the central block
of the rocket

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:56.751
The core block is ignited at
the same time as the 4 boosters

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.481
to provide an additional thrust

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.501
The rocket then initiates a manoeuvre
called the pitch manoeuvre

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:07.537
to get the proper orientation
towards the desired orbit

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.151
The acceleration on the crew members

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.953
starts to slowly increase to 1.5 g

00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:16.342
45 seconds later

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.913
the rocket has already
reached an altitude of 11 km

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:24.283
and a velocity of 1,640 km/h

00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:26.140
This is the moment the rocket

00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:29.751
must withstand the maximum
pressure on its structure

00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:39.803
The cosmonauts feel twice 
their normal weight on the ground

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:48.497
Looking at the projection
of the track on the ground

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:53.228
we can observe that the rocket has
already crossed 16 km.

00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:02.331
After almost two minutes into the
flight

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:06.046
the rocket is at an altitude
of more than 40 km

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:09.356
high enough to get rid
of the launch escape tower.

00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:12.886
A few seconds later
the four strap-on boosters

00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:16.748
stop firing having consumed
all the propellant they contained

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:19.298
Being of no use now
they are jettisoned

00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:21.274
from the main core

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.148
which continues to fire

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.267
and is now called
the second stage

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.157
In case of a severe malfunction
at this point

00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:30.364
the spacecraft can still separate

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.413
from the rest of the rocket

00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:36.602
and come back safely to the ground
without the need for
additional propulsion

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.567
The debris follow a trajectory
that leads it to hit the ground

00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:46.021
in an uninhabited area located
more than 350 km from
the launch pad

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.797
Soon the crew members will
experience the maximum acceleration
on their bodies

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.329
3.5 times their own weight

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.435
but only for a few seconds

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.801
This is the most physically

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:00.309
demanding moment for
the cosmonauts

00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:02.584
In the meantime

00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:07.274
the second stage continues
to fire for 3 more minutes

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:10.990
The structure that protects the spacecraft
is then jettisoned

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:14.045
Once again the debris
will follow a safe trajectory

00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:19.663
to hit the ground 530 km
away from the launch site

00:08:23.218 --> 00:08:26.577
The spacecraft is now
fully exposed to space

00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:27.900
The light from outside

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:32.170
can now enter the crew compartment
through the small windows

00:08:45.736 --> 00:08:49.243
It's now been approximately
5 minutes since lift-off

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.902
Two seconds before the extinction of the second stage

00:08:51.927 --> 00:08:54.767
the third stage is ignited

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:58.346
then the second stage separates
from the rest of the rocket

00:08:58.363 --> 00:09:00.737
The engine of the third stage

00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:03.648
will continue firing
for the next 4 minutes

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:06.291
As with the 4 boosters
the second stage

00:09:06.307 --> 00:09:09.482
follows a safe trajectory
down to Earth

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.109
The rocket is already at an altitude of 170 km

00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:20.656
and travelling at a velocity
of 13,250 km/h

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:25.061
Then the circular section that
links the second stage

00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:27.078
with the third stage is jettisoned

00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:31.048
while the rocket goes on to reach
the targeted orbit

00:09:31.064 --> 00:09:35.282
around 220 km above
the surface of the Earth

00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:44.232
Once on the desired orbit
approximately 9 minutes
into the launch

00:09:44.244 --> 00:09:46.875
the last engine is cut-off

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:51.626
The spacecraft finally
separates from the rocket

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.911
the cosmonauts can now feel
the microgravity

00:10:13.284 --> 00:10:15.494
Moments later the antennas

00:10:15.503 --> 00:10:17.997
and the solar arrays are deployed

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.715
The spacecraft

00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:21.350
is now on its way to the

00:10:21.364 --> 00:10:24.732
International Space Station
