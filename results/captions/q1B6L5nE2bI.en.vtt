00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.640
A few years ago, my friend and I went to Hawaii, and we rented a car to get around.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.320
Here’s me on day one, the car still in the parking lot, looking a little terrified at

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.740
the prospect of driving.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.020
Not because I was tired, or because I hate
driving.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.800
It was because in Australia, you drive on the left side of the road,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.640
whereas in the US, you drive on the right.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.900
Most countries in the world — about two-thirds — drive on the right side.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840
Which leaves one third that drives on the left.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.460
You might be wondering why people who drive on the left don’t just switch over to the right.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.460
The thing is, left-hand side traffic was the worldwide norm for a long time.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.059
So how come a split now exists?

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.540
Well, the reason boils down to two main factors:

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.120
One, the fact that most people are right-handed.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.580
And two, the fact that countries were using different forms of transportation at the time

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.440
formalised road rules began to emerge.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.320
Back in the middle ages — way before cars existed — people mainly travelled around on horseback

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.480
or by foot.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.740
People kept to the left so they could keep their dominant hand closer to the centre of the road.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.860
Remember this was a time when people often carried weapons on them — such as swords,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.980
knives or daggers — while travelling because of bandits and outlaws.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.540
Also, people almost always mount horses from the left side — and it’s safer to mount

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.900
from the roadside than in the middle of the road.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.140
This left-side travelling continued for years across the world until about the time of the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.140
French Revolution.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.340
There was a big class distinction on the roads of France at the time — the wealthy would

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.340
drive their carriages on the left and force poorer people to travel to the right.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.260
But by the end of the revolution, the aristocracy began travelling on the right to blend in

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.440
with the lower classes, and France’s roads effectively became right-side travel.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.940
So you had France travelling on the right, and places like England travelling on the left.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.880
Throughout Britain it was more a matter of custom than widespread regulation until 1835,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.860
when parliament passed a law forcing traffic to keep left.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.520
In France, the keep-right rule was established more firmly by this guy.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.940
As Napoleon conquered countries across Europe, those countries were forced to switched sides.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.580
Meanwhile in the US, one particular wagon was a big driving force for keeping to the right.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.760
The Conestoga wagon became popular in the late 1700s, as a way to transport heavy goods.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.220
These massive wagons could hold thousands of kilograms worth of cargo, and needed teams

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.720
of horses to pull them along.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.319
There was no driver’s seat, so the driver would usually sit on the rear left horse — so

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.239
they could still hold a whip in their right
hand.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.010
Because of this, the wagons travelled on the right, so the driver — sitting on the left

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.700
— would have more visibility over the rest
of the road.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.240
In 1792, Pennsylvania officially passed the first keep-right law in the US, to this turnpike.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.960
Twelve years later, New York enforced right-hand travel on all public highways, and it slowly

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.000
spread across the rest of the US.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.239
In time, more and more countries shifted to the right.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.380
As they found themselves surrounded by converted land neighbours, it was just easier to follow suit.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.380
When the US started putting steering wheels on the left, that became extra incentive to switch.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760
Cars initially had the wheel on the right, following horse-drawn buggies.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.460
Ford was the first to put the wheel on the left with the Model T in 1908.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.480
Initially, it was just to make disembarking easier.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.659
But car manufacturers soon realised it was better — and safer — for the driver to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660
sit more towards the centre of the road.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.920
And because the US is such a big car exporting country, this was an extra push for more countries

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.660
to switch over to the right, so they could use the cars.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.280
Obviously not everyone made the switch.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.790
British colonies remained on the left, and still do for the most part.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.920
And other countries like Japan and Thailand, which were never British colonies but had

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.620
dealings with the British, have also kept to the left.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.700
But most countries switched to the right in the early to mid 20th century.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.360
In fact, only three places have switched back from right to left in recent times.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.960
In Japan, Okinawa was controlled by the US after WWII and made to drive on the right.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.840
It switched back to the left on July 30, 1978, after being returned to Japan 6 years previously.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.660
Timor-Leste switched to the left under Indonesian rule in 1975.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.260
And Samoa switched over in 2009, so they could import old Australian cars

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.140
instead of more expensive US cars.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.080
The Samoans had a smooth changeover — they got a two-day national holiday to ease traffic,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.300
and a three-day ban on alcohol sales to deter accidents.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.860
But they had a relatively small population at the time of about 180,000 people.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.780
So what would happen in a country with a lot more people

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.800
— and a lot more that could go wrong?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.120
Sweden switched from left to right in 1967.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.960
With a population of about 7.8 million people at the time,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.940
there was a lot to prepare for H-Day.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.860
Road markings had to be repainted, bus stops relocated, intersections and one-way streets redesigned,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.820
and about 360,000 street signs changed.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.220
At precisely 5am on September 3, Swedes were directed to switch over to the right.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.640
The whole process cost 628 million kronor — the equivalent of more than $400 million today.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.580
But the country’s road networks and infrastructure a lot more sophisticated now than they

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.840
were 50 years ago — not to mention there
are a lot more people and cars.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.020
A switch nowadays would be a lot harder and cost a lot more.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.520
It’s the main reason why we won’t see another country switching sides any time soon —

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.510
it would be a huge logistical exercise that would cost a lot more than people

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.080
are willing to spend for something that isn’t needed.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.020
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.440
In the end, it only took a day or two for
us to be comfortable driving on the other

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.040
side of the road — and it’s probably what
travellers will have to keep doing.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.940
You may have noticed that most left-side driving countries are actually

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.880
islands, which helps justify not switching over.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.430
For the few that do share borders with right-side driving countries, most of the time it’s

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.620
a non-issue - you’d have to go through customs first, so you’d go through border security

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.230
on one side and exit out the other.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.340
But for a few countries, they’ve come up with some inventive solutions.
