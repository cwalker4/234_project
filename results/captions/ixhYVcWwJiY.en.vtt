00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
Hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the Ford Flathead V8 engine and it's a pretty neat engine

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.620
we're gonna be getting into a bit of how it works and ultimately why it died off in the year I was born 1953

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.120
Now this is a super cool engine it was introduced in America in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.240
1932 in the Ford model 18

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250
and it was really the first mass-produced

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.230
V8 engine entering the market so you could say it started our obsession in America with v8 engines

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.570
which that lust has certainly never died

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.519
still super passionate about v8 engines though the style has changed quite a bit now. This is a later model Ford flathead v8 engine

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.029
it's a bit larger than the original the original was a 3.6 Liter v8 and it had a compression ratio of just

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.000
5.5:1 and produced

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.489
65 horsepower which you know you may think is a bit embarrassing out of a 3.6 liter v8

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.659
but you know this is back in the day 90 years ago when they didn't even have computers

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.129
so it's pretty wild how sophisticated this engine actually is for its time

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.938
it's pretty cool, and I had a lot of advantages especially from a cost perspective that allowed it to enter the mass market, okay

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.489
so let's get into how this engine works first

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.769
and we'll just start disassembling it and kind of dive into it so up top we have the air filter fed through the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.789
carburetors into the intake which then passes into the engine and then out the exhaust you can see those middle two cylinders

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.129
share an exhaust exit whereas each of the outside cylinders have their own individual exit

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.159
so we'll go ahead and take these wires off

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.180
which are igniting those spark plug, you can see the four spark plugs right there, and so why I've gotten the Flathead name

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.610
here's the engine cylinder head

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.970
so extremely simple

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.799
basically just one piece of metal and that really helped with the cost of it because the cylinder head was not complicated at all

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.169
all of it could be cast into a single block

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.639
where you have your intake and exhaust valves as well as your pistons in front we of course have this cooling fan

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.269
you've got a generator, and then the distributor right here in red

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.440
which is going to be sending the ignition to each individual spark go ahead and turn this off and remove our intake

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440
so there's our air filters

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.200
here we have the intake pull that off

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.289
so pretty fascinating looking at the actual operation of the intake and exhaust valves as well as the Pistons so you've got a single camshaft

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.610
located in the center of the V

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.429
which is operated by the crankshaft geared of course two to one so two rotations of the crankshaft

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.500
for every rotation of that camshaft, which is opening these intake and exhaust valves now

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.299
you've got the same basic four strokes as any other engine so there was your intake stroke pulling down

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.239
compressing that air &amp; fuel mixture power stroke is that piston goes back down and then pushing out through the exhaust

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.119
now you can see that exhaust valve opening up there, and then the cycle repeats itself so pretty cool

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.069
you can actually see the operation of those valves by the camshaft here within the engine

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.549
and you've got those two

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.949
exhaust valves shared in the center there which port out through that Center exhaust

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.190
and then these will actually come down the sides and through the exhaust versus your two intake ports right here

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.999
you know so it's actually shortening making that path simpler, and you've got these cylinders offset a little bit

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.239
so that single camshaft can operate each individual valve so none of the two valves actually line up directly so perhaps

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.309
it's a bit obvious looking at it now

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.199
but it's a real simple design and part of that simplicity is beautiful leads to

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.540
reliability and you know helps this engine come in at an affordable price point where it can be marketed in a mass production vehicle

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.100
and actually you know sold out to the everyday common person and so that's really the beauty of this engine is that it can bring

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.888
the V8 to everyone not just you know really expensive performance cars, so so that's really the advantage of it

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.779
and it actually did have decent low-end you know lower rpm power, but as you might imagine,

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.839
the downfall of this really comes down to airflow and efficiency because it isn't reall y

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.079
optimized for good airflow or good efficiency and so we're gonna get into the reasons for both of those, okay, so first

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.589
let's just get into the air flow and the air flow path is not ideal in this situation, so you've got your air

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.209
it's going to be coming in right here, then feeding up, so it's going to go up this direction

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.870
then it has to chain change 90 degrees

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.679
and then it has to change another 90 degrees and go down into the cylinder

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.870
rather than you know on today's engines the airflow goes towards the piston out around it and then down into the cylinder rather than making

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.439
180-degree turn now it has to do the exact same thing when that airs on its way back up so it comes up the cylinder

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.649
goes that 90 degree angle and then out the exhaust

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.559
so again the airflow situation here is not ideal just based on the path that the air has to travel

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.790
versus today's modern engines the other challenge with air flow is that your intake and your exhaust flow is in opposite directions, so

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.170
after your power stroke

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.619
you're pushing that air out the exhaust and your air flow is traveling this direction

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.739
so that exhaust valve starts to close and your airflow is going in this direction then your intake valve opens and

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.600
suddenly you're reversing that air flow into the cylinder

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.260
versus in today's modern engines that air flow is in the same direction so the intake air

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.199
comes in and then as it exits the exhaust the exhaust air is traveling in the exact direction

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.839
that the intake air is going to be entering in and so you have that nice scavenging that nice air flow

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.430
exit where it's a smooth transition from exhaust to intake rather than having them collide with one another and act in opposite directions

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.120
now the air flow

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.910
challenges don't end there because as you can see if the air is coming in from this intake valve right here

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.390
and it all needs to travel this direction the air that comes in on this side of the valve on the top there has to

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.960
completely change around so it's kind of ideal from this end where it can just come right out and then go into the cylinder but really

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.040
that's the face where all of that air flow has to flow in on this side of the valve on this top portion here if

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.040
it were to come out there

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.629
then it's got to go up around the side of the valve and then back down into the cylinder

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.880
so it's very challenging from a design standpoint

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:21.170
it's much more ideal in today's engines to have that valve over the cylinder where the air flow can go completely around the valve and

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.740
into the cylinder rather than you know just having a portion of it where the air flow is ideal.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.820
Okay well, if air flow isn't great

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.010
then why don't we just open these intake and exhaust?

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.039
valves more just push them open more so that you can have more flow in well the challenge with that is is it means you

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.700
have to dig out more of this cylinder-head

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.020
so the more of this cylinder head that you remove to allow for space for these valves to have clearance and open up and provide

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.760
airflow then the lower your

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.200
compression ratio is going to be because this is to the side of your piston so the larger this volume here to the side of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.610
your piston the less you can compress the overall volume of that cylinder because you've got this big volume above the valves

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.540
so if you want to improve the

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:09.760
compression ratio it often means you're reducing the amount of clearance that your valves have to open and close so you're further

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.559
impeding air flow at high rpm so really you know the battle to make this thing efficient and flow well is a losing fight

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:25.750
because you can't have a high compression ratio and high rpm air flow and you can't have high airflow with a high compression ratio

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.150
both of them fight against each other so one of the final versions of the Ford flathead v8 was a 3.9L

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.740
very similar to what you see here, and had a compression ratio of 7.2 to 1 and produced 110 horsepower

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.770
but how do you improve how much power this engine makes?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.690
Well you get rid of it, and you switch to an overhead valve design, and that is what Ford did in

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.869
1954 so this thing died out in

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.229
1953 producing about 110 horsepower

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.039
and then the next year with their overhead valve design with the same displacement

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.340
they were able to improve how much power the engine created so huge shout-out to Erik Harrell for lending me this beautiful

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.900
3D printed engine

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.939
