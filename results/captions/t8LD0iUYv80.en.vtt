00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:36.640
[Music Playing]

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.360
Commander.

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.077
We are good for pre-flight.

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:43.377
Roger that.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.988
Standby for final telemetry
upload and lock.

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:48.625
Oh, and...

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:52.087
The crew hope you're enjoying
your send off serenade.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.742
It's perfect, thank you.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:56.466
We thought you'd like it.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.553
Standby for final checks
and transmission tests.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.477
Five by five, Flight.
Ready to disengage.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:03.557
Proceed.

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.203
You are cleared for initial trust.

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:22.409
Roger that.

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:23.928
Moving out. Quarter impulse.

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:25.690
Nerd!

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.135
Card carrying.

00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:32.473
And if you don't say "make it so",
I'll be very disappointed.

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:33.795
Noted, commander.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:37.674
Please proceed
to drive initiation point.

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:38.976
On my way.

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.653
See you soon.

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.118
Ah, so fast!

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.206
Someone is excited.

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.504
You're looking forward to playing
with your new toy, aren't you?

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:19.416
I am, but maybe don't tell them
we call it "my toy".

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:22.302
They may ask us
to cover the trillion-dollar bill.

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:29.195
Hey.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:34.606
I'm coming back.

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:36.654
I always did.

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.236
I wouldn't do this
if I thought otherwise.

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:42.438
You better...

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:45.275
You can't get rid of me that easily.

00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:05.053
Flight, we are green across the board.
Please confirm.

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:06.853
Confirmed, Longshot.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.996
Disengaging interlocks.

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:19.610
Flight, we are a go for FTL burn.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.316
It's now or never.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.116
God speed, Commander.

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.589
See you on the other side.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.531
Come on, Flight.
Let's hear it, you can do it.

00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.577
Fine.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:32.372
Make it so, Commander.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.128
There you go.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:38.211
... of the very first faster than light
propulsion system.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.964
The Longshot is the most
advanced space craft ever built.

00:03:41.837 --> 00:03:44.687
And in it, Commander Kane
will travel to Mars.

00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:48.972
A journey that, according to NASA,
will take just over three minutes.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.093
Lighting it up in three,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.227
two, one...

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:55.530
Mark!

00:04:30.346 --> 00:04:32.224
1.25 c.

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:35.235
Spinning down in five.

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.474
Flight, do you copy?

00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:59.876
Loud and clear, Commander.

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:02.693
Welcome back
to our corner of space time.

00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:05.006
Well, that's good to be back.

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:06.800
And this just in!

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.310
Commander Kane
has arrived at his destination

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.513
and is now the first man

00:05:11.763 --> 00:05:13.144
to travel faster than light.

00:05:13.394 --> 00:05:14.349
Thank, God!

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.960
The commander will now launch
an entangled satellite

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.563
into orbit round Mars
allowing real-time communication

00:05:20.813 --> 00:05:23.013
between Earth and Mars Colony One.

00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:29.155
Q sat, online.

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:31.564
All right.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.077
Let's do this again,
before you miss me too much.

00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:37.497
Initiate return sequence.

00:05:38.217 --> 00:05:39.976
Starting FTL spin-up sequence.

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:41.751
Roger that, Longshot.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:53.244
And we are a go
across the board, Flight.

00:05:53.494 --> 00:05:54.973
Spin her up, Commander.

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.655
Flight, it looks like I may have
an interlock issue here.

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:06.276
We're seeing the same thing here.

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:08.403
Let's take a look at diagnostics.

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:13.408
Abort FTL drive start and spin down.

00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:15.088
Roger that.

00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.021
Spinning down.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.210
Flight, we have a problem...

00:06:44.983 --> 00:06:48.318
Flight, I have lost drive control.
Repeat, I have lost drive control.

00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:53.323
I have no nav comm
and I am approaching light speed.

00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:00.580
Find him, Comms!

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:03.333
I am being pulled in
to a new vector!

00:07:07.837 --> 00:07:09.559
Warning, hull breach.

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:11.294
Warning, hull breach

00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.339
Warning, hull breach

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.715
I need information.
People, come on! Where is our bird?

00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:25.999
Gone. I mean, gone.
No vector, nothing to track.

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:29.752
We should be able to get him
on Q comm anywhere, but nothing.

00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:34.507
Stand by.
We're receiving some new information.

00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:39.220
Commander Kane
seems to have disappeared.

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.147
Where did dad go?

00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:43.933
The Longshot was ready
to make the return voyage home,

00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:46.012
but something
seems to have gone wrong.

00:08:46.262 --> 00:08:48.229
We will continue to follow the story

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:51.229
and provide updates
on any new developments.

00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:00.622
First contact.

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:02.773
Okay, okay, above my pay grade.

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:45.289
After almost a day
since his last communication,

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:48.395
the search
for Commander Kane continues.

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.435
We have reached out

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:52.735
for the Commander's family
for comment.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.152
We're sure it's been
a difficult time for them.

00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:59.042
Along with the rest of the world,
we all now hope for a safe return.

00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:19.724
Nothing more to do today.

00:11:20.655 --> 00:11:21.424
Go home.

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:33.558
Flight?

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.137
There's something.

00:11:35.387 --> 00:11:36.405
Control, come in.

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:39.192
You guys getting this?

00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:44.954
NORAD is reporting an anomaly
approximately 2.5 clicks from the ISS.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.782
"Anomaly"? Do we have a visual?

00:11:47.032 --> 00:11:48.033
Coming up.

00:11:54.174 --> 00:11:55.324
What is that?

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:21.192
Are you tracking?

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:36.250
Jack!

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.520
Daddy!

00:13:29.622 --> 00:13:30.623
It's me...

00:13:32.308 --> 00:13:33.309
It's me!
