00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
You are watching Coldfusion TV

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.160
Welcome to another Coldfusion video

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.460
I'm going to start this video off with a quote.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.900
Henry Ford once said:

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.620
"It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.940
for if they did I believe there
would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.020
I quote this because it encapsulates the fact that

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.260
the contents of this video may be unsettling compared to the videos that i normally make.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.040
I still feel compelled to make this video

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.340
because I've been exploring the financial world
for the last four years

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.020
and it has definitely given me a more complete view
of the world.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.540
I want to share some of what i've come across with you guys

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
I'm also going to do a video about crypto-currencies like Bitcoin in the future

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.820
and to understand why Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.680
may continue to rise, it's critical that you understand the contents of this video.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800
I hope that you find this topic interesting and that it inspires you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420
to do your own research afterwards.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.680
Now, with that said, let's begin.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.640
So who controls all of our money?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.540
It's a simple question!

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.620
We all know that you and I don't control it.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.420
Our employees don't controll it.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780
The companies that they work for don't control it.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.100
So who does?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.380
Where does it even come from in the first place?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.680
I'll give you a hint...

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.140
Money does NOT come from the government

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.100
It's a seemingly obvious question that's
never asked or taught in schools for some reason.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.420
Unfortunately, most people's
lives are basically dedicated to money.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.260
It's all people ever worry about or
talk about.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.860
We go to school to learn basically how to go to university,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.040
to learn the skills to get a good job

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.260
so that we can trade hours of our lives all
for this thing called "money".

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.000
So why wouldn't you want to know where money
comes from and who issues it?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.320
Today, in this very special video, you're about to
find out the answers to the question of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.260
"Who controls all of our money?"

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.120
People today can tell something isn't quite right with our financial system,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.180
but they
just can't put their finger on it.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.780
Some people think it's the failure of government, others think that it's the failure of the capitalism itself

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.640
This video should
clarify a few things.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.400
The year is 1694 andEngland had just suffered through 50 years of war.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.060
Exhausted, the English government needed loans to fund their political means.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.320
Brainchild of Scottish banker William Paterson,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.790
it was decided that a privately owned bank that could

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.400
issue the money to the government out of
thin air was to be the solution.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.260
This was the very first modern central banking
system in the world.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.780
Central banking is more influential than laws, governments and politicians,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.540
but strangely not the focus of the general public.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.420
Fast forward to the early 20th century, and after two failed attempts

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.400
a group of bankers wanted to put a central bank in the United States of America.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.400
It was December of 1910 and senator Nelson Aldrich

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.920
boarded a private train car in New York
with six others.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.780
The six were not to be spotted by any news reporters to avoid questions.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.480
Their destination: Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.000
The meeting went for nine days and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.740
from that they created the Federal Reserve System.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.900
This is all documented and a matter of public record.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.660
Some of them went on to write about the meetings in their personal biographies.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.580
Here is a quote from Frank Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank of New York

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.860
February 9th 1935

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.860
in the Saturday Evening Post:

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.680
"I was as secretive - indeed, as furtive - as any conspirator.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.040
Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.159
If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.660
that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.980
The six men that Nelson Aldrich brought together included the head of banks, branches of government

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.720
such as the Treasury and some of the richest people on Earth at the time.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.500
To give you an idea of how rich they
were

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.660
in 1910 these six men represented a quarter of the world's worth.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400
The bankers told the American public

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.420
that the purpose of the system was to stabilize the economy and to stop the grip of

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.400
the Wall Street banks over America.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.520
The problem was the guys that wrote the bill were the very same people they said they'd stop.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.940
If they succeeded, it would give a small group of men the ability to create money from nothing

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.420
and loan it to the American government with interest.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320
So why was it done in secret?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.820
Because the American people didn't want a central bank.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.360
Back then, unlike today, people knew what central banks were

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.900
and understood them very well.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.640
Everywhere a central bank went, there would be wealth inequality,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.440
wild swings between economic booms and busts

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.340
and after each bust, those in the top of society mysteriously came out richer,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.020
while everyone else got poorer.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.680
Europe was a running example of this at the time.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.980
The Federal Reserve was originally drafted as the 'Aldrich bill',

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.420
but when it came into Congress, they recognized Senator Aldrich's name

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.680
and smelled a rat.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.400
The bankers needed better cover.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.240
They decided to send two millionaire friends to carry the bill to quell the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.320
suspicions of Congress and renamed it
"The Federal Reserve Act".

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.920
Next in this textbook lesson of deceit

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.440
the bankers set out to fool the American people through disinformation.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.240
In the newspapers of the day the bankers screamed and protested

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.880
against the new Federal Reserve bill.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.000
"It would ruin the banks!" they exclaimed.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.800
The average person read the protesting articles of the bankers and thought to themselves:

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.220
"If the bankers hate it, it must be good"

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.740
and then they ended up unknowingly supporting a Trojan horse.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.980
The bankers also fooled Congress by putting clauses in the bill that limited their power

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.500
only to remove them once the bill was passed.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.000
A double head fake of the public and Congress - was all it took.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.600
The bill was passed on December 23rd 1913 while most of Congress was out on holiday.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.640
And with that, a small group had complete monopoly over the issuing and creation of American money.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.080
Today the Federal Reserve is the most
powerful entity in the United States

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.860
and they're not ashamed to admit it either.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.480
Here is former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.200
What should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.140
Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:39.500
and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.760
What the relationships are don't frankly matter.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.020
In addition to this, it seems that the Fed can't even be touched by investigating parties.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.480
So I'm asking you if your agency has in fact, according to Bloomberg,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.960
extended nine trillion dollars in credit,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.800
which, by the way, works out to 30,000 dollars to every single man woman and child in this country.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.920
I'd like to know: if you're not responsible for investigating that, who is?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.040
We actually have responsibility for the Federal Reserve's programs and operations

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.780
to conduct audits and investigations in that area.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.180
In terms of who's responsible for investigating ...

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.060
Would you mind repeating the question one more time?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.660
Mr. Chairman my time is up, but I have to tell you honestly

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:32.879
I am shocked to find out that nobody at the Federal Reserve, including Inspector General

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.160
is keeping track of this.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.660
"So what does all of this have to do with me?" you might be asking.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.560
"I don't even live in the US"

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.660
Well, two reasons.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.100
Number one: the central banking model from the Bank of England and the United States has now been put

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.520
in all countries and even consolidated power in parts of Europe as the European Central Bank or ECB

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.980
This unites separate countries under one economic policy.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.040
The only places in the world that don't have central banks are North Korea, Iran and Cuba.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.420
In 2000 this list suspiciously
included Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.380
And number two: since the end of World War II, the US dollar has been the reserve currency of the world.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.360
This means that all central banks hold US dollars in their reserves.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.820
In other words all other currencies are backed by the US dollar.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.040
This directly links to your country to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in America.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.880
More on this later.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.340
When the post- World War II monetary system, called the "Bretton Woods" system, was created,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.740
all US dollars were backed by and exchangeable for gold.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.380
A byproduct of this was that currencies used to be very stable in relation to each other.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:47.440
For that, all the countries, the exchange rates were fixed and year after year

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.500
you could predict what prices were going to be.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.620
You could start a business elsewhere,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.120
you could calculate profits, business was much easier before floating exchange rates.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.880
Unfortunately, in 1971, due to a falling US dollar, international capital flows into gold

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.580
and the funding of the Vietnam War,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.840
President Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.780
I have directed secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.820
into gold or other reserve assets.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.020
Now the dollar was floating and backed by nothing and has been ever since.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.400
So let's think a little: if the US dollar is backed by nothing

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.100
but the world reserves are backed by the US dollar intrinsically since 1971,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.700
doesn't this mean that all currencies are now backed by nothing tangible, only trust in the American government?

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.420
Well,  this is correct!

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.160
Money backed by nothing is known
as "fiat currency".

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.180
"Fiat" in Latin means "let it be done".

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.140
In other words, the government
says it is money, so it is.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.660
A consequence to having money backed by nothing is that whenever the Federal Reserve creates money

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.200
it dilutes the currency supply of all other nations

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.800
because their reserves are backed by the US dollar.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.060
All countries' reserves are worth less each time money is created.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.380
In the past few years the Federal Reserve has printed trillions of dollars

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.060
and countries like Russia and China have noticed this.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.300
As a reaction to the money printing, these countries have been selling US dollar reserves and buying gold

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.580
over the same period.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.660
"But wait a second!"

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.380
Some of you clever thinkers out there may have asked yourselves:

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.880
"If every currency on Earth is backed by nothing, how am i able to pay for things?"

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.000
Well, as it turns out, the whole economic system today is running because it is backed by faith.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.020
Faith that you can exchange your unit of currency for goods or services.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.040
In a way, part of that faith comes from the fact that not many people actually know where money comes from.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.560
We're about to find that out in this video.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.460
A central bank is essentially the entity that manages a nation's money supply

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.840
and it can loan money to the government with interest.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.780
In the United States and most other countries it works like this:

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.880
When the government needs more money than they received from taxes

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.080
they ask the Treasury Department for money.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.000
The Treasury then receives an IOU or bond from the government.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.420
The Treasury, through the banks, gives this IOU to the Federal Reserve.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.560
The Fed then writes a check for this IOU and hands it to the banks.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.720
At this exchange at the banks, money is created and it can be used to pay government bills.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.340
So hang on!

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.560
Where does the Fed get the money to be able to write this check?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.120
They get this money from nowhere! They literally just invent it.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.100
Here's a quote from the Boston Federal Reserve:

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.700
"When you or I write a check there must be sufficient funds in our account to cover the check.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.780
But when the Federal Reserve writes a check, there is no bank deposit on which that check is drawn.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.720
When the Federal Reserve writes a check, it is creating money".

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.200
So, in essence, they're writing a check and creating money from an account that has no money in it.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.980
The money the Federal Reserve creates can be used as legal tender to buy things

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.260
and eventually makes its way into the real economy.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.140
If you and I did that, we would go to jail for fraud,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.640
but they can do it because they
invented the system.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.800
This is the same system used throughout the world today

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.740
Another part of this money creation
happens at the commercial bank side.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.680
Every time you take out a loan to buy a house, car or TV, banks create money out of nowhere to give you this loan

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.220
and you still have to pay interest on it.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.940
And don't just believe me when I say that.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.480
Hear it for yourself from the horse's mouth, the people running the system,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.200
Graham Towers, former governor of the Central Bank of Canada states:

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.180
"Each and every time a bank makes a loan, new credit is created. New deposits. Brand new money."

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.820
Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England:

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.580
"Banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customers' current account."

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.760
So what they're basically saying is that each time the bank makes a loan,

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.040
the bank doesn't use other people's deposited money and give it to you.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.680
It creates new money.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.940
In modern times this means typing digits into a computer.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.000
97% of all money is digitally created like this.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.280
Only 3% is the physical cash and coins that we carry.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.960
Another crazy thing that commercial banks can do is lend out 10 times more money

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.640
than they actually have in reserves.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.020
This is called fractional reserve lending.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.920
So who wrote this ridiculous system into law?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.220
For the United States, it was part of the Federal Reserve System drafted in 1913.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.360
And again, this is the same system used throughout the world.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.800
So what's the issue? Why should I even care?

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.180
Well there's consequences.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.480
When more loans are given out more money is created

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.520
and the rest of the money in circulation is
worth less and less as the years go on.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.400
This is known as inflation.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.640
In a way, inflation is basically a tax that we all pay for the fraud of money printing.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.440
Easy money now in exchange for tax on our future generations.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.640
It's also why in 1950 a house used to cost $7,000 and a car $2000.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.260
Obviously, this is no longer
the same today.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.360
Things will always keep getting more expensive as long as this system is in place.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.720
This was actually kind of OK because wages grew in relation to inflation until about 2008.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.460
Why this stopped happening is a story
for another day.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.920
So things are already pretty crazy, but they get even crazier.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.660
The more you look into it, the stranger things become.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.000
So remember we were talking about how central banks and commercial banks can create money out of nothing

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.400
This procedure actually does create
something.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.860
It creates debt.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.140
Let me explain:

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.560
When you take out a loan, it's written down as an asset in the bank

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.920
as a negative form, kind of like a negative value of money, or otherwise known as "debt".

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.460
Under this system, debt is actually money.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.460
And again, don't just listen to me.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.359
Marriner Eccles, former Governor of the Federal Reserve states:

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.140
"If there are no debts in our money system, there wouldn't be any money."

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.160
So, in essence, instead of gold being the backbone of our economy, it is now debt.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.920
The system we're under now is sometimes referred to as "the debt based monetary system".

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.460
It requires that debt always grows.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.780
Countries and people must become deeper in debt so that there's more money in the system,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.880
because, remember,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.760
debt is money.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.380
If people and governments stopped borrowing money and paper clones,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.560
the debt doesn't grow, the money supply shrinks and the system falters.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.940
It truly is bizarre, but we all live in this system each and every day.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.980
The Federal Reserve and other central banks control money by adjusting its supply

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.380
and how much it costs to borrow money, otherwise known as the interest rate.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.620
With these tools and as a consequence of human group psychology,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.160
central banks create booms and busts
in the economy at will

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.320
and also to stall and derail an economy by messing with it.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.880
Let's take a quick case study.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.940
In the year 2000, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates to 1%.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.180
He did this to try and fight off the recession from the dot-com bubble

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.960
and encourage people to borrow money.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.380
When interest rates are low, if you're borrowing money you save a whole lot on repaying mortgages.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.580
Since the 1% interest rate hadn't been seen at the time since the 1950s it was a pretty good deal.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.560
Greenspan's idea was that he could create a wealth effect.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.360
People would start to buy houses, the prices would go up and the people would feel wealthier

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.060
and spend more money in the economy
and stimulated.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.860
Greenspan's sure succeeded in getting people to borrow money to buy houses.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.580
But they borrowed too much and the results was the 2008 housing bubble.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.000
This is a prime example of what can go wrong when central banks mess with an economy.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.860
Yes, corrupt bankers have a lot to answer for on their role in the 2008 crisis.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.180
But the Fed has a far bigger long-term impact.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.820
Even crazier things are happening in Japan.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.780
Their central bank is  buying so many stocks

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.360
that they were the number one buyer of Japanese stocks in 2016

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.840
so they have part ownership of companies with money that they created from nothing.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.540
So, in essence, it is the central banks that
control our economy

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.660
and the central and commercial banking system together that control all of our money.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.820
The difference is central banks can create money at will while commercial banks need loans to create money.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.240
To give you an idea of people's views of central banking when people actually knew what central banks were,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.660
here's a couple of examples.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.000
In 1881 then, President of the United States, James Garfield states:

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.140
"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.680
and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another,

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:10.680
by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate."

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.260
Benjamin Franklin, in his autobiography, stated that the prime reason for the American War of Independence

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.360
was a battle over who actually controlled and issued the money of the new colonies.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:27.600
Moving on to more modern times, Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman states:

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.240
"The Federal Reserve definitely caused The Great Depression

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:37.180
by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933."

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.920
So, with all this being said, some would argue that central banks are not inherently a bad thing.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.920
They just need to be part of the government and not privately-owned.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.740
The government should be able to issue its own money for the benefit of the people and shouldn't have to pay

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.720
a massive interest on its own debt.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.740
This was tried at least once in the United States by President Lincoln.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.920
He stated this:

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.040
"The government should create, issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.720
to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.020
By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.980
Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity."

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.120
Abraham Lincoln then issued his own government money.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.740
It was called "the greenback".

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.620
No further comments on that story.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.540
So I think we'll end the video there.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.000
There's so much more that I could cover about what central banking decisions led

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.300
to what revolutions around the world.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.520
Pretty much when you look at it, all revolutions and all wars, when you dig through everything,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.520
it all boils down to money.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.700
I could also have talked about the new global movement of those who are rejecting

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.460
the debt based economic system.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.760
People are starting to move their currency into gold, silver and crypto-currencies like Bitcoin.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.180
So there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.420
That's a whole nother story for another day.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.640
Anyways, if you've watched the whole way
through this video, congratulations!

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.240
You're one of the few who have found out
the hidden truths about who controls all of our money.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.160
I think I've only met about four people in real life that have been aware of the debt-based economic system.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.240
It's strangely unknown, but it's as true as
anything.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.600
I haven't showed you all the quotes of the bankers and the former heads of the Federal Reserve telling you

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.060
from their own mouths how the system
actually works.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.280
If this is your first time hearing all of this, I encourage you, as I said before, to do your own research

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.680
and then you'll start to see the bigger picture and the world today will make a whole lot more sense.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.100
If you want some good starting resources, I recommend Mike Maloney's "Hidden Secrets of Money" series.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.340
It's here on YouTube and I'll leave a link below.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.980
Mike is a very knowledgeable guy and I've had some great long conversations with him about the economy.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.700
If you're into reading and you want to know more about the history of the Federal Reserve,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.380
I recommend the book by G. Edward Griffin, "The Creature From Jekyll Island".

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.180
So anyway, I think I'll stop talking now.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.220
Thanks for watching this video!

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.280
It's a been too go go(?)

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.880
You've been watching ColdFusion.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.420
Feel free to subscribe to this channel if you're new. This isn't the stuff I normally make, but

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.160
I think you'll like the other stuff
anyway.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.540
I really hope you learned something from this video and I'll see you again soon for the next video.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.920
Cheers guys, have a good one!
