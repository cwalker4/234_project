00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:30.742

Yeah, I've been married 20 years, Don.

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:56.093
That's what I said to her.

Mr. Don Rickles.

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:22.325
Y’all was, like, one of the first ones to do the roasts.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.209
Well, the network started that, yeah,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.523
which had me as the closing guy, yeah.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.495
Well, that must've meant you was a home run hitter.

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:29.821
You said it, I didn't.

Ronald Reagan, our great former governor, who said to me,

Orson Welles, 30 years ago you were handsome,

00:01:40.503 --> 00:01:42.513

[Laughing]

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.975
I think that's what made you different and original from everybody else,

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:49.171
that you didn't have to write it.

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.292
That you could go up there and you could say it as you seen.

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.883
Everything I've ever done is off the top of my head.

00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:55.104

&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:56.422
Well, that's how I was.

00:01:56.422 --> 00:01:59.066
When I made my first couple of records I didn't know how to write.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.823
I just was able to just say whatever came to heart.

00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:05.740
You said you were like the, of the black world, Frank Sinatra.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.052
Oh, way. I love Frankie, baby.

00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:09.752

Ol’ Blue Eyes, Dogg Sinatra.

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:15.883
I used to go out on the stage with Frank.

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:18.334
I know that was special, man, to go on stage with Ol’ Blue Eyes.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.699
Did he have a cup, was he drinking on stage?

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:21.941
Oh, sure, drank all the time.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.981
I used to say, "Uh, Frank, put the booze down."

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.603
"Your voice is gone, so...
[Laughing]

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:28.091
It's all over, Frank.

I know you don't like to hear that.

Now back in your days, what was the, uh, relaxation?

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:40.458
Because in our day, we choose cannabis as our relaxation.

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:41.094
You choose what?

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.631
Cannabis. Marijuana.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:43.614

Are you sure you never used it?

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:52.372
Never.

Are you sure you never touched it?

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:54.491
No, never touched it.

You just touched it now.

As a fan watching, it was like you had fun every day of your life.

I did have fun.

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:29.214
And the Copacabana was the spot.

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:34.048
I went to the Copacabana with my manager, Joe Scandore at the time,

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:36.259
and Jules Podell I met for the first time.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.335

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:43.607
"I don't need no wise guy kid that makes fun of my customers."

"He'll never, never work the Copacabana."

I sat there like a schmuck.

I said, "Joe, Jesus Christ."

"I'll take care of it."

"Be nice, be nice."

00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:02.712

It's not what you know, it's who you know.

That's right.

And people love to compare me and you and say that you hung out with the wiseguys

00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:11.991
and I hung out with sort of tough guys or sort of kind to speak.

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:15.290
But I don't think there was a difference between those guys and regular guys.

&gt;&gt; from the ’70s and the ’60s.

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:55.774
Family is key with me, Don.

00:06:55.774 --> 00:06:59.939
I'm, I mean, like, throughout my career, if I wouldn't have had my family

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.383
I think I would've cracked many years ago because, you know,

00:07:02.383 --> 00:07:05.284
it's so many superficial fans and friends that you meet in this industry,

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:06.514
&gt;&gt; you got to have some solidity.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:08.145
I'd come home and tell the kids,

00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:10.458
they were very impressed that I was gonna be on the air with you.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:11.321
Oh, wow.

00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:12.897
They all love you with that.

00:07:12.897 --> 00:07:13.475
Well you know what?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.767
Shout out to the Rickle family.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:17.150
This is the Rickle down effect.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.160
We appreciate the love.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.900
Toast to the boogie baby.

00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:28.126
This is one of those moments where you, you know, you could be proud

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:31.189
to say that you've actually done something 'cause you sittin' next to a great

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:32.797
and you conversing with the great.

00:07:32.797 --> 00:07:34.460
And showing that love is love.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.116
You know, his career is iconic.

00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:38.642
There's nothing you can do to take that away.

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:40.304
I'm half of what he is right now.

00:07:40.304 --> 00:07:41.599
I'm trying to be whole.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.493
What it do?

00:07:58.493 --> 00:07:59.752
It's your boy, big Snoop Dogg.

00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:02.811
And I need y'all to go subscribe right now to the AARP Channel.

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:03.446
You know what I'm talking about?

00:08:03.446 --> 00:08:06.377
So you can see Don Rickles and see his right-hand man,

00:08:06.377 --> 00:08:09.655
no, his left-hand man, Snoop Dogg, live and direct.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:10.554
Go subscribe right now.

00:08:10.554 --> 00:08:11.316
What you waitin' on?

00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:13.045
What did he say?

00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:15.362
[Laughing]
