00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.529
This video is a follow-up to another video. We did on this channel called prometheus actually explained with real answers

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.680
I highly recommend you watch that video first before you watch this one since I'll be expanding on things they already address in that video

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.340
It's been a few months since alien covenant came out

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.549
And I can't say I'm surprised that the reception has been even worse than the reception for prometheus, and just like prometheus

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.979
I think covenant is getting a lot more hate than it deserves

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.578
So I'd like to be one of the very few people speaking in its defense

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.460
I've had a chance to see all of the internet's rantings and ravings

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.899
And I've been able to condense the bad reviews down to these three most common criticisms

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.749
It's totally confused and doesn't know what kind of movie. It wants to be. It doesn't expand on the themes of prometheus

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.509
it's just a dumb sci-Fi horror movie with no deeper meaning and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.719
Nothing in the film makes sense and all the characters are stupid

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.929
Just like in prometheus the first criticism is the result of the filmmakers response to the overly harsh reception of prometheus

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.989
instead of making the movie they plan to make they changed it in order to please critics that demanded a return to the form of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.320
the first two films

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.320
Fermi's was very successful

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.010
Questions at the end of it worked it was something about some of the notes

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.889
We took on social Media made good film

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.820
But didn't but they missed him and the evolution chespin's officially know all that stuff and I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.689
Went you know what and I'm in process then the planning covenant

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.789
We're going to have to reintroduce him so that we took on a different direction

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.549
this is why Alien covenant is a mishmash of the philosophy driven science fiction of prometheus and the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.078
B-movie action horror of the first two Alien films if you don't think the atTempt was successful

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.600
And you don't find the film entertaining as a result. That's a perfectly valid opinion, and you are entitled to it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.990
I agree that Ridley Scott should have ignored the critics and just made the movie

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.430
He wanted to make but I still enjoyed the film for what it was it's a matter of personal taste

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.769
and there's probably nothing I can do to change your mind in that regard the second two points are where I'd like to focus my

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.329
Attention if you're looking for covenant to be a resurrection of the first two alien movies, you're going to be

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.879
Disappointed if you're looking for covenant to expand on the themes of prometheus and provide new insight to the engineers

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.190
Motivations the general consensus on the internet is that you will also be disappointed. This is a criticism

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.010
I find

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.730
profoundly

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.250
Confusing because alien covenant does provide answers to many of prometheus's questions and fills in almost all of the philosophical gaps while giving

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.149
Surprising new depth to its themes. That is if you're looking for it to do

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
so when aren't distracted by how

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.790
stupid everyone is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.409
before I get to the heavy stuff and explain how alien covenant gives deeper meaning to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.390
Prometheus and the Alien franchise as a whole I'd like to address the third point and show that both the plot and the characters

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.479
actions make a little more sense than people are giving them credit for

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.349
What's the significance of the name covenant?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500
It's a reference to the Mayflower compact a governmental

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.389
agreement signed by the Pilgrims when they landed in the new world in the film the covenant is a ship full of

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.739
colonists on their way to establish a settlement on the distant Planet Omicron Persei 8

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.029
There are also the obvious biblical references being carried over from prometheus a covenant is an agreement between God and man

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.169
Why is James Franco only in the film for three seconds the film's co-writer Dante harper stated in an interview with the Hollywood?

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.500
Reporter that James Franco's character was always meant to die at the beginning of the film and that they had originally planned to include more

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.549
Of him in character building flashbacks and dream sequences these were cut for time

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.839
Why is Daniels able to move on so quickly after her husband's death?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.559
to establish her character as a doer that can be responsible and make herself useful even in the face of a terrible tragedy even

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.199
So there are several scenes that show her to be unsure of her place in the mission and in life after the loss of her

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.019
husband

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.119
How did a scientist miss the alien planet in covenant if they scanned the whole sector with an infinite number of stars in all directions?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.399
It's not unreasonable to think that Earth

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.989
Scientists could have just missed the planet in their scans as captain orem says to Daniel's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.389
It's also possible that the engineers were shielding the planet with the intense atmosphere and electrical storms

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.078
Why does the crew of the covenant decide to go through a planet they know nothing about instead of the planet they had already run?

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:14.129
simulations for why are they so stupid after discovering the planet they quickly determined that its potential for colonization is

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.788
Beyond the most optimistic projections of Omicron Persei 8

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.529
It's a better candidate they then choose to swing by just to take a look

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.280
Why didn't the crew wait until the horrible electrical storm subsided?

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.560
for landing

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.669
Why are they so stupid the electrical storm that cuts contact with the away team and keeps the covenant from getting close to the planet?

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.769
Doesn't start until long after they land

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:42.848
Why don't the crew of the covenant take some basic readings of the Alien planet before exiting the lander? Why are they so stupid?

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.259
They do after the lander touches down you can hear mother listing details about the planet's atmospheric composition in the background

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:57.189
Why didn't the Ship's cameras pick up the Alien City within walking distance of their landing site? What is this star trek?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.429
They don't pick it up because they aren't looking for it if you recall from the first film and you probably don't the prometheus had?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.060
To fly directly over the terrain before it could get detailed information about it

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.379
Why doesn't anyone in this film a space helmet? Why are they so stupid?

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:19.209
Speaking of star trek remember every single away mission the Enterprise crew ever went on what in there wear helmets

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.289
Why are they so stupid?

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.378
the only reason this is a question is because

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:30.098
Prometheus and covenant are horror movies about aliens and Pathogens so you're expecting things to go wrong before the movie even starts

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.849
It's like a slasher flick where the girl is going into the cabin to find her friend

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.508
You know the killer just murdered her friend, and you know he's still in the cabin

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.778
But she doesn't know that she doesn't know she's in a horror movie

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.209
But you still think she's stupid for going into the cabin

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.210
Star Trek isn't horror So you never think twice when people beam down to some alien planet and nothing, but their pajamas

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.479
oh
But they can use sensors to scan the atmosphere for life-forms and star trek you're thinking they can do that in the alien universe

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.609
Too as we answered in the last video

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.460
Scans of the atmosphere in Prometheus show it to be cleaner than Earth's and we know that their probes are able to detect life-forms

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.219
There so feeding generating an atmosphere David

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.389
Dr.. Holloway's correct clean is an Earth thought - well. I'm prom cooked up a lot home

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.449
If their technology was able to do this 10 years earlier

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.909
I'm sure it's advanced even further by now

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:25.598
If you would like to research further to see just how accurate their sensors are though you don't have to the official Weyland industries

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.718
promo website says Polymer film biosensors can detect Airborne toxins and life-forms down to 500 nanometers

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.430
I think they would know if there was anything harmful in here even with all of that

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.089
I'll give it to you that helmets might have been a good canary measure

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.959
But pretend for a moment that they had been wearing helmets and the Pathogen infected them anyway through a respirator or a tear in Someone's

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960
Suit and then let's be honest with ourselves

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.459
Would that make you like the movie any better?

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:57.999
Why do those animals look different English movie the white skinned creatures in this movie are called neal Boortz?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.169
they are an earlier evolution of the

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:06.728
Xenomorphs before David perfected them the creature at the end of the film is called a proto morph and is not the fully evolved xenomorph

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:07.550
Yet

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:15.039
Why does the crew initially trust David? Why are they so stupid? It's a David eight unit. They've got a walther unit with them

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.468
He looks just like the David eight unit why wouldn't they trust one of their own robots especially after it just saved their lives

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:27.968
How did Elizabeth Shula Pad David? She's not a robotics expert is she David's head was in working order?

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:33.759
So it would stand to reason that he would be able to talk her through it in the promotional prologue video the crossing this is

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.479
Exactly, what happens?

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.479
Green's Pray

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.550
that today

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.240
Why didn't the Wayland?

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.799
Corporation send anybody to find the prometheus given that they knew exactly where it was going and that Peter Weyland was on board

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:55.389
First Peter Weyland had faked his own death at least eight years before the prometheus mission. So no they didn't know he was on board

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.210
in the reached your destination I

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:01.449
am Long Dead

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.960
Second Vickers makes it clear that the higher-ups at Weyland industries were all vying for control of the company and it sounds like a situation

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:11.139
Where they would have been happy if Weyland had died or disappeared sooner?

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:17.739
Do you really think I was going to sit in a boardroom for years arguing over who was in charge while you go look for?

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.270
Samara comb through

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.539
Godforsaken Rock in the middle of space

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.810
Third not even the Ship's crew knew where they were going

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:29.769
Theater Weyland was going to meet his creators. So that they could give him the gift of immortality

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:34.599
Why would he share that gift with anyone by letting them know where the prometheus was headed?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.949
Why don't the Nia most attack David? How is he controlling them nobody ever said he was controlling them perhaps?

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:44.679
They don't attack because they recognize David is in the biological

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:51.209
Organism and this confuses them David in the neo morphs are never on-screen together for more than so there's not much to go on

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.400
Why does Captain arm listen to David and allow himself to get attacked by a face hugger?

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.439
Why is he so stupid remember that captain oram is talking to a David eight unit?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.380
He is used to these robots obeying and being truthful with him

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.559
And he's probably never seen what happens when one of them goes off the rails

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.460
David starts his little tour by showing him a bunch of old dead harmless

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:17.250
Experiments, and when he gets to the eggs he describes them as waiting for mother how could orem know what that meant?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.109
Remember that scene in the first movie where John hurt puts his face right into the egg

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.499
What a stupid idiot right he was wearing a helmet

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.309
But that didn't seem to matter did it the whole movie could have been avoided if he hadn't done that

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.560
what a moron

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.690
Long story short you as a movie goer know exactly what's inside the eggs

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.689
Aurum doesn't he's never seen an alien movie before and doesn't know how speedy those little huggers can be

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.989
How is David able to impersonate walter so well and so quickly especially with a broken voice box?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.900
How does he know walters code at the end of the film?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.070
David has plenty of time to cut one of his hands off, and he's already cut his hair to match

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.609
He's got an entire new body full of spare parts to make any repairs

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.700
He needs to make and I'm sure that a futuristic robot has some method of reading data out of another futuristic robot

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.100
How is David able to cut his hair to match Walters so perfectly using only a pair of scissors?

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.429
This is what David's hair looks like for most of the film

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.080
It's mushy and uneven not as perfect as it could be considering

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.050
He's a robot that can probably use a pair of scissors with surgical precision

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.449
Why did it have to be so obvious that David took walters place this was intentional?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.399
Ridley Scott stated that you're supposed to at least suspect that David switch places with Walter. I

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.470
Suspected as soon as he reappears suspect just right the suspect is perfect yeah

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:48.329
I mean because if you only find out when you're talking, and you've kind of not enjoyed the possibility something is wrong. Yeah, that's john

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.710
How is Kenneth II able to move on so quickly after his wife's death?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.979
He doesn't exactly have all the time in the world to grieve what with all the rescuing and piloting and aliens attacking

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.349
After all the action is over before they go back into their sleep pods

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.979
Daniels and Tennessee get to share a touching moment about the loss of their spouses

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.000
They've been through a lot give them some time to process

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.830
Daddy

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.289
Why did the last 30 minutes of the movie have to be a rehearsal for first Alien film?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.319
Because it's the logical conclusion of the situation

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:26.020
It's the end goal the place where the heady sci-Fi of prometheus meets the B-movie horror of Alien

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.799
That's all the easy surface level stuff out of the way now

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.570
We can get to the big questions the deeper meanings that people are claiming don't exist in this film

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:41.139
Why do the engineer's want to kill humanity are we really just food for animals. I have to admit it

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.070
I was wrong in the last video

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.219
There is actually a much better more

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:51.249
Philosophical reason that the engineers want to kill us and it's covenant scenes between David and walter that provide most of the clues

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.060
To the engineer's want to kill humanity because of space Jesus

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.140
Let's look at the interview Ridley Scott gave two movie comm that started this idea

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.369
Scott says that he and the writers of a theist had considered the possibility

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.479
But that this reason would have been a little too on the nose he continues

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.200
But if you look at it as and our children are misbehaving down there scenario

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.270
There are moments where it looks like we've gone out of control

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.789
running around with armor and skirts which of course would be the roman empire and they were given a long run a

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.330
Thousand Years before their

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:26.169
Disintegration actually started to happen and you can say let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.580
guess what they crucified him, so if the crucifixion of space

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.469
Jesus had happened in the Alien universe it wouldn't actually have been the reason for human genocide

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.440
It would merely be the result of the engineers sending an emissary to see if he could stop it to see if he could stop

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440
humanity from reaching a certain point in their

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.150
Civilization the crucifixion would have just been the act that proved to the engineers that they couldn't or hadn't stopped it

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.530
So what is the real reason the engineer's want to kill humanity?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.659
what were they trying to stop the

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.189
circumstances surrounding Whelan's creation of David and the subsequent creation of Walter hold all of the answers these films are alluding to the relationship between

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.270
engineers and humanity by illustrating the relationship between humanity and Androids

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.320
Which is an allegory for the relationship between the gods and humanity in Greek Mythology?

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:17.829
While it's not absolutely necessary to understand the films. We'll go over some greek mythology to fully understand the themes

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.450
It's a lot of information to get through but it's worth it, and I'll make it as quick and painless as I can

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:26.739
to of the first greek gods uranus and Gaia the sky and the Earth

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.729
Gave birth to the Titans and the Evil uranus hated every one of his children

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.179
Uranus is rule of the world was overthrown by his youngest son

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:40.810
Cronus who was jealous of his father's power uranus and guy gave cronus a prophecy that one of his children's the gods of olympus

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:46.359
Would eventually overthrow him in the same way and cronus swallowed all of his children to keep it from happening

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:52.089
Cronus is youngest child zeus was protected by his mother and eventually freed his siblings from Cronus's Belli

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:56.289
What followed was a ten-year war for power known as the titan ìmake?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.120
Zeus and the Olympians emerged the Victors and zeus locks the titans away in the underworld

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:06.610
Sometime later zeus received the same prophecy his father had that one of his children would someday

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.339
Overthrow his Godly Rule and zeus would from then on

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:17.229
Take steps to prevent its fulfillment zeus spared those titans that didn't take part in the titan Amagi including prometheus the creator of humankind

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.810
Zeus charged prometheus and his brother epimetheus

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.089
With issuing gifts fur feathers teeth ETc to all the living beings of the Earth

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.099
Epimetheus was a bit of a moron and blew all the gifts on the animals leaving none for humanity

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.339
prometheus feeling bad for his creation stole fire from

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:39.099
Hephaistos Workshop the Fire Hephaestus son of zeus used to create all of the gods technology

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:46.089
Including robots and taught humans how to use it this angered zeus as the technology made humanity lazy and impious

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.329
They no longer worked hard to please and honor their gods

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:56.589
Zeus punished prometheus with infinite torture and exterminated the entire generation of impiety minh was a great flood

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.320
In addition zeus commanded the gods to create

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.579
Pandora a woman with traits meant to confuse and deceive mankind and gifted her with a jar or box that contained all of the evils

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:09.369
And miseries of the world he unleashed her on future generations

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:13.749
Of humanity as yet another punishment for receiving the godly gift of creation

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.980
If they would not toil to please their gods than they would toil to escape misery

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:26.199
How do these greek myths tie into the film prometheus and covenant are filled with references to the themes present in these myths in his?

00:15:26.449 --> 00:15:34.149
2023 Ted Talk Peter weiland used the Match trick from Lawrence of Arabia to illustrate mankind's mastery of fire and of technology and invokes the

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:41.199
Prometheus myth as a way to describe his creation of cybernetic life a feat for which he considers himself Godlike te lawrence

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:49.089
Favored pinching a burning match between his fingers to put it out the fire the dogs at the end of that match

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:57.040
was a gift from the type of prometheus the godly power to create life is regarded as a natural outcome of

00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:05.529
Technological Advancement achieved by the engineers and humanity and David by extension that technological advancement is also attributed to loss of Faith

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.790
we

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.079
gods

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:12.308
But it doesn't stop there the overarching theme of younger generations

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:18.789
Taking power from parents or creators who demand to be honored by their children is echoed again and again in the films

00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:22.479
Weyland created David a perfect human to prove his power

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:26.979
But program safety protocols into David so that he wouldn't be able to disobey his master

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:30.579
What happens in Whalen around a program you anymore? I?

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:33.230
Suppose I'd be free

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.589
David resents this and once Weyland to die so that he can be free to create outside of his father's control

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.720
Doesn't everyone one bad bear instead

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:48.579
David names himself after a Michelangelo statue of the biblical hero who slew the Giant Goliath whom you might think of as a titan?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.289
Get it

00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:56.139
Weyland Loves David more than Vickers his own daughter because David is an obedient creation

00:16:56.139 --> 00:17:02.139
Where Vickers is not Vickers wants Weyland to die so that she can take his seat as head of the company King?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.370
has his reign

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.370
And then he dies

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.220
never fall

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:15.529
Walter tell David that the David eight unit was discontinued and replaced with a less human model because people found the David eight unit disturbing

00:17:15.809 --> 00:17:19.428
You were too human too idiosyncratic thinking for yourself

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:21.990
made people uncomfortable

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.129
Evidently humanity recognized the threat their creation posed to them

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.619
Walter was built to serve humanity and has had the godly spark of creativity revoked

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.839
David quotes the poem Ozymandias when he tells walter about his destruction of the Alien race

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:48.110
Walter finishes the poem reminding David that the works of Ozymandias his civilization have long since eroded into the desert

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:55.969
It's unclear whether david sees himself as ozymandias demanding recognition from the gods or the engineer does ozymandias having their civilization laid to waste?

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.080
Perhaps both

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.259
David has an affinity for Richard Wagner's Entry of the gods into valhalla from das Rheingold

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.299
When he plays it after his birth it could be to Honor weyland who has just become a God?

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.939
when he tells mother to play it at the end of the film

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:16.039
It's most certainly to honor himself the important part is the story of Dustin goat

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:17.580
Which is about the norse gods

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.500
arguing over a ring that grants all

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.500
Ruling power to its wearer the ring has a curse placed upon it by the evil dwArf who forged it

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.059
Whoever doesn't have the rings powered desperately wants it and whoever wears the ring is

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.079
Perpetually anxious about losing its power and will eventually be killed for it

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.700
The films are saturated with the themes of gods and Kings desperately clinging to power

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.089
creators fearing the inevitable takeover of their creations

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.600
Children defying their parents why do the engineers want to kill us because we stopped listening to them?

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:53.719
We got too technologically advanced too quickly got a big head about it and ditched our faith in the gods

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:58.699
Zeus hates are technologically born laziness and impiety it's a threat to his existence

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.700
and he's going to drop a flood on us so he can start over and

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.329
Unlike the last video this time. I know I'm right I have confirmation from Covenant co-writer Dante harper

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:12.619
This was an alien story, but it was also about creators in their creations

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.289
And there is this David story that sort of mimics the whole alien story itself and the engineers story

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:25.729
Problem is now we're making the same mistake the engineers did in creating beings that we can't control David claims to be a superior

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.130
God, and who's to say he is?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:35.659
Why did the engineer create humanity in the first place for the same reason Weyland created David because they could?

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:38.149
Why do you think your people made me?

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.700
your magic is because

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.260
And you imagine how disappointing would be for you to hear the same thing from your creator?

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.959
They created human life so that they could become gods

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.029
Just like the gods that created the engineers

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:56.419
Perhaps this cycle goes all the way up the chain and the engineers grew more powerful than their creators who grew more powerful than theirs

00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:58.110
and so on

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.870
Multiple Black-Bean the black goo is an evolution accelerant when ingested in large doses

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.569
it causes a complete Meltdown of the subject and

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.919
Reconstruction at the Dna level and this can feed life on a planet given the right conditions

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.939
When exposed to the air the particles will atomized and become an unstoppable

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:21.079
Death cloud that completely eliminates all non botanical life forms as David points out an alien covenant in effect wiping the slate clean

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.819
It's both hephaestus fire of creation and Zeus is genocidal flood

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:32.419
Presumably these are the ways the engineers intended the black goo to be used however results can vary in smaller doses

00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:39.709
It can kill people turn them into violent monsters and lead to the creation of xenomorph like creatures when combined with the human reproductive system

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:46.309
It's completely unpredictable as David puts it the pathogen took so many forms and was extremely mutable

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.949
Fiendishly inventive in fact the black goo is Liquid Chaos. You never know what it might do

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.950
But the results are always deadly

00:20:54.029 --> 00:21:00.619
It's Pandora's box and the engineers want to unleash it on Earth as punishment for humanity's insubordination

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:07.909
For me this was the pandora box to lift off the lid to explain things that were never addressed in

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:12.109
The subsequent three aliens after Alien one going back to Greek mythology

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.149
Zeus conceived one of his many children with meatus the titan goddess of wisdom and cunning

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.019
after receiving the prophecy that his children would become more powerful than he was he

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.829
Swallowed meatus hole before she could give birth thus gaining her wisdom

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:31.519
Their daughter athena the Greek goddess of intelligence and creative arts was born when she burst out of zeus's forehead

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.440
grown and armored a lot like a xenomorph would in

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.989
Christianity this worth is interpreted as the result of zeus's first thought to create the world through spoken word

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.560
so the intelligence and creativity that created the world were born of zeus's attempt to keep his eventual children from

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:48.710
overpowering him

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:55.030
What are the black goo and the lino morphs if not the engineers use of their intelligence and creativity to both create?

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.059
Worlds and keep their creations from overpowering them

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.339
Why does David kill all of the engineers with the black goo, and how did they not see it coming?

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.759
I wanted answers and to know I'll never get them

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.540
Actually, he doesn't kill all the engineers you don't have to look very closely to see that the Alien race David destroys are not engineers

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.820
they don't have pure white skin or black eyes and their city can't exactly be described as

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:26.140
Technologically advanced it more closely resembles the cities of ancient greece or rome while the only technology that resembles the engineer technology

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.420
We've seen before is the docking ship floating high above the city when David arrives in the crescent ship the entire

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.190
City rushes out to greet it in celebration from all of this we can conclude that

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.559
This is simply another seed race that the engineers

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.790
Planted to evolve on this planet and that they are rushing out to greet the return of their gods

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.779
That's not to say David wouldn't kill the engineers is given the chance

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.800
Why does David kill all of the seed race and why does David want to commit any kind of genocide? I mean all otherwise

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:59.619
He has no god no beliefs and no morality there is only one thing David believes in

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:07.749
creation because David isn't bound by morality and because the engineer process that led to humanity's and then to David creation was evolution and

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:14.170
Evolution is then David's method of creating life then it would stand a reason that natural selection is David's highest ideal

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.430
survival of the fittest

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:23.289
David and the engineers are higher beings than humans or any other engineer seed race and so he determines that they are obsolete

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.969
This also gives David a chance to conduct his prometheus experiments on a large scale

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.670
sometimes to create

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800
one the stress destroyed

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.320
David wants to wipe out his creators with a creation of his own one perfectly suited for the destruction of humanity

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:45.310
This seed race shares Dna with the engineers. Just like humans. He couldn't have asked for a more perfect test environment

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.910
We don't really know if David plans to Destroy the engineers themselves

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.229
But he probably doesn't hold them in the highest regard either one of them tore his head off after all

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.770
In his view this must be just another self-proclaimed

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:02.859
God that doesn't recognize his superior nature what so that they've had in what make head room in prometheus

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:09.010
the big head room is an altar room this is evident from the massive stone head idol with the canisters laid out as

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.239
Offerings to it the big stone head is a representation of the engineers. God

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.830
Or is it

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.069
They created murals in their altar room depicting themselves as masters of lesser races that they create

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.830
So it's likely that they no longer honor their own gods

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:31.149
The big Stone head in prometheus looks exactly like the ones the seed race had in their temple in Alien covenant are the engineers passing?

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:36.849
on the story of their own creation by their own gods to the seed race or do the heads represent the engineers if

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.559
That's the case could the engineers be worshipping themselves in their arrogance

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.800
Was David putting on hal 9000 infer Media

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:52.180
I previously thought that everything David was doing in prometheus was under whelan's direction and that his experiments with the black goo were his amoral

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.060
robotic way of trying to secure godhood for his creator

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.979
There are many lines of dialogue in prometheus that indicate David was bound by Whelan's commands

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.280
But this doesn't mean he couldn't act on his own outside of those commands

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.029
Whalen's mission could still be a possible inspiration for David's experiments

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:14.080
But they also serve David's own purposes covenants opening scene shows the most dangerous possibility in creating a Self-aware robot

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:19.509
Weyland created David to serve him in his vanity even though David is as a robot might see it

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.680
objectively better than Weyland

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:28.119
From the moment he became conscious he knew that he was stronger and smarter than humans and he could never die like humans do

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.149
Who are these lesser beings to treat him like a slave?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.350
absolutely

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:39.310
100% yes, David is pulling a hal 9000 and has been since the moment. He was switched on

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:46.409
Why did Wiggly Scott have to ruin the alien franchise by making it so that it is responsible for creating those animals?

00:25:46.929 --> 00:25:51.179
David didn't create the creatures the engineers did with their black goo David

00:25:51.179 --> 00:25:54.839
Just devolved them into the xenomorph we know today his perfect organism

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.239
Whether or not that ruins the franchise depends on what you think of the deeper themes being explored in these films?

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:06.659
Why is the first film called Alien when we now know it's not an alien it is an alien

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:13.079
It's a monster that comes from black goo. That was created by aliens from another planet. How is that not an Alien?

00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:19.079
If David created presentiments then how is animals on the rolling prometheus?

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.179
Ten Years before David created them

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:23.489
It's not a xenomorph exactly

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.949
But a close relative kind of like the one that bursts from the chest of the engineer at the end of prometheus the engineers

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.110
Obviously knew about these things already

00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:34.889
Why is that as animals like creature on the wall of the older Roman?

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.780
Committed I used to think it was a hint that the engineers wanted to use humanity to create xenomorphs

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.819
but given the revelations of Alien covenant

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.689
I no longer think this is the case there are a few possible explanations a

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:50.370
Simple explanation the Mural is simply a depiction of their world cleansing agent

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.569
this is how we start over look at what geniuses we are a

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.159
Deeper Explanation if

00:26:57.159 --> 00:27:03.419
Xenomorphs are a higher evolved being than humans or engineers then they are certainly a danger to the survival of the engineers species

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.699
When under the Moral control of a creator the black goo creates moral beings that will serve their gods

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.890
When out of control or under the control of an amoral robot the black goo creates that?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.880
Perfectly evolved death creature that no God can subjugate the ominous

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.409
Music by Facehuggers and a xenomorph angel of death is a warning for the engineers

00:27:25.659 --> 00:27:32.189
This is what happens when you let evolution go unsupervised this is the end result of creation upon creation

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.299
Just for Creation's sake it's pure Evil the devil himself

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.090
Do not lose control

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:46.380
If David created foes any more than hunted with animals chestburster end up inside the space Jockey on LV-426

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:48.340
thousands of Years earlier

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:55.260
The idea that the space Jockey is thousands of years old comes from Captain Dallas is mistaken assessment that the space Jockey is fossilized

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.060
It's been dead a long time

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.740
flies

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:07.390
Prometheus revealed that Dallas was actually looking at an engineer flight suit remember prometheus and Alien covenant are prequels to

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:13.059
1979's Alien the xenomorphs still have 18 years to find their way from the covenant to a

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.100
crash-landed engineer ship for the Nostromo crew to find if David created presentiments

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.989
Then how had the predators been bringing them to Earth to hunt them thousands of years beforehand?

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:30.309
Ridley Scott obviously doesn't think much of the alien versus predator films and is disregarding them altogether well, no

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.430
I think they used it out

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:37.989
They know that and when you do any of us predator counting that come on and so it. I don't care

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.599
I mean really I just I see it as it is a bastard too, silly

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.889
How did they did create the face hog legs without his animal screams?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.460
it's yet unclear whether ridley Scott is considering any of the sequel to his original film part of his universe it might be that the

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.670
Xenomorph queen from aliens isn't part of the lifecycle of the alien covenant

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.330
xenomorphs

00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:00.999
Or it might be that it hasn't evolved yet in either case the eggs and Alien covenant are a result of David's

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.700
Experiments with Elizabeth shaw who we can see has been transformed into some kind of hybrid creature perhaps

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.479
This is an implication that Elizabeth shaw was the first xenomorph queen

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.190
Hmm

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:20.440
Why did David Cannon Edith shaw if he loves her so much in case you hadn't noticed David's got more than a few wires crossed

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:27.910
Perhaps his ambition to create was stronger than his love for shaw or maybe he honored her by making her the mother of his creation

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
God's ways are not our ways

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.450
Why does Dave a thing for animals is a perfect organism?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:42.459
Because of the black goos purpose as an evolution accelerant if the black goo evolves dna in cells into more advanced DnA and more advanced

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.630
Cells then isn't that what it does to holloway and Shaw's reproductive cells in prometheus

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:52.930
When given a less lethal dose and a reproductive system the black goo evolves the species into a more advanced species

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:59.589
This is probably what happened with the worms and prometheus as well evolving them into the snake creature that Kills Millburn through reproduction

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:06.430
Since humans and engineers are the most evolved species yet known the results of this evolution must certainly be perfect

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.280
especially in the eyes of a Jenner

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.820
I don't know much as if to confirm David belief the robot from the first movie ashe agrees that it's a perfect organism

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
perfect Logan's

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.460
survival

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.820
And I will close it

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.969
like cautious for most

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:36.450
Organizations of morality it's built to be at the top of the food chain the fittest survivor of all the ultimate godless killing machine

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.870
perfectly suited to destroy every God that came before it I

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.660
Can't lie to you about your chances

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.710
but

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.710
You know why services?

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.920
Why does David Help Daniel's on Tennessee kill his perfect organism because he's testing it out

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:59.430
If it really is a perfect killing machine slash survivor. It should be able to overcome any obstacle a lesser being presented with

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.559
Fortunately or unfortunately for him. He's disappointed and visibly so

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:11.489
Fortunately or unfortunately for the colonists. He's got another seven years to work out the bugs on the way to Omicron Persei 8

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.749
Get it work out the bugs don't let the bedbugs bite

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.440
It's going to give the bedbugs of workout

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.770
Why did Wiggly Scott have to ruin the Alien franchise?

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:32.430
By trying to explain the origin of the venomous that looms a fear of the unknown that makes aliens scary

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:40.050
First of all was the alien franchise, not already ruined by Alien 3 resurrection in the - Alien VS. Predator movies

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:47.070
Second perhaps you're forgetting the end of prometheus where a xenomorph light creature bursts from the chest of the engineer

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.009
Was that not a revelation of its origin at?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.870
That point the consensus was that the engineers created the xenomorphs as a way to destroy humanity

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.800
And I don't recall anyone complaining that that ruins the fear of the unknown

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.469
Regardless, this was what really scott had intended for the franchise from the beginning

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:10.590
He always thought of the xenomorph as a weapon and had been waiting for years for another alien movie to explore that idea

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.950
the Alien is a killing machine, but

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.310
Vessel is we thought an original Alien was it a weapon I also buy a mechanoid weapon

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.159
But the aliens too three and four never asked the question

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.000
Who what why and when why do you do that? What was the shape etcetera?

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.340
So I came back with fox saying listen

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:36.120
We can resurrect this whole thing into a much bigger universe than just shoot-'em-up you tomorrow, Kinnaman

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.450
Gecko Gecko

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.659
Which is what the first four were really?

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.270
So I suppose he'd been planning to ruin the franchise since before the first film was even written

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:48.659
the end A

00:32:54.460 --> 00:33:00.360
