00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.970
Top 10 Cancelled MILITARY Operations That
Would’ve CHANGED EVERYTHING

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:37.460
10.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Operation Tannenbaum

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.690
The Plot: Despite its neutrality, Switzerland
was expecting to be invaded at any time, and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.660
had actually raised the draft age to 60 to
add more soldiers to defend the country.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.520
Hitler promised to respect their neutrality,
but the Swiss knew better, especially after

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.510
he started to invade other non-enemy countries
like the Soviet Union.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.039
Hitler even told Italian diplomats “Switzerland
possessed the most disgusting and miserable

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860
people and political system.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.889
The Swiss were the mortal enemies of the new
Germany.”

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:09.479
Why It Didn’t Happen: This is still a mystery.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.380
Hitler was expected to go in at any time,
with Germans and Italian forces massed on

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.909
the border and Switzerland ready to start
fighting house to house warfare, but he never

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.069
pushed the button.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.719
This may have been due to the Allies landing
in North Africa, or the Soviet Union proving

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.719
to be a handful.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.759
But this was also due to the fact that almost
every household in Switzerland had at least

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.149
one gun, due to national service for all males.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.179
They would slow advances with potshots, possibly
stalling the troops.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.630
If It Did Happen: If it was successful, Germany
would have a slight issue.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.479
Most Germans did not want to see a neutral
country being taken over, so this would have

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.520
led to massive internal criticism and disobedience.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.909
So much so that, according to many contemporary
German reports, it would have overwhelmed

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.909
many cities police and armed forces, and would
have weakened Germany.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
9.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:01.909
Plan Rubber

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.809
The Plot: After the Vichy government was installed
in France, German aircraft were now in range

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:11.540
of South America through bases in Africa,
with Brazil being a trove of natural resources

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.940
waiting to be taken.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.569
The US government thought that after losing
to Moscow, the Germans might take their anger

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.829
out West, and into Brazil.

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.310
After Pearl Harbor, the U.S. thought this
plan credible enough to draw up plans to invade

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.310
Brazil.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.500
While planning showed that most coastal cities
could not be taken quickly with beach assaults,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.090
the U.S. decided to make formal plans anyway.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.450
Especially after they found some evidence
that Brazil’s dictators could side with

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.780
the Nazis.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.950
Called Plan Rubber, battleships were assigned
to the coastal positions and divisions were

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.060
assigned beaches and cities, eerily similar
to the D-day plans.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.329
Queries about Brazilian forces showed how
weak they were.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.190
Why It Didn’t Happen: However, the plans
never came to fruition, mostly because Brazil,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.690
then on the fence on who to side with, finally
chose the Allies and actually allowed American

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.079
troops access to air bases and even signed
a defense pact with them.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.640
If It Did Happen: The U.S. had a right to
be afraid of Brazil’s Nazi sympathies, especially

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.829
since neighbor Argentina particularly liked
them.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.329
An American attack, demonstrated by exercises
in the States, would have most likely been

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.329
defeated.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.840
And, since the ruler of Brazil didn’t know
who to choose for the longest time, a nation

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.269
closely associated with Germany’s enemies
attacking Brazil, could have pushed them to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.459
go running to Germany for help, especially
with all the Pro-Nazi Brazilians.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.360
So if Plan Rubber was initiated, there would
most likely be a third front in World War

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.030
II, this time in South America.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.090
8.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.090
Operation Vulture

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.090
The Plot: In 1954, the French were busy trying
to defend French Indochina from Communist

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.920
guerrillas With the country about to fall,
the French asked the Americans to come and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.749
rescue the French forces in the region.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.450
The head of the French army even flew into
Washington to personally ask President Eisenhower

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.450
for help.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.250
A plan was quickly formulated, in which parts
of Vietnam would become the next Hiroshima.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.909
As in, they were going to allow the Americans
to drop three nuclear weapons on Vietnam simultaneously.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.180
Why It Didn’t Happen: Hmm, did you miss
the part about the nukes?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.519
President Eisenhower was unsure about them,
and called on the Brits for backing on this.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.560
When they said no, Eisenhower balked at going
in with only French assistance.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.090
If It Did Happen: Nukes would have been dropped
on the major Communist cities, most notably

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.090
Hanoi.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.870
The French and the Americans believed Vietnam
would surrender, and immediately stop the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.919
siege of Dien Bien Phu.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.160
With a now partially-radiated Vietnam now
back under French control (and France owing

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.240
the U.S. a huge favor,) U.S. intervention
in Vietnam a decade later would have probably

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.840
not have happened, sparing the generation
thousands of deaths, and quite possibly not

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.240
fighting anywhere.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.090
Provided the nukes didn’t kill us all anyway.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.090
7.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.090
Operation Northwoods

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.979
The Plot: After the Cuban Missile Crisis,
The American government began to suspect that

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.590
this Castro fellow in Cuba might be up to
no good.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.699
So the U.S. military with help from the CIA,
slapped a plan together, where they would

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.560
get some loyal Communists from Miami, give
them some cash, weapons and proposed targets,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.970
and say “go nuts”.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.440
Basically, this would show Americans that
Castro actually wanted to attack the United

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.690
States, and give them enough credibility for
them to attack Cuba, perhaps with some allied

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.790
help.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.819
Why It Didn’t Happen: When Kennedy read
it, he took one look and pretty much said

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.280
“Whose insane plan is this!??!?!?”

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.940
When Joint Chiefs of Staff tried to persuade
him otherwise, the enraged Kennedy, still

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.850
pretty mad at the CIA and military for using
civilians in missions, simply fired the guy,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.460
and the whole Northwoods plan died with him
leaving.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.599
If It Did Happen: According to the plans,
an unprovoked attack by Cuba would make international

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.780
powers side with the Americans.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.229
With international support, the US would be
free to attack the recently Communist nation.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.490
And, with Cuba at blame, the Soviet Union
couldn’t exactly defend their ally.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.629
So if Northwoods did happen, we would be looking
at a Cuban-American war in the early 1960’s.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.160
And with a small Army, it is quite likely
Cuba would have been defeated.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.330
And since this was to be done before the Cuban
Missile Crisis, that whole debacle would have

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.440
been averted.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440
6.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.190
Army of the Ocean Coasts

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.849
The Plot: Napoleon was having fun taking out
Egypt and Austria, until the Peace of Amiens

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:08.900
in 1803.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.509
Looking for a new target, he eyed his old
enemy, England.

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.979
Napoleon began a new three-year planning binge,
putting together 200,000 troops, and had his

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.879
shipyards in France and the Netherlands start
building fleets of ships.

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:26.051
Why It Didn’t Happen: France lost the Admiral
who was to take charge of the invasion, due

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.500
to tuberculosis.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.800
And when Napoleon oversaw tests of the huge
battleships to cross the channel, the ships

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.910
soon sank, leading to many lost ships and
men.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.169
While Paris was actually beginning to build
a victory column in preparation for the successful

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.080
conquest of England, Napoleon began to consider
things that weren’t ships, mostly hot air

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.830
balloons, and actually prepared the first
air invasion in history.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.259
England soon got wind of an attack, and prepared
the coasts for an attack.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.379
And then, before an attack could mount, England
struck first, attacking vital French harbors.

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.740
After Trafalgar, Napoleon had to divert resources
to Spain.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.530
If It Did Happen: It would have been the first
airborne invasion ever, even with poorly-made

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.560
air balloons leading the charge.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.650
Assuming that didn’t kill everyone, there
was the rest of England.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.740
Leading Napoleonic scholars believe that 2,000
ships full of soldiers would be launched,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.689
wiping out any British ships in their path
to London.

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.919
Considering that there were not many soldiers
at home because of overseas fighting, they

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.960
would be outnumbered, even with a lot of troops
being recalled.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.759
So either Napoleon gets into London or, if
somehow defeated, he turns efforts to other

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.759
British territory.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.620
Either way, today’s maps would probably
not look the same, with a fairly good chance

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.400
of London being an occupied city for many
years.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400
5.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.800
Huele a Quemado

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.480
The Plot: In 1977, Panamanian General Omar
Torrijos, and American President Jimmy Carter,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.380
were planning how to deal with the Panama
Canal Zone, which was then under American

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.380
control.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.130
After tense negotiations, Carter agreed to
give the Canal back to Panama in 1999, which

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.860
the US ultimately did.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.789
However, if that had failed, Torrijos had
an ace up his sleeve: if Panama couldn’t

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:02.560
have it, no one could.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.759
Cleverly code-named “Huele a Quemado”
(Spanish for “It smells like something is

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:10.360
burning”), the plan stated that, if Panama
didn’t get the Canal Zone back, then it

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.349
would pretty much attack and destroy the thing.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:16.600
Why It Didn’t Happen: It was signed and
approved in the U.S. Congress by one vote,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.240
thus ensuring Panama the canal in 1999 and
none of the “let’s destroy the most valuable

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.090
trade route in the world at our own expense”
business.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.500
If It Did Happen: On average, a few hundred
million tons of shipping per year pass through

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.410
the Canal, serving every continent, and tolls
from the canal circulate back into the economy.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.340
If the canal was blown up, world cargo trade
would be cut at its knees, meaning most probably

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.450
a bigger recession, Carter losing even more
to Reagan in the 1980 elections, and the VERY

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.100
strong possibility of the United States invading
Panama in retaliation.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100
4.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.260
Operation Vegetarian

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.360
The Plot: During World War II, Britain decided
maybe it was time for some out-of-the-box

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360
thinking.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.180
Thus began the ironically-titled “Operation
Vegetarian.”

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.250
Started in 1942, Britain devised linseed cakes
filled with anthrax, and dropped them onto

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.430
German fields.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.260
Cattle would then eat them, with the population
then eating the meat and passing the anthrax

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.080
onto the humans, killing millions and creating
a food shortage.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.440
Why It Didn’t Happen: Because the U.K. actually
poisoned themselves in the process.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.810
Britain’s initial testing didn’t go so
well, actually contaminating an area of Scotland

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.420
until 1990.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.930
The cakes made were eventually incinerated.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.470
Even then, they still had backing from many
military leaders to give it a shot, but it

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.290
wasn’t worth making more of the UK uninhabitable
with more testing.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.560
If It Did Happen: Seeing what it did to Scotland
unintentionally, a part of Germany could have

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.620
seen major food shortages, with all the cows
suddenly dying from anthrax attacks.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.960
With Bavaria, the main target and cattle area,
out of it, troops and civilians would have

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.480
had even less food to go on, and possibly
surrendered earlier than expected.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480
3.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480
Operation Downfall

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.290
The Plot: In case Truman didn’t opt to fire
the atomic bombs, the Allies needed a backup

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.670
plan to get Japan.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.570
Namely, an invasion.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.670
Creatively called Operation Downfall, Forces
would go for the bottom Japanese island of

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.680
Kyushu, and work up.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.990
Estimates of American troops lost range from
250,000 to 4 million, if civilians were brought

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.080
in to defend.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.830
500,000 Purple Hearts were made in preparation,
a number so large that they have supplied

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.600
every single war since, with about 100,000
still left over.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.130
Why It Didn’t Happen: After Truman saw the
numbers of estimated casualties, he decided

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.670
that nuking would be much easier, and Japan
surrendered in early September, much sooner

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.500
than the Downfall estimate of fighting until
1947 or so.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.000
If It Did Happen: The War Department made
500,000 purple hearts, so they had a good

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.720
idea how many soldiers would be hurt or killed
in taking over the islands.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.520
Also, if an invasion did occur, with the Soviets
coming from the North, Japan would have been

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.840
taken over by the US, Soviet Union, and China.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.510
After the real surrender, the Soviet Union
wanted a part of occupation like Germany,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.290
but they were denied this by Douglas MacArthur.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.710
If there was an invasion, it would have been
hard to say no, so that meant dividing up

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.970
Japan like Germany was.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.820
Meaning another part of the Cold War, in Asia,
and even more power struggles in the decades

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.820
ahead.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820
2.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.860
Vietnam POW Rescue

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.380
The Plot: In the early 1980’s, the United
States got wind that some POW’s and MIA’s

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.810
from the Vietnam War might still be alive
in Laos and Vietnam.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.530
An elite force of the Army, the Delta Force,
was charged with planning and getting the

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.620
soldiers out.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.770
Why It Didn’t Happen: The strike was set
up twice and canceled at the last minute twice,

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.820
all because a former Vietnam vet hired American
and Laotian mercenaries, who went into Laos

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.880
to get the missing soldiers themselves.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.800
The vet, a man named Bo Gritz, didn’t help
much with his secret missions.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.980
And when they actually went in, they were
immediately caught and ambushed by Vietnamese

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.980
forces.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.180
Eager not to have another Vietnam, the Delta
missions had to be scrubbed, all because Gritz

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.370
was drawing attention into the region about
POW’s being held behind the lines.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.130
Gritz was even called out on his behavior,
being told he was doing more harm than help.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.690
But Gritz did inspire Rambo and the second
Delta Force movie, so he wasn’t totally

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.690
wrong here.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.610
If It Did Happen: Delta Force, like the SEALs,
have a pretty high success rate, as seen recently

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.120
with the Somali shipping hostages and the
Bin Laden takedown.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.090
If Gritz wasn’t there trying to do it himself,
many POW’s would have been brought back

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.900
into the United States safe and sound.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.900
1.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.900
The Warsaw Question

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.990
The Plot: When Germany took over Warsaw during
the beginning of WWII, Warsaw residents threw

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.990
a fit.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.990
For several years.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.360
Despite German numbers, Warsaw residents,
especially the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.480
were not giving up easily, with much of the
city in shambles because of the fighting.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.910
So Hitler and friends decided to just get
rid of Warsaw and build a new, more German

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.570
city in its place.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.930
Why It Didn’t Happen: By the time the Germans
had just about quelled the population, they

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.960
had to retreat from Russian troops marching
on to Berlin.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.310
In the only instance this sentence has ever
been uttered, Stalin did wonders for Warsaw.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.830
If It Did Happen: With no more Warsaw, Poland
would basically have to build a new capital

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.790
from scratch, or reuse the old one in Krakow
for awhile.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.370
Basically, all of Poland’s growth after
WWII would be reduced with no central capital.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:14.600
In the best case scenario, they would’ve
had a shiny new city with Nazi icons everywhere.
