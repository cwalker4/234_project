00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.801
The President:  Well, thank
you all for being here.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.904
We are doing a lot of things,
a lot of things are happening.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.506
Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.775
Secretary Alex Azar,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.746
who's really setting
the world on fire now

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.615
with your lowering
of prescription drug prices

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.584
and a lot of other
things you're doing,

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.885
and we appreciate it very much.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.121
A lot of people are seeing it,
already, what's happening.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.825
And especially the lowering
of the price of healthcare --

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.427
we see what's going on there.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.529
It's going to be a tremendous
reduction in healthcare

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.399
pricing because of what
we're all doing together.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.000
So, great going, Alex.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.804
And Secretary Betsy DeVos
for joining us.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.507
Today, we're here with state
and local leaders,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.509
law enforcement officers,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.178
and educations
officials to discuss

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.980
how we can make
our schools safe

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.548
and our communities secure.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.385
And no better time to
discuss it than right now.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.388
And I think we're making
a lot of progress,

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.725
and I can tell you there's
a tremendous feeling

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.959
that we want to
get something done.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.695
And we're leading
that feeling, I hope.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.399
But there's a great feeling,
including at the NRA,

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.436
including with
Republican senators

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.539
and, hopefully, Democrat
senators and congressmen.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.744
I want to thank Curtis Hill for
being here, attorney general.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:23.817
I also want to thank a really
tremendous attorney general --

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.553
that's Pam Bondi,
from Florida -- for being here.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.655
Thank you, Pam, very much,
great job you've done there.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.058
Yesterday, I met with survivors
of Parkland shooting.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:35.862
The Parkland shooting
is just horrible.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.731
So bad for so many people
and so bad for our country.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.035
Families who have lost their
children in school shootings

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.671
and local community members
of Washington, D.C.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.374
who want to make sure that
every child is safe at school.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.244
We're having a lot of
problems in Washington, D.C.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.614
I listened to their
heartbreaking stories.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.182
I asked them for their ideas,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.385
and pledged to them
that we will take action,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.753
unlike, for many years,

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:04.457
where people sitting in my
position did not take action.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.758
They didn't take proper action.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.394
They took no action at all,
we're going to take action.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.530
Today we want to hear from you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.233
on how we can improve physical
security in our schools,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.535
tackle the issue
of mental health,

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.470
which is a very big issue.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.742
This person that was caught
after having killed

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.511
so many people -- 17 --

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.847
and badly injuring
so many others --

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:29.349
people don't talk
about the injured,

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:33.319
and they have to go through
life with that horrible,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.490
horrible situation that
they were put in unnecessarily.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.927
People don't talk about that,
the people that are so badly --

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.563
I visited them in the hospital,
in Broward County.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.000
And these are injuries
like people wouldn't believe.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.738
And we want to ensure that,
when we see warning signs,

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.007
we act quickly.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.609
When we have somebody
that's mentally unstable,

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.846
like this guy that was a sicko,

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.814
and there were a lot
of warning signs.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.116
A lot of people
were calling, saying,

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.617
hey, he's going
to do something bad.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.754
People have to act.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.390
As I said last week,
we must work together

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.394
to create a culture of
our country that cherishes life

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:17.797
and forces real
human connections.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.034
We're also working to reduce
violent crime in America

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.436
and to make
our communities places

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.438
that can be totally safe
for our children,

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.340
for our families.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.142
Under my administration,

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:33.246
gun prosecutions have
increased very significantly.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.818
The Attorney General is very,
very much after that.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:43.656
And we're also after the gangs.
The gangs have been incredible.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:47.193
MS-13 -- I see where
a couple of commentators

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.195
that are lightweights said,

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.464
 Oh, MS-13,
who talks about that?

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.066
That's all he talked
about on Fox. 

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.834
No, that's not
talked about on Fox.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.336
That's talked about
in communities

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:01.140
where they're killing people,
not necessarily with guns --

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.810
because that's not painful
enough, this is what they think.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.111
They want to do it
more painfully

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.146
and they want to do it slowly.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.881
So, they cut them up
with knives.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.718
They don't use guns;
they use knives,

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.087
because they want it to be
a long, painful death

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.322
to people that had
no idea this was coming.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.926
And we're getting them out
by the thousands,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:20.893
putting them in jail

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.929
and we're getting them out
by the thousands.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.400
And our people from ICE
and our Border Patrol

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.302
people are much tougher
than they are.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.537
That's the only thing
they understand,

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.973
by the way, is toughness,
they don't understand niceness.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.844
They understand toughness,
and our people are much tougher.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.679
They go in there,
they grab them by the neck.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.315
There's no games being played.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.451
And I let them know
that's what we want.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.587
We need tougher
people than they are,

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.455
and our people are
a lot tougher than they are.

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.159
So, we're working on getting 
violent offenders off the streets

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.828
and guns out of the hands
of the dangerous criminals.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.599
There's nothing more important
than protecting our children.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.336
We had a, really,
incredible meeting yesterday

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:07.907
with some of the families
that have suffered so greatly,

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.111
in different places,
not only in Florida --

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.313
as you know, Columbine.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.851
And it was a very sad situation.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.320
But I will tell you,
background checks --

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.656
I called many senators
last night,

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.625
many congressmen,

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.560
and Jeff and Pam

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.328
and everybody in this room.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:33.733
I can tell you, Curtis, they're
into doing background checks

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.003
that they wouldn't be thinking
about maybe two weeks ago.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.639
We're going to do strong
background checks.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.710
We're going to work on getting
the age up to 21 instead of 18.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.512
We're getting rid
of the bump stocks.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.949
And we're going to be focusing
very strongly on mental health,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.384
because here's a case
of mental health.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:55.021
Part of the problem is we used
to have mental institutions.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.055
And I said this yesterday --

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.690
where you had
a mental institution

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.727
where you take a sicko,
like this guy --

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.863
he was a sick guy,
so many sides --

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.766
and you bring him to
a mental health institution.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.001
Those institutions
are largely closed

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.739
because communities
didn't want them.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.908
Communities didn't want
to spend the money for them.

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.444
So, you don't have
any intermediate ground.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:19.445
You can't put them in jail

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:20.813
because he hadn't
done anything yet,

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.315
but you know he's
going to do something.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.184
So, we're going to be
talking seriously

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.954
about opening mental health
institutions again.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:29.989
In some cases, reopening.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.793
I can tell you, in New York,
the governors in New York

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.294
did a very, very bad thing

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.197
when they closed
our mental institutions,

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.232
so many of them.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.933
You have these people
living on the streets.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:45.872
And I can say that, in many
cases throughout the country,

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.473
they're very dangerous.
They shouldn't be there.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.877
So, we're going to be talking
about mental institutions.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:54.213
And when you have
some person like this,

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.149
you can bring them into
a mental institution

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.618
and they can see
what they can do.

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:00.820
But we got to get them
out of our communities.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.190
So, with that being said,
I'd like to ask

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.827
the very talented people
around this table

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.096
to just introduce
themselves quickly

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.631
and say a few words.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.300
And maybe we can start
off with Pam Bondi.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.768
Pam, thank you.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.669
Ms. Bondi: Thanks, Mr. President.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:17.737
I'm Pam Bondi, Attorney
General of Florida.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.539
And, Mayor, thank you.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.542
I know you're going
through a lot now.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:24.610
President, she was there
that night with me.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.113
I think you were there with me
until 3:30 in the morning

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.981
when all these families
were being notified,

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.349
and it was horrific.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.820
So, I know you've been through
a lot, so thank you so much.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.821
The President:  She
did a great job.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.856
Ms. Bondi: I have a couple
issues that I'll wait --

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.057
or do you want to
talk about them now?

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.826
The President:  Talk about them.
You can talk.

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.894
Ms. Bondi:  Well, one it
addresses some of the things

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:43.596
you said in Florida.

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:46.165
It's called the Baker Act, but
it's our civil commitment act.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.735
And it's weak, and it's
about 1,000 pages long.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:53.973
And I've had my solicitor
general on it for four days,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.108
three days now, working on it,
we're rewriting it --

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.777
along with
Governor Scott, who's --

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.845
you're going to meet with him

00:07:58.845 --> 00:07:59.745
and he's going to give you
a ton of good information.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:00.513
The President:  Good.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.348
Ms. Bondi: We've been
rewriting it,

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:03.883
and we are going
to bring in something

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:07.053
called the Gun Violence
Restraining Order.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.788
So, if someone is
civilly committed --

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.124
and typically, you can hold them
for up to 72 hours,

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.160
but people are getting out
within 24 hours,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.228
the majority of them.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.429
So, what we want to do

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.130
is let law enforcement

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.665
come in and take the guns.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.666
The President:  Good.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:21.868
Ms. Bondi: They are a danger
to themselves or others --

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:24.604
The President: which
you can't do right now.

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:25.705
Ms. Bondi:  Well,
without being adjudicated.

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:26.906
So, because they're
a danger to themselves --

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.374
The President:  You want them
to take the guns

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:32.511
and not go through
six months of legal trials

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.946
and everything else,
which is a problem.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:34.647
Ms. Bondi: Exactly.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.715
The President: Okay.

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.316
Ms. Bondi:  But we also have
to give the mentally ill

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.452
the due process in which
they deserve, President.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.721
So, what we're doing
is they're going to be able

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:43.089
to take the guns

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:46.459
when they're taken into
custody -- or into the hospital.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.960
And then, when they're released,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.363
within 24 hours
or 72 hours later --

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.998
typically, it's 24 hours --

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:55.534
but law enforcement will have
72 hours to determine

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:57.536
whether they should
give those guns back,

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.705
or they can go to a judge

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.541
and say, "Your Honor,
please keep these guns.

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:07.079
We feel this person is still
a danger to himself or others, 

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.114
whether they're in
or out of custody.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.515
The President:  So, this would
not have worked the way

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.117
it's currently constituted.

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.686
This would not have
worked with Cruz

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.188
as it's currently constituted.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.390
Ms. Bondi: As it's currently
written.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.357
The President: So,
you're going to make changes?

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.825
Ms. Bondi: We're going
to make changes.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:21.127
And one other thing we're doing
about the reporting,

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.262
President, which is --
this is a big issue --

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.464
we need a clearinghouse.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.333
And that's what we've
all been discussing.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.835
And we have created,
and several of my counterparts

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.170
have done it around the country,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.073
but we're the biggest state
doing it -- it's an app.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.642
Because kids now
are on social media.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:39.111
And there were so many
warning signs on Snapchat,

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.180
on Twitter, on Instagram.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.648
And they were posting --

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.383
they were sending them
to all different sources.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:46.585
And we're going to have --
and we just got it in written

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:47.987
in our House and Senate budget;

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.656
it will cost at least half
a million dollars a year

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:53.426
to fund this.
But what it does -- kids --

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.362
and so I met with 10 students,
and they loved it.

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.364
And they said
I'm empowering them.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.833
Three of them are
my graphic designers.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:01.867
The President:  Good.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.035
Ms. Bondi: They're going
to design the icon.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.603
Some are going to name it;
they're helping us with it.

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:08.207
But it will cost probably about
$100,000 maximum to develop.

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.175
That's all in our budget.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.743
So what kids can do now --

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.814
they can automatically
send something that says,

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.782
 I'm going to buy a gun, 
just like Cruz was doing.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.551
 I'm going to do this.
I'm going to do this. 

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.120
And one of the girls who I met
with -- one of the students --

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.788
told me he had been doing
this since middle school,

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.091
he had bullied her,
and she reported it.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:26.826
So, it will all --
they can instantly --

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.294
and they can do it
with anonymity.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.261
The President:  Good.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.830
Ms. Bondi:  Put it in this app.
It will go in the app,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.565
and it will go through
one clearinghouse

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.001
with state law enforcement
in Florida.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.269
The President:  Well,
you mentioned the Internet.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:38.537
We have to look at the Internet

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.773
because a lot of bad
things are happening

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.375
to young kids and young minds,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.343
and their minds
are being formed.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.580
And we have to do
something about

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.916
maybe what they're seeing
and how they're seeing it.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.152
And also, video games.
I'm hearing more and more people

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:56.255
say the level of violence
on video games

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:59.825
is really shaping young
people's thoughts.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.328
And then you go the further
step, and that's the movies.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.163
You see these movies,
they're so violent.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:09.435
And yet a kid is able to see
the movie if sex isn't involved,

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.870
but killing is involved,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.106
and maybe they have to put
a rating system for that.

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:17.410
And, you know, you get into
a whole very complicated,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.811
very big deal.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.480
But the fact is that
you are having movies

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.915
come out that are so violent,

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.717
with the killing
and everything else,

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.986
that maybe that's another thing
we're going to have to discuss.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.154
And a lot of people
are saying it,

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.823
you have these movies
today where you can go

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.691
and have a child see the movie,

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.827
and yet it's so violent
and so disgusting.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.263
So, we may have to
talk about that also.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.932
Well, thank you very much, Pam.
Thank you very much. Jeff?

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.870
Attorney General Sessions:  Mr.
President, my schoolteacher wife

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.375
watched your meeting yesterday.
She was very moved by it.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.645
And I think it has touched
people all over the country.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.714
The President: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.017
Attorney General Sessions:  And
I salute you for that.

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:00.553
And I won't talk now; others
have got things they'll say.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.823
I just will say that
we believe we can do better.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.226
We believe that
some of the things

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:11.363
that Attorney General Bondi
is talking about can work.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:14.533
We've done a lot of research
in this country

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.102
over the last several years.

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.903
We need to go back
and act on it.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.705
It's one thing to research,
as you indicated.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:21.040
It's another thing
to do something about it.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.241
The President: We're
going to act, that's right.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.010
Attorney General Sessions:  And
we think we can help you

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.115
develop the kind of policies
that will make America safer.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.549
The President: Good, thank you.

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:31.550
And you're doing a great job
with the gangs.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.718
The gangs are such a problem.

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.121
You know, we talk
about child safety.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.389
The kids walk home, and they
meet one of these gangs.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.891
And these are absolute animals.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.694
These aren't human beings;
these are animals.

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.631
And it's the torture --
the level of torture.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.932
In this country,
who would ever believe

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.701
a thing like this could happen?

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.071
But we're literally getting
MS-13 out by the thousands.

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.942
But they come in --
these are smart, they're smart.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:59.245
They actually have franchises
going to Los Angeles.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:02.014
We're getting no help
from the state of California.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.885
I mean, frankly, if I wanted to
pull our people from California,

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.286
you would have a crying mess

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.821
like you've never seen
in California.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:12.691
All I'd have to do is say,
ICE and Border Patrol,

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.461
let California alone.
You'd be inundated --

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.929
you would see crime like nobody

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.464
has ever seen crime
in this country.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.101
And yet we get no help
from the state of California.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:24.203
They are doing
a lousy management job.

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:26.438
They have the highest
taxes in the nation,

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:30.576
and they don't know
what's happening out there.

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:35.514
Frankly, it's a disgrace --
the sanctuary city situation,

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.583
the protection of these
horrible criminals --

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.851
you know because
you're working on it.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.755
And the protection
of these horrible criminals

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.856
in California,

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.125
and other places,
but in California.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.427
That if we ever pulled our ICE
out and we ever said,

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.062
 Hey, let California alone.

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:51.564
Let them figure it out
for themselves, 

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.833
in two months they'd be
begging for us to come back.

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.735
They would be begging.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.871
And you know what?
I'm thinking about doing it.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:00.706
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.074
Sheriff McDonald:  Yes, sir,
Charles McDonald.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.509
Mr. President,
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.213
I thank you from the bottom
of my heart for your support,

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.215
certainly from all the sheriffs
in North Carolina,

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:10.816
if not, all of law enforcement.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.851
The President:  Congressman
Meadows is a big fan of yours,

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.386
that I can tell you. You know
who I'm talking about, right?

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.255
Sheriff McDonald: Well, I'm a 
big fan of his, thank you, sir.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.990
The President: Good man.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.225
Sheriff McDonald: I've been
very impressed, Mr. President,

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.492
with a lot of the ideas
I've heard just since --

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:21.760
before you came in, actually.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.964
And I do think mental health
is a serious issue

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.665
that's affecting us
across the nation.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.234
I know it is in North Carolina.

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.570
I appreciate your courage, sir,
to talk about the fact

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.005
that I do think
there is a place

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:35.207
where properly trained people

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.042
in certain areas as well --

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:40.112
think multi-layered,
like an onion.

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:41.880
Security has got
a lot of facets.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.116
And I believe that
you've got, certainly,

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.317
the courage and the leadership

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.086
to bring all of this together.

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.821
I know there's a lot of
good ideas out there.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.889
I think they all need
to be listened to.

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:53.325
But it's going to take a lot of
courage on the part of leaders,

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:56.395
I think, in this nation,
to bring the community together,

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.297
to help them do the things
that that they really want

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.531
to do in their heart,

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:01.533
but maybe haven't had
the courage to do yet.

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:02.301
Thank you, sir.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.369
The President:  Thank you,
Sheriff.

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.037
It's going to take a lot of
political courage, you're right.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.038
Sheriff McDonald:  Yes, sir.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.106
The President:  A lot of
political courage.

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.874
Some of it won't be
politically correct.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:13.779
But time for political
correctness is over.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.381
We have to get
this problem solved.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.415
So, you're right about that.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.284
Thank you, Sheriff. Yes, sir.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.485
Mr. Sanders:  Mr. President,
Rick Sanders,

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:21.287
Commissioner of
the Kentucky State Police.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.789
And much like Florida,
we went through this last month.

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:26.759
We had a school shooting at
Marshall County High School.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.528
And we're going to hear a lot

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.530
about what we can do
in the future

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.399
to help protect our children.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.234
What I'm concerned with is,

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:37.636
what are we going to do now 
to protect our children?

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:38.771
The President: Right.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.239
Mr. Sanders: And there's going
to be a lot of debate,

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.741
but I applaud you, sir,
for having the courage

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:45.444
to bring together
law enforcement,

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:47.646
mental health professionals
and educators,

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:49.648
all sitting around
this table to decide

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.917
together what we need to do.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:57.022
I'm real curious to hear
what Attorney General Bondi

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:59.024
continues to do in Florida.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.193
I think the gun violence
restraining order

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.428
is critically important.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:05.864
And I also think that we,
in law enforcement,

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:09.835
we need to create a database
in our fusion centers

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:12.971
where can take information
that we have on students

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:16.308
that may be a threat
and put that into a database

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:19.812
so that the FBI can share
with local law enforcement

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.213
and state police,

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:24.016
and we all have that information
that we can act upon.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.684
And more importantly,
I think there should be

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.619
something coming out of that;

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.655
that we did something with it.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.990
And it didn't just lay there,

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.194
but we took that information
and we actually acted on that.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.363
And that's something
I'm very interested in pursuing.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.131
The President:  Thank you, Rick.
The federal government

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.266
is really going to be
a coordinator

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.568
between all of the states

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.437
so that you give information

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.506
and other states
will have that information.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:48.974
Otherwise, there's
no way of getting it.

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:49.742
Mr. Sanders:  Yes, sir.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:50.709
The President: So,
we'll be doing that.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.745
And I have to say, the states
are starting to act --

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.347
Florida, as an example;
your state.

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.283
A lot of states are starting
to act on their own.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.853
They don't necessarily
need 100 percent

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:01.954
from the federal government.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.255
Federal government
is going to help a lot,

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:05.391
but a lot of states
can do some of the things

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.526
that I'm talking
about on their own.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.596
And I really implore
them to do it,

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.965
and to do it as quickly
as possible,

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:14.366
as you understand.
Thank you.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.968
Ms. Bondi:  And Governor Scott,
Mr. President.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.336
Wait until you see
what Governor Scott

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.971
is about to release in Florida.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:19.772
The President:  Governor Scott
is a great example.

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:20.706
Ms. Bondi: It's great.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.874
The President: He's going to do
a lot of things.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.941
And, again,

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.209
there will be coordination
with the federal government,

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.845
but the states can do a lot
of this work on their own

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:28.313
and get it done very quickly.

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.248
Paula.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.783
Ms. Stone: Yes,
I'm Paula Stone and I'm

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.451
a mental health professional,

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:34.953
although I now work for
the Department of Human Services

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:37.055
in the area of making sure
that mental health services

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.191
are provided to
the citizens of Arkansas.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.594
And so I think what you said
about early warning signs

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:43.996
is very important to note,

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:47.065
and access
to appropriate services,

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:49.868
and training educators.

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:52.404
There's a program called
Mental Health First Aid,

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.473
where educators can be trained
in how to identify

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.175
those early warning signs

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.944
and making sure that those
services are easily accessible,

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.512
because access is a problem.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:02.080
If somebody has to leave
the school grounds

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.983
and go to a clinic,
wait for an appointment,

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.685
then you've lost all that time.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.687
If we can have mental
health professionals

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.389
that are located in schools,

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.491
co-located with physicians

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.993
in places where people
go into the community,

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.763
so those people are
identified with those needs

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.298
and get those
services very quickly

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:23.202
before it gets to the point of
having some significant needs.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.170
Mental health
professionals also,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.007
for people that have
more significant needs,

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:31.076
can wrap around
the whole families.

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:33.579
Because a lot of times, the
families are asking for help,

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.481
but they haven't
gotten that support.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.016
There may be stigma,
there may be access issues.

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.786
You want to make sure that
all of those services are there,

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.621
readily available,

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.323
that there's no stigma
to those services

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:45.757
and that they can have those.

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.059
And then, we were
talking down at this end

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.895
of the table
a minute ago about then,

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.730
when it gets to the point
where somebody is scared,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.532
or somebody gets arrested,

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.400
we are starting
crisis stabilization

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.568
units in our state.

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:59.137
And other states have used
crisis stabilization units.

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:03.108
And our Governor Hutchinson
has given some funds for us

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.643
to start them in our state.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:07.079
They are units which is
not just mental health;

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.747
it's a partnership
between the county,

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:12.751
the mental health
agency in that area,

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.186
and the law enforcement.

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:16.288
So, when law enforcement
is trained

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.257
with crisis
intervention training,

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:21.026
they can identify people
when they arrest them,

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.160
that they have a mental illness,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.296
that they're having
a mental health issue,

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.664
instead of taking them to jail,

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.033
where they wouldn't
receive that treatment,

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.268
or where it would be
very difficult

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:30.536
for them to be screened.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.804
They can take them to the
crisis stabilization units.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.907
They can hold them
there for 72 hours.

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.408
The President:  Good.

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:37.676
Ms. Stone:  They can
do screenings,

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.678
they can begin treatment,
and then they can make sure

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.481
that they get filtered
into the right treatment,

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.483
also working with the judiciary

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:47.052
and the law enforcement
officials as a partnership,

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.353
a collaboration with them all.

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.888
The President:  Thank you,
Paula.

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:50.956
Say hello to the governor.

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:51.590
Ms. Stone:  I will.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.524
The President: He's
a great governor.

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.725
Ms. Stone:  He is.

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.660
The President: He is, done a great job.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.627
Alex.

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:56.995
Secretary Azar:  Well,
Mr. President, as you know, you,

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:59.898
last year, had identified
serious mental illness

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:03.802
as one of the core
priorities at HHS already.

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:05.003
The President: That's right.

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.838
Secretary Azar:  And that
involved funding

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.206
and also involved creating

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:10.576
the interdepartmental
coordinating committee

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:11.810
around serious mental illness

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.879
to pull all the resources
of federal government

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.348
together around these issues.

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.616
And I've enjoyed
the discussion

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:20.586
so far this morning with these
experts around some of the areas

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.522
of how we're building
our future agenda here

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:26.358
to really tackle these issues
of serious mental illness

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.293
around the issues of violence.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.963
One of those areas is education.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:33.799
What can we do better
to assist educators,

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.500
and parents,
and first responders

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.970
on dealing with serious
mental illness situations?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.939
Second is, what can we do
around screening

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:44.376
and identification of those at
risk for serious mental illness?

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:45.777
The third is treatment.

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:46.979
Both preventive treatment

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.848
for those who are
recently diagnosed,

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:52.484
but also those who are
an imminent risk of danger

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:53.885
to themselves or others.

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:57.522
And that might involve
involuntary issues.

00:20:57.522 --> 00:21:00.792
As talked about earlier, how can
we be of assistance there

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.661
to get people the care
that they need

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:03.996
to live fruitful
and good lives,

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.631
but also be safe?

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.165
The fourth is
community engagement.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.534
So often, serious mental illness

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:12.204
is part of being disengaged
and disconnected,

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:14.573
and how can we reconnect people
or keep them connected.

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.441
And then finally, it's research

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.744
on the next generations
of therapies.

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.612
What can we in
the federal government

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.714
do to help bring the research

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.016
and next-generation therapies

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:26.184
for mental illness
to the table for people?

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.653
The President: Right,
that's great, Alex.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:28.920
That's great,
thank you very much.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:33.525
The Mayor of Parkland,
Florida has suffered greatly,

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:34.993
seen things that
you never thought

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.762
you would ever be
a part of or see.

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:38.930
And I just want
to say, Christine,

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.266
on behalf of all of us,
you've done a great job.

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:43.001
Mayor Hunschofsky:  Thank you
so much, Mr. President.

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.069
The President: You've been
given a rough hand,

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:46.104
but you have done
a great job, thank you.

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:47.105
Mayor Hunschofsky:  I would
just, first of all,

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:48.206
like to say thank you.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.943
I don't know if you realize how
much it meant to the students

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.879
to be able to have a voice

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:57.182
and to be heard by you
and your administration.

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:01.486
That's a very empowering
thing for the students,

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.888
and we appreciate it immensely.

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:04.056
The President:  Thank you.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.090
Mayor Hunschofsky:  We
spoke yesterday,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.492
and this roundtable
has been amazing.

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:09.795
I am grateful
to be able to be here.

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:12.931
This didn't just
happen in a vacuum;

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:15.333
there was a whole timeline
that led to this.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:20.972
And I'm very happy that there's
such a commitment to action

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:26.812
on all the steps that could
have been taken to prevent it:

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.947
The beginning of the mental
health portion of it.

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:31.416
The President:  Right.

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.385
Mayor Hunschofsky:  The police
portion of it;

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.120
if there had been
better communication,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.455
maybe that could
have been acted on.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:40.258
What's very important
to our residents right now

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:42.294
is the school safety
portion of it:

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:46.164
that someone like that cannot
gain access to these schools,

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.300
and that our students
are safe going to school.

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:51.903
And it's very important
that we act on that

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:53.338
as quickly as possibly,

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.241
because that is
where the parents

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.843
and the students
are afraid right now.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.245
And then, on the end,

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.448
how did somebody like
this person get access

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:05.383
to that kind of firearm?

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:09.087
And I think what Pam Bondi
is working on is wonderful.

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:12.357
And thank you so much for
allowing us a seat at the table,

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:14.726
and for really listening
and being committed to action.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.596
I think that makes us
all very hopeful.

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:19.397
The President:  Well, thank you.

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.166
And I'm so sorry for
what you've gone through.

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.734
I mean, few people
will ever go through

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.469
what you've gone through
over the last week,

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:26.571
and we really all appreciate it.

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:28.573
You've done a -- you've been
an incredible mayor

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:32.310
in a time when they need it,
really, right now --

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.912
a very incredible mayor.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.281
The amazing thing about
Parkland -- which I know,

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.950
because Florida is a special
place that I know very well --

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.853
this is probably the last
place in this country

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:44.156
where you'd think a thing
like this could happen.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:45.824
Mayor Hunschofsky:  We were
the safest city.

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:46.758
The President:  Yeah.

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:47.993
Mayor Hunschofsky: We're one
of the safest cities.

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:51.596
The message is, if it can happen
here, it can happen anywhere.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.598
And it's very important
that we do everything

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:55.233
we can to secure our schools

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.435
so that the students
feel safe there

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:59.371
and the parents feel
safe sending them there.

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.173
The President:  Yeah.

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:03.008
Mayor Hunschofsky: Thank you,
Mr. President, I appreciate it.

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:03.809
The President: Thank you,
thank you very much, Christine.

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:04.676
Andrew.

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:05.844
Mr. Bremberg:  Well,
Mr. President,

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:06.978
we had a really
great conversation,

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:08.780
and I want to leave more time
for the other participants.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.448
We can brief you
later on more --

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:11.516
The President:  Okay, good.

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.584
Mr. Bremberg:  -- of the great
ideas and issues

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:13.351
that these leaders
have talked about --

00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:14.286
The President:  Good.

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.887
Mr. Bremberg:  --
particularly as you continue

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:16.721
to lead this discussion --

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.557
The President: Thank you.

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.457
Mr. Bremberg:  -- and as you
prepare for your conversation

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:20.292
with the governors.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.393
The President:  Thank you,
Andrew.

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:22.260
And Kellyanne Conway, though,
I'll have you say --

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.495
I think most people
know Kellyanne,

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:24.462
she's become a pretty big star.

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.397
What do you think?

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:26.598
Attorney General Sessions:  Big
star.

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:27.699
The President: Pretty big star,
I think the best, right?

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:29.367
Ms. Conway: Thank you, sir,
I don't see it that way.

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:30.268
The President: Would you like
to say something because I know

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:31.369
it's a very important
issue for you, personally.

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:32.604
Ms. Conway: Yes, sir, yes, sir.

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:33.805
Thank you for
yesterday and today.

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:36.208
And the one thing
I would mention,

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.676
because we heard it
from the mayor

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.777
before you walked in the room,

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.645
we heard it from
Mr. Scott yesterday --

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:42.380
whose daughter,
Rachel Joy Scott,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.816
was the first fatality
at Columbine, 19 years ago --

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:48.520
is this lack of connectedness
for our youth.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.922
And some of the social
media outlets

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:53.592
you've mentioned
didn't even exist in 1999.

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:55.193
But it's this lack
of connectedness,

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:58.263
and I think that's a whole
other type of stigma and silence

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:01.032
that needs to be cured
in our society.

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.267
We all have a role
to play there;

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.935
there's an entire
spectrum of actors.

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:07.072
We should watch our words
and our actions and realize

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:10.141
that there are many different
causes and symptoms

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.643
and consequences, obviously.

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:15.347
But at the same time,
if we're focusing on youth,

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:17.849
we need to focus on all youth

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.619
and the ability for them
to feel that they are connected.

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.321
That is not with respect
to any one individual.

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.857
It's just I heard it
very clearly from Mr. Scott

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.492
yesterday, very clearly
from the mayor,

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:28.727
and very clearly
from the President of

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:30.795
the United States moments ago.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:34.132
Thank you very much for being
a leader on this, Mr. President.

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:36.234
I think that you have
a great opportunity

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:39.304
to join with the nation
and help them to heal

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:42.474
and to move forward in a way
that shows not just resilience,

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:45.543
but great resolve,
and not just talk, but action.

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:48.813
We're very grateful that
you're President at this time.

00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:50.181
The President: Thank you,
thank you very much, Kellyanne.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.550
Patrick.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.451
Mr. Neville:  Mr. President,
Patrick Neville.

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:54.319
Colorado House Minority Leader,

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.787
and also a former
Columbine student

00:25:55.787 --> 00:25:57.455
who was there that day.

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:59.090
Thank you for your
leadership on this issue.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:00.659
You're absolutely right --

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:02.360
I read some of your
comments from last night,

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.497
but we have to find a way to let
good people defend our students.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.233
We can't let criminals think
that this is going to be

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.601
an easy target

00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:12.504
for them to enter their schools
and injure our students.

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:14.239
We have to find a way
to harden those targets

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:16.708
so that our students
aren't sitting ducks.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.511
Furthermore, I think
that we do have

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.012
some good programs
to model off of.

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:22.547
The Safe to
Tell program in Colorado

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.849
has been wildly successful.

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.851
We have similar to what
Pam Bondi was talking about.

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:29.120
It can be used not just
for school violence actions,

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.623
but it can also be used
for suicidal ideations

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:32.824
and other things of that nature.

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:36.494
But that said, I think we have
to do it immediately,

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:37.729
but I think we also
need to realize, too,

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.397
it's not just about the guns.

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.199
My experience is pretty
unique in Columbine

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.802
that there was also
two propane tanks

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.470
that were supposed to be
a bomb that going to go off.

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:48.139
By the grace of God,
that didn't happen.

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.241
But there are other ways
that people can commit

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.776
these atrocious acts.

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:54.346
So, I appreciate
your approach on this,

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:57.716
by listening before
just reacting.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.218
The President: Well,
I appreciate what you're saying.

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:03.154
And I've watched you
and read about you,

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:04.622
and you have a great story,

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.358
where you came from
and how you --

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:09.995
and you're doing so
fantastically well right now.

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.529
But I happen to agree with you.

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:15.133
We have to harden our schools,
not soften them up.

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:19.404
A gun-free zone to a killer,

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.007
or somebody that
wants to be a killer,

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.776
that's like going in
for the ice cream.

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:27.212
That's like,
 Here I am, take me. 

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.647
We have to get smart
on gun-free zones.

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.983
When they see it says,
 This is a gun-free zone, 

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:34.919
that means that nobody
has a gun except them;

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.155
nobody is going to be shooting
bullets in the other direction.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.492
And they see that as
such a beautiful target.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.993
They live for gun-free zones.

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:46.131
And, I mean, frankly,
you have teachers

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:48.233
that are Marines for 20 years,

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:50.201
and they retire,
they become a teacher.

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:54.706
And they're Army, Navy,
Air Force, they're Coast Guard,

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:58.176
they're people that have
won shooting contests.

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:01.913
And they're for whatever --
this is what they do.

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:03.548
They know guns,
they understand guns.

00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:08.420
And I, frankly, have been
reading a lot about it.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.891
And I think when
you allow a person

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.526
who has been in the Marines
for 20 years,

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.960
who's done nothing
but handle guns

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.662
and handle them
safely and well --

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.364
because you can't just
give a teacher a gun.

00:28:20.331 --> 00:28:22.167
One of the fake
news networks, CNN,

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:24.069
last night was saying
I want teachers to have guns.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.136
I don't want teachers
to have guns.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:28.206
I want certain
highly adept people,

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:31.276
people that understand
weaponry, guns --

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.647
if they really have
that aptitude.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.715
Because not everybody
has an aptitude for a gun.

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:39.751
But if they have the aptitude,

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.986
I think a concealed permit
for --

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:43.655
having teachers
and letting people know

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:45.657
that there are people
in the building with a gun --

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:48.259
you won't have -- in my opinion,
you won't have these shootings.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:49.594
Because these people
are cowards.

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:52.730
They're not going to
walk into a school

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.766
if 20 percent of
the teachers have guns.

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:56.768
It may be 10 percent,
or it may be 40 percent.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:00.405
And what I would recommend doing
is the people that do carry,

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.507
we give them a bonus.

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.109
We give them
a little bit of a bonus.

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:07.912
Frankly, they'd feel more
comfortable having a gun anyway.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.581
But you give them
a little bit of a bonus.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:15.286
So, practically for free,
you have now made the school

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.988
into a hardened target.

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.423
For instance, if the coaches,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.994
who I guarantee had plenty
of experience with weapons --

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.530
if they had guns --
you need to hard,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.500
because no matter what you do
to keep them gun-free,

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.368
they'll be able to get in there,

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:33.371
and they'll crawl through the
back of a window or something.

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.939
And you're going to
have everybody, again,

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.475
without any protection.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.777
So, I know where
you stand on it.

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:42.280
You want a hardened school,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.715
and I want
a hardened school, too.

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:45.216
I want to know that
if they get in there,

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.484
they're not going to be long.

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:48.186
Because it's going to take

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.721
10 minutes for the police
to get there.

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.623
The police do an incredible
job in getting there.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.558
I guess it averages
about eight minutes,

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.194
but the shootings
average three minutes.

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:59.664
And that's tremendous
destruction and death.

00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:08.072
So, I would like to see true
people with great talent at guns

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:10.208
and being adept at guns,

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.810
of which there's only
a percentage of people.

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:16.814
But whatever that percentage may
be, it's a substantial number.

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:18.917
Because you can't hire
enough security guards.

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.618
You can't hire --
I mean, the school --

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:23.388
your school, as an example,
Christine, you would have --

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:26.324
you'd need 100,
150 security guards.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:29.060
That is a very big school
with a tremendous floor area.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.328
You can't have that many --

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.063
who wants that
many security guards

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:34.165
standing all over the place,
loaded up with guns?

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:37.168
But you could have concealed
on the teachers.

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.204
They wouldn't know --
the people --

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.672
nobody would know who they are.

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:43.374
And it is a tremendous threat.

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:45.810
And, by the way,
instead of advertising,

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.613
 This school has no guns.
We are gun-free, 

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:51.249
you let the people
know the opposite.

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:53.017
Nobody is going to attack
that school, believe me.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.852
Because they're cowards.
They don't want to be shot at.

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.888
And they're going to be shot at.

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:59.324
So, not everybody agrees with us
-- I know how you stand --

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.758
and a lot of people
do agree with us.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.428
But I think we need
hardened sites.

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:04.696
We need to let people know:

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.799
You come into our schools,
you're going to be dead,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.003
and it's going to be fast.
And unless you do that,

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.771
you're going to always
have this problem.

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:15.907
You can talk about
your gun-free zones.

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:17.976
We had a case three years ago

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:21.746
at a military base
where five Marines,

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:25.383
I believe, three of whom
were world-class shots

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:27.051
and experts at guns,

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.787
they were told it was
a gun-free area --

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.756
within a military base,
if you can believe that.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.225
If we can't trust our military,
who are we going to trust?

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:35.960
You know what I'm saying. Five.

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:39.797
They were putting away --
they put away their guns.

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:44.068
Their guns were in a different
section, totally gun-free.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.672
Their guns were
250 yards away from them

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.374
where they had to store them.

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:51.042
And they went in for lunch,

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.845
and a wacko came in
and shot the five of them.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.313
He wouldn't have
lasted for one --

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:57.949
three of these people
were world-class marksmen.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.319
He wouldn't have lasted
for a second.

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.421
But they stood there;
there was nothing they could do.

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:06.324
All five were killed, you know
the instance I'm talking about.

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.826
That was in a gun-free zone
on a military base.

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:12.797
Well, a school is,
frankly, no different.

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:16.534
I want my schools protected just
like my banks are protected,

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:17.835
just like everything else.

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.872
And I get a kick -- I was
watching a politician, weak,

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.573
ineffective politician
last night --

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.742
I'd tell you a name, but I don't
want to embarrass anybody --

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:27.912
and he was talking about
no guns, no this, no that.

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:30.181
And yet, he's surrounded
by three guys carrying guns.

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.216
I said,  Well, when are they
going to give up their guns? 

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.085
They're not going to
give up their guns.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.754
But he wants everybody else
to have no guns.

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:40.625
And you have plenty of them.

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:44.562
So, we have to harden our sites.
We have to be very careful.

00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:47.098
And these people,
as adept as they may --

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.199
they have to go to training,

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.834
I would say, every six months
or every year.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.836
They have to have a fairly --

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:56.908
really, a rigorous course
in what they're doing.

00:32:57.575 --> 00:32:59.444
And they should be
paid extra money.

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.512
Those teachers should
be paid extra money.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:04.282
So, they get a bonus, and they'd
love getting that bonus, too.

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:08.653
And it would be much less
expensive than the guards.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.922
It wouldn't look bad,
you know, if you have guards,

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:14.092
it looks like you have an armed
camp that would look terrible.

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:15.493
Because people are telling me,
we're going to put a lot

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.061
of security guards
in the buildings.

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.296
Will look terrible.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.731
And it would be
much more effective.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:22.834
But I'll tell you what, if you
harden these sites in that way,

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.736
or some other way
in a similar fashion --

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:26.738
not only teachers;

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.072
coaches, it could be
other people

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.674
that work in the building --

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.476
if you harden the sites,

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:33.644
you're not going
to have this problem,

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.913
because these guys
who lack courage

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.915
will never go
into those schools.

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.784
Those schools are
going to be safe.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.521
But when you say a school
is gun-free --

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.891
it's got no guns,
no nothing, it's gun-free --

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.261
boy, they start --
that's what they want to hear.

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:53.931
So, I agree with you, Patrick.
Strongly agree with you.

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:57.802
Mr. Kittle:  Fred Kittle
from Bartow County schools

00:33:57.802 --> 00:34:00.171
in Bartow County, Georgia.

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.874
First, so my mom
doesn't whoop me,

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.978
thank you for March 29th --
for the veterans.

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.546
She is a Vietnam widow,

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:11.082
and my uncle
is a wounded veteran,

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:14.152
former police chief in (inaudible) City.

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.920
What we're doing in our --

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.322
I got to thank
Clarence Robie of DNS,

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:19.724
who's -- as you know,
school boards,

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.993
we have regular jobs
and do this on the side.

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:26.097
But one of the things that we're
doing in our school system --

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.766
and Georgia has given the school
boards a lot of power.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.234
And you are absolutely correct,

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:33.171
there's things local
can already do.

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:36.174
We have the single point
of entry at all of our schools.

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:40.645
You have to be buzzed to get in.
We do have resource officers.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.514
And like you said,
it would take quite a bit --

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.950
we have, I believe,
it's seven with our school.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:53.491
And we have 13,332 students
and 892 teachers there.

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.860
But we also work really closely
with our law enforcement.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.164
For example, one of our middle
schools and elementary --

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:01.766
police station is
right around the corner.

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:05.203
And we do pay
the sheriff's department

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.004
and local police to help do,

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:09.273
when people are coming
and going, to do the traffic.

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:11.309
But it's also, they're there
and they're present.

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.711
So that's also a deterrent.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.613
The President:  How many
are in the school?

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:17.415
Because when you have
a sheriff's department,

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:19.917
they don't have enough people to
really take care of the school.

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.018
That's the problem.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.086
Mr. Kittle: You're
absolutely correct.

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:23.154
Now, here's something
the state of Georgia did

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.523
after the last shootings
in 2014,

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.893
in giving the school
systems the authority.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:32.897
We're allowed to -- if the
school board so votes on it,

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.733
we actually can have
armed employees.

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:39.337
They do have to go through their 
safety firearm training and that,

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:44.141
and then our resource officers
also go through a third party --

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.944
another party
for training each year.

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:50.014
So, you're absolutely correct.

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.482
And there is more
that can be done.

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:55.953
And I think a lot of it, too,
that we need to address, too,

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.222
is the heart problem --
the heart issue.

00:35:58.222 --> 00:36:00.858
You know, one of the things
that comes out is the family.

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:03.694
We come from a community
where the faith-based community

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:06.063
just wants to help all they can.

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.798
When the tornadoes
hit Adairsville,

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.967
FEMA thought they were going
to be there a long time.

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.536
Very short.
People volunteered,

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.471
came out with chainsaws
right when it happened.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.473
And they had to send them back

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.675
because they had to get
the power and gas and all that.

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:23.180
But when you're allowed to have
the faith-based, it does a lot.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.715
Right now, they're trying
to figure out

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.651
how to help us
in all kinds of ways.

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:28.819
But because of this separation
of church and state,

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.388
that was never intended.

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:32.690
So, we would appreciate
if you keep electing --

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.792
or not electing --
appointing the justices

00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:38.195
like you're doing that follow
the Constitution on their --

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.297
The President: We're having
a great success

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.831
with the appointment
of justices,

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:42.066
that's true, and judges.

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.702
Mr. Kittle: And I need to say
this, so they don't fuss at me:

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:47.038
But we have a lot of people
praying for you

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.806
and your administration
there in Georgia.

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.808
We have quite
a few churches there.

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.777
We have a group called
President's Team.

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:54.645
Once a week,
they pray for you all.

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:55.880
The President:  Thank you.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.081
Mr. Kittle: They're praying
for you and your community.

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.416
I know that may sound --

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.484
with the devastation,
I can't imagine.

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:04.388
I've got six kids, and I can't
imagine losing any of those.

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.357
In fact, watching
what you had --

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:09.827
and I love how you're having
everybody discuss and talk,

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.896
and then a solution.

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:15.333
You're solving things that we
hear politicians for 30 years,

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.767
and you're doing it
within a year.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.869
And we really appreciate it.

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:22.306
And we've, kind of, taken
your motto, "Just do your job." 

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.008
And that just
works phenomenally.

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.910
Because when it's
one person responsible,

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.945
then we know where
it comes down on.

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.814
The President:  Well, I want
the politicians to watch.

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:32.483
Like yesterday,
very importantly, they watched,

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.018
and a lot of them saw that.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.988
And they saw the
devastation that's caused.

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:39.290
And you know, some of them
maybe don't know

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.524
if they don't get to see.

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:42.293
I mean, I was
with those families,

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.962
and those families
are devastated.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.498
And I want the politicians
to see that

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:49.133
because they have
to pass legislation.

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.935
They have to do things.

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.303
And I'm the biggest believer

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.772
of the Second Amendment
that there is.

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.207
Okay? I am the biggest.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.977
But I'll tell you what, I spoke
with the NRA -- the top people.

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.813
And I spoke, and they
gave me tremendous support,

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.782
and -- tremendous.

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.618
I think I had their earliest --

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:11.088
I was probably
the earliest one, Kellyanne,

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.423
from what I hear, ever.

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:16.360
You know, they endorsed me
at the absolute earliest point

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.130
that you could,
and I'm a believer.

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:23.234
But I spoke to them,
and they're ready to do things.

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:24.735
They want to do things.

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.604
You know, they're good people,
they're patriots.

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.938
They love this country.

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:31.609
But the NRA is ready
to do things.

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:35.246
And you know,
people like to blame them,

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.114
and they do have power
and all of that.

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.916
But they want to do --
they want to --

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:42.453
they actually came up
with certain of the rules

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.221
and regulations
that we have now.

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:45.756
But we're going to have to
toughen -- I told them,

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:47.058
I said, we're going to
have to toughen them up.

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:50.394
Because it doesn't
make anybody look good,

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.996
and most importantly,

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.998
I saw the devastation
of these families.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.232
We can't allow that to happen.

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.936
But again, we need
a hardened school.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.038
But we want to harden it without

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:02.440
having everybody

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.974
standing there with a rifle.

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.910
I don't want that either
because that's no good.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.278
That sends a lot of bad signals.

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.747
As an example,
I'm watching John Kelly --

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:10.915
General John Kelly.

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:15.519
So, he's a four-star Marine,
he's a tough cookie.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.057
If he was a teacher,
I wouldn't mind him have a gun

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:22.059
because I guarantee he can use
it better than anybody.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.096
There's no security guard
you're going to hire

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:26.997
that's going to handle
a gun better than him.

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.265
So, if he's a teacher,

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.267
and if other friends of his
from the Marines,

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:31.802
if they're teaching --

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:34.972
or other people like that --
I want them to have a gun.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.375
But more importantly --
almost more importantly,

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:40.945
nobody is going
to attack that school.

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:45.382
Because they know General Kelly
is the history teacher.

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:48.552
He's teaching about
how we win wars, okay?

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:51.055
And he's got a concealed weapon.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.323
But they're going to know
he's got a concealed,

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.458
because we tell them

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.794
that the bullets are going to be
flying in the other direction.

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.896
You're not going to have
these attacks if you do that.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.198
If you're going to continue
with this nonsense

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:04.235
about a gun-free zone --
gun-free, it sounds so good.

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.003
It's like -- it sounds so great.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.672
It is such a target
for the killer.

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:12.576
They look for gun-free zones
because, believe it or not,

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.211
they don't want to get killed.

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.613
Mr. Kittle:  And we are
a soft target,

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.348
and so are movie theaters
and that.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.150
The President:  Well, look
at the guy in Florida.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.952
He tried to escape
with the other. Right?

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:25.022
You had a great policeman caught
him in a different community.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:27.258
But he actually escaped.
He didn't want to get shot.

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.827
If he would have known that
he was going to be shot --

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:32.029
because he's a coward --

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:34.165
but he tried to escape.
He did actually escape.

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.634
They had a great policeman in a
different community found him.

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:38.702
So, that's what we need.

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:40.738
Mr. Kittle:  One of our board
members did ask me to ask you,

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:42.740
however, when we're looking at
all these solutions --

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.075
and we all know
that the kids are precious,

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:46.777
and we need to do
whatever we need to do --

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.112
but at the same time,

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:50.014
one of the things
that hurts our systems a lot

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:52.483
is when we come up
with these unfunded mandates.

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.686
We'll suddenly have something
that we have to do,

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.454
and we don't necessarily
have the money.

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:59.223
So, if it is something
on the federal level,

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:02.092
we would like to make sure
that it's funded

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:06.197
because we've already had to go
to a different block schedule,

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.999
and it cost us 30 teachers.
And we don't want to --

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.001
The President: You know, this
isn't so much about funding.

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.436
This is more about common sense.

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.738
I mean, the money
we're talking about --

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:17.141
I mean, what I'm talking about
is going to save money.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.510
Everybody that agrees
on a hard --

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.612
they're all talking about
having 50 security guards

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.080
standing all over the school,

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.784
which is, you know, going to be
very not nice for the students.

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:30.254
I'm talking about something
where they're there anyway,

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:31.755
where they get
a little extra money

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.224
because they happen to carry,

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.659
where they go for
training every year.

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:38.896
I mean, we're talking
about rules

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:40.698
and regulations
for purchasing.

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:44.735
We're talking about
changing an age, from 18 to 21.

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:48.539
I mean, so they buy
a revolver -- a handgun --

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:51.876
they buy at the age of 21.

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:56.247
And yet, these other weapons
that we talk about --

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.414
that some people don't like --

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.883
they're allowed
to buy them at 18.

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:01.785
So how does that make sense?
How does that make sense?

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:05.823
So, I say that
it should all be at 21.

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.992
But we're not only
talking about money.

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:11.662
We're talking about common
sense, and it's a great thing.

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.664
And the NRA will back it.

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.833
I really feel very confident
the NRA will back it,

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:17.768
and so will Congress,
and so will the Senate.

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.270
Mr. Kittle: I really like
how you're not focused on

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.239
just the tool, you're also
focusing on like mental illness

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.474
and other issues,
and families --

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.875
The President:  No, no,
focus on mental illness.

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:27.778
You got to focus on mental
illness; it's a big factor.

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.246
But in addition
to mental illness,

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.581
we have to harden our schools,

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.016
we have to make sure --

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:34.985
in a way that doesn't
look like they're hardened.

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:37.855
But we have to let the bad guy
know that they are hardened.

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:39.623
There's not going to be news.

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:41.859
And we don't want
to have a secret.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.194
So, you come in here,
you're not going to last long.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.730
You do that, you're not
going to have a problem.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:48.966
Betsy, thank you.

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.034
Secretary DeVos:  Thank you,
Mr. President.

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:52.202
Thank you so much
for your leadership on this.

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:56.740
The session yesterday
was difficult and very moving,

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.475
but very important.

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:03.113
I really appreciate
our focus on both protection

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.082
but also on prevention.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:09.186
And I think particularly about
this issue of connectedness,

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:12.256
and I think of all
of our teachers

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.626
and what tools can we give them,

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:19.363
what practices that
they can do daily,

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:21.098
weekly, bi-weekly.

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:26.370
I heard a great story about
a teacher, following Columbine,

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:30.207
who now every two weeks
asks her students

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:32.943
to make a list
of five students

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.012
that they'd like
to sit by next week

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:38.382
and five students
who might like to sit by them.

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:43.287
And by the simple act,
regularly done,

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:45.990
she is able to detect a pattern,

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.926
if there's a child
that is on the outside.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.929
And this is a simple practice

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.598
that can be implemented
tomorrow, today.

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:58.836
So, I just really -- my heart
goes to the teachers

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:01.472
who, in some cases,
feel powerless.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:04.508
But I think we can help them
and empower them with tools --

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.743
The President:  Good.

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:06.777
Secretary DeVos:  --
to notice these things.

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:07.845
The President: Thanks, Betsy,
thank you.

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:08.779
Secretary DeVos:  Thanks,
Mr. President.

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:09.813
The President:  Pam.

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:10.781
Ms. Stewart: Mr. President,
I'm Pam Stewart.

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.416
I'm the Commissioner
of Education

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.884
for the great state of Florida.

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:14.651
The President:  Right.

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:17.788
Ms. Stewart:  And it was
a terrible tragedy.

00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:19.189
I appreciate, so much,

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.892
your willingness to visit
the victims and their families

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:25.496
and to hear from students
and parents yesterday,

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:28.098
as well as convening
this group today.

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.400
The President:  Thank you.
Thank you.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.436
Ms. Stewart:  The Governor
of Florida, Rick Scott,

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:34.371
as you know,
was in Parkland

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:36.173
and has spent
a great deal of time there.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:39.643
He also asked that we convene
three roundtables,

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:41.178
which we did on Tuesday --

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.714
one on public safety,
one of mental health,

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:44.915
and one of school safety.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:48.585
I moderated the one
on school safety.

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.020
We discussed mental health.

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:53.824
We discussed the policies
and practices

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.259
that need to be in place.

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:58.395
We discussed the hardening
of the building.

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:02.800
And so many of the issues that
have been brought up came up

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.435
when we talked.

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:07.004
Secretary DeVos has just
mentioned one of those,

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:11.742
which is what we would call
Tier 1 social-emotional issues,

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:14.011
where that needs
to be a practice

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:17.581
where we are helping
students feel connected

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:21.251
so that we don't reach
that point of Tier 3 or Tier 4

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.654
where we've got to have
the mental health services

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:28.092
to intervene on individuals like that.

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:28.926
Individual practices being in

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.032
place: We are required to have
a fire drill in schools

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.667
once a month.

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.137
We are not required
to have active shooter drills.

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:43.107
And so a practice like that,

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.875
where you put something
like that into place --

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:46.176
The President:  But active
shooter drills

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.711
is a very negative thing,

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:49.813
I'll be honest with you.

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:53.016
I mean, if I'm a child
and I'm 10 years old,

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:55.586
and they say, we're going to
have an active shooter drill,

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.620
I say, "What's that?" 

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.755
 Well, people may come in
and shoot you. 

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:02.526
I think that's a very negative
thing to be talking about,

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:04.628
to be honest with you,
I don't like it.

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:07.331
I'd much rather have
a hardened school.

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.966
I don't like it.

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.367
I wouldn't want to tell my son

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:13.837
that you're going to participate
in an active shooter drill.

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.440
And I know some of them
actually call it that.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.409
I think it's crazy. I think
it's very bad for children.

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.878
Ms. Stewart:  And I think
calling it something else

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.179
is something important.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.114
The student that served
on our committee

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:28.018
felt that it was important
that he and other students

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:31.655
would know what to do
in an emergency of this type

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:35.526
so that they would know
where to go, how to get out.

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:40.197
Things like hardening
the building so that there is,

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:43.033
as the Mayor has said,
one point of entry.

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.737
Having plans that are developed

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:49.973
that have minimum standards
are established.

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:53.544
And having those individuals
in our schools

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:57.014
who are ready to respond,
as you had mentioned.

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.750
The other issue that did come up

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.020
was the ability to interface
agencies together

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.223
so that we are able
to work together

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:08.225
and know what one
another are doing,

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:12.196
and to better be able to address
these issues as they arise.

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.463
The President:  Good.
Thank you, Pam, very much.

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.199
Curtis.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.166
Mr. Hill:  Mr. President,
thank you so much --

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.167
The President:  Thank you.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.902
Mr. Hill:  -- for the
opportunity to be here.

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:21.672
And I want to start out
by saying that, as we all know,

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.640
this is the freest
nation on Earth,

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.909
and whatever measures
we take have got

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.644
to be consistent
with the character

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:30.147
of who are as Americans,
first and foremost.

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:33.016
I'd like to make three
points of things

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.084
that we're doing in Indiana

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:35.919
and things that we can
do better in Indiana.

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:37.621
And it goes to the discussion
that we had here.

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.924
Securing the physical
environment of the school

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:42.526
is an absolute must.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:45.662
It goes beyond
policies and plans.

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:48.065
We have a school in Indiana,

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:50.000
in Shelby County,
Southwestern High School,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.135
which was participating
in a pilot project,

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:53.604
and it wouldn't surprise you
to know that it was under

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.606
the leadership
of your Vice President --

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:56.573
The President:  Good.

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.474
Mr. Hill:  --
then-Governor Pence.

00:47:57.474 --> 00:48:00.077
Through this program of
innovation and technology

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.646
in connection with the
Indiana Sheriff's Association,

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:06.617
the school created
a model for security.

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:10.621
And in the security, not only do
we have bulletproof doors,

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:13.757
bulletproof glass;
we have containment zones.

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:16.460
When the students
are in the classrooms,

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.095
the doors are locked

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.963
so we don't have to go up
and lock it from the outside.

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.431
And, Mayor, we talked
about that earlier.

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.066
That was a concern
you had on how that's done.

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.102
This is all done
automatically.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.937
The school is wired directly,

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.573
securely to the Sheriff's
Department 10 miles away.

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.742
So, the Sheriff's Department
can monitor

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.377
in real time
what's occurring.

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:36.913
Each teacher has a key fob,
so that when something occurs,

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:39.750
they can communicate
effectively, immediately,

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.419
with someone off-site.
And the most --

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:44.154
The President:  Do you have
anybody inside with a gun

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:47.457
that can take on the man
that's right outside the door,

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:49.726
that, by the way, can shoot
right through the steel doors,

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:51.194
as they did in your school?

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.229
Those bullets went right through

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.697
those steel doors
like they were butter.

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:54.965
Mr. Hill: That's a part
of what's -- that's a part

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.166
of what's necessary.
But I can tell you this:

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.101
Whatever else they have
are countermeasures --

00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:00.070
countermeasures that
can be employed

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.638
from the Sheriff's Department

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.340
within seconds

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.376
to contain the attacker

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:09.212
and, in a sense,
turn the attack on them.

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:11.381
That's a critical piece.

00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:13.317
I would invite you
to come to Shelby County --

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:14.985
The President: I just don't
know what that means.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:16.787
Honestly, I don't know
what that means.

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.055
Mr. Hill:  Well, I can tell you
what it means.

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.222
When you're in a hallway --

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.525
if you have an active
shooter in the hall,

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.927
and he's going around
and he's looking for targets,

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:25.762
we've got the doors blocked.
We've got it locked up.

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.130
Somebody is monitoring.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.266
And, for example,
they have smoke canisters

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.768
that can come in
and blind the shooter,

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.938
which detracts him
from his target.

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.306
That gives time, as you know,

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:39.276
that critical time when
he's alone looking for targets.

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.878
Now's he discombobulated, he
doesn't know where he's going.

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:43.246
The President: Hopefully,
hopefully.

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:44.414
Mr. Hill: Well, that's the
idea, I mean, these are not --

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:45.682
The President: In the meantime,
he's shooting everybody, though.

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.184
Mr. Hill:  Well, in this
particular school,

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.519
they're locked down.

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.922
We need to have those
types of hard products

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:54.191
or hard targets in our schools.

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.625
We do need to have secure --

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:59.096
I think, secured
or highly skilled,

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.664
highly trained individuals

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:03.166
that would combine
with that to make sure

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:06.203
that if they do get in there,
there is that deterrent.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.372
Another piece that I want
to talk about

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.307
is the mental health
aspect in Indiana.

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:12.509
And Pam is working
on this in Florida.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:15.579
In Indiana, we already have
what we call  red-flag laws. 

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.181
We have a law in Indiana
that allows police officers

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:20.450
who believe that
someone is dangerous

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.686
or who believe that someone --

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.888
or have reason to believe that
someone has a mental illness

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:28.492
and is off their medications,
or is otherwise a danger,

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.193
to be able to take the guns,

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:33.797
both under a warrant and in some
circumstances without a warrant,

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.465
but then to certainly provide

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:37.801
due process for that
particular individual.

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.036
What that does, it gets us
past the issue

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:41.271
of the person's mental illness.

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.573
We address the taking
of the guns.

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:44.775
We get them in court.

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:46.376
They're allowed to have
their day in court,

00:50:46.376 --> 00:50:49.613
but in the meantime, we're able
to cool down this process

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.281
and take the guns from someone,

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.616
which is exactly
the type of thing

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.184
that we're not having
all over the country.

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.720
I think there's a handful of
states that have this process.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.722
Indiana has been doing it
for a number of years.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:01.725
We just issued a public
safety advisory yesterday,

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.461
because what we learned
is that many of prosecutors

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:07.731
and our police officers weren't
even aware that we had it.

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:08.965
The President: Yeah, it's good.

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.567
Mr. Hill: So, we're making sure
that that's getting out there.

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.269
I would suggest
that it be something

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:13.970
that all states adopt

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.205
as quickly as possible.

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:16.039
And one last point.

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:18.208
To the extent that
this is about guns,

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.710
let it be about
the illicit use of guns

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.580
used inappropriately
or in crimes

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.348
so that we can do
what we do in Indiana

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:27.250
and that we need
to work on continually,

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:30.854
is to enhance the penalties
for any type of offense

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:33.723
that's used with a firearm.
Let's double down on that.

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:38.428
If you commit a burglary
or robbery with a firearm,

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.163
you need to pay
a severe consequence.

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:41.498
The President: Yeah,
thank you very much.

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:43.400
Mr. Hill:  Thank you, sir.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.434
The President:  I want
to thank everybody.

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.703
I just want to end by saying --

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:48.605
in listening to some of
these suggestions,

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.475
we really do have to have
offensive measures also.

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:53.410
I know people don't like
talking about it,

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.546
but we need offensive
as well as defensive.

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:57.981
We have to be totally defensive.

00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:01.685
But if we don't have offensive
measures within these schools,

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.987
we're just -- you're just
kidding yourselves, folks.

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:05.755
You're just kidding yourselves.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:09.392
And if the offensive measures
are strong and solid,

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.128
you're going to stop
the problem.

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:13.163
You're going
to stop the problem.

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:14.698
Because they're not
coming into that school.

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.100
They'll find something
else, unfortunately.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.468
But they're not coming
into that school.

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:22.839
So, I just would like everybody
to think about that

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:25.141
because I hear so many
of these wonderful plans

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.410
where you're going to live
in this utopian school

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.945
and there's not going
to be any protection,

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:30.213
there's not going
to be any guns,

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:31.915
there's not going
to be any bullets

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:34.384
flying at the perpetrator --

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.953
the animal that wants to destroy

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.655
the lives of families
and children.

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:43.326
Unless you're going to have
offensive capability,

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:45.996
you're wasting your time,
you're wasting your time.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.165
And you're going to talk, and it
would be easier to pass --

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:52.269
I'm sure you're having a lot
of trouble in Florida passing

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.037
because a lot of people
don't understand it,

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.071
or they do understand it,

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.073
but it's politically what
they want to believe.

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.775
Because I want to end
the problem.

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.311
I don't want to have it
where this happens again.

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.813
And unless we're going to have
an offensive capability,

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.916
it's going to happen again,
and again, and again,

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.517
and it's going to be
the same old story.

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:09.519
And people are going to be
sitting

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:10.754
around tables and talking.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:11.955
I like to get things done.

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:14.658
And to get this done,
we do need defense,

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:16.893
but we also need
offensive capability.

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.062
I want to thank everybody.

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:21.364
You're really experts
at what you're doing.

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:24.000
And it's really tremendous
hearing

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.436
some of these ideas that a lot
of people haven't heard.

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:29.539
The media is now hearing things
that they haven't heard.

00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:33.443
And a lot of people that are
watching on television right now

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.111
are hearing things
that they haven't heard.

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:40.417
So, it's a horrible situation.
We're going to get it stopped.

00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:43.119
And we're going to stop it
through heart

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:44.554
and through toughness.

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.489
It's a combination of through
love and through toughness.

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.491
Otherwise it's not
going to happen.

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.026
Just not going to happen.
It's not going to stop.

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.796
And again, thank you
all very much.

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.297
It's a great honor
to be with you.

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.932
Thank you all very much.
Thank you.

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:58.735
The Press: Mr. President,
many school teachers

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.904
say that they don't
want guns in the classroom.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.839
The Press: Are you willing
to go up against the NRA, sir,

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:03.640
on age limits?

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.908
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.476
I don't think I'll be
going up against them.

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.645
I really think the NRA
wants to do what's right.

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.814
I mean, they're very close
to me. I'm very close to them.

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:13.049
They're very, very great people.

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.385
They love this country,
they're patriots.

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.254
The NRA wants to do
the right thing.

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.256
I have spoken to them often
in the last two days,

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.692
and they want to do
the right thing.

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.894
They're going to do the right
thing. I have no doubt about it.

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.329
The Press: Do you think
you can win that battle, sir?

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:27.497
The President: It's not
a battle.

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.432
I think the NRA wants
to do the right thing.

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.467
The Press: What do you say
to teachers who say

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:31.768
that they don't want guns
in the classroom?

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:32.702
The President:  These
are experts.

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.971
These would be people that
actually would want them.

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:36.339
And it would be
a small percentage,

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.008
but it would be a lot of people.

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:40.410
And once you do this,
you will have a situation

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:44.047
where, all of a sudden,
this horrible plague will stop.

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:46.516
Thank you very much, everybody,
thank you.

00:54:46.516 --> 00:55:00.230
The Press: (inaudible.)

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.533
The Press: Sir, just one more
(inaudible.)

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:04.300
Do you worry about that --
to have a gun?

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.372
The President: These
are experts, only experts.

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.375
You understand that,
only experts.

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:15.045
That's all we're talking about.

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.013
These are people that are
at the highest

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.381
level of professionalism.

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.649
The Press: Would you give
them money, federally, for that?

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.317
The President:  I would, yeah.
For training.

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:22.519
For additional training.
