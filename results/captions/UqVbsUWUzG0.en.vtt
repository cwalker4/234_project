00:00:01.172 --> 00:00:04.441
IMMIGRANTS TO VOTE.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.743
&gt;&gt; Shannon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:09.580
LET'S GET TO THE 2 TOP STORIES.

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:12.883
THE COMMENTS FROM ILHAN OMAR

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.686
BLASTING BARACK OBAMA'S HOPE AND

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.856
CHANGE MESSAGES.

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:20.090
OUR PANEL NOW.

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:25.829
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.532
LISTEN, CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR IN

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.802
TROUBLE FOR ANTI-SEMITIC

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:32.202
REMARKS.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:34.472
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S BEEN

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.340
TAKING SOME HITS AT FORMER

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:37.441
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.444
HE IS BELOVED AMONG DEMOCRATS.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:42.880
IN "VANITY FAIR" THEY SAY

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.583
DEMOCRATS DID NOT ABANDON OMAR

00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:47.418
OVER HER COMMENTS ABOUT ISRAEL,

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:50.655
BUT HER CRITICISM OF BARACK

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:52.357
OBAMA IS ANOTHER MATTER.

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:55.526
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE?

00:00:55.527 --> 00:00:57.795
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.364
WORSE THAN SAYING SOMETHING

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.933
ANTI-SEMITIC FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:02.233
PARTY.

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:05.603
IF THIS WASN'T CRAZY IT WOULD BE

00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:07.905
VERY HUMOROUS.

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.875
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLED

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:12.877
TO DEFEND OMAR AND FORGET HER

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:14.579
SINS FOR SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.714
HAVE DUAL LOYALTY TO THE U.S.

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.583
AND THE ISRAEL.

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:22.687
PEOPLE ARE HYPNOTIZED BY ISRAEL

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:26.557
AND NOW ATTACKS PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.226
IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:29.560
SUGGESTING HE IS BASICALLY

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:32.096
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT HE HAD A

00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:35.600
PRETTY SMILE AND A NICE FACE.

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.702
&gt;&gt; Shannon: SHE IS BACKPEDALLING

00:01:37.703 --> 00:01:38.303
ON THAT.

00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:39.804
THE REPORT HAS HIS OWN TAPE.

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:43.475
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WAY SHE WAS

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:45.977
QUOTED IN CONTEXT.

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:48.280
MATTHEW WROTE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.281
TRIPPING OVER THEMSELVES DODGING

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.316
REALITY AND TRYING TO CLEAN UP

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:52.551
THIS ANTI-SEMITIC MESS.

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:53.952
KEVIN, WHY IS SHE GETTING A PASS

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:55.253
FROM SO MANY IN THE DEMOCRATIC

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:55.554
PARTY?

00:01:55.555 --> 00:02:00.091
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AS A

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:03.161
DEMOCRAT I AM SICK AND TIRED OF

00:02:03.162 --> 00:02:06.031
HEARING CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR.

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:08.333
IT'S A DISTRACTION FROM THE

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:11.603
PASSAGE OF THE LARGEST ELECTION

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:12.270
REFORM BILL AND TERRIBLE

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:13.872
ECONOMIC NEWS WITH THE JOB

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:14.473
REPORT.

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:16.241
YOU SAW A UNITED DEMOCRATIC

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:19.845
PARTY IN THE HOUSE CAUCUS.

00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:22.781
EVERY MEMBER VOTED TO CONDEMN

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:23.982
ANY ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:26.552
YOU ARE SEEING SENIOR LEADERSHIP

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:27.686
PULL HER ASIDE.

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:28.987
SHE IS NOT A STATE

00:02:28.988 --> 00:02:31.456
REPRESENTATIVE IN MINT.

00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:33.358
-- MINNESOTA.

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.928
SHE IS ON THE WORLD STAGE.

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.565
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:43.101
STANDING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.070
ISRAEL AND CONDEMNING HATEFUL

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:48.974
SPEECH THIS REPRESENTATIVE IS

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:49.341
SPEAKING.

00:02:49.342 --> 00:02:50.709
&gt;&gt; Shannon: LAST NIGHT

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.910
CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:52.978
OCASIO-CORTEZ SAID SHE AND OMAR

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.813
AND OTHERS ARE BEING TARGETED AS

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:55.681
FRESHMAN WOMEN OF COLOR.

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:57.683
SHE SAID THEY ARE GETTING UNFAIR

00:02:57.684 --> 00:02:58.050
TREATMENT.

00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.119
IF YOU WENT AFTER EVERY BAD

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.587
THING A CONGRESSMAN OR WELCOME

00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:02.654
DID ON THE HILL EVERYBODY IN

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:04.823
CONGRESS WOULD BE IN TROUBLE AM

00:03:04.824 --> 00:03:05.124
FAIR?

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.359
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR AT

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.894
ALL.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:10.462
FIRST I WANT TO NOTE.

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:14.767
IT'S REMARKABLE AND STARTLING

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.336
HOW MUCH ILHAN OMAR -- THE

00:03:17.337 --> 00:03:19.872
DISDAIN SHE HAS FOR THE COUNTRY.

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:23.542
THE COUNTRY HAS GIVEN HER FAMILY

00:03:23.543 --> 00:03:26.245
AND HERSELF REFUGE.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:28.547
SHE WAS A REFUGEE IN KENYA AND

00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:31.817
THANKS TO A LUTHER AN CHURCH

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:33.419
GROUP CAME TO THE UNITED STATES.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.355
AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF, THIS

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:40.359
CONSTANT DISDAIN OF HER

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.226
PORTRAYAL OF THE UNITED STATES

00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:44.196
AND IT'S ANTI-TERROR POLICIES.

00:03:44.197 --> 00:03:47.600
TREATING IT LIKE A MURDEROUS

00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:50.002
COUNTRY THAT CAGES CHILDREN AT

00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:53.306
THE BORDER AND DRONES PEOPLE AND

00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:56.709
NOT ANY CRITICISM OF THE ISLAMIC

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.111
GROUPS, THOSE THAT TURNED HER

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:01.814
HOMELAND INTO A HORRIBLE PLACE.

00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.115
NOT ONE WORD OF CRITICISM.

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:04.950
ONLY DIRECTED AT THE COUNTRY

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.653
THAT GAVE HER AND HER FAMILY

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:07.987
REFUGE.

00:04:07.988 --> 00:04:10.356
IT'S NOT A PERFECT COUNTRY.

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.892
IT'S STARTLING.

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:13.493
IT'S DISGUSTING.

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:17.130
&gt;&gt; Shannon: KEVIN AS YOU SAID IT

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:21.434
OVERSHADOWED PASSING HR-1.

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:25.004
IT'S A MASSIVE SWEEP OF TALKING

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.540
ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:36.516
AND TRANSPARENCY.

00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:40.753
THE ACLU EVEN HATES THIS THING.

00:04:40.754 --> 00:04:42.922
THEY ARE TEAMING UP WITH MITCH

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:43.456
MCCONNELL.

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.191
I DON'T KNOW HOW DIFFERENT YOU

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:45.758
COULD BE.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.026
EACH WEIGH IN.

00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:49.295
NOT ONLY GOING TO FORCE DONORS

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.331
TO DISCLOSE BUT THERE WILL BE

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.899
MATCHING FUNDS WHERE TAXPAYERS

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.735
WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR AND

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:58.004
SUBSIDIZE CAMPAIGNS.

00:04:58.005 --> 00:04:58.304
KEVIN?

00:04:58.305 --> 00:04:59.839
&gt;&gt; THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.842
AMERICANS IN THE COUNTRY WANT

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.110
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.546
THEY SUPPORTED IT EARLIER IN THE

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:09.349
2000S AND WANT TO CLEAN UP BIG

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.250
MONEY THAT CORRUPTS POLITICS.

00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:13.553
THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT THINGS

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:16.589
IN THAT BILL INCLUDING SECURITY

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.459
FUND FOR OUR STATES.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.628
TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND ENSURING

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.463
THAT ANYONE SEEKING THE HIGHEST

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:26.032
OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY SHOULD

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:28.301
RELEASE TAX RETURNS AS EVERY

00:05:28.302 --> 00:05:31.104
PRESIDENT GOING BACK TO NIXON.

00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:34.975
&gt;&gt; Shannon: AIMED AT THE CURRENT

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:35.342
PRESIDENT?

00:05:35.343 --> 00:05:35.809
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.110
THE IMPORTANT THING COMING OUT

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:39.379
IS THE HOUSE PASSED IT AND THE

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.947
SENATE SHOULD DEBATE IT WHICH

00:05:40.948 --> 00:05:43.216
MITCH McCONNELL REFUSED TO DO.

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.517
&gt;&gt; Shannon: THE STATES SAY THEY

00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:45.952
SHOULD RUN THEIR OWN ELECTION.

00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:47.220
&gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD.

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.922
FEDERALIZING THEM IS NOT A GOOD

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:49.489
IDEA.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.059
THE MORE YOU GET THE FEDERAL

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.294
GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IT'S LESS

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:56.029
DISCRETION OF THE STATES.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.864
EXPOSING DONORS IN PUBLIC TO

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:00.934
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT DOING

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:03.136
POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.705
BAD MOVE.

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:15.215
THE REASON THE  NAACP IS AGAINST

00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:21.055
IT.
