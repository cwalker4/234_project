&gt;&gt;JACKIE FAHERTY: Is everybody excited?

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.800
I’m just going to start with that.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:12.120
That’s good, because I can guarantee you
have never seen the Milky Way like you’re

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.620
about to see it tonight.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.590
And it’s in part—that was a scream, I
like it.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029
Whatever this energy is, I’m going to work
with it.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.480
What you’re going to see is rendering of
data that we do here at the American Museum

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.550
of Natural History.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.180
And I’m so excited to show it to you because—I
mean, you guys are going to be some of the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.800
first people to see data in this way, rendered
in this kind of way because you are here in

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.600
this place at the American Museum of Natural
History where we have some of the best data

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
visualization tools.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
All right, so.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.120
To start, I want to set the landscape for
you.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.550
The landscape of astronomy.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.870
This is a picture of the nighttime sky, it’s
about the best kind of nighttime sky anybody

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.210
on this Earth could hope to see.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.090
This is a picture of the nighttime sky.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.540
I was actually inside of one of those telescopes
when this picture was taken.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.979
This is a picture taken from the Las Campanas
Observatory, which is in northern Chile.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.280
And you’re seeing a fairly realistic, just
a little bit heightened, beautified image,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.509
of what the nighttime sky should really look
like.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090
This is actually a very special picture.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.460
This was actually on my birthday a couple
of years ago.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.909
The photographer, Yuri Beletsky, took it for
me while I was observing.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.429
Notice there’s this red dot on the upper
right-hand side, I don’t know if you guys

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.429
can notice that.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.150
It was a total lunar eclipse this night.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.659
So, actually—yeah, I like this.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.659
You guys, very nice, very nice, you’re into
it.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.090
On the left-hand side you’re seeing the
large and small Magellanic Clouds.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.670
You can tell it’s the southern hemisphere
if you’re seeing those two satellite galaxies

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.319
of the Milky Way.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.429
And this picture, to me, I’ve got a giant
version of this up in my office.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.469
It’s one of my favorite pictures taken.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.170
And it is a gorgeous view.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.259
This is the view of the nighttime sky and
so when I ask all of you what you think of

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.750
when you think of the cosmos, you probably
think of the nighttime sky.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.189
And you’d probably want to think of the
nighttime sky that I’ve got pictured for

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.489
you here.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.319
However, and this is a beautiful image, you’re
missing some critical information here.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.100
The critical information that humans are just
not capable of detecting is how far away all

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900
this stuff is.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.720
Your eyes can’t tell that.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.280
You can’t tell that those two galaxies are
galaxies.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.639
That they’re not inside of the Milky Way
that we live in.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.959
You can’t tell that.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.870
You can’t tell what in this picture is the
closest star to you.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.329
You can’t see that.

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.620
You actually need something else.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.799
You need science, which is real, not that
fake news, it’s real news.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.980
Well, with the applause on that.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.750
Science will give you answers to things like,
how far away is a star?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.959
And we’ve figured that out.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.340
The other thing that you don’t get from
this image, while magical and beautiful, is

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.680
you can’t see motion in this image.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.870
All of these stars, everything that’s in
this picture right now, this snapshot taken

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.790
on a gorgeous night during a total lunar eclipse
in Chile, is moving.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.909
But you’re not seeing it here.

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.859
And what I get to show you tonight, through
the magic of data visualization tools and

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.939
the magic of science, but it’s not magic,
‘cause it’s science, is—I’m going

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.239
to show you how stars move.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.290
I’m going to take time and I’m going to
turn it on for you.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.959
And I’m going to show you how we can learn
a tremendous amount about our galaxy by looking

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.930
at how far away stars are and how they move.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.499
So, I’ve got several movies that will take
us through that.

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.499
And I want to thank a couple of things—this
talk was made possible by a couple of things.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.999
Number one, and the reason why I can do this
tonight, and I’m sure many of you actually

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.690
don’t know this because it didn’t get
the kind of press I think it should have.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.359
That’s a satellite called Gaia.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.850
Gaia was launched several years ago.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.250
And on April 25th of this year, the entire
perception of the Milky Way was changed.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.600
The entire perception of astronomy was changed
on April 25th of this year.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.880
The foundation of astrophysics—the foundation
of everything you know about the cosmos—you

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.050
need to know how far away something is.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.940
You need to know how far away a star is.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.030
It’s the foundation of stellar astrophysics.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.380
It’s the foundation of cosmology, it’s
the foundation of everything.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.650
And everything we knew until April 25th, 2018
of this year, was based on a prior mission—it’s

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.650
one of the trivia questions, I don’t know
if anybody got it right—a mission called

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.650
Hipparcos.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.849
There were 120,000 stars that Hipparcos had
measured distances from.

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.890
And then we extrapolated on that and got a
ton of new information.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:19.180
Gaia came out on April 25th and released 1.7
billion parallaxes—distances to stars and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.180
motion.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.480
A hundred and twenty-thousand is what modern
astrophysics was based upon.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.970
One-point-seven billion is what we got on
April 25th.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.260
So that’s a big difference.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.330
You can applaud Gaia, because it is an amazing
mission.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.990
So, what I’m going to do for you is I’m
taking subsets of that Gaia data, and anytime

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.500
you want to see Gaia, come to something we
do upstairs in the dome.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.950
I can fly you through 900 million stars.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.510
No one on this planet has seen that unless
you’ve seen it here, just FYI.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.510
The other thing, I’m using three pieces
of software throughout.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.510
You’ll note, I’ll have a little note on
the bottom of my screen during the movie so

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.510
you can see which piece of software I’m
using.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.510
Some of this we develop here.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.510
Some of the movies you’ll see that it’s
me rendering them as I work through the science.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.820
But I’m going to take the Gaia dataset,
I’m going to break it down into subsets,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.180
and I’m going to explain to you how science
has moved forward using this amazing dataset

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.509
with data visualization tools.

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.720
So, I’m going to start with—I just showed
you the Milky Way.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.750
And there’s—this is going to be a movie
that I made using Partiview software, an open

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.229
source piece of software.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.910
And this is a subset—so, 1.7 billion stars
breaks a laptop.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.910
So.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.060
Just in case you were wondering, it’s very
hard to render that on your laptop.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.470
So I’m going to show you subsets.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.759
This is going to be a couple hundred thousand
stars.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.759
A couple hundred thousand.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.430
It’s like me rolling my eyes at that—that’s
amazing.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.220
A couple hundred thousand stars.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.650
I’m going to run through this.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.470
So, this, now, is—this is not an image.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.110
These are all dots.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.040
These are all stars for which we’ve measured
the positions.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.690
And already you can see, before I start the
movie, it looks like the Milky Way already.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.629
I call this pointillism.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.360
It’s pointillism of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.280
No one has ever been able to do this before.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.710
I’m going to turn this on and you’re going
to see—this is my flying around in the data.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.770
It’s a screenshot of me, using the software.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.930
And so the best part of this now is I can
fly out.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.150
I can actually move outside of the data.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.139
This is a specific subset of data.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.659
These are the hottest stars.

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:21.710
So we never knew exactly how far away they
were because no one could actually measure

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.349
their distances before, we didn’t actually
have a satellite that could do it.

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:27.610
You can see I’m rendering this, I’m moving
out.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.540
So these are what are called the O and the
B stars that live hard, die fast.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.759
There’s like a—I mean, that’s literally
what happens.

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.830
They are very big and they die in just a couple
million years.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.069
So they never move outside the plane of the
Milky Way.

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:51.380
So, as I fly out, the dots that I turned on
there is the locations of what’s called

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.960
“star formation regions.”

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.720
Most people know Orion, right?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.730
Everybody loves Orion.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.449
Orion is the closest star-forming region to
the Earth.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:07.919
And so I pulled out, part of why I think this
phenomenal—notice these streaks.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.539
I kind of call them fingers of God.

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:13.879
And those are marking for you clumps.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:18.449
These are where star-forming regions are located.

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:23.479
And part of—I’m going to run it again—and
as you fall out, what you’ll see is, okay,

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:27.650
we all know, that image of the galaxy you
just saw, we didn’t take that picture.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.800
Voyager is kind of the farthest thing we ever
sent and it’s barely left the solar system.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.280
So we’ve never taken a picture of the galaxy.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.690
But what we’re able to do in this map, and
as I fly out here the second time, what you’ll

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.560
see is the locations of those star-forming
regions.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.800
Those locations of these hot, O and B stars
are telling you the shape of the Milky Way

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800
galaxy.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.410
It’s been heavily debated what the shape
of the Milky Way galaxy is.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.930
Does it have spiral arms?

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.029
I mean, we think so, we’re in a spiral galaxy.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:04.470
What do those spiral arms look like?

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.590
You can now use these stars as a map to try
and get to that structure.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.970
And part of why at this point in the video
that I’m sort of zooming around, and you’ll

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.040
see I turn on this image of the galaxy and
turn it off.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.990
As you blink on and blink off, what you’re
seeing is gaps.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.670
And non-gaps.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.740
Which look like you’re basically getting
the structure of the spiral galaxy out from

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.620
this very simple thing of just mapping the
hottest stars in the galaxy.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.940
Okay, next video I’m going to show you,
and this is my favorite one—you’re not

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.580
supposed to have favorites, but I have favorites.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.950
So, this is my favorite one.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.420
This is what I call the solar neighborhood
flybys.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.769
This is something that I’ve wanted to do,
just something I’ve always wanted to do.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:10:01.709
If you know how stars are moving and you know
how far away they are, you can look at their

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:03.760
trajectories.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.300
We are stuck in this static view, like I mentioned,
of what the galaxy looks like right now, what

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.360
the nearby stars look like right now.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.589
But once Gaia showed up with all of these
motions and distances, we can turn time on

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:26.100
and you can see—are these the stars that
have always been the closest stars to us?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.470
Did we ever have a flyby?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:34.680
Did another star come sweeping through our
solar system and knock a bunch of stuff around?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.480
Kicking comets and asteroids from the Kuyper
Belt and the Ort Cloud, the asteroid belt,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.490
in towards the inner solar system.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.100
Well, we can turn time on on this video.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.960
So this is a cartoon version of the sun.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.700
This is rendered with software we have here
called Open Space.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.930
So, again, in the corner here, it’s telling
you what software I’m rendering this with.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.620
And these are all stars that you cannot see
with your eye.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.910
Because your eye can’t really detect anything
but the brightest stars.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.800
And so I’m going to turn time on right now
and it’s going to go over a couple of million

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
years.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.589
So you’re going to watch your future.

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:22.090
And don’t be scared, but kind of be scared.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.529
This is a lot of stuff going on here.

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:33.860
So, what you’re seeing—again, don’t
be scared, but be scared—that all of the

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.600
stars around you are moving.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.959
Everything is moving.

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:41.700
And you don’t know, though—are they moving
toward you?

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.440
Are they moving away from you?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.889
What this video is showing is mostly—sorry—mostly
the stars motion through the galaxy.

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:54.280
You’re watching the stars have their trajectory
in the plane of the galaxy.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.550
But notice some of them are flying closer
than others.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.910
And what was an immediate thing that came
out of this—this was actually something

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:07.650
that we knew from Hipparcos, but we know it
so much better now, is that in—this another

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:13.600
little movie that I’ll show you close in—in
1.2 million years, there’s a star called

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.709
Gliese 710.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:19.700
It’s about 60% the mass of the sun.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.029
And it’s going to come within the Ort Cloud,
which is that cloud of debris that I’m flying

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:26.290
you towards right now.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.579
You can see the star right there.

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:35.950
You can come in past the glare of the sun,
past the Kuyper Belt into the Earth.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.360
And in 1.2 million years, look out.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.170
Who knows if we’ll still be around.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.230
But if are, Gliese 710 is doing a flyby.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:50.060
And, when it does, it looks like it’ll kick
around a bunch of stuff in the Ort Cloud.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.730
When it does that, it sends stuff into the
inner solar system.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.940
Now, okay, I’m not trying to scare you.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:04.639
But that is an absolutely important of understanding
solar systems, to know what is the dynamic

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.750
nature of how things move.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.000
And just one other thing on this, too.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.010
I’m going to run this again.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.320
How many people have heard of Oumuamua?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.410
Anybody hear of Oumuamua?

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.550
Couple of shouts, one or two.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.149
Oumuamua is this object that was a recent
visitor.

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:27.000
So I’m just going to turn this on to continually
scare you.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.850
Oumuamua is this piece of debris, it looks
like, that came from a different solar system.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.300
It flew through our solar system very recently.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.630
It was discovered a year ago.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.829
And we caught it, it’s on what’s called
a hyperbolic orbit, which means it’s not

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:46.830
bound to our own sun.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.830
Flew right out.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:54.370
Now, using the data like this, astronomers,
it was just last week, used this exact thing

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:59.140
that I’m showing you to trace back where
Oumuamua might have come from.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.700
Now, we’re not sure that it’s right.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.260
I mean, that’s also the other aspect of
this.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.449
We’re not positive we got all the velocities
and the positions correct.

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:15.470
But never before in time have we been able
to even take the step towards this.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.269
Where you could trace back the motion of an
object that came from a completely different

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:25.990
solar system and try and find its host, to
find where it came from.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:32.720
An ejected piece of garbage from some other
star that just passed through here.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.480
And we studied it.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.040
And now we used this kind of thing to trace
back where it might have come from.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.860
So, that should excite you.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:49.709
That is the science on the horizon of what
we’re able to do in the nearby solar neighborhood.

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:54.190
Another thing that we can do with this gigantic
dataset—this is something that I worked

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.380
on heavily—is look for objects that move
together.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.480
Kind of looking for family members of stars.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.959
Until you know how far away they are and how
they move, you cannot know if they’re moving

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:10.950
with each other or not.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:18.040
So what this movie is rendering for you, this
is a catalog of about 10,000 stars that I’m

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040
isolating for you.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040
They’re very near to the sun.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.980
And I’m going to turn time on here and every
one of these objects is moving with something

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.980
else.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.980
So you’re going to watch.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.870
This is over millions and millions of years.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:37.139
So the beauty of this is that you will never
get to see this, because we don’t live long

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.139
enough.

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:40.690
But I can simulate it for you.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:46.150
And so now, as you watch these dots, notice
how they’re moving in clumps.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:54.160
So you’ve caught a chunk of things over
here on the far left-hand side.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.980
Everybody’s got a partner here.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:02.880
And this, this is how you figure out where
do stars come from?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.940
How do stars evolve?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.290
How do they end up interacting with each other?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.410
Do they stay together?

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.579
Are these clumps of just four and five stars—because
some of these are clumps of four and five

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:22.470
stars that we’ve only recently discovered—are
they the last bits of core of a giant region

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.420
of stars that had formed together millions
of years ago?

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.950
Billions of years ago?

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.199
This is the kind of stuff we get to figure
out now.

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:36.200
It’s like forensic evidence that we didn’t
have before and all of a sudden we have access

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200
to.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.730
This is another one.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.279
This is now a catalogue, that was 10,000 stars
that I was focused on because they were all

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.520
co-moving with each other.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.470
This now is a collection of stars that are
all young.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.040
So, we know that they’re young.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.530
All of these show the telltale signatures
of an object that is a young object.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.670
And so I’m going to pull out a little bit
and you’re going to see, there’s about

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.120
10,000 stars in here.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:10.130
And this I work on non-stop, because the young
stars near the sun are also where you would

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:17.080
look for the baby solar systems, for the newly-forming
planets, for the areas where you’re going

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:24.100
to get a glimpse of maybe what our solar system
looked like back when it was just a little

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.470
baby.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:31.160
And as you pull out here, this is where it
gets intense, because you’re seeing what’s

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.270
called the Centaurus-Lupus Super Complex.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.700
And as I’m saying that I’m forgetting
the full jargon for it.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:48.350
But this is a gigantic complex of young stars
near the sun.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.160
And I’m going to turn time on in the last
moment and you’ll watch that these objects—so

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.140
these are the labels of some of them.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.680
There’s Coma Berenices, there’s Pleiades
8.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.630
There’s the Hades and the Pleiades, which
many of you might recognize because you’ve

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.270
seen it in the sky.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.370
And now time is turned on and you’re seeing
how these things move.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.150
So they move together.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.540
But do they move together forever?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:19.630
That last video I showed you might be the
last remnants, the cores of these things which,

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.690
at this point, we know are co-moving with
each other.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:30.400
They’re all young stars and this, this is
where the solar systems are forming.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.230
This is where astronomers look.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:38.410
And Gaia just gave us this unprecedented look
at where they came from, because you can actually

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:44.880
run time backwards and forwards and see how
they interact with each other.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.030
One other thing that Gaia doesn’t do that
great of a job with, yet I was still able

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:55.130
to pull out info and I have to say this because
this is my passion and my science, which is

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.550
brown dwarfs.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.030
This is a video that’s showing you—even
there’s stuff that you can’t even see

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.190
with your eyes in the Milky Way, yet it’s
right there, so brown dwarfs are these objects

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.330
in-between stars and planets that are everywhere.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:17.470
And I just wanted to promote for you as well
that mapping the Milky Way and mapping the

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.620
solar neighborhood is something that we’re
still doing today.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.980
The third and fourth closest—I said “systems,”
but it really means stars, star systems to

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.540
the sun were only discovered in 2013 and 2014.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:35.540
Just imagine discovering an object that’s
sitting there right outside—it’s like

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.410
turning over in bed and somebody’s there.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.650
And you’re, like, when you’d get there?

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.670
Like, how did that happen?

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.720
But that’s still happening.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.170
They’re really cold, so it’s also like
you can hide out because they’re cold.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:57.180
And I run a citizens science project called
Backyard Worlds, Backyardworlds.org, if you’re

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.180
interested.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.600
Go to the website.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.760
Help discover new worlds.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.480
Gaia isn’t as good with these because they’re
a bit too faint.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.690
What now I’m going to reflect on exoplanets.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:14.200
And this is a movie that we’ve rendered
here using Uniview software to give you a

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.230
highlight of the current view of planets around
other stars.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:26.710
So this is a flight off of the surface of
the Earth into the nearby solar neighborhood,

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.770
out of the glare of the solar system.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:34.320
And what you’re going to see is, as we move
out of our solar system, a bunch of stars

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.370
are going to come up that we’ve only discovered
since basically the year 1995.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.940
But since 1995, we’ve been discovering exoplanets.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:49.300
And now all of the blue circles are showing
you were stars near the sun have been found

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.350
to have an exoplanet around them.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.770
The majority of these that you’re seeing,
you can see that they’re all around you.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:01.270
And, as we pull out what you’re going to
see is a special catalogue of objects.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:08.270
It’s going to be color-coded in yellow and
it’s called the Kepler Planetary Objects.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.300
Kepler was this spacecraft launched many years
ago.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.870
So here comes Kepler into this field of view.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.830
Notice the blue circles here which are marking
for you the location of planets around stars.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.710
It’s very close to the sun.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.120
And that’s because a lot of those, we’re
just looking at the brightest stars using

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.920
a technique called the radio velocity method.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.530
Kepler used what’s called the transiting
method, which means you stared at a field

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:40.190
of view and you watched and waited for a planet
to cross in front of the star from your point

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.190
of view.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.380
And so this is going to fly outside of the
Milky Way.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.840
Again, we didn’t take this picture of the
Milky Way because we’ve only gone as far

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.850
as maybe outside the solar system.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.590
So this is an image of another galaxy that
we think looks like our own.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:58.690
And this should both absolutely amaze you
and also make you wonder, oh, my goodness,

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.210
there’s a lot more to the galaxy for us
to try and figure out.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:08.240
So these objects we pull out, you can see
where Kepler was.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.370
This was our rendered view of it prior to
Gaia.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:18.380
I’m going to show you the view from Gaia
and part of that is Kepler redefined how we

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.890
knew about exoplanets.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.520
Like I said, those exoplanets that you saw
with the blue circles, those were fairly close

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520
by.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.670
And, while we had a lot of them, we didn’t
quite have them the way that we do with Kepler.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.960
You can see that, you can go way further out.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.720
Way towards the edge of what you can do in
the galaxy.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.270
And there are now thousands of exoplanets
that have been discovered via Kepler.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:52.400
This is showing it to you now all mapped properly
with their distances from Gaia.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.950
And I’m going to turn time on in just a
minute and what you’re going to see it Kepler

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.950
break apart.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.260
So this is the Kepler field of view.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.970
This is the view that you would have gotten
from Earth, from the detectors.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:12.380
And what you want to look for is, once you
have them all mapped out, you want to be able

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.290
to see where they’re going and where they
came from.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:20.910
So, as we’re close in, you’ll see the
detector field of view comes in and we turn

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.910
time on.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:29.360
And you’re going to watch where these stars
came from and where they’re going.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.260
That kind of broke the Internet when we put
this on Twitter the day after Gaia came out.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.100
So you’re watching where those stars came—where
are they going?

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.250
Who are they moving with?

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:47.130
These are all—this is the history of these
exoplanets.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.720
And this final thing that I’m gong to show
you is the thing that we can now with Gaia,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:59.710
matching it with very complicated missions
that now color-code all of these objects by

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.710
their chemistry.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:07.750
So you can take very complicated surveys that
go and measure the abundances of different

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:15.510
molecules and you can actually see, you can
see—this is showing you in color-coded—how

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.750
much iron you’re getting out of stars.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.110
How much iron you were getting in Kepler and
then lots of other fields of view.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.580
And notice there’s the green and then it
gradients out to the blue.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.690
Blue means low metallicity.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.760
It means that there’s not a lot of metal
in that.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.280
That’s a signature of older stars, which
is what you see when you get outside of the

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.360
galaxy.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.230
One more view of that from this perspective.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.110
And, by the way, the reason why this looks
so funny, with these footprints, these singular

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:48.810
footprints, is because that’s the view that
we had from the telescope, when you looked

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.710
up and you took an image of the sky.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:57.640
It’s in two dimensions and, through the
magic of data visualization, we can actually

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:03.730
fly you through those datasets with Gaia Parallaxes
and beyond.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.760
All right.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.120
So that’s your quick tour of all of the
exciting aspects.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.330
I have probably a hundred more movies I could
show you, but I’m out of time on the movies,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:23.330
so I’m going to leave you with this takeaway:
The Milky Way galaxy, via Gaia, via many surveys

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.390
on top of Gaia, is being mapped like never
before.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.840
And this data is revealing just the intricate
details of where stars come from and where

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840
they’re going.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.200
And, if you’re interested in playing with
the data, this is not just for astronomers.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.390
This is for the public.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.290
This is for everybody.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.290
This is for the kids.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.130
You guys are right here, I’m pointing at
you.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.490
This is for everybody to play with.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.900
So, download our software.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.900
Download the data.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.250
Play with it.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.670
It’s 1.7 billion stars, that’s too many
for the astronomers.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.890
There’s not enough astronomers for all of
the data.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:04.170
So please consider this your invitation to
the party of mapping the galaxy.
