00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.090
Hey guys, welcome back.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.510
So last time I welded this cylinder head here
and if you haven’t seen that video, you

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.910
might want to go check that one out.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.869
What I did was I used my MIG to fill in some
places where it blew out at the coolant passages

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.480
and then I used a wood router to flatten those
welds down.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
It looks pretty good.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
Like I said in the last video, I had to make
another pass of the welder, so I did that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.090
and then came back over again with the router
and took a look.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.620
There’s one place right here where I still
got a little bit of an imperfection, but we’re

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.010
going to get rid of that when we flatten this
whole cylinder head here.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
I haven’t checked, it’s probably, I don’t
know it’s probably pretty flat.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.300
Maybe it’s warped a little bit, but in any
other case we’re going to clean it up.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.670
There’s some pitting, you know, from where
the gasket was and stuff.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.580
Oh yeah, so this part here, I’m not super
happy with how close this passage ended up

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.660
to the ceiling surface of the combustion chamber.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.650
If you look down in there, I think I might
have gotten a little bit carried away with

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.100
the Dremel when I was widening this out, which
is stupid because if you look at the gasket,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.460
these holes, they’re not even completely
used.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.230
It’s just a little teeny pinhole to let
the coolant through, so I didn’t even need

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.560
to grind it out much.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.060
My thought was that if I left the welds how
they were, there’d be places for crap to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.500
collect behind there and you know, so I wanted
a smooth transition.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.740
This might have actually been a little bit
more corroded out at this point anyway.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.070
I wish I had noticed that as I was doing it,
but I think it will be okay.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.240
I think it’s going to hold at least for
a little while.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.900
So let me show you how I’m going to flatten
this and I’m going to use my table saw.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.320
I’m going to use the cast iron table that’s
on it.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.660
So these cast iron tables were ground flat
at the factory so they’re a nice, good reference

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.760
surface to use.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.030
I just cleaned it up, there’s a little bit
of surface rust, but it’s nothing, it’s

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.510
just staining, so I used a little razor blade
just to get any high points off.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.600
Then, came over with the 3M pad.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.190
An old machinist once told me that your finger
can feel a millionth of an inch, which is

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.370
crazy, but it makes sense if you, you know,
you can feel like a tiny little hair and just

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.590
the things that you can perceive.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.880
This feels pretty good to me.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:56.520
So we’re going to use some 3M spray adhesive
here, this is called Super 77, and it’s

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:15.530
just like a spray contact adhesive kind of
thing.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.350
And then I’ve got some 80 grit sandpaper
and we’re going to put this down.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:30.000
I’m not sure, the back of this stuff has
kind of like a tacky kind of surface on it.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.740
I might be able to get away with it, let’s
see, oh yeah I don’t need to spray the back

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.550
of the sandpaper either.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.580
That sticks really well.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.850
Yeah.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.680
The important thing is that they don’t overlap
of course.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.410
There can be a little bit of a gap, that’s
fine.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.550
So here’s the idea, and let me get that
last piece on and basically just going to

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.769
rub the cylinder head against it until it’s
all cleaned up.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:21.959
Let’s give it a shot.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:50.560
[ Metal rubbing sound ] So you might not know,
but I know this from woodworking, you can

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.159
actually take a flat surface and sandpaper
and a flat piece and end up putting a curve

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.680
into it, if you’re not careful with how
you put pressure into the piece.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.650
This thing is pretty heavy, so it’s easy
to just kind of rock it back and forth.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.939
So I’m not too worried about that, but it
is possible if you were to say, like leaning

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.110
on one side more than the other, you could
actually sand off one side more and then it

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.400
ends up not being flat.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.169
So the key here is to just kind like, let
the weight of this thing do it, you know,

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:47.889
help you out, and just apply horizontal forces,
then try not to push down on it at all.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:06:04.029
[ Metal rubbing sound ] Yeah you can see,
I don’t know if you can see, I can see that

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:16.080
this end, and up over here, kind of getting
a little bit more scratches in it than some

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.309
places in the middle.

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:25.300
Like right here, right here, you can see that
must have been a low point.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.919
So it is warped a little bit, so it’s good
we’re doing this.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:41.550
This will get it all down to a flat surface.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:56.839
And I’m going to clean the sandpaper often.This
stuff is actually brushing right off.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:07.419
A Vacuum would be good here, and maybe a dust
mask.

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:24.419
[ Metal rubbing sound ] We’re getting there.

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:38.189
All right, well you get the idea.

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:50.069
So it’s looking like it’s a lot elbow
grease, but uh, it’s how it goes when you

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.069
don’t have a mill.

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.069
Someday.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:57.939
So, I’m going to have to keep doing this,
but it’s getting late and I gotta get ready

00:07:57.939 --> 00:07:59.240
for work.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.490
So it’s going to be the end of this video.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:10.689
I am planning, I’m not sure though, I was
planning on coming back with 120 grit sandpaper,

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:17.689
but you know, they don’t sand it from the
machine shop, they just leave a machine surface.

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:23.449
I’m thinking this 80 grit is even smoother
than what we need really for a gasket surface.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:30.189
In fact, I think you do want a little bite
for the gasket to seal properly.

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:34.650
So yeah, I’ve got a little bit more here
to go.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.570
There’s still some corrosion here I want
to get down to, so it’s clean now and it’s

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.440
pretty flat. and It’ll probably fine, but
I do want to just get rid of some, a little

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.110
bit more, to make this all bright metal.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:54.390
So all right, then after that I got to clean
the whole thing, I haven’t figured out the

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.180
best way to clean it yet.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.800
Probably just brushes and acetone or something.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.020
Probably going to be a very manual process,
but um, I wish I have some kind of tank to

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.620
dip it in of uh, not water this time, but
some kind of solvent or something.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.190
And then, even before I do that, maybe I’m
going to clean up the valves and make sure

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:20.110
that the valves are clean, clean up the seats
and the guides and make sure the valves are

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.090
still sitting here properly and didn’t warp
that, because if that’s the case, then I

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.700
got to go bring it and have a valve job done,
which is some money I didn’t want to spend.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.980
Then I might end up buying an aftermarket
head at that point if it comes to that.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.550
So we’ll see.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:43.090
All right, a little bit long-winded, but thanks
for watching.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:48.240
I hope you found this somewhat interesting,
and if it helped you at all, let me know in

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240
the comments.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.780
If you think this is stupid, let me know that
in the comments too.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.250
I always like to hear those, honestly.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.710
It’s good to hear from you guys.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.950
Thanks for watching, we’ll see you next
time.
