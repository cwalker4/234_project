A nude and decapitated body

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.540
pulled from the waters off South Padre Island.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.480
We collected evidence from the tire shop,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.220
fingerprints were there in the hands

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320
I'm here with your husband...

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.100
He's their first suspect...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Why?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.500
It's hard to explain why your

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.020
border patrol badge is with cocaine, money,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.780
and a cartel pistol.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.980
A Border Patrol agent is being charged

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.660
with capital murder associated with the Gulf Cartel.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.640
He was on our team...

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850
we've very concerned about that.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.040
He is not one bad apple.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.200
He is part of a raid

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500
of corruption that exceeded that of

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.100
any other US federal law enforcement agency.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.760
Beginning today, the United States of America

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.880
gets back it's borders.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.489
[Police scanner]

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.700
Walls don't really do you any good

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.040
if you can hire somebody to wave you through it.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.940
It was during the height of Spring Break.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.040
South Padre Island!

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.840
Beautiful, warm, and sandy.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.440
When we got the call through our dispatcher,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.800
I was on patrol.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.260
His neck, where his head was cut off,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.740
was at the surface of the water.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.180
His arms were sticking out like this.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.940
We grabbed him by the arms

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.300
and pulled him out.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.100
Then the legs, of course, came out.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.840
The hands were there,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.300
the fingerprints were there on the hands.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.980
We ran them through the machine,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.920
and lo and behold

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.260
we do get an identification on the body.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.460
The victim is Francisco Palacios Paz

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.240
also known as Franky.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.080
[Seagulls]

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.270
A Honduran immigrant.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.640
Frankie worked at the tire shop

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640
in Edinburg, Texas.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.460
[Seagulls]

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.950
We identified people that were co-workers.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
To our surprise, you know, most of them say,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.500
"He went to Spring Break."

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.720
[Seagulls]

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.600
We collected evidence from the tire shop.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.400
We discovered blood stains and blood spatters

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.460
on the walls.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.820
More than likely it was Franky

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.540
that had beed killed there.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560
We collected cell phone records.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.220
There was one text message,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.240
what it read was that Franky,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.340
he's gonna snitch.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.480
He's a damn traitor,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.720
he's going to finger

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.990
identify you at any moment.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.120
So that established for us a motive.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.440
These two brothers emerged,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.290
Eduardo Luna and Fernando Luna.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.600
Well, Fernando Luna was not at the tire shop.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.300
Fernando was in Mexico.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.600
By the grace of God that day

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.800
he was coming back into the United States.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420
When he did cross at customs

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.380
they ran his name,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.080
and lo and behold the warrant pops up...

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.820
and they tell us that there's a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.660
second person with him identified as Joel Luna.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.780
Joel Luna was the third brother,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.150
the middle brother of the Luna's.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.800
When we found out he was a border patrol agent,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.560
this whole scenario now has changed.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.880
In the last dozen years, more than 130

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.460
Customs and Border Protection Officials have been

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.260
arrested, charged, or convicted of corruption.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.340
Mexican drug mafias annually send between

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.480
19 and 29 billion dollars in proceeds from

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.240
the United States to Mexico.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.060
There is a huge incentive

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.380
to work with cartels because of the money.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.700
Obviously, he's brothers to them.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.320
Is he involved?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.440
He was involved in laundering money

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.790
to convert it into legitimate money to provide homes

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.200
for his brothers.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.220
and his mother in law's house.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.780
We end up finding a safe, a black safe.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.080
Joel Luna was standing outside.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.360
Joel had bought it with his own credit card.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.140
We opened it in our office.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.660
and the baggies to resell,

the scale to weigh it, the spoons

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.850
prices on ammo, prices on who owed what.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.760
They found this gun...

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.620
A gun that's tied directly to the gulf cartel,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.580
it says gulf cartel on it.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.960
It has this word, this phrase on it

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.220
that says "pajaro".

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.550
Pajaro is a bird.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.760
El pajaro was the name of Eduardo Luna,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.500
the brother of Joel Luna.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.120
Eduardo Luna, el Pajaro, was a Sicario

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.420
Sicario is a Spanish word for assassin.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.430
Well, when you get to a certain stage...

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.340
your bosses make gifts.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.440
It's hard to explain that away.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.900
It's hard to explain why your Border Patrol

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.051
badge is in a safe with cocaine, money, and

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.180
a cartel pistol.

serves our country in Iraq.

his brothers have become.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.639
to his dad and his mom.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.820

The mistake he made was giving his brothers shelter,

00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:19.940
brothers who he had been separated from.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.200
It's not every day that a border patrol agent

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.680
gets tried for cartel violence,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.180
but this is the story of border patrol corruption.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.000
Mr Luna is not one bad apple,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.180
he is part of a raid of corruption that exceeded that of

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.220
any other US federal law enforcement agency.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.740

Our order calls for the hiring

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.540
of another 5,000 border patrol officers.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.600
The risk is that you do

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
exactly what we did last time...

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.340
We'll increase the number of Border Patrol

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.680
officers by an additional 6,000.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.100
We dramatically ramped up border patrol agents.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.430
You gotta hire people quickly, they cut corners.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.380
There was a real spike in border patrol corruption.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.060
On average, more than one agent has been arrested

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.180
every month for the past 11 years, frequently

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.270
for drug or human trafficking.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.080
It's doubled its size in 10 years...

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.340
I think we're starting to see some problems as a result

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.340
of that.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.320
Transnational criminal organizations are doing

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.270
all they can to infiltrate CBP, through our

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.140
hiring initiatives.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.320
I spent 8 years in a senior leadership position

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.880
at CBP, attempting to sound the alarm and

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.790
put in place reforms.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.940
The nation's largest law enforcement agency

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.440
is trying to reform itself.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.900
Congress to require that new employees

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.040
pass a lie detector test.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.640
About 60-something percent of the people who take

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.800
that test don't pass it.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.080
They make admissions to things that

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.190
make them ineligible to hold a federal position or as

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.180
a law enforcement officer in border patrol.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.790
So not all of that attrition is bad.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.880
But right now, we're losing people faster

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.610
than we can hire them, and part of the reason is

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.600
polygraph.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.120
We need to have a hiring system

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.480
including polygraph that actually brings in people faster

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.040
than the rate that we lose them.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.680
One of the things that's under consideration

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.380
now is moving from what they call a law enforcement

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.020
test, which tests a complete version of your

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.360
history, to a test that is specifically designed

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.280
to see if you are susceptible to corruption,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.810
and it's also a shorter test.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.580
That is a polygraph test designed to

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.420
test analysts for the intelligence community, not

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.050
for frontline law enforcement officers.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.980
They're doing a 180 from what has been recommended

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.660
to fix the problem and going down the road

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.440
in the opposite direction.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.380
They go to work everyday, and maybe they don't

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.300
make a lot of arrests that day, maybe they

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.820
don't make any seizures, but they know

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.029
that when they're on that line and they are watching

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:34.380
and protecting, that it matters.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.460
So having more agents is going to help us.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.320
We are definitely growing.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.900
We are currently doing an

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.040

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.470
[Music]

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.480
This was a criminal enterprise,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.370
and their enterprise was to import drugs.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.960
They had the intel because one of the brothers

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.080
was a US Border Patrol Agent.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.360
When the murder occurred, Joel was

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.080
at his home in San Juan, getting ready for work.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.960
Joel was working when his brother,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.440
Eduardo, was driving the body of

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.340
Franklin Palacios Paz to the island.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.700
I made it a point to set the safe

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.520
in front of the jury everyday.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.640
And the jury just looked at it.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:10.120
[Music]

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.840
The sicario, the assassin,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.440
Eduardo took life without parole.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.460
And Fernando, the one who turned state's witness,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.880
he was deported.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.600
A former border patrol agent at the center

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.240
of a murder trial faced a judge this morning.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.720
[Music]

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.839
Joel was acquitted of capital murder and murder.

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.700
He was found guilty of the two counts of

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.490
engaging in organized criminal activity.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.820
I like telling the jury...

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.980
If you aid and abet, then you're just as guilty

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.380
as the guy who pulled the trigger.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.980
One border patrol agent can undo

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.740
an incredible amount of good that all the other

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.800
border patrol agents do.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.950
And it occurred to me...

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.040
Walls don't really do you any good

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.580
if you can hire somebody to wave you through it.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.520
