00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.221
It looks like the big threat to Westeros in
Game of Thrones Season 7 are the Others, or

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:11.900
white walkers, with their army of the dead
, marching on the Wall to bring a “night

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.160
that never ends” . These guys are a… problem,
cause the walkers are not only super-strong,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.400
super-angry ice demons, but their swords can
shatter steel – they seem immune to normal

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.630
weapons . There are just two known ways to
kill a walker – one is with a blade of dragonglass

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.980
– go watch that video – and the other
way is with a blade of Valyrian steel – we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.050
see this in Season 5 , and it’s also hinted
in the books . Valyrian steel is a special

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.880
kind of metal, used to make swords that are
sharper, stronger and lighter than blades

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.649
of regular steel . The steel was made in Valyria
hundreds of years ago, but when Valyria was

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.480
destroyed in a mysterious Doom, the secret
of making Valyrian steel was lost . So the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
Valyrian blades that remain are really valuable
– there are a couple of hundred of them

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.909
in Westeros , but only about twenty are mentioned
in the books.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.820
Most are the treasured heirlooms of noble
houses, handed from generation to generation

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.960
through the centuries . Lots of these swords
have great backstories and histories, and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.770
some of them may play a role in the war with
the walkers to come.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.350
So let’s have a look at the Valyrian blades
of Game of Thrones.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.280
Probably the most obvious Valyrian sword is
Longclaw, the sword used by Jon Snow.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.319
Longclaw is a bastard sword, which means it’s
a bit longer than a normal longsword . This

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.819
is also pretty fitting given that Jon is a
bastard – or he’s believed to be a bastard,

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.789
but that’s another story.

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.899
Longclaw is given to Jon by Jeor Mormont,
whose family held the sword for hundreds of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.499
years . Jeor originally gave Longclaw to his
son Jorah, but Jorah dishonoured the family

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.310
by selling slaves and fleeing Westeros.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.649
He leaves the sword though , so Jeor gives
it to Jon.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.469
It’d be interesting to see Jorah’s reaction
if he ever sees Jon with his family’s sword.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.180
But with its bastard blade and white wolf
pommel, Longclaw is very symbolic of Jon’s

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.180
identity.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.161
It’ll no doubt play a big role in Jon’s
fight against the white walkers, and the sword

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:22.129
might even tie in to the prophecies about
a hero called Azor Ahai who’s expected to

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.159
lead the fight against the walkers with a
flaming sword called Lightbringer – that’s

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.349
what Stannis and Melisandre try to emulate.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.379
There are theories suggesting that Jon’s
sword Longclaw might somehow become the true

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.959
Lightbringer, to be the fire and the light
needed to face the darkness and cold.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.400
Another sword that appears in the show is
Heartsbane, the Valyrian steel greatsword

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400
of House Tarly . Randyll Tarly makes a big
deal of how he doesn’t want his fat cowardly

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.250
son Sam inheriting the fabled blade Heartsbane,
which is part of the reason why Randyll forces

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.439
Sam to join the Night’s Watch . Heartsbane
does have a long history – a few hundred

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.410
years ago, an outlaw from Dorne called the
Vulture King was stopped when men led by a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.740
Savage Sam Tarly hunted him down, using Heartsbane
to slay dozens of Dornishmen . There’s a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.969
pretty good chance our Sam was named after
this historical Savage Sam.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.221
In the books, Heartsbane is held by Randyll
Tarly , who’s known as one of the great

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:29.150
soldiers of Westeros . In the show, Sam visits
home and takes Heartsbane from Randyll, bringing

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.090
it with him to the Citadel, the sorta Hogwartsy
university of the maesters.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.140
Which could play out in some interesting ways.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.829
Maybe Sam and the maesters could study Heartsbane,
try to unlock the secrets of Valyrian steel,

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.560
or maybe find more Valyrian blades.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.180
But whatever happens at the Citadel, Randyll
will want his sword back.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.950
Another important sword is Ice, the Valyrian
steel greatsword of House Stark . Ice is really

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.939
big, apparently too big to use in battle – it’s
more of a ceremonial sword . Ned Stark uses

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.800
it to execute Gared at the start of Book 1
– and near the end of Book 1, Ilyn Payne

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.810
uses it to execute Ned . So the Lannisters
end up with Ice, and Tywin Lannister decides

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.500
to melt Ice down and reforge it into two smaller
swords.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.250
Cause while no one knows how to make new Valyrian
steel, some skilled smiths can reforge it

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.730
into new forms – in this case Tywin hires
the armorer Tobho Mott – who happens to

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.510
be the teacher of Gendry.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.980
So some people speculate that Gendry knows
a thing or two about Valyrian steel .

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.160
But yeah Ice is melted down and forged into
two smaller swords – Tywin gives one to

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.020
his son Jaime, and the other to his grandson
Joffrey.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.100
Joffrey names his sword Widow’s Wail, because
he’s a nasty little shit, while Jaime does

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.710
something more meaningful.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.930
He names his sword Oathkeeper, and gives it
to Brienne.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.780
Cause remember, Jaime swears an oath to Catelyn
Stark that in return for being set free, Jaime

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.710
would return to her Sansa and Arya.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.210
So Jaime gives Brienne Oathkeeper to uphold
this oath on his behalf, to defend “Ned

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.730
Stark’s daughter with Ned Stark’s own
steel” . The sword is also symbolic of the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.830
respect Jaime has for Brienne – he used
to hold her in contempt, but now he gives

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.800
her a “sword fit for a hero”.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.180
Joffrey, meanwhile, uses his Valyrian sword
to slay a book and then a pie, and then he

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.000
dies . The sword then presumably then goes
to Joff’s brother Tommen, though in the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.080
show Tommen’s dead too – so it’s not
clear who’ll use the sword next.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.380
Widow’s Wail is now the only known Valyrian
sword in the city of King’s Landing – surely

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.040
it’ll come in handy sometime.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.560
So those are major Valyrian swords that appear
in the story – there are also some interesting

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.100
historical ones.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.710
Perhaps the most famous Valyrian blade is
Blackfyre . Blackfyre was the sword of King

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.790
Aegon Targaryen, the Conqueror who first took
over Westeros.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.830
Aegon was a great warrior , and used Blackfyre
in the battles that founded the Targaryen

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.830
dynasty.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.170
Each king after Aegon bore his sword , so
Blackfyre became an important symbol of Targaryen

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.220
political legitimacy – if you had the sword,
you were seen as the rightful king.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.560
That’s why it was so shocking when King
Aegon the Fourth, one of the worst Targaryen

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.120
kings, gave Blackfyre to one of his bastard
sons, Daemon . Daemon took Blackfyre as his

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.420
house name, and later claimed to be the rightful
king, beginning a war for succession called

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.510
the First Blackfyre Rebellion . The great
battle of this rebellion was at the Redgrass

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.600
Field, where Daemon used Blackfyre in a duel
against Gwayne Corbray, who had his own famous

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.750
Valyrian blade , called Lady Forlorn.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.330
It’s said they fought for near an hour,
and each time Blackfyre and Lady Forlorn clashed,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.190
you could hear the sound from leagues away
– “half a song and half a scream” . Eventually

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.950
Daemon won the duel, but then he was killed
by arrows from his half-brother Bloodraven,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.490
who by the way, is the same guy who later
becomes a tree god and teaches Bran how to

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.040
magic – more on him later.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.780
So Daemon died on the Redgrass Field, but
his Blackfyre ancestors continued to rebel

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.430
against the Targaryens for years , and all
of this began partly because Aegon the Fourth

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.900
gave the Conqueror’s sword to his bastard
son.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.410
The sword represents being the rightful king
, but for the hundred years or so, no one

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.090
seems to know where the sword is.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.640
Which could have implications for the schemes
of Varys and Illyrio.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.620
In the books, Varys and Illyrio have this
crazy complex conspiracy to put a kid called

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.050
Young Griff – who they say is Aegon the
Sixth – on the Iron Throne – go watch

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.220
that video.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.280
But basically there’s evidence that this
Aegon kid might actually be a Blackfyre, a

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.950
descendent of Daemon.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:02.150
So it’s very interesting that in a reading
by George Martin of a draft version of a chapter

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:08.480
from Dance, Illyrio mentions a gift for Young
Griff, and a “sword”, and “things Griff

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.860
must know”.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.670
Fans speculate that Illyrio may have Blackfyre,
the fabled blade of Aegon, and will give it

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.550
to Griff to grant him political legitimacy
as a king.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.540
This is very speculative, but could make a
lot of sense – it’d solve the mystery

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.600
of what happened to Blackfyre, and would tie
present plots to the past in a really cool

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
way.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.469
So yeah, Blackfyre is important, and Lady
Forlorn is also a thing.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:39.919
After the duel at the Redgrass Field, the
sword returned to House Corbray, and a hundred

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:45.090
years later, Lyn Corbray used it in Robert’s
Rebellion, killing Prince Lewyn Martell of

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.310
the Kingsguard.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.830
Lyn is now involved in the plots in the Vale,
working with Littlefinger, but it’s not

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:57.250
clear if he can be trusted . Lyn’s a dangerous
man , violent, and possibly a paedophile , depending

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.490
on how you interpret this line about “boys”
. But yeah that’s what’s happening with

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.970
Lady Forlorn now.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.230
Historically, there was also a sword called
Lady Forlorn used in the wars of the Andals

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.080
in the Vale, but apparently that may’ve
been a different Lady Forlorn?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.210
People keep naming swords after famous older
swords, which confuses things, but anyway

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.280
–
Another important Targaryen sword is called

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.720
Dark Sister.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.430
While Aegon the Conqueror had Blackfyre, his
sister Queen Visenya had Dark Sister, a “slender

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.510
blade” designed for a female warrior . Visenya
used the sword during Aegon’s Conquest,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.810
when she wasn’t roasting people with her
dragon.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.040
And many years later, Dark Sister went to
Daemon Targaryen, the “rogue prince”,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.450
who used the sword during the Dance of the
Dragons – the big Targaryen civil war.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.580
During a mid-air dragon battle with his nephew
Aemond One-Eye, Daemon leapt from his dragon

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.160
onto Aemond’s dragon, and drove Dark Sister
through Aemond’s one good eye , before both

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.930
men and their dragons fell from the sky and
died.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.360
This is why we need a Game of Thrones prequel
movie, guys.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.570
After Daemon, Dark Sister went to Aemon Targaryen,
the famous Dragonknight said to be one of

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.340
the greatest and noblest knights that ever
lived – he’s the namesake of Maester Aemon

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.340
Targaryen.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.360
And after the Dragonknight, Dark Sister went
to a man called Brynden Rivers, or Bloodraven

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.570
. Bloodraven really needs his own video, but
basically he was a king’s bastard, a spymaster,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.010
sorcerer , Hand of the King, he killed Daemon
Blackfyre at the Redgrass Field, had a relationship

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.610
with Shiera Seastar – who might possibly
be Quaithe? – then Bloodraven joined the

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.380
Night’s Watch, became Lord Commander, went
north and finally became a tree wizard man,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.130
the guy who’s known in the show as the three-eyed
raven.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.800
But the question here is – what happened
to the sword Dark Sister?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.030
Did Bloodraven bring it with him to the Night’s
Watch – like Jeor did?

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.940
And if he did, is the sword in the cave where
Bloodraven trains Bran?

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.050
If so, it’s possible that Bran’s friend
Meera might take up the sword – it’s designed

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.990
for a woman’s hand, after all.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:09.270
In fact, some people think that in the show,
she already has it – she does grab a sword

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.900
from the cave in in Season 6.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.310
Another possibility is for Dark Sister to
go to Arya.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.550
Needle is cool and all, but surely a ninja
assassin like Arya should have a storied Valyrian

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.120
sword like Dark Sister – Arya herself kind
of is a ‘dark sister’.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.521
This is all wild speculation, but given the
history and importance of Dark Sister, it

00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:34.160
seems likely that the sword will reappear
in the story.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.210
Another lost Valyrian sword is Brightroar.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.260
House Lannister bought Brightroar for a huge
amount of gold before the Doom of Valyria

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.560
. But a hundred years later, after Valyria
was destroyed, King Tommen Lannister went

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.210
on an expedition to plunder its ruins.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.010
He took Brightroar with him – and “never
returned” . House Lannister lost one of

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.130
its most valuable treasures, which always
frustrated Tywin when he led House Lannister.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.520
So at one point, Tywin’s younger brother
Gerion went on a quest to find Brightroar,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.500
but he never returned either – go watch
the Gerion video.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.650
But in the end, Tywin got his Valyrian sword
in the form of Ice, which he made into Oathkeeper

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:13.650
and Widow’s Wail.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:19.360
By the way, in the books those swords are
coloured red, Tywin has the metal dyed to

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.540
a sorta rippling Lannister crimson, cause
Tywin’s all about that house pride family

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.230
legacy stuff.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:32.980
Anyway the next couple swords are owned by
ironborn – there’s Red Rain and Nightfall.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:38.070
Red Rain is a Valyrian sword held by Dunstan
Drumm , the Lord of Old Wyk.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:43.320
He whips it out at the Kingsmoot and recounts
how his ancestor, Hilmar Drumm the Cunning,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.220
famously took Red Rain from some knight, armed
only with his wits and a cudgel.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.850
And there’s a theory that that the knight
who Drumm took Red Rain from might have been

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.970
from House Reyne , a family in the westerlands
who Tywin Lannister wiped out.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.830
The Reynes have a red lion for their sigil,
and their name is Reyne, so Red Rain is a

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.670
fitting name in more ways than one.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.400
And the westerlands have historically been
raided by ironborn , so it makes a lot of

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.000
sense for the Drumms to have taken Red Rain
from the Reynes.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.990
In Book 4, Drumm is on raids with Red Rain
in the reach.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.500
Nightfall is Valyrian sword held by the knight
Ser Harras Harlaw.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.830
Harras supports Asha or Yara Greyjoy at the
kingsmoot , though Euron later kinda steals

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.870
him from her by making Harras a lord . The
sword Nightfall was historically wielded by

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:37.670
the infamous ironborn raider Dalton Greyjoy
, called the Red Kraken for all the blood

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:44.339
he shed . It’s said Dalton loved three things,
the sea, women, and his Valyrian sword Nightfall

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:49.940
. It’s not clear how Red Rain and Nightfall
will tie into the broader story of Thrones,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.490
but some speculate that King Euron might take
these swords from their owners – in the

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:59.589
books Euron has a set of armour made of Valyrian
steel, he might wanna complement that with

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.339
a Valyrian sword or two.

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:06.010
Also Nightfall is a pretty appropriate name
for someone who is low-key trying to cause

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:12.279
a Lovecraftian blood magic apocalypse type
situation, which, he is – we’ll have to

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.300
explain that in another video.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.040
Euron is scary.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.029
But another Valyrian blade that’s had a
big impact on the story is not another sword,

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.520
but a knife.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.430
In Book and Season 1, an assassin tries to
kill Bran Stark with a knife of Valyrian steel.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:35.180
Catelyn takes the blade to King’s Landing,
and Littlefinger tells her the knife is Tyrion’s

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.300
– so Catelyn, thinking the dwarf tried to
kill her son, arrests Tyrion, which kicks

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.620
off the War of the Five Kings.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.649
Thing is, the real culprit behind the catspaw
is Joffrey – Littlefinger lied about the

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:49.630
knife in a deliberate attempt to cause war.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.260
After betraying Ned Stark and profiting off
the downfall of his family, Littlefinger carries

00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.060
the Valyrian knife in later books – shamelessly
wearing a symbol of his lies and betrayal.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:06.200
Now, in the books, Sansa in the Vale with
Littlefinger and the knife – some people

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.630
speculate that Sansa will use the knife to
kill him, destroying Littlefinger with the

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.610
same blade he used to destroy her family.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:19.400
There’d be a great poetry to that – though
things’ll prolly go differently in the show.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.710
There are a few more Valyrian swords that
were used in the Dance of the Dragons, the

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.760
Targaryen civil war from a hundred years ago.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.730
Lamentation is a sword carried by a guy called
Willum Royce.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.580
He got caught up in the Storming of the Dragonpit,
when a rioting mob of common folk killed some

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.190
chained-up dragons.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.240
In all the violence and the chaos, Willum
Royce and his sword were lost . There was

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.279
also Bold Jon Roxton and Ormund Hightower,
who bore the swords Orphan-Maker and Vigilance

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:53.120
. Roxton was killed , and we haven’t heard
from his family since, but the Hightowers

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.240
are still around, so they might have Vigilance
at Oldtown – where Euron may be closing

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240
in.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.690
There are a few more Valyrian blades that
are only briefly mentioned in the text.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:08.820
Some soldier from Lys had a Valyrian sword
called Truth , the Celtigars of Claw Isle

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:14.470
are said to have a Valyrian steel axe , and
a guy called Caggo has a Valyrian steel arakh

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:19.700
– one of those curvy Dothraki scythey things
– which is apparently rare in Valyrian steel

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.960
. Caggo is a captain of the Windblown mercenaries,
so he’ll be involved in the story ahead.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.760
And finally, there are a bunch of Valyrian
daggers among the treasure Euron presents

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.830
at the Kingsmoot.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.850
It’s a little weird the way these are off-handedly
mentioned , as though a buncha Valyrian blades

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.870
is no big deal – maybe Valyrian daggers
are more common than the swords are, though

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.589
you’d think, that if so, someone like Tywin
could buy a bunch of Valyrian daggers and

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:50.890
reforge them into the sword Tywin so desperately
wanted for so long.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.510
The true value and rarity of Valyrian steel
is not very clear.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:01.220
But regardless, this is every Valyrian blade
mentioned in Game of Thrones.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:06.589
Longclaw and Heartsbane, Ice, Oathkeeper and
Widow’s Wail, Blackfyre, Dark Sister, Lady

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:12.139
Forlorn, Brightroar, Red Rain and Nightfall,
the swords of the Dance, Littlefinger’s

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:15.209
dagger and this other miscellaneous stuff
too.

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:18.839
There are more swords out there somewhere
of course – bout a hundred and eighty more

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:24.809
– and Westeros might need them all to win
the war against the walkers.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:25.809
Thanks for watching.

00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:29.570
If you wanna learn more about the histories
and backstories of Thrones, you might like

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.619
to read The World of Ice and Fire, George
Martin’s worldbook, which is all about this

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:34.619
sorta stuff.

00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:39.330
There’s a link to buy it below, which supports
this channel at no extra cost to you.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.450
Some of this art is from The World of Ice
and Fire, other pieces are by Amok, and kethryn,

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.899
check the description for details.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:51.749
Thanks to the translators for translating
captions, and thanks to the Patrons for making

00:17:51.749 --> 00:17:57.659
Alt Shift X possible, including James Beagles,
Yelda Aktuna, Avery Calvert, Rufus T Firefly,

00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:58.690
Suikoshiningforce2, and Hodor Targaryen.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:58.950
Cheers.
