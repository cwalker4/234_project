00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:04.344
(wake thundering and hissing)

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.639
- [Narrator] A few years ago,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.374
entrepreneur Jim Clark envisioned a boat

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:11.291
built purely for speed.

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:15.762
A boat so light, so fast,

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:19.354
that it would shatter
every record it attempted.

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:20.187
In 2014...

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:24.570
That dream became a reality,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.789
with 100-foot monohull, Comanche.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.636
- [Ken] It's by almost any measure

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:32.145
the fastest monohull in the world.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.933
- [Narrator] With her
revolutionary design,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.933
she has since been dominating

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.107
the world of professional sailing,

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:41.303
blowing competitors out of the water.

00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:44.269
Now, skipper Ken Read is on a mission

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.714
to break one of sailing's
most prestigious benchmarks,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.179
the transatlantic record.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.375
- It's one of the holy grails
of ocean-going records.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:58.214
- [Narrator] A grueling
journey of 2,880 nautical miles

00:00:58.214 --> 00:01:02.701
from New York to the
southern tip of England.

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.782
The crew's success depends largely

00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:07.742
on how elite navigator, Stan Honey,

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:09.748
can predict, harness,

00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:14.024
and adapt to the Atlantic's
fickle weather patterns.

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.183
If broken, this record will
secure Comanche's place

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:21.350
among the most successful
racing boats in sailing history.

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:32.585
(slow mysterious chiming)

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.021
- Overview of Comanche is really simple.

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:50.597
Itâ€™s, uh, Jim and Kristy Clark's dream to have

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:54.162
the ultimate race boat, the
ultimate monohull race boat.

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:56.109
- [Narrator] Clark's team
analyzed every aspect

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.205
of the modern monohull,
then set out to build

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:01.789
the next iteration of racing boats,

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.032
principally designed to
break open ocean records.

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:07.789
- [Ken] The build team that we assembled

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.207
are the best of the best.

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:11.978
- There was no expense spared
in creating this thing.

00:02:11.978 --> 00:02:14.414
It's either carbon or titanium.

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:16.092
- With the engineering structure,

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:17.813
with the use of carbon fiber,

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:19.509
with this canting keel mechanism,

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.435
this boat is literally half the weight

00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:24.703
of a boat like this,
even 10, 15 years ago.

00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:26.767
- Ken Read, the skipper,
and Jim Clark, the owner,

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:30.582
gave the designer a
very, very clear mission,

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:34.133
which was to design and build
the fastest possible boat

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.922
that was legal to enter into

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.253
the major ocean races around the world,

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:42.172
and to, ideally, set the course
records for these events.

00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:44.818
That sort of clarity of
objective was, I think, critical

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:47.684
to the boat coming out the way it did.

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:49.202
- You know, it's meant to make a statement

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.728
in the sailing world,
and you can just tell

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:55.269
by its outward appearance, it
makes a statement. (laughs)

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.436
- The level of detail that they
take in building these boats

00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.799
then filters down throughout
the whole sailing team.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.930
- Ken is among the best
sailors in the world.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.582
He's a commentator for the America's Cup,

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:11.329
he's extremely
knowledgeable, you know, about sailing,

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.412
and he's a great skipper.

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.369
- Ultimately, what I'm
pretty good at doin'

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.129
is getting a compatible group of all-stars

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.893
from all around the globe,

00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:24.967
that can actually handle a boat like this.

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:26.156
It's like a Formula One car:

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:30.323
You let it get away from
you, it'll get away from you.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.344
- It is a very dangerous boat.

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:34.678
Everybody who is onboard this boat

00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:37.281
either has America's
Cup, Volvo Ocean Race,

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.947
Grand Prix high-end racing background.

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:41.628
It's their career; it's their job.

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:42.984
- My job, specifically,
is really quite easy:

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:45.364
I get to sail the coolest
boat in the world.

00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:46.978
I guess, as the skipper of the boat,

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:50.462
I'm ultimately responsible
for the safety of the crew,

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.027
the big decisions, you know?

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:54.535
I work very closely with
Stan Honey, the navigator,

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:57.234
on where we position
ourselves in the ocean.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.249
It's critical, because the
navigator and the skipper

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.110
work together very closely.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.047
And then where we overlap
and work together,

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:04.880
is in the tactic area.

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:09.250
- The boat's a 100-foot screamin' machine,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.949
that has been built to break
every record in the world

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.873
that we can, and she's
on her way to doing that.

00:04:15.873 --> 00:04:17.017
- [Stan] Once in the water,

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:20.600
Comanche went straight
for her competitors.

00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:28.390
- Wild Oats is the boat to knock off,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.358
and we're here for a
reason, but there's also

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:34.208
three or four other really
good boats in this event,

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:35.803
that could do the same exact thing,

00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:37.254
so we've just gotta go out and sail well,

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.139
and let the chips fall.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.601
- [Chris] The sheer size
of it, it looks different

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:44.601
to any other boat out there at the moment.

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:47.351
(crowd cheering)

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:51.287
- I think it's fair to say,

00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.836
we've got the fastest
100-footer in the world.

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.494
You saw what it did off the starting line

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:55.799
and what it did down that first run,

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:58.113
and we were 30 miles ahead when we broke.

00:04:58.113 --> 00:04:59.844
We love this boat.

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:01.525
- [Jim] We've had good
luck, racing in those races

00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:03.034
and setting the records.

00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:03.867
- This boat's unique,

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:07.643
because it's the fastest
in the world. (laughs)

00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:10.127
- [Narrator] With wind in
their sails, the Comanche team

00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:13.674
set their sights on sailing's
most prestigious prize,

00:05:13.674 --> 00:05:15.757
the transatlantic record.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.657
- Stan Honey is a legend in our sport.

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:23.288
When you think of all
the great navigators,

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:25.460
Stan is one of those guys right at the top

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.092
of the list who comes to mind.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:28.256
The amount of work that he puts into it,

00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:29.604
to make these attempts happen,

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.164
without him, it wouldn't happen.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.826
- So, uh, the transatlantic monohull record is

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:38.444
probably the most prestigious
sailing record of any.

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:41.060
- [Narrator] In 1905,
the transatlantic record

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.514
was first set by the schooner, Atlantic.

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:47.873
It took her 12 days and
four hours to cross,

00:05:47.873 --> 00:05:50.956
a benchmark that stood for 100 years.

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:56.758
Since then, only four boats
have improved on her record.

00:05:56.758 --> 00:05:58.841
- [Ken] The current project
we're setting out to do

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:01.138
is to try to set the monohull record

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:03.533
for the fastest transatlantic passage.

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.027
That record is currently set at

00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:07.694
six days, 17 hours, by Mari-Cha.

00:06:11.927 --> 00:06:15.103
- Mari-Cha did as well
as any boat could do

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:19.020
in that tactic, where you're
gonna have to use two systems

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.818
to get across the ocean.

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.536
So what we were trying to do

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:26.490
was to take an entirely
different approach,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.559
which nobody had ever
done before in a monohull,

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.922
but take a single system
all the way across.

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:33.285
- You know, he watches the weather,
just religiously,

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:34.987
looking for all these small little things

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:36.982
that might happen.

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:40.373
- I had access to 11 years
of historical weather data,

00:06:40.373 --> 00:06:42.631
so I routed Comanche every six hours

00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:46.445
for each of the last 11 years,
from June through November,

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:47.278
and what I discovered was

00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:51.279
that there was only two
possibilities per year, on average,

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.879
where Comanche could stay
ahead of a southwesterly storm

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.865
the whole way across.

00:06:57.865 --> 00:06:59.683
- You can't take the ocean for granted.

00:06:59.683 --> 00:07:02.583
This is man against ocean, this
is man against the elements.

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:04.848
If I've learned anything,
you start to just

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:09.015
get a little cocky in the
ocean and it'll bite you, hard.

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:11.936
- [Narrator] July, 2016.

00:07:13.096 --> 00:07:16.987
Stan Honey spots a moving
low in the westerlies,

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:20.986
potentially favorable
for an Atlantic crossing.

00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:23.895
Within a day, the
international Comanche team

00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:28.062
is assembled in New York City,
waiting for a green light.

00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:32.224
- It was kind of a cruel turn of fate

00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:34.930
that it turned out that the
perfect weather had evolved

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.276
at a time when Kenny couldn't join us.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:39.230
- For Ken, it just came at a period where

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.624
he had a prior commitment
with the America's Cup,

00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:43.748
but that's the nature of weather.

00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:45.168
- [Narrator] If Comanche launches,

00:07:45.168 --> 00:07:48.867
Captain Casey Smith will
take the helm as skipper.

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:53.034
- Iâ€™ll (expletive) my pants to start with. (laughs)

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.970
- But at that point, Kenny
knew just how hard it is

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.717
to find these opportunities, and said,

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:02.675
"Okay, well, I can't make
it, but you guys gotta go."

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:04.655
- To be able to be told that,

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:06.633
"Hey, you're gonna be the guy in charge,"

00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:09.607
and I was really, really
happy to be in that position

00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:11.359
and trusted like that.

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:14.027
- Casey is an enormously
experienced sailor,

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.042
and he was the boat
captain, so he's the guy

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:18.513
in charge of moving the
boat around between events,

00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:21.137
so nobody knows the
boat better than Casey.

00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:25.084
- Casey in the pit, Nick Dana at the rig.

00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:27.513
- The transatlantic was a
very interesting one for us,

00:08:27.513 --> 00:08:30.317
because we had three false starts.

00:08:30.317 --> 00:08:32.211
You're waiting for that exact window

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.965
and you have to be ready at any moment,

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:36.415
so your life's pretty much on hold.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.555
At this point, we're not that confident

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:40.918
that this was actually, the one.

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:43.944
- We are getting constant
information from Stan.

00:08:43.944 --> 00:08:48.575
- We wanna start as close
as we can to the front,

00:08:48.575 --> 00:08:50.549
but ahead of the thunderstorms,

00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:52.626
because if the thunderstorms catch us,

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.508
you guys know what happens.

00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:57.353
- [Nick] It felt like a bit
like launch day for NASA,

00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:00.793
where you're waitin'
for that exact window,

00:09:00.793 --> 00:09:02.741
and you have to be ready at any moment.

00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:03.862
- [Stan] This is the...

00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:06.467
put yourself in harm's
way to try to do something

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.634
that nobody else has ever done before.

00:09:11.616 --> 00:09:12.953
- [Casey] And then when
we pushed off the dock

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.814
and started motoring out,
that's when it really was like,

00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:18.908
"Wow, we're doin' it, we're gonna go!"

00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:19.741
Amazing.

00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:28.474
(tense music)

00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:30.826
- It's real, it's happening.

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:33.898
We positioned ourselves about a mile away

00:09:33.898 --> 00:09:36.678
from the Ambrose Light,
which gives us enough runway

00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:39.678
to hit the start line at full speed.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.567
We had the sail combination
that we wanted to use,

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:48.806
we had the perfect wind,
it was time to let it rip.

00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:52.555
- [Nick] The acceleration,
doing 25 knots to 30 knots,

00:09:52.555 --> 00:09:53.396
- Honey!

00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:55.017
Oh, this is perfect, guys.

00:09:55.017 --> 00:09:57.526
- [Nick] Doing that jump in
such a short amount of time

00:09:57.526 --> 00:09:58.956
can often put you on your butt.

00:09:58.956 --> 00:10:00.373
- Copy, 16:58.16.

00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:05.940
- And we came past the
Ambrose Light fully lit up.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.473
Everyone gave a huge hoot and holler

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:11.928
as we went past the start
line, and off we went.

00:10:11.928 --> 00:10:13.133
(wake hissing)

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:16.800
(dramatic drum-heavy music)

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.012
And, it's pretty radical.

00:10:26.012 --> 00:10:27.902
You've got all the sail area up,

00:10:27.902 --> 00:10:29.846
you've got all the power
in the world you need,

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:32.524
so, you know, for a start,
you don't want to mess it up.

00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:36.691
(wake hissing)
(dramatic music)

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:48.561
- New York's there, England
is there, 3,100 miles now.

00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:51.478
We're gonna knock this bastard off.

00:11:00.383 --> 00:11:01.216
(thunder rumbles)
(wake hisses)

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:02.288
- [Narrator] But just as they're off,

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.418
things take a dangerous turn,

00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:08.132
as Comanche tangles with a
formidable thunder storm.

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:09.480
- The worst part of it,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.356
the most dangerous part, weather-wise,

00:11:11.356 --> 00:11:16.024
was actually the first
night and that next morning.

00:11:16.024 --> 00:11:17.145
- We started ahead of a front,

00:11:17.145 --> 00:11:20.010
and the thunder storms preceding the front

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.419
came out earlier than expected,

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:24.637
and kinda gobbled us up,
which was unexpected,

00:11:24.637 --> 00:11:27.730
and you know, we definitely
had to change our plan,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.563
adapt on the go,

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.974
sail a course that we
weren't expecting to sail,

00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:33.465
and the first thing in my mind is,

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:34.436
"Is it over?

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:35.347
"Are we done?

00:11:35.347 --> 00:11:38.467
"Are we sailing home and
going on standby again?"

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:40.153
- [Narrator] For hours, the team battles

00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:41.926
through the wind and waves

00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:44.616
of the unforeseen lightning squall.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.557
- You know, you can't
control the lightning.

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:48.459
The lightning does what it wants to do,

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:50.560
and so you basically just
put that out of your mind

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.963
and focus on the sailing.

00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:56.081
You focus on what you can control.

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.378
- I thought it was over.

00:11:57.378 --> 00:12:00.428
When the thunderstorms came, I
thought it was actually over.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.414
But luckily, we were able to find

00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:06.132
a little narrow bit of
breeze, up close to land,

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:07.132
and escaped.

00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:10.577
- And we managed to just
wiggle our way out of it

00:12:10.577 --> 00:12:12.077
and, uh, keep on going.

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:17.870
- Well, tough morning, day two.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.269
The thunder storms, which were brewed up

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:23.044
over the Central America,

00:12:23.044 --> 00:12:24.647
came out and got us.

00:12:24.647 --> 00:12:26.314
Now we've popped out the other side,

00:12:26.314 --> 00:12:28.901
and we're back in the forecast winds.

00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:29.993
- [Interviewer] Looking good?

00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:33.313
- So we're heading east at pace.

00:12:33.313 --> 00:12:35.171
- It's probably closer
to a dive expedition.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.688
We spend a lot of time underwater.

00:12:37.688 --> 00:12:39.687
All of our gear is our
only line of defense

00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:42.235
from becoming totally saturated,

00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:43.890
turning into a giant raisin.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.407
- You've got 18 guys onboard,

00:12:45.407 --> 00:12:47.389
and it's for 5-1/2 days,

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:48.914
so it's pretty tight quarters,

00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:50.593
even though it is a 100-foot boat.

00:12:50.593 --> 00:12:51.944
You're sharing bunks, sharing bowls,

00:12:51.944 --> 00:12:53.794
you're sharing water bottles

00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:56.127
for drinking and everything.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.678
- This race we just did a
simple four-on, four-off,

00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:04.761
you know, traditional watch system.

00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:07.164
- [Casey] That's a challenge
in itself, you know,

00:13:07.164 --> 00:13:08.247
waking up every four hours

00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:09.823
to come on deck and do your watch.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.082
- No, you're off the lock!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.299
- [Casey] And then off you go again.

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:13.942
You might sleep for
three hours out of that

00:13:13.942 --> 00:13:15.642
when you're down, when you've eaten.

00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:17.801
- [Nick] If you're lucky, you
get your four hours off watch,

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.937
but you never miss your
four hours on deck.

00:13:19.937 --> 00:13:22.739
- When you're off watch, you
gotta do everything else.

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.451
That's when you gotta do the cooking,

00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:26.745
do the tidying up, do the eating,

00:13:26.745 --> 00:13:29.532
and try to get some sleep.

00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:32.288
The four hours goes by pretty darn quick.

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:34.652
- So, you have your helmsmen, who are...

00:13:34.652 --> 00:13:36.255
They'll drive the boat for two hours.

00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:37.724
You've got your trimmers of the sails,

00:13:37.724 --> 00:13:40.547
who are basically the engine,
making the boat go fast.

00:13:40.547 --> 00:13:43.142
- So I'm one of the bright individuals

00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:44.946
that is on the front of the boat,

00:13:44.946 --> 00:13:46.522
that's basically taking on

00:13:46.522 --> 00:13:48.681
a lot of the dangerous situations.

00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:51.582
Up front, we deal with all
the sails going up and down.

00:13:51.582 --> 00:13:53.477
- [Casey] And then you've
got a lot of the guys

00:13:53.477 --> 00:13:55.614
who are required for the
muscles and everything,

00:13:55.614 --> 00:13:57.256
to pull those sails in.

00:13:57.256 --> 00:13:59.640
- The more prestigious of the records

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.678
are set by boats where
all of the sail handling

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:05.122
is done with human power.

00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:06.908
- We have six grinding pedestals,

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:10.712
so we have to pull any
sails up or trim them in.

00:14:10.712 --> 00:14:13.950
We have 12 guys just going at it,

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.303
until, you know, the trimmer's
happy or, you know, the sail's up.

00:14:18.303 --> 00:14:20.090
- [Casey] You're working
the sails, you're grinding,

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.712
you're steering, you're always sort of losing,

00:14:21.712 --> 00:14:25.129
losing, losing, losing against the, the sleep.

00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:28.883
- [Stan] There's no place I'd rather be,

00:14:28.883 --> 00:14:33.167
even though, it's a terrible
place in a lot of respects.

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:37.596
- Oh, I wish I had new boots. (laughs)

00:14:37.596 --> 00:14:41.763
(wake hissing)
(crew chatting)

00:14:55.573 --> 00:14:58.194
- Being onboard Comanche in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean

00:14:58.194 --> 00:15:01.541
is something that, you realize
how small you are out there.

00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:03.909
You realize that you're a speck.

00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:06.492
Personally, I love the silence.

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:10.131
You know, when you're
flying an airplane across

00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:12.064
and you look down, you're
never gonna see us.

00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:13.043
It's huge.

00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:15.891
You know, if we were to lose all
communications and everything,

00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.808
you'll have a hard time finding us.

00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:25.995
- Another thing that you
tend to notice early on

00:15:25.995 --> 00:15:27.950
is how big the ocean is.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.354
You know, if you're sailing around the world,

00:15:29.354 --> 00:15:32.742
you can just sail for day,
after day, after day, after day,

00:15:32.742 --> 00:15:35.302
even on a really fast boat.

00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.987
- You have a lot of time to
think, when you're out there.

00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:39.810
The day slows down a lot.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.462
You're living every hour.

00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:44.295
(water splashing)

00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:50.938
- It's kinda cool to just disconnect,

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:54.193
and you're out there, in the elements,

00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:56.276
the wind and the waves...

00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:00.657
It's nothing like it, it's crazy.

00:16:02.737 --> 00:16:04.410
- You have a lot of time to reflect on

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.012
everything in your life, but as well,

00:16:07.012 --> 00:16:09.547
you have a lot of time to appreciate

00:16:09.547 --> 00:16:10.797
where you are in the world.

00:16:10.797 --> 00:16:12.502
All of us were

00:16:12.502 --> 00:16:15.000
definitely captivated by
the sea at that point.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.306
- It's amazing.

00:16:16.306 --> 00:16:18.719
- You get the clouds getting
lower, and lower, and lower,

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:20.614
and the sky turns more and more gray,

00:16:20.614 --> 00:16:24.152
and then you get this sort of
drizzle, as it starts to rain,

00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:26.805
and that's what we had, all
the way across the ocean.

00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:29.388
Just kind of this gray drizzle.

00:16:31.376 --> 00:16:33.137
- Things move differently

00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:35.367
compared to other keeled
boats I've sailed on.

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:37.877
One minute you're doing 10 miles an hour,

00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:39.982
and then you blink, and honestly,

00:16:39.982 --> 00:16:42.162
you're up to 20 to 30 miles an hour.

00:16:42.162 --> 00:16:43.556
- The thing's a weapon.

00:16:43.556 --> 00:16:47.090
It just goes forever, and it's
not a really short awesome,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.076
but things being awesome for days on end.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:53.576
(tense music)

00:16:58.277 --> 00:17:01.599
- Okay, guys, there's ice
contours we're keeping track of.

00:17:01.599 --> 00:17:02.532
- [Narrator] Day three,

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:05.336
Comanche faces its greatest obstacle,

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:09.503
navigating through an area
known to have icebergs.

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:14.562
- There was a very small
patch of south-westerly

00:17:14.562 --> 00:17:17.012
that we had to stay in,
and that patch of wind

00:17:17.012 --> 00:17:19.562
took us right through an area

00:17:19.562 --> 00:17:22.370
where there was known to be ice.

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.540
(tense throbbing music)

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.780
- Couldn't see more than

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.061
100-feet in front of the boat.

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:29.903
Fully engulfed in fog.

00:17:29.903 --> 00:17:30.933
You know, doing 20 knots,

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:33.685
100-feet isn't enough
warning to avoid the ice.

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:34.897
- And it sounds crazy,

00:17:34.897 --> 00:17:37.478
to have guys on deck keeping
a careful watch for icebergs

00:17:37.478 --> 00:17:40.076
when you can't even see the bow,

00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:43.835
but a funny thing happens when
you get close to an iceberg.

00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:46.548
The icebergs are just unbelievably white

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:48.601
that they appear to glow.

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:50.322
You know, you're sailing along and the pea soup fog

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:52.250
suddenly gets a little bit clearer,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.835
and then a part of the
horizon looks funny,

00:17:54.835 --> 00:17:56.780
'cause it looks like it's glowing.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.204
- The consequence of hitting icebergs

00:17:58.204 --> 00:18:00.375
is so severe and it's like you just

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:01.333
turn it out of your mind.

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:06.206
We just canâ€™t. You prepare for it, but
if it happens, it happens.

00:18:06.206 --> 00:18:07.759
- On the leeward side of an iceberg,

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:10.785
you can get these small
bits of ice called growlers.

00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:12.477
They're too small to see on radar.

00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:14.722
You know, they're like the
size of a pick-up truck.

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:17.211
If it hit the boat exactly wrong,

00:18:17.211 --> 00:18:19.728
it's potential, that it
could punch a big enough hole

00:18:19.728 --> 00:18:22.561
into the boat, so that
the boat could sink.

00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:23.581
- To be fair, it's hard to sleep

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:25.308
when you're off watch and go down below,

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:27.120
because you know the other
watch is going through

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.918
exactly the same thing, so
it's a little bit nervous.

00:18:29.918 --> 00:18:31.933
Not my favorite part of sailing.

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:33.701
I don't like it, yeah.

00:18:33.701 --> 00:18:35.016
- That's why, when we sleep down below,

00:18:35.016 --> 00:18:36.999
we sleep with our feet forward,

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:40.493
so if you stop suddenly,
your feet'll take the impact,

00:18:40.493 --> 00:18:41.660
not your head.

00:18:43.613 --> 00:18:45.401
- Hey guys, we're out of the area

00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:47.237
that there are known to be icebergs,

00:18:47.237 --> 00:18:50.544
and we've got 20 minutes
till we're out of the area

00:18:50.544 --> 00:18:54.211
where there's any
possibility of an iceberg.

00:19:00.736 --> 00:19:03.817
- Yeah, right now, by the GPS

00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:07.734
we're at 22 miles, a
little over an hour to go.

00:19:11.357 --> 00:19:12.733
- We knew we were on the pace.

00:19:12.733 --> 00:19:14.900
We knew that the time was right.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.206
(winches ticking)

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:19.533
- And a lot of transatlantic records fail

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:20.546
right at the finish.

00:19:20.546 --> 00:19:22.470
Boats get within a hundred
mile of the finish,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.207
and then they stop, due to the light air.

00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:27.561
And I knew, once we were
2/3 of the way across,

00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:29.067
that that wasn't gonna happen,

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.912
that that low was powerful
enough to push that ridge

00:19:31.912 --> 00:19:35.933
and we were gonna have
good breeze all the way in.

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.496
- [Interviewer] What are you looking for?

00:19:37.496 --> 00:19:39.049
- Land, yeah.

00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:40.554
We're looking for the Lizard.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.200
Should be on the bow, about 10 miles,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.117
can't quite see it yet.

00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:48.274
- And the finish is off
the Lizard Lighthouse

00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:50.024
in southwest England.

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:54.667
- Now!
(cheering)

00:19:55.698 --> 00:19:58.755
- [Casey] Thank you very
much, mate, good on ya!

00:19:58.755 --> 00:20:01.341
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:04.596
- Essentially, we had crushed the record.

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:07.489
- The goal was to improve
Mari-Cha's record by a day.

00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:11.832
We were able to improve it
by one day, three hours.

00:20:11.832 --> 00:20:15.660
We pioneered a completely new tactic,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.560
which is the tactic of
doing it in a single system.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.200
And it was just barely possible to do that

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.059
with a boat like Comanche,
and I don't think

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:26.090
it would have been possible

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.399
with a monohull that was any slower.

00:20:28.399 --> 00:20:30.410
- This boat was built to do that.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.303
It did it.

00:20:31.303 --> 00:20:33.053
We're all very happy.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.074
- It's such a special thing,

00:20:38.074 --> 00:20:40.177
to be able to break this
transatlantic record.

00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:41.380
Huge thanks to the weather gods

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.772
to allow us to do it, as well,

00:20:42.772 --> 00:20:44.591
'cause that what it really took.

00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:47.332
- I'm happy, I'm tired! (laughs)

00:20:47.332 --> 00:20:48.776
- I think, for everyone in the crew

00:20:48.776 --> 00:20:51.243
it was something they're real proud of,

00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:52.964
because these records live forever.

00:20:52.964 --> 00:20:54.214
- [All] Hooray!

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.941
- A record like the transatlantic record

00:20:56.941 --> 00:21:00.135
is one of the most prestigious
events in all of sailing.

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.585
Even if somebody beats our record,

00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:05.167
it'll always show that Comanche
took one day, three hours

00:21:05.167 --> 00:21:07.052
off the previous one.

00:21:07.052 --> 00:21:10.885
(laid-back synthesized music)

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.017
(fireworks whistling and cracking)
