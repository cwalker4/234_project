00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:10.419
STEVE: WHEN I SPOKE WITH A

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.724
BACKDROP, OUR CONVERSATION

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:16.458
FOCUSED ON JOBS AND RESCALING

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:17.059
THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.826
THE OTHER IMPORTANT PART FOCUSED

00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:18.227
ON FAMILIES.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:19.862
WATCH.

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:20.596
&gt;&gt; THESE POLICIES ARE WORKING

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:22.498
AND WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.101
JOBS WERE THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:26.869
AND THOSE OF PEOPLE WERE TRYING

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.202
TO HELP.

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:30.205
WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO HELP WITH

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:30.939
OUR WORKING FAMILY AGENDA BY

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.107
RECOGNIZING THE REALITIES OF

00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:35.944
MODERN WORKING FAMILIES IN THE

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:36.678
ENORMOUS COST OF CHILDCARE FOR

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.614
THOSE FAMILIES AND THE NECESSITY

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.784
OF CHILDCARE TO FAMILIES WHO

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:47.189
NEED TWO INCOMES OR ARE SINGLE

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.523
PARENTS.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:48.958
THEN OF COURSE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:49.959
CHILDREN OF CHILDCARE IN EARLY

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.632
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.767
STEVE: THERE'S A LOT OF

00:00:57.768 --> 00:00:58.801
SUBSTANCE HERE BUT LET'S PUT UP

00:00:58.802 --> 00:00:59.735
THE ELEMENTS OF IVANKA TRUMP'S

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:07.443
PROFAMILY AGENDA, DOUBLING THE

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:08.310
CHILD TAX CREDIT, PUSHING FOR

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.311
PAID PARENTAL LEAVE AND WANT TO

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:10.279
SHOW YOU HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.380
BUT ONE OF THE CENTRAL POINT IN

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.114
A MESSAGE WAS UPWARD MOBILITY.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:12.648
LOOK AT THIS DATA.

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.949
IT ANALYZES SOCIAL MOBILITY BY

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.051
FAMILY STABILITY.

00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:18.587
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ONE IT IS A

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:20.422
REALLY IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON

00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:21.891
BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE.

00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:24.493
IF YOU LOOK THERE THAT THE

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:29.865
MARRIAGE RATES KEEP PARENTS

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.933
TOGETHER DEPENDING ON WHETHER

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:31.834
THEY ARE COHABITING OR MARRIED

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.036
IS A HUGE FACTOR.

00:01:34.037 --> 00:01:37.773
74% OF MARRIED PARENTS STAY

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:39.675
TOGETHER COMPARED TO 24% FOR

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:40.676
COUPLES WHO ARE COHABITING.

00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:43.546
GET THE DATA WHO IS RISING UP

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:44.714
AND CAN SCALE IT TURNS OUT

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:48.851
SOMEONE BORN IN THE BOTTOM 20%

00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.821
OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION, IF

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:52.689
THE PARENTS ARE NOT MARRIED AND

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.525
THEY WILL BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:57.660
STAY THERE.

00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.161
50% THEY THERE.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.962
IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE COMPARED

00:01:59.963 --> 00:02:05.668
TO PEOPLE BORN IN A FAMILY WITH

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:06.369
A STABLE PARENTAL BACKGROUND.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.337
FAMILY POLICY IS NOT SOFT,

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:10.840
SEPARATE THINGS BUT RIGHT AT THE

00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:16.479
HEART OF JOBS AND A COMIC IN ITS

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.280
FANTASTIC TO SEE THE

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:18.014
ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES IN A

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:18.515
SUBSTANTIVE WAY.

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:21.217
JOINING US TO DISCUSS THIS,

00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:21.885
EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:23.953
FEDERALIST AND FELLOW FOR THE

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.488
HEARTLAND INSTITUTE.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.792
WE JUST INTRODUCED BY TERKEL

00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:32.395
CARLSON AND THEN I'VE BEEN

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:33.163
VORACIOUSLY CONSUMING EVERYTHING

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:33.963
EVEN WRITING AND I LOVE IT.

00:02:33.964 --> 00:02:36.266
ONE PARTICULAR THING THAT I WANT

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:37.433
TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT WITCHES A

00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:40.270
PIECE YOU WROTE ABOUT HOW YOU

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:44.941
CAN COMBINE WHAT MOTHERS WANT TO

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:46.276
DO WHICH IS BE THERE FOR THEIR

00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:46.976
CHILDREN BUT ALSO MEET THEIR

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:49.179
DESIRE TO BE IN THE WORKFORCE

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.280
WITH MUCH MORE POSSIBLE WORKING

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:51.548
ARRANGEMENTS.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.149
TALK ABOUT THAT.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:06.530
&gt;&gt; SURE, I FOUND PARTICULARLY IN

00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:07.998
MY OWN LIFE AS I HAD CHILDREN

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.199
AND I HAVE FIVE, IT'S A

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.933
WONDERFUL BLESSING TO FIND

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:10.601
EMPLOYERS FOR FLEXIBLE AND

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:11.735
WILLING TO WORK WITH ME BECAUSE

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.170
THEY VALUE MY SKILLS AS A WORKER

00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:14.271
AS WELL AS THE AS A WHOLE

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:14.605
PERSON.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:15.806
I'M A MOTHER AND COMMITTED TO MY

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:16.173
CHILDREN.

00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:17.207
I MISS SPENDING A LARGE PORTION

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:18.642
OF MY DATE WITH MY CHILDREN AND

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:19.743
I HAVE A ONE -YEAR-OLD, THREE,

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:20.577
FIVE -YEAR-OLD INTO OLDER

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:21.045
SCHOOL-AGE KIDS.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:22.613
I KNOW THEY NEED ME TO BE THERE

00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:31.722
WITH THEM TO HAVE AN OPTIMAL

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:32.122
DEVELOPMENT.

00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:32.756
MY EMPLOYERS HAVE LOVELY

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:33.724
FLEXIBLE WORK AND I WORK NIGHTS

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:34.792
AND WEEKENDS IN COUPLE HOURS A

00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:35.993
WEEK WITH A BABYSITTER AND THAT

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:37.261
ALLOWED ME TO DO TWO THINGS I

00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:37.561
LOVE.

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:38.195
MORE EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:39.163
THINKING ABOUT THAT AND WHEN WE

00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:40.097
HEAR THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT

00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:50.908
WOMEN THEY FOCUS ON WEIRD THINGS

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:51.809
LIKE FREEZING THEIR EGGS THAT

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.610
CAN HAVE DAMAGE TO WOMEN'S

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.878
BODIES AND THINK IT DAMAGES THE

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:54.645
CULTURE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:55.780
DOESN'T SAY TO THEM AND WE VALUE

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.981
YOU AS YOU ARE AND WOMEN MAKE

00:03:56.982 --> 00:03:58.182
BABIES AND THAT IS OKAY AND LOVE

00:03:58.183 --> 00:03:59.117
THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR

00:03:59.118 --> 00:03:59.450
SOCIETY.

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:00.218
THERE ARE PROFAMILY AND PRO-

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.985
WOMEN WAYS AND ANTI- FAMILY AND

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:01.819
ANTI- WAYS OF ARRANGING WORK.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.320
WE SHOW SUPPORT.

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.756
STEVE: SARAH, TO FOLLOW FROM

00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:09.994
THAT WE JUST SAW ALTHOUGH I

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:10.928
PRAISED HER TECH POLICY ALONG

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.497
WITH WORN HEAD OF POLICY ON

00:04:12.498 --> 00:04:13.397
CHILDCARE THAT SOUNDED NOT AT

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:17.802
ALL THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE

00:04:17.803 --> 00:04:21.472
MOVING.

00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:22.240
&gt;&gt; THAT CERTAINLY IS THE DEBATE.

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:23.174
JOY BRINGS UP SOMETHING THAT IS

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:23.908
DEAR TO MY HEART.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:24.809
I HAVE A FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE AND

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.577
WE HAD CHILDREN AND SIX CHILDREN

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:27.912
FROM OLDER TO YOUNGER AND HAVE

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:36.954
TO TAKE CARE OF MANAGING THEM

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:38.456
AND AS A MOM AND I HAVE A

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:39.357
FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE I'VE CHOSEN AT

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:40.625
THIS POINT IN MY CAREER TO GO

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:41.659
INDEPENDENT AND WORK HERE WITH

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.830
FOX AS A CONTRIBUTOR TO DO MY

00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:46.964
WRITING BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:48.065
THIS DEBATE ON THE SCALE FOR

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:49.167
WOMEN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'M

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:49.867
ALSO THINKING REALISTICALLY.

00:04:49.868 --> 00:04:50.802
I SPOKE EARLIER WHEN WE TALKED

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:51.602
ABOUT MY MOTHER AND AFTER MY

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:52.770
FATHER PASSED AWAY SHE BECAME A

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:56.174
SINGLE MOM AND ENDED UP WORKING

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:57.409
AND DID NOT HAVE A COLLEGE

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.243
DEGREE BUT WORKED IN A FACTORY

00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:04.149
FOR A WHILE AND PUTTING AIRPLANE

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.950
PARTS TOGETHER BUT REMEMBER HOW

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.184
DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FIND THAT

00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:07.152
TIME TO BALANCE CHILDREN IN THE

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:09.354
RIGHT JOBS TO BALANCE BOTH OF

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:14.660
US, MY BROTHER AND I AS WELL AS

00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:15.794
HER JOB IN BRINGING MONEY AND

00:05:15.795 --> 00:05:17.129
SUPPORTING US SO WE WOULD HAVE A

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.164
LIFE.

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:20.532
I THINK WHAT JOY IS SAYING IS SO

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:20.832
TRUE.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:24.970
WERE AT A NEW LEVEL IN SOCIETY

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.371
OR WE HAVE TO HONOR WOMEN AS

00:05:26.372 --> 00:05:27.973
WELL AS WHAT WE CAN DO TO MOVE

00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:31.810
THEM FORWARD IN THE WORKPLACE BY

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.744
HONORING WHO WE ARE AND OUR

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:33.845
BODIES ON THE ABILITY TO HAVE

00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:34.680
CHILDREN BUT LOOK AT OTHER

00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:35.013
ISSUES.

00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:35.947
I DON'T AGREE WITH ELIZABETH

00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:37.149
WARREN'S PLANS ON USING THE

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.017
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:42.955
STEVE: SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF BUT

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.022
HENRY, I LIKE YOUR POLITICAL

00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:47.359
TAKE ON THIS.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.260
THAT AGENDA CHILDCARE, CHILD TAX

00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:51.430
CREDIT IS NOT TRADITIONAL

00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:53.332
REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE POLICY.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:53.966
I WOULD SAY IT'S POSITIVE

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.534
POPULISM.

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:56.502
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING

00:05:56.503 --> 00:06:05.711
THAT FAMILIES TALK ABOUT AROUND

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:06.245
THE DINNER TABLE.

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:06.979
SORT OF THING REPUBLICANS HAVE

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.713
BEEN AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:08.047
NEED TO.

00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:08.714
YOU TALK ABOUT BLUE-COLLAR

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:09.448
FAMILIES WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP FOR

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.182
REPUBLICAN AND THEY NEED THAT

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:12.952
FLEXIBILITY OR COULD BENEFIT

00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:13.686
FROM MORE CHILD TAX CREDITS AND

00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:17.189
THE WAY SHE WANTS.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.923
TALKING TO MODERATE EDUCATED

00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:18.691
MOMS WOULD ALSO BLUE-COLLAR MOMS

00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:22.695
AND DADS THAT THIS IS EXACTLY

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:23.429
WHERE REPUBLICANS NEED TO BE

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.096
TALKING AND HAVE NOT BEEN

00:06:24.097 --> 00:06:24.797
TALKING AND SHE'S HELPING TO

00:06:24.798 --> 00:06:26.165
LEAD THE WAY.

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:26.832
&gt;&gt; I THINK WERE HAVING AN

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:35.141
ELITIST CONVERSATION SO THE

00:06:35.142 --> 00:06:35.942
MAJORITY OF KIDS DON'T GET TO GO

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:36.575
OFF IN TWO-PARENT HOMES.

00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:37.343
AT THE MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION

00:06:37.344 --> 00:06:39.378
AND SAD BUT THE THOUGHT THAT

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:40.179
EVERY AMERICAN GOING UP OR HAVE

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.980
A HUSBAND TO SUPPORT THEM IS NOT

00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:41.380
REALITY.

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.016
STEVE: WE HAVE THE DATA ON THAT.

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:44.750
IT'S APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE

00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:45.885
YOU GOT HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE

00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:48.254
WOMEN ARE THE EARNER.

00:06:48.255 --> 00:06:51.290
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I LIKE IVANKA

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.993
PUSHING FOR PARENTAL LEAVE.

00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:54.727
I WOULD SAY THE GIG ECONOMY IS

00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:57.296
NOT ABOUT WOMEN BUT THE DAD WHO

00:06:57.297 --> 00:06:58.030
WANTS TO STAY AT HOME BUT THE

00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:59.565
REALITY IS A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:04.103
IS THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:07:04.104 --> 00:07:04.837
GROWING UP IN SINGLE PARENT

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:08.041
HOMES IS GREATER THEN MARRIED

00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:08.574
HOMES AT THIS POINT.

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:09.242
MARRIAGE HAS BECOME AN ELITE

00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:10.410
INSTITUTION AND THAT IS NOT GOOD

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:12.645
FOR SOCIETY.

00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:13.246
STEVE: IS A HUGE ISSUE.

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:16.382
I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE FINAL

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:17.150
WORD BECAUSE THAT'S AT THE HEART

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:17.483
OF THIS.

00:07:17.484 --> 00:07:20.987
YOU CLOSE OUT.

00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:21.687
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS MISSING FROM THE

00:07:21.688 --> 00:07:26.526
CONVERSATION WERE HAVING ABOUT

00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:27.260
DAYCARE AND PAID LEAVE IS THE

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:27.994
FACT THAT IT'S AND COMFORTABLE

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:28.728
THE YOUNG CHILDREN NEED THEIR

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:30.797
MOTHER TO FOCUS ON THEIR

00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:31.297
ENERGIES ON THEM.

00:07:31.298 --> 00:07:31.931
THAT IS SOMETHING NEITHER

00:07:31.932 --> 00:07:34.434
DAYCARE CAN PROVIDE A CHILD BUT

00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:35.001
THE CHILD'S EMOTIONAL

00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:36.836
DEVELOPMENT AND CHILD

00:07:36.837 --> 00:07:37.804
INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:40.506
THEIR SENSE OF SECURITY FOR THE

00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:44.844
REST OF THEIR LIFE IS CREATED BY

00:07:44.845 --> 00:07:45.611
HAVING MOM FOCUSING ON THEM FOR

00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:46.345
THE FIRST THREE, FIVE YEARS OF

00:07:46.346 --> 00:07:47.513
LIFE AND THAT IS SUBSIDIZING

00:07:47.514 --> 00:07:50.683
FAMILY SEPARATION TO DAYCARE AND

00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:51.617
OTHER POLICIES BUT WE NEED TO

00:07:51.618 --> 00:08:00.326
FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING FAMILIES

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:01.060
AND FAMILIES BEING RESPONSIBLE

00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:01.794
FOR THEIR OWN KIDS INDICATING

00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:02.395
THAT MESSAGE OTHER THAN

00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:03.096
SUBSIDIZING FAMILY SEPARATION

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:05.531
BUT THAT'S ONLY BAD FOR KIDS AND

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:06.232
THE SOCIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:06.966
RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THAT.

00:08:06.967 --> 00:08:07.667
THAT'S BEEN MISSING FROM THE

00:08:07.668 --> 00:08:09.702
HIGH LEVEL AMORTIZATION.

00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:11.838
YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE CARE FOR

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:14.073
CHILDREN AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE.

00:08:14.074 --> 00:08:16.843
&gt;&gt; YOU PUT IT ON THE AGENDA.

00:08:16.844 --> 00:08:17.510
JOY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:20.280
TALKING TO YOU MORE ABOUT THIS
