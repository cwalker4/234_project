00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:02.261
- You guys, I'm not even kidding,

00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.104
I found another room in this house.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.129
It's a hidden room that we had no idea

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.010
about until last night.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.517
(creepy music)

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:14.386
This is not a joke,
this is not click bait,

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:15.671
this is for real.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.539
Last night I was taking the trash out

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.828
and I was coming back I
stopped and I was just like,

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:20.685
looking at the house.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.627
I realized there was a
window that had blinds in it.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.719
It looks to me like
that window has blinds,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.159
and if that window has
blinds, then that means

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.306
there's a room.

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:32.306
There's gotta be a room.

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:38.041
Okay, so, if you look here,
we just have this like,

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:41.367
vaulted ceiling thing that
goes above the stairs,

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:44.530
so if there's a place
to walk around up there,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.781
you would have to walk here
or there or I don't know.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.598
Is there two different entrances?

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:51.707
Let's look upstairs.

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:53.827
Here's a door and this
is our communications

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:56.847
closet slash extra mattress room.

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:59.075
The roof here is vaulted,
which means there might

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.729
be some room up there but I'm
not a hundred percent sure.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.550
Okay, so Chell's room is over there,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.884
Atlas' room is over here.

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:07.252
Let's go in Atlas' room.

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:09.585
This room definitely, well..

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.746
Check in here.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.438
It doesn't have any,
okay, there is one, okay.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.024
I've never seen this before, is it locked?

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:22.107
Oh, it's not.

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:25.015
Yeah, we can, I think we can get up there.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:26.817
Ladder!

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:29.515
This should be really interesting.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:31.376
I feel like I should be
wearing like a breather

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:34.969
or something, I mean I could but, nah,

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.110
I'm just gonna take a look first,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.377
then I'll decide.

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:39.975
(creaking)

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.271
(coughs)

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:44.283
Oh there's light!

00:01:44.283 --> 00:01:46.173
Yup there's the window.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:47.652
It doesn't look too bad.

00:01:47.652 --> 00:01:49.411
I don't think I have
to worry so much about

00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:50.555
dust or any crazy stuff.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.995
How's this get out of here?

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:54.995
Some stuff just dropped.

00:01:57.558 --> 00:02:01.308
Oh, hello, some Barbies up here.

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:05.450
And a light switch.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.777
Doesn't do much.

00:02:06.777 --> 00:02:10.488
This is so crazy, you guys,
and it's so hot up here.

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:15.488
Oh my gosh, it's like 75
degrees outside but up here,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.076
uh, it's smoldering.

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.833
Look, it goes all the way back there.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:23.220
You gotta be freaking kidding me!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220
That's gonna be awesome.

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:28.087
I wanna see these first.

00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:30.290
Let's, I don't know if
I wanna even touch them.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.688
What the heck, dude.

00:02:31.688 --> 00:02:33.733
Oh, there's three of them.

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.369
There's another one.

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.039
Now, I need to make my way across.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.369
I can see there's some sort
of possible foot path right

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.896
there but, like, I don't wanna
step through the ceiling.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:48.185
I'm just gonna do this and
pray that I don't fall through.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:53.185
Yup, look at that, there's
the window, yeah were blinds.

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:54.462
Oh look at this.

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:55.462
What's this?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.517
It's like a

00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:01.991
Uh-oh, what was that?

00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:06.098
It's, is it gonna snap me?

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:10.213
(whirling noise)

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:11.380
What the heck?

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:14.057
Something gonna happen?

00:03:14.057 --> 00:03:15.307
Is that a trap?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.770
I don't know if it's a
trap, or something weird.

00:03:23.122 --> 00:03:24.637
I'm not going to get too
close to it, 'cause I have

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.882
no idea what the heck this is.

00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:28.722
So I'm just gonna kinda move past it

00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:32.161
and see if I can look
at it from this side.

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.624
Oh there might be a battery right there.

00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:36.041
But I don't know.

00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:39.629
That is crazy!

00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:42.685
Oh look it's moving.

00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:46.018
Wait, it did it for a second, maybe not.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.360
That is moving.

00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:52.161
So this is a part of something.

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:56.040
Maybe its, maybe its like a clock.

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:59.077
You know what, I think it might be.

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:02.054
It might be some sort
of like old clock part.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:03.973
And if it is, dude, that is impressive.

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.185
It is just going.

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:06.763
Well, I don't think I'm going to get hurt

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.589
if I touch one of these.

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.787
I'll just pick it up, oh it stopped.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:15.798
(creepy music)

00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:17.048
That was weird.

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:22.481
I'm just gonna let that be.

00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:24.708
Uh, sweating bullets, dude.

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.983
Alright this looks like our A/C unit

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:30.566
and those are miniature
replicas of things.

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:32.670
Hmm.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.171
It's like a kid's playset
or something I mean it's all

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.622
nasty and dusty, I don't know
how long it's been up here.

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:39.522
This is what I wanna know.

00:04:39.522 --> 00:04:41.522
(creak)

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.293
Oh.

00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:44.139
(chuckles)

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.136
Oh, oh great, even smaller
miniature replicas of thing

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:51.873
there's like a Coca-Cola and Cheer.

00:04:51.873 --> 00:04:53.142
What is this?

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:53.986
Is there anything else in here?

00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:55.624
Just toys.

00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:57.052
Oh that's disgusting.

00:04:57.052 --> 00:04:57.885
And what's this?

00:04:57.885 --> 00:04:58.846
Look at this.

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:01.559
It's like an old sewing machine
or something, that's neat.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:02.392
(old time music)

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:04.083
Cool little designs.

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.431
It's still creepy but it's cool.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:11.303
Okay, I'm officially soaked,
it is so hot up here.

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:12.997
Well I don't know about all
this stuff being up here,

00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:15.184
I feel like it might be
some sort of fire hazard,

00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:18.519
but at the same time this
thing is not really getting

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.852
hot or anything.

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:23.743
Oh that's been there for a long
time, look at all the dust.

00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:26.174
There's all these light
switches, I just want to hit them

00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:27.369
and see what happens.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.744
At the same time I feel
that if I hit too many light

00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:30.966
switches I'm gonna like
hurt something in the house.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.074
I probably shouldn't touch them.

00:05:32.074 --> 00:05:34.818
It's shocking to me how many
cables there are in this place.

00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:36.443
Like there's cables running
here through this pipe

00:05:36.443 --> 00:05:38.657
and then, like all of those,
I guess that's all the

00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:41.421
communication stuff, but
still that's a lot of cables.

00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:42.566
I'm going to start
making my way outta here.

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:44.968
This is the top of the stairway.

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:46.550
I really thought it would go
all the way up to the ceiling,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.877
but I guess not.

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:50.306
Man I feel like I'm dying
up here with all this heat.

00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:51.333
I need to get out.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.462
I'm going to take this with
me too, that's kinda neat.

00:05:53.462 --> 00:05:56.375
I'll leave the toys,
the toys are whatever.

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.685
Excuse me, again, oops.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.344
(coughing)

00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:01.913
You know just because I'm
going to take these things

00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:03.878
and just wash them off
and give them to Chell.

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:05.797
I gotta get outta here,
there's a lot of dust.

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:10.797
(dramatic music)

00:06:17.405 --> 00:06:19.655
(coughing)

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.972
Maybe I shoulda wore a mask.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:31.791
Alright, let's take a
closer look at this stuff.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.563
Oh, just dinged my table, ouch.

00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:37.461
(comedic music)

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.937
Look at that.

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:41.859
These are some Barbies, here's
a naked Ken, it's for you.

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.511
- What's wrong with him?

00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:46.386
- I don't know, I think it's
just probably from his time.

00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:47.390
And look at this.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.341
- [Kristen] What is that?!

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.827
- [Cory] I think it's a, it
might be like a clock thing.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.043
Dude, I touched it and
it just started running

00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:55.502
and it didn't stop for like
five minutes, (Kristen gasps)

00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:57.065
until I touched it again
and then it stopped

00:06:57.065 --> 00:06:57.898
and it hasn't run since.

00:06:57.898 --> 00:06:58.731
- [Kristen] What?

00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.564
- [Cory] Sorry, sorry.

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:00.397
I don't know what's in there.

00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:03.564
But yeah, let's see if it'll go again.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:07.994
No I swear, it was like
totally running and there's

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.939
like these little things,
and I thought it was gonna,

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:10.772
- Creepy

00:07:10.772 --> 00:07:11.634
- [Cory] It was like a weird contraption

00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:12.692
- [Kristen] It's pretty creepy, dude.

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:13.783
- [Cory] And this Barbie looks like she's

00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:15.008
had the time of her life.

00:07:15.008 --> 00:07:17.538
She's had many, many,
oh look there's a name.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:18.841
A name or a battle scar, I'm not sure.

00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:19.674
(Kristen giggles)

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.442
And look at this guy
over here, he looks like,

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:24.106
he's just so happy, like
he's finally been rescued.

00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:26.393
Like what kinda hair is that?

00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:29.185
That would be 1968 hair.

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:30.029
- [Kristen] Hmm.

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:31.180
- [Cory] Wow.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.772
So how old are the other ones?

00:07:32.772 --> 00:07:36.144
He's not even wearing
underwear, 1968, yeah.

00:07:36.144 --> 00:07:40.927
I'm guessing the same for
this one, 1966 on this one.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.760
- Let's see, um, 1966.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.919
Look how long her hair is, by the way.

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:47.752
- [Cory] That is crazy.

00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:49.325
- Like talk about unrealistic goals,

00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:51.186
(Cory laughs) you know what I mean?

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:52.625
- [Cory] Fun fact, this
Barbie was made my mom was

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.315
as old as Chell.

00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:57.193
Oh, and I found this box up there,

00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:59.578
surrounded by miniature
replicas of things.

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:00.565
- [Kristen] No.

00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:01.398
- Mm hm.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.122
To make it worse, it's up on
the heater thing, the heater

00:08:04.122 --> 00:08:06.178
cooler, A/C, I don't know I'm
not one of those technicians.

00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:07.240
- You didn't grab it?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.073
- [Cory] No.

00:08:08.073 --> 00:08:10.248
Well I, okay, I opened it,
I opened it and there were

00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:13.977
smaller things inside,
it's like it was surrounded

00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:17.604
by evil and the inside was even more evil.

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:19.931
Like how can, what's the evilest of evil?

00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:21.702
It was awful.

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:22.535
- I love it.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.494
- [Cory] It was terrible.

00:08:23.494 --> 00:08:25.532
But yeah I don't know, I feel
like maybe that was a kids

00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:27.040
room at one point and
so like the kids were

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.653
probably be like sneaking up

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:31.760
and I would guess that
the kids are climbing up

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.703
the shelves and then going up there

00:08:33.703 --> 00:08:35.597
and then probably playing at some point.

00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:37.868
But not in the summer
time, because it's hot.

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:38.908
(Kristen laughs)

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:40.473
It is so hot, it musta
been some sort of winter

00:08:40.473 --> 00:08:41.698
thing that they were doing.

00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:43.304
But what's kinda creepy is this house

00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:45.669
was built in what, 199...7

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:46.847
- Seven.

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:47.680
Yeah.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.726
- [Cory] Yeah so, like
what's up with this stuff?

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:52.084
Like 60's dolls, maybe
this was like the parents'

00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:52.917
- [Kristen] Maybe.

00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:53.866
- [Cory] toys or something.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.831
And then this was, just whatever.

00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.664
- [Kristen] I don't know.

00:08:56.664 --> 00:08:57.497
- [Cory] Yeah, kids.

00:08:57.497 --> 00:08:59.332
But yeah, wow.

00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:01.240
I'm really surprised Chell is
still sleeping, by the way.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.513
(Cory coughs)

00:09:02.513 --> 00:09:03.684
- Yeah does it go over
her room, that part?

00:09:03.684 --> 00:09:04.517
- [Cory] Mm hm.

00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:05.350
- Oh.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.462
- [Cory] Sorry, I got
some stuff in my lungs,

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:07.852
I didn't wear a breather.

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:08.685
- Cory!

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:09.539
- [Cory] I know I should of.

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:10.898
I need some water though.

00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:11.900
It's probably all over my face.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.681
I need a shower too, like God.

00:09:14.681 --> 00:09:19.681
(upbeat jazz music)
