00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.500
Game of Thrones Season 7 finally confirmed
one of the biggest secrets in the series – the

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.059
father of Jon Snow is Rhaegar Targaryen.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:16.550
Rhaegar died some fifteen years before the
main story, but he’s an important and mysterious

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.410
character, connected to prophecy, and political
plots, with complex relationships with Lyanna

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.990
Stark and Elia Martell.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.189
Rhaegar’s actions shape the course of the
story – with the fall of House Targaryen

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.530
in Robert’s Rebellion, and the birth of
Jon Snow, to the fate of Westeros in its fight

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.230
against darkness.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.929
So let’s work out who Rhaegar was, and what
he means for the future of Thrones.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.149
Before Tommen and Joffrey and Robert, the
King of Westeros was Aerys Targaryen.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.629
Prince Rhaegar was Aerys’ son and heir – and
he was the brother of Daenerys and Viserys.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.739
Rhaegar was married to Elia Martell – the
sister of Oberyn and Doran – and they had

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.519
two young children, Rhaenys and Aegon.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.930
But one day, at a tournament at Harrenhal,
Rhaegar passed over his wife Elia and crowned

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.719
Lyanna Stark – the sister of Ned Stark – as
Rhaegar’s “queen of love and beauty”,

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.079
when Lyanna was promised to marry Robert Baratheon.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.619
So the Baratheons, Starks, and Martells were
mad about this, and the next year things got

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.950
worse when Rhaegar ran off with Lyanna – and
Robert started a war to get her back . King

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.399
Aerys was killed by Jaime Lannister.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.070
Daenerys and Viserys fled east.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.780
Elia Rhaenys and Aegon were killed by the
Mountain and Amory Lorch . Lyanna died giving

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.619
birth to Jon Snow.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.340
And Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.619
The Targaryen dynasty, who had ruled Westeros
for hundreds of years, was over – Robert

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.649
Baratheon became the new king.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.939
Fifteen years later, the first book begins
and it’s a mystery exactly what happened

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.770
with Rhaegar and Lyanna.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.680
King Robert says that Rhaegar abducted and
raped Lyanna , but in Season 7 we learn that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.829
that’s a “lie” – and that Rhaegar
and Lyanna were in love . There’s this whole

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.159
thing in the books hinting that Lyanna rode
in the Harrenhal tournament in disguise as

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.370
a mystery knight, and Rhaegar was sent to
go find her – which was probably how they

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.370
met.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.280
So they fell in love, secretly got married
, and ran away to this tower in Dorne to have

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.610
sex all day until Rhaegar was forced to the
war with Robert – where he died “with

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.620
Lyanna's name on his lips” , while Lyanna
died in childbirth.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.610
It’s a tragic love story – but it’s
also something more complicated.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.680
Cause Rhaegar risked everything with Lyanna.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.700
He not only left his wife and children – he
started a war that destroyed his family and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.290
his kingdom and his life . And the reasons
behind this go deep into politics, and prophecy,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.920
and the fate of Westeros.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.439
When Rhaegar took Lyanna, he knew he was risking
conflict.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.020
Like, we’re told in the show that the war
was “built” on this “lie” that Rhaegar

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.379
kidnapped Lyanna . But even if people knew
the truth that Lyanna loved Rhaegar, they’d

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.630
still be mad.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.880
Cause this was not a society that let women
choose who they could love.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.930
Lyanna was a political tool that the Baratheons
and Starks were using to build a marriage

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.930
alliance.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.190
By taking Lyanna, Rhaegar ruined those plans.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.819
He also insulted Dorne by rejecting his wife
Elia.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.969
So Rhaegar pissed off three of the most powerful
families in the realm which is never a good

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.409
idea, but it was especially dangerous at that
time.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.200
The political situation was super delicate,
cause the king, Aerys Targaryen, was insane.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.180
By the time of the tourney at Harrenhal, it
was well known that Aerys was mad . He was

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.219
violent and paranoid , obsessed with fire
, burning alive people he thought were his

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.680
enemies . He was a terrible king, and lots
of powerful people wanted him gone.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.549
Tywin Lannister had beef with Aerys, and said
he’d prefer Rhaegar as king . And it’s

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.790
hinted that the Baratheons, Starks, Arryns
and Tullys were forming an alliance against

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.609
Aerys – marrying Lyanna was part of that
. And Rhaegar himself was apparently plotting

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.930
against his father.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.719
We’re told that the whole Tourney of Harrenhal
began as a plot so Rhaegar could conspire

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:18.750
with the great houses to force his dad into
retirement . So Rhaegar was playing the political

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.270
game – he knew how dangerous things were,
and he was carefully scheming to work with

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.880
the houses to peacefully replace the Mad King.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.520
Until he suddenly threw that all away by publicly
crowning Lyanna, insulting the very families

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.030
who could have been allies against Aerys!

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.580
Then by running off with Lyanna, he set off
the chain of events causing war.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.240
The Starks came angry to King’s Landing,
the Mad King killed those Starks, and demanded

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.630
the heads of Robert and Ned.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.910
That was when the war began . And it doesn’t
seem to have much to do with the “lie”

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.250
of an abduction.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.170
It was caused by the tension between King
Aerys and the great houses – which Rhaegar

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.600
not only failed to fix, but made much worse
by taking Lyanna.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.010
Why did Rhaegar take such a terrible risk
at such a dangerous time?

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.490
To understand why, we need to understand Rhaegar
– from the very beginning.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.470
We’re told that Rhaegar was good at everything
that he did . He was smart , and a great warrior

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.370
, he played the harp, he was beautiful . He
was “Able … Determined, deliberate, dutiful

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.390
[and] single-minded” . Jorah calls Rhaegar
“the last dragon” , and says he fought

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.290
“valiantly”, “nobly” and “honourably”
before he “died” . Cersei, as a child,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.490
had a big crush on Rhaegar , and hoped to
marry him . Jon Connington also loves Rhaegar,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.650
his “silver prince” . And Rhaegar was
popular with the common people, who cheered

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.390
him at tournaments . So, on the surface, Rhaegar
seems like a golden boy who everyone loved

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.220
. [] But Barristan says that no one truly
knew Rhaegar . He had a private, secretive

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.290
side . A melancholy, and “a sense … of
doom”, which was related to Rhaegar’s

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.450
birth at Summerhall.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.640
[] Summerhall was a Targaryen “palace”
in the south . Rhaegar's great-grandfather

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.760
King Aegon the Fifth brought his family there
“to celebrate the impending birth” of

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.350
Rhaegar . But Aegon also apparently tried
to perform a fiery magic ritual to hatch some

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.930
dragon eggs , and the fire got out of control
and killed King Aegon and much of his family.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.340
[] It was during this tragedy at Summerhall,
“amongst the flames”, that Rhaella Targaryen

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.120
gave birth to Rhaegar . “He was born in
grief … and that shadow hung over him all

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.320
his days”.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.600
But it wasn’t just grief that haunted Rhaegar
– it was destiny.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.770
The Targaryens have always been guided by
visions and prophecy . The reason they survived

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.850
the Doom and came to Westeros in the first
place was cause of the visions of Rhaegar’s

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.440
ancestor, Daenys the Dreamer . We see Daeron
and Daemon Blackfyre having prophetic dreams

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.950
in Dunk and Egg.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.310
And prophecy is the reason why Rhaegar was
born – his parents Aerys and Rhaella got

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.880
married because a witch said that the prince
that was promised would be born of their line

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.510
. The prince that was promised, or Azor Ahai,
is a hero prophesied to be reborn and save

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.260
the world from darkness – which seems to
mean they’ll fight the white walkers.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.580
The prophecy’s vague and complex, and people
interpret it in different ways.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.890
Melisandre, for instance, thinks Stannis Baratheon
is Azor Ahai – which doesn’t work out

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.491
– while others think Daenerys is the hero
. Rhaegar was also into this prophecy, and

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:31.950
it guided him from a very young age.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.560
As a boy, Rhaegar wasn’t interested in playing
with other kids – he just wanted to read

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
books.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.640
Until one day, Rhaegar read about Azor Ahai,
and came to believe that he was the prophesied

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
hero.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.860
So young Rhaegar went to the master-at-arms,
and said he needed a sword – “It seems

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.000
I must be a warrior”, he said . He talked
about this in letters with his great-granduncle

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.300
Maester Aemon.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.860
Aemon agreed that Rhaegar was Azor Ahai, cause
according to prophecy, Azor Ahai will be reborn

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.860
“amidst smoke and salt” . They thought
the smoke was from the fire that burned Summerhall

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.490
when Rhaegar was born, and the salt was from
the tears that were shed there.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.940
So Rhaegar was convinced that he was Azor
Ahai, and since Azor Ahai’s described as

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.320
a “warrior of fire” who will lead “the
fight against the dark” , Rhaegar trained

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.510
and became a great fighter.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.540
From a young age, Rhaegar was willing to shape
his life around fulfilling the prophecy of

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.290
Azor Ahai.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.670
But his beliefs about that prophecy later
changed.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.589
Aemon says Rhaegar came to believe that Azor
Ahai was not Rhaegar, but Rhaegar’s son,

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:38.789
Aegon – the baby he had with Elia.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.519
Because the prophecy says that Azor Ahai will
be born “beneath a bleeding star” . And

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:47.660
Rhaegar and Aemon thought that this star was
a comet that was seen the night Aegon was

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.470
conceived . This connects to a vision that
Daenerys has in Book 2 – she sees her brother

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.970
Rhaegar and his wife Elia with their baby
Aegon.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.240
Rhaegar says Aegon “is the prince that was
promised” , and “There must be one more

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.519
… The dragon has three heads” . It’s
not clear how the heads of the dragon relate

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:11.380
to the prophecy of Azor Ahai, but the heads
do connect to the symbolism of Rhaegar’s

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.490
family, the Targaryens.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.470
Because their banner shows a dragon with three
heads, which represents the three siblings

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:24.130
who led the house three hundred years ago
– Aegon, Rhaenys and Visenya . As Daenerys

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:29.040
points out, these names connect to the names
of Rhaegar’s children Aegon and Rhaenys.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.610
So when Rhaegar says “There must be one
more”, it sounds like Rhaegar wants a third

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:39.360
child called Visenya – to complete the set
of the dragon with three heads . But – there

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360
was problem.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.920
Rhaegar’s wife Elia was always “frail
and sickly” . And after giving birth to

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.449
Aegon, she couldn’t bear any more children
. So if Rhaegar believed “There must be

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:54.209
one more” – he’d need another woman
to produce his third child.

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:56.430
And that is where Lyanna Stark comes in.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:02.259
It seems likely that part of the reason Rhaegar
ran off with Lyanna and fathered Jon Snow

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:06.870
was that he wanted a third child to fit the
three heads of the dragon.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.320
If he was planning for a daughter called Visenya
to fit Aegon’s sisters – that didn’t

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320
work out.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.550
But he might have changed his mind about Aegon
and decided that this third child, Jon, would

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.189
be Azor Ahai.

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:22.509
Because Rhaegar says that Azor Ahai is connected
to something called the “song of ice and

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:26.329
fire” – which happens to be the title
of the book series.

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:29.610
Lyanna Stark of Winterfell is connected to
ice.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.570
And Rhaegar of the Targaryen dragonlords is
connected to fire.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.649
So a child of Lyanna and Rhaegar would be
a song – or a son – of ice and fire.

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:43.800
There are many hints in the books that Jon
may be Azor Ahai.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.819
Melisandre prays “for a glimpse of Azor
Ahai”, and her god shows her Jon . There’s

00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:53.120
smoke and salt and a bloody star in the scene
where Jon dies.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.769
And Ned promised to protect Jon, making Jon
a “prince” that was literally “promised”.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:03.649
So Jon – not Aegon or Rhaegar – may be
the true hero.

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:08.449
It might have been Lyanna who realised this
in the end – maybe she named Jon Aegon in

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:12.050
the show – “What better name” for the
prince that was promised?

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.819
So it seems that in the end Rhaegar achieved
his goal – his actions with Lyanna led to

00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:22.499
the birth of Jon, who may be the hero who’ll
save the world.

00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:25.590
But does that really justify Rhaegar’s actions?

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:31.200
Couldn’t he find a way to father Jon without
abandoning his family, and causing a war that

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.889
killed thousands?

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.990
How could he be certain that taking Lyanna
was the only way?

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.630
Vague prophecy seems like a convenient excuse
for Rhaegar to do things that he probably

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:47.129
wanted to do anyway – like ignoring difficult
political realities, running away from his

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:52.689
problems, and shacking up with a teenager
– cause remember, Lyanna was just fifteen,

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:56.550
in the books, while Rhaegar was a twenty-something
year old prince.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.899
You can imagine his pitch to her – like,
‘hey, I’m married, and you’re engaged,

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:06.149
but if we don’t bang, the world will literally
end – and did I mention I play the harp?’.

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:10.880
And he takes her away to this tower he calls
the “tower of joy”, and they sit around

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.279
making prophecy babies for like a year, meanwhile
the world is burning.

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:19.449
Are these really the actions of a hero trying
to save the world?

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:25.680
Or was Rhaegar a selfish idiot who killed
thousands cause he was thinking with his dick?

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.149
There is one theory that ties things together
in a way that could justify all of Rhaegar’s

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:33.730
actions – including the war and the deaths.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.889
Cause part of the prophecy of Azor Ahai is
that the hero will have a “burning sword”

00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:44.809
called Lightbringer . In Book 2, we’re told
a story of how the original sword was forged.

00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:47.559
Apparently Azor Ahai tried three times.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.480
The first sword broke when he tempered it
in water.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.200
The second sword broke when he tempered it
by stabbing the heart of a lion.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.160
But the third sword he tempered by stabbing
the heart of his beloved wife.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.809
She cried with anguish and ecstasy and died,
but her strength went into the steel, and

00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:09.250
that is how the true Lightbringer was forged,
and the world was saved . Some readers have

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.189
noticed that this story kinda mirrors the
story of Rhaegar.

00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:17.070
Like Azor Ahai, he tried three times to fulfil
prophecy.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.730
First, he believed that he himself was Azor
Ahai – but he ended up dying in the waters

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.450
of the river Trident.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.380
Second, Rhaegar believed that his son Aegon
would be Azor Ahai – but Aegon was killed

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.940
in the war by the men of the Lion of Lannister,
Tywin . The third and final time, Rhaegar

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.769
made a child with his beloved wife, Lyanna.

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:42.399
He plunged his “sword” into her – conceiving
Jon – and she died in childbirth.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.619
So the first sword, broke in water, is Rhaegar
. The second sword, broke with a lion, is

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:48.619
Aegon.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:53.079
And the third sword, the true Lightbringer,
forged with death of a beloved wife – is

00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:59.089
Jon Snow – “the sword in the darkness
… the light that brings the dawn” . So

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:05.790
while Jon is the weapon who’ll beat the
white walkers, the hero Azor Ahai, is Rhaegar

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.740
– dead years before the story even starts.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:17.149
This theory suggests that each of these deaths
was necessary, predestined, to save the world.

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:19.740
Lyanna needed to die in childbirth.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.369
Aegon needed to die in the war.

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:26.110
And Rhaegar needed to die at the Trident.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.779
Maybe he knew.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:33.639
Maybe Rhaegar saw this stuff in dreams like
his Targaryen ancestors did, and he knew that

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:38.449
his fate was to die and to cause the deaths
of everyone he loved.

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:42.559
And that’s why he could never be happy,
never be known , or fully love, or explain

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:49.619
himself to anyone – that was his melancholy,
his sense of doom . Maybe his is the song

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:54.880
of ice and fire – and from the beginning,
he knew how it ends .

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.290
That’s one theory anyway.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.800
There’s a lot we still don’t know – about
Rhaegar’s goals, the politics, prophecy,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.870
heads of the dragon – and about Lyanna and
Elia – like how did Elia feel about her

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.259
husband running off with another woman?

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:11.999
Was she in on the prophecy stuff?

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:14.320
And how much did Lyanna know?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.220
Between Lyanna and Elia and Rhaegar’s mother
Rhaella there are a lot of women in this story

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.990
whose only role’s to be pretty, give birth,
then die – we know almost nothing about

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.629
them, so it’d be nice to learn some more
about their stories.

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:32.720
What is clear is that Rhaegar and his legacy
are tied to the fate of Westeros, and we’ll

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.639
keep seeing his influence until the end.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:40.899
Alt Shift X now has a website at altshiftx.tv.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:45.939
We made it with our sponsor Squarespace, which
is an amazingly quick and easy way to make

00:15:45.939 --> 00:15:47.190
a beautiful website.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:53.300
There’s no mucking around with HTML or XML,
patches, updates – you just choose a domain

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.600
name, pick a nice template, customise it how
you like – and you got a website.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.319
So if you’ve got a project, or a business,
or a theory about how the Mountain is actually

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:06.540
