00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:24.496 line:0%
<i> in the process.</i>

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:27.365 line:0%
crowd: Ohh!

00:19:27.398 --> 00:19:30.802
- Whoever came up with this
idea is a genius.

00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:32.204
Yeah, no, you know why?
You know why?

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.939
Because sports fans always act

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.874
like they could have
won the game, right?

00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:37.442
When they're barely winning
in life.

00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:38.777
You people sitting
at home like,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.912
"You idiot! You should have
passed the ball

00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.447
"earlier, God damn it.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.620
Mom! My hand is stuck in the
Pringles can again!"

00:19:48.653 --> 00:19:50.622
I think we should do this for
everything.

00:19:50.655 --> 00:19:52.457
Everyone that has too much of
this when they don't

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.658
do the job. Be like,

00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:55.594
"Oh, that pilot's landing
was horrible."

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:58.296
All right, Sully, why don't you
take the controls?

00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:00.398
"No, if I was Thor,
I would have gotten

00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.400
Thanos in the head."

00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:03.535
Well, it's funny you say that,

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:05.203
because Thanos is outside
right now.

00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:07.339
Why don't you take that axe
and prove it?

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:10.576
"Oh, I would, but my hand is
stuck in this Pringles can."

00:20:11.943 --> 00:20:14.813
But easily, easily my favorite
attempt at the field goal

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.014
was this one.

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:21.086
crowd: Ohh!

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.321
- [laughs]

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:25.190
Oh, man.

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:29.828
The bright yellow vest was not
the protection that man needed.

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:32.397
And now his balls have
a concussion.
