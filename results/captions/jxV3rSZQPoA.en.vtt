Fantastic, thank you so much. Uh Howie. -Do you know what medieval times? Have you ever been to medieval times?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.240
-I have.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.760
if they took that concept and made a one-woman show this is what I think it would be.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.780
-Okay.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.880
I didn't see an amazing trick. I didn't see one amazing trick.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.040
Hes allowed his opinion, its ok.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.800
You did some flips and kind of jumped off a but

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700
and did another weird flip

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.280

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.380
Okay, uh..Mel

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.600
-I think I'm gonna have to kind of agree with Howie. what! I think if you do get through to the next round

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.090
Focus on really switching up what you do because there were a few tricks in there that I was like

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.720
Oh wow, that's great. I just wish you would have put them in a lot sooner. they've had a sword fight.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.260
I've never seen a dog have a sword fight with his owner before...

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.460
And I felt

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.540
Hero was almost singing along with the music, so I don't think they quite understood what you just did.           -Alright.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680
But maybe now I've explained it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.380
Let me kick this off with...Howie.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.660
I dont understand.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.400
I do.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.480
I don't. -Ok. -I don't. -That's ok.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.280
So im gonna say no

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.740
*Crowd Boos*

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.920
Yes or no Mel.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.160
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to say no

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.040

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.460
*Crowd Boos*

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.600

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.300
Both of you trust me on this I saw something you didn't  see.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.340
*Crowd Chants "Abby!"*

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.120
Okay, okay, I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I know people like dogs, so I'm gonna, I feel so bad. This is emotional.

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.129

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.069
Heidi

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.220
See, I would of wanted to see you again in

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.380

So two yeses.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.760

*Crowd Boos*

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.940

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.520
Hero, you have a yes from me.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.780
Names Amy Book

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.580
I'm 22 I'm a personal trainer, and I'm from Gates.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.600
I first started singing when I was very very young and I always sang to my mom and she used to

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.740
always tell me to shut up.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.600
But music means a lot to me. Amy's lifelong passion for singing together with a little hometown

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.380
Inspiration has driven her to achieve her dream of auditioning for the x-factor.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.580
Samira inspires me most is shower called because we both came from Newcastle both came from working backgrounds

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.929
She's a massive inspiration because she's gone from that and look at her now, she's a superstar. I hope that I can follow her steps

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.240
Today is by far the biggest day of my. and I really really really want to make a massive impact on the judges.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.660
Hi.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.860
Hello.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.620
All right, what's your name? Amy book and how old are you Amy 22? Where you from?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.680
Your neck of the woods missy.
I thought so.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.660
Yeah

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.240
And you feeling a little bit nervous?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.800
Yeah, I'm feeling nervous and but I'm very very excited. I'm feeling a buzz.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.980
What are you gonna sing Alicia Keys falling.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
Good luck.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.560
I keep on fallin'

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.180
In and out

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.340
With you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.730
Sometimes I love you

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.680
Sometimes you make me blue

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.100
Sometimes I feel good

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Sometimes I feel bad

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.380
Heard enough.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.360
Well I'm going to start off by saying I think you look like a pop star already you look absolutely fantastic. Thank you.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.590
But I think that song was too big for Amy.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.700
I really do. I think you've got a nice pop look.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.540
I agree totally.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.300
Amy.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.590
I think you've got a good voice, but it's not a great voice.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.300
Ah, you're very well prepared, you look fantastic

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.280
But I don't think your voice is good enough darling

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.000
*Crowd Boos*

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.340
*Crowd Boos*
Don't cry babe.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.240
*Crowd Boos*

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.640
Amy listen, listen we're not saying you're bad.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.700
I think you're a good pop singer. I don't think you're a big Davison.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.020
So you gotta work out in your mind the right kind of song for you.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.020
I nearly sang a Girls Aloud song you know.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
What?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.940
Alright well why don't you sing the girls Aloud song?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.960
Probably forgot the words now.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.960
I'll help you.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.020
ooh

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.380
Why you look so sad

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.700
Tears are in your eyes.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.860
Come and go to me now.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.060

Cause I've seen the dark side too.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.300
*Crowd Cheers*

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.900

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.740

And you've got absolutely everything going for you could just need to get rid of the nerves and take that last box yes really

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.979
Huge, thank you to this slot and made it through to boot camp congratulations

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.139
You are to the trial she picked herself up

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.769
My name is Jacob curly. I'm from Daphne, Alabama, and I'm a singer

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.500
Music has always been a big part of my life

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.120
Even as a young child it helped me get through some of the tough times in my life

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:20.819
My parents weren't what you would call

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:26.639
Model parents whether it be because they were in jail or because they were doing drugs

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.149
He got so bad that at the age of five

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.219
The police came and picked up my sister, and I and took us to foster care that

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:42.779
Night laying in bed. I wanted my parents more than anything even though. They weren't the ideal parents it was all I knew

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:50.068
Visitation periods were the worst because for the first few months my parents actually showed up, and they brought me things

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:56.490
But eventually they just stopped coming and being a kid I would beg and beg and beg even if there was like ten minutes

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.779
I thought no no they're coming. Please don't leave they're coming and eventually they just stopped coming

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:08.189
It was really lonely no matter who it was if someone smiled at me or showed me any

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.090
Emotion then I would I would beg them to adopt me

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.670
As the years progressed I gave up. I just it made me feel like I was nothing

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.800
At eight years old my life got a lot better

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.110
One day a lovely couple came to visit me and it turns out that

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.029
They are my parents now, and I love him so much only for a moment. I promise

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.440
Seeing Jacob walk out onto the stage tonight. I can't wait to

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:46.560
brag to every single person I know and tell them that's my

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.130
Son got there. Give it to him that poor man. All right

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.639
My dream is to be able to do this for a living, so I'm really nervous, but I hope they like me

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.859
How are ya I'm good, how are you? I'm doing really good and

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:07.889
Are you nervous yes, sir?

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:15.659
What's your name? My name is Jacob and were your problem? I'm from Daphne, Alabama. You're from Alabama. Are you here by yourself?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.239
I'm here with my mom. Oh, that's nice. She gives me everywhere. She's my number one fan

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:27.630
That's what moms are for yes, and what's the dream? Um I'd like to win America's Got Talent. That would be

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.230
Get is what you got

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.760
When the only information oh they're gonna bend it over

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.580
So we keep waiting

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.970
waiting waiting on the world to change

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.180
We keep waiting waiting waiting

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.700
on the world to

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.960
Thank you

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
Not yet

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.560
Oh

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.220
I

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:13.470
Really like you a lot, I think that you're great. I think you have a beautiful voice and you have another fan, okay

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.480
Thank you. I'm glad

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.960
When I judge this show I think of myself when I when a singer comes out a young singer like yourself

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.370
I say well would I invest my own money in a singer like yourself. That's the standard

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.669
I would hold you to and I would I would invest my money in you

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.490
You have one of those voices a bit like Ed Sheeran you hear his voice

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.769
and you instantly recognize who it is and boy that was just

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.700
Amazing, thank you so much

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.399
Jacob so you know I'm looking at your mother there you know and

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.909
Obviously there's a lot of emotion there

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.079
And you seem like a wonderful guy you sang with so much soul

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.610
Like you've lived a life longer than your years life hasn't always been easy

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.730
My childhood was pretty rough. I was me and my sister both were in and out of foster homes

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.070
they started when I was five and

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:28.319
It was kind of rough not knowing where you were gonna be or if anybody loves you like it kind of got

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.390
I made me feel like I was just somebody's luggage

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:42.030
When I when I met my mom and my dad, and they wanted to adopt both me and my sister

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:48.750
It felt just like this knowing that I would have a family that loved me and

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:58.440
This is awesome well, you know what America's Got Talent has now adopted you and America loves you, too

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.410
You
