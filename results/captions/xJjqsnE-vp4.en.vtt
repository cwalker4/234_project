00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.840
What  is the penalty for crossing the border unlawfully?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.780
I would defer to the department of justice on any..aah..

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.500
Let's try it this way...who has exclusive juristiction over immigration cases?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.860
Again, it's outside of my lane, but I would say it is CBP or ICE, Sir.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.060
So, it would be federal? It's exclusively federal?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.240
- Yes, Sir!
- Both...and they'really... unless you can think of

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.580
something I can't think of...

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.160
..see, they're crossing a border unlawfully, or overstaying a visa, would be about the only ways you can get in the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.220
country unlawfully... The only two ways I can think of, either cross one of our territorial boundries, or you're

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.120
invited in and you overstay your visa. And those are both exclusively federal.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.060
But, I think you'll agree with me, that almost all of our interactions in life

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.000
are with state and local law enforcement...It's not an FBI agent who stops us for speeding...?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:08.300
It's not an ATF agent who is [..don't get it...], so, if most of our citizen - police encounters are state/local...

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.920
...and yet, immigration is exclusively federal, how are the federal officers supposed to know...

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.340
...about folks who are not here lawfully?

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.820
Sir, the...duh...the Department of Homeland Security  has the PEP program, which I am not at liberty to speak on...

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.000
...but I would say, if Congress passed a law that commandeered every local police officer...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.100
...and wanted to pay for that, then I think we would welcome it.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.080
When you said...well, "commandeered" is such a pejorative word...how about we just say "cooperate"?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.680
Well, you don't "commandeer" people for  your Terrorism Task Forces, do you?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.940
You don't "commandeer" people for your  Narcotics Task Forces, do you..? It's called cooperation!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.300
And yet, you have a policy that says that "New Orleans Police Department members shall not make inquiries...

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.720
...into an individuals' immigration status". What do you mean by "inquiries"?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.180
Sir, if there is a criminal in New Orleans, and an officer interacts with that person,...

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.620
...and there is a criminal warrant, that person...
- See, I don't know what you mean by "criminal"...

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.800
...you mean...if...if the person has...if there is probable cause to believe that an offence was commited,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.380
...or if there is already an outstanding warrant?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.760
If there is a state, federal or local warrant, or probable cause, that an officer observes conduct that is criminal...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.460
...they will arrest the person.
- All right, and then they can inquire?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.560
...as to the person's status...?
- Our officers, under this policy, do not inquire about...

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.000
...a person's immigration status.
- They can or cannot?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.420
- Under this policy they do not inquire about a person's immigration status.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.220
- Why not?
- Because we believe that, 1) this follows federal law...

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.140
- Ahh..how, how..
- And 2)...

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.980
- How are the federal law enforcement officers supposed to know who is here unlawfully...

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.920
...if your officers don't inquire? They're not the ones that are interacting with them!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.960
- They're not enforcing traffic laws, They don't respond to domestic violence calls.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.760
- The FBI doesn't have juristiction over that...that would be your state and local officers.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.340
- So, how was that supposed to happen?

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.200
- Sir, I think your concern is with the broader system, and not with this policy. In New Orleans we arrest...

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.140
...every criminal that we interact with. We bring them to the jail...

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.500
- I...I love the way you phrase that, you "arrest every criminal you interact with"...

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.960
...they're only a criminal after they've had a jury trial, Mr. [don't get it]...they're a suspect, up until that point.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.340
- Correct.
