00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:17.279
we are entering a golden age in
astronomy advances in technology are

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.710
giving astronomers unprecedented
capabilities allowing us to explore the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.499
universe as never before we'll be able
to understand our future and what our

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.929
ultimate fate is going to be in the
universe

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.880
in the high desert of northern Chile an
international team of scientists and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.990
engineers is on a quest to unlock the
secrets of the hidden universe they are

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.360
pushing the limits of technology to
build the most advanced Observatory on

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.440
earth in one of our planet's most
inhospitable places

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.309
known as Alma the Atacama Large
millimeter/submillimeter Array this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.660
30-year project promises to open a new
window on the cosmos and redefine our

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.270
place among the stars whenever you build
something that opens up new

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.369
possibilities and then opens up the new
space of discovery and that is a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.890
remarkable ability that Alma will
provide

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.150
as humans we're always asking questions
perhaps the most fundamental is where do

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.630
we come from

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.439
to answer we must venture into unknown
regions of the universe to its very edge

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:07.329
where the first galaxies are forming
deep within immense clouds of gas and

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.239
dust where stars are igniting and
organic molecules are slowly building

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:21.370
the ingredients of life and inside dusty
discs where young planets take shape

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.760
around their future Suns such alien
realms are separated from us by almost

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.730
unimaginable distance and time and are
shrouded in veils of dust and gas are

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:47.799
there other worlds where life has taken
hold how did they come to be today we

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.069
are on the verge of a giant leap in
understanding in one of our planet's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.630
most unforgiving environments an
ambitious new telescope is poised to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.310
revolutionize everything we know about
our cosmic origins

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:19.890
it is called Alma astronomers study what
they can observe for centuries that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.240
meant stars planets and other visible
objects but the universe is deepest

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.320
secrets may lie in the darkness between
them empty space is a little bit of a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.650
misnomer especially nowadays in modern
astronomy wherever we look with

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.530
telescopes we see something there's gas
there's dust there are stars and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.450
whenever we look at a new unexplored
region of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.070
we find something different starlight
arrives in every color we can see but

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.950
this visible light is only a tiny sliver
of a vast electromagnetic spectrum that

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.269
encompasses every kind of light we know
of we've been able to explore just about

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.180
all of it but one part has been
especially tricky to observe a range

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.850
known as millimetre and submillimetre
wavelength light which represents half

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.580
of the light that reaches us from
distant space

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.560
peering into this cold dusty realm
requires a telescope that goes beyond

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.050
anything ever achieved in radio
astronomy because the light they observe

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.740
is so weak radio telescopes must be
built on a colossal scale they have

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.480
either a single massive collecting
surface or an array of smaller dishes

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.910
spread across a flat expanse combine
these individual antennas form a single

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.090
giant dish as large as the entire array

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:22.960
Alma is the most ambitious ground-based
telescope ever attempted the astronomers

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.780
design calls for 66 highly sensitive
antennas each costing over five million

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:36.700
dollars teams from North America Europe
and East Asia are sharing the cost of

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.230
the 1.3 billion dollar project each
region is responsible for its own

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.500
antenna design and construction the
international collaboration and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.500
competition is drawing the world's top
scientists and engineers pushing the

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.810
limits of innovation Alma scientists
need more than cutting-edge technology

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.560
they need a site unlike any other in
ground-based astronomy

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.360
there were three conditions a place that
would be high and therefore very dry

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.620
that would be flat so that we could put
antennas in accessible the number of

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:31.090
high big flat sites in the world is very
limited and so the search for the oma

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.640
site began in New Mexico close to home
there was a place called the Aquarius

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.290
plateau in Utah which was pretty good
it's very high but it turns out it has

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.490
about five feet of snow on it all winter
long and can't move the antennas around

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.190
at all the site to end all sites at
least at the time for astronomy was

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.460
Hawaii we studied the possibility of
putting the Ray Allen Mauna Kea with the

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.560
other big telescopes and it just barely
could fit when we were asked why aren't

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:14.960
you looking at Chile and so we made a
trip to Chile

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.800
the high desert of northern Chile is
renowned for its clear skies

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.940
but the remote location presents huge
challenges despite them Chile remains

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.610
the team's last best hope on the day
that that we went looking for a place

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.180
Heraldo via diaries and I drove along
going to higher elevation heading up a

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:49.819
very narrow old sulphur mining road /
ruts around boulders bouncing our way up

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:54.440
we're having a good time and and we're
headed towards something that's that's

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.570
at least high enough to have flat ground

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:07.970
we walk and look out and it is just
unbelievable lo and behold here is this

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:40.659
enormous flat plain so really exciting I
mean we felt like real adventurer

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.240
you

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.779
the Atacama is the driest desert on
earth

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.510
some parts have never recorded a drop of
rain

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.529
what moisture there is typically
condenses on the towering peaks of the

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:16.740
Andes

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:23.519
millions of years of volcanic activity
have created perhaps the most unique

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:29.629
feature in the region the Chuck Nam tour
Plateau

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.340
this high-altitude plane stops the
moisture Laden air rising from the

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.160
Amazon basin
it's Mars like surface provides the

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:57.000
perfect terrain for cutting-edge radio
astronomy finding an ideal site is one

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.330
thing building the telescope in this
extreme environment is another the

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.380
project faces significant hurdles not

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:17.100
least if these challenges is this site
itself

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:28.950
the 16,500 foot-high array operations
site is the highest large-scale

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:37.980
construction site on earth it is also
one of the harshest temperatures

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:48.330
fluctuate from minus 20 to 55 degrees
Fahrenheit UV radiation is almost double

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.380
what it is at sea level

00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:59.970
winds are often clocked at 75 miles per
hour the conditions affect both man and

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:09.209
machine the atmosphere is roughly half
what it is at sea level so you have half

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:14.579
the oxygen manpower tends to suffer from
oxygen deprivation they tend to be

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:21.329
lightheaded they tend to be nauseous and
there's more subject to injury or

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:27.089
accidents at that high site to deal with
these risks Alma's design calls for a

00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:34.050
second lower elevation site the
Operations Support Facility at 9,500

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.079
feet

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.480
workers live here just below the 10,000
foot level at which high-altitude

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.610
sickness increasingly strikes

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.470
but altitude and weather aren't the only
dangers the Atacama Desert sits above a

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:59.649
fault line in the infamous Ring of Fire
that encircles the Pacific earthquakes

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:02.910
and landslides are common

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.340
just to the southeast of the observatory
an active volcano called laskhar looms

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.170
overhead
she sends an almost daily smoke signal

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:22.520
of warning into the sky the ash cloud
from an eruption could paralyze the

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.690
telescope for weeks

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.220
for the astronomers these dangers are a
calculated risk in their quest for new

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:37.960
science for the engineers they present
profound challenges

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.430
Alma's builders must find materials and
designs that deliver unprecedented

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:49.630
performance in this unforgiving
environment if they succeed this

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:56.579
international team will change astronomy
forever

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:02.050
in the quest to discover our cosmic
origins engineers are building the most

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:12.000
complex Observatory in history of utmost
importance are the antenna dishes

00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:18.550
measuring 12 meters across a main Alma
dish is the business end of a highly

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:25.779
sensitive instrument to maintain its
precise shape the dish needs to be rigid

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:34.230
yet very light and must not warp in the
heat cold and wind of the Chilean desert

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.639
with such stringent requirements the
engineers need highly specialized

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:50.470
technology located on the Netherlands
southern coast The Hague is home to a

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.120
producer of composite materials uniquely
suited for the challenges of the Alma

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:06.430
project the telescope's design calls for
24 pi like segments join together to

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:11.980
form the backup structure for each dish
they are made from millions of tiny

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.500
fibers the only material suitable for
this structure is composite material

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:26.000
it's lightweight strong it is very stiff
and thermal expansion is almost there

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.400
4,000 individual sheets of fiber
material make up each segment

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.330
technicians must layer the precise
shapes by hand as the fibers can be

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:43.230
easily damaged at this stage it's very
strong in this direction of the fibers

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:51.000
but when I make a band I break
the finished segment is then baked or

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.220
cured in a giant high-pressure oven

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.000
this hardens and strengthens the fibers

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.879
the engineers use a laser measurement
system to verify its shape to within 20

00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:17.699
microns one-fifth the thickness of a
sheet of paper it takes weeks to craft a

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:29.550
single segment in all the team will
construct 600 each of them identical 140

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.720
miles away in northern Germany the
segments are tested together for the

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:41.639
first time like a circular jigsaw puzzle
technicians build the dish piece by

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:48.720
piece over a period of two weeks it's
the only way to ensure the shapes are

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.860
exactly to spec

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:03.140
the team's final step is to verify the
position of the 1300 Brahmans that will

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.840
hold the dishes reflective surface
everyone is measured to a precision of a

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:16.520
few thousandths of a millimeter the dish
is shipped in pieces to the Alma site in

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:25.010
Chile where it will be rebuilt one final
time far across the Atlantic in the

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:30.610
flatlands of East Texas the antennas
other half the finished base is

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:38.060
beginning its own journey outside of
Houston a team of 30 workers is moving

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:44.000
the first North American antenna
pedestal to the Gulf of Mexico because

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.160
it takes up the entire road they can
only transport the huge structure at

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:57.860
night it's almost dawn when the caravan
arrives at the harbor the pedestal will

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:04.040
spend the next two weeks in the hull of
an ocean freighter bound for Chile where

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.430
engineers will attempt to join it with
its dish for the first time

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:15.060
the next great leap in astronomy is
underway

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.850
to encounter some of the great mysteries
of modern astronomy we don't have to

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:29.730
look far into our own galaxy
only a hundred seventy-five light-years

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:35.940
away in the constellation Hydra is a
young star that could be the key to

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.640
understanding how our own solar system
developed

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.890
there's a wonderful protoplanetary disc
around the star TW Hydra this is a

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.570
unique system because it's one of the
closest known to the earth so we can see

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.250
it in the most detail only ten million
years old

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:02.790
1/500 the age of our Sun TW Hydra is a
planetary system that is just starting

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:08.070
to take shape we know that there is a
inner hole in the disk we think that the

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:13.500
holes being cleared out by a planet in
formation and with Alma we should be

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:19.530
able to see the gas and dust that's
forming the planet and even the gas and

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.420
dust in the circum planetary disc that
may be forming moons around this planet

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:31.330
Alma's views of TW Hydra and other
planetary discs will shed light on the

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:37.780
earliest history of our solar system and
could tell us where to look for other

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:47.290
earth-like planets suitable for life on
our own planet life flourishes in even

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:54.730
the most unlikely places and the Atacama
Desert is no exception here a number of

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.430
creatures thrive in the barren expanses

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:10.960
flocks of andean flamingos depend on the
salt flats for survival desert foxes and

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:18.910
wild donkeys comb the lush lowlands in
search of food

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:26.260
and in the high desert well-adapted
climbers like llamas and vicunas forged

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:39.430
nimbly on the rocky slopes the atacama
also has a unique human history the

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:46.300
Atacama Desert is the center of this
ethnic group call atacameños you see

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:53.140
the remains of ancient civilizations
before the arrival of the Spaniards it

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.690
was sort of a remote outpost of the
Incas very sparsely populated even today

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:05.440
you find original people the delicate
nature of the area presents

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.730
environmental challenges for the
expansive Alma project the desert is

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:18.970
something in master Carol you want to
keep the natural beauty of the place so

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.370
we are being very environmental friendly

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.530
one of the region's most imposing
features is known as the VA de la Luna

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.120
or Valley of the Moon

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:40.810
carved over millennia by wind and water
the otherworldly landscape lives up to

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:47.090
its name

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:52.460
almost a month after leaving Texas the
antenna pedestal must make its way

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.889
through the valleys narrow passages

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:05.990
after a 5,000 mile journey it finally
reaches its destination the 30,000

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:11.379
square-foot hangar constructed for final
assembly of the North American antennas

00:21:11.379 --> 00:21:17.029
this is the side erection facility this
is the first place that the entire

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:23.450
antenna assembly comes together the
first major step in the assembly process

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:33.879
is also the most risky attaching the
dish to its face using a 100 ton crane

00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:41.440
engineers slowly lift the 14,000 pound
dish structure 60 feet into the air

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.210
Foreman on hydraulic lifts relayed
commands to personnel on the ground who

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.789
steady the dish using a system of ropes

00:21:52.749 --> 00:21:58.809
the final positioning can only be done
by hand

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.320
even a small bump can damage the dish

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:20.600
the 39-foot dish is aligned in the exact
center of the pedestal the antenna may

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.970
look complete but it's still missing a
critical component the reflective panels

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:36.680
that gather the light from space deep in
mainland Europe on the edge of Germany's

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.500
Black Forest metalworking specialists
create the telescope's precise dish

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:51.050
surface 264 aluminum panels each about
the size and thickness of a coffee table

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:57.650
sit on top of the dish structure the
different shapes fit together to form a

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.330
perfect 3d parabola

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:08.360
panels begin as high grade aluminum
slabs that have already passed stringent

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:15.380
materials testing to transform them into
precise shapes technicians use a

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:22.400
specialized five axis machining
instrumentum different titanium carbide

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.250
drill bits hollow out the interior in a
two-hour process making the panel's

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:34.370
lightweight but stiff the team uses a
coordinate measurement machine to verify

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:41.090
that each panels shape is perfect they
digitally map every surface to make sure

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.320
it will fit with the others

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:51.380
the first time the reflective surface is
assembled is upon arrival at the Alma

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.860
site technicians follow a strict
sequence as they carefully transport

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:07.880
them one at a time up to the antenna to
secure the panels correctly they have to

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.770
go inside the dish itself

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.370
small holes in each segment create a
tunnel with just enough clearance for

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:31.300
one of the team smallest workers he will
spend upwards of four hours at a time

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:38.650
inside the dishes hot interior the
elaborate process takes nearly three

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:47.860
weeks after stringent testing the
engineers turn the antenna over to Alma

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:54.820
scientists to be readied for the move to
the high site they are responsible for

00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:01.500
checking every detail of the engineers
work inside and out

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:11.960
their long list of tests takes months to
complete

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:20.570
the team and the antenna still face
their biggest test to date the move

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:26.520
7,000 feet up to the array site where
years of design and development will

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:38.580
confront the raw power of nature to
discover our deepest roots we must

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.860
unlock the secrets of the early universe

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:51.930
some 13 billion years ago shortly after
the Big Bang we encounter a powerful

00:25:51.930 --> 00:26:00.110
beacon in the dark this is a quasar a
newly forming galaxy anchored by a

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:06.660
supermassive black hole quasars are
among the most luminous objects in the

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.510
universe they're surrounded by vast
oceans of invisible gas that will one

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:20.220
day become stars seeing this process
remains a challenge we know very little

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.250
about what the gas is doing that is very
very distant early times in the universe

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.980
and almost going to completely open that
up for study for mankind it's really the

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:38.310
next major step in our understanding of
galaxy evolution light from the distant

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:45.150
universe reaches Alma's dishes as
extremely faint waves to capture them

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:51.210
requires a complex suite of microscopic
sensors and electronics known as the

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.590
front end
the signals that come in are extremely

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:04.000
weak and the front end has to be very
very sensitive in order to detect these

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.230
signals and to amplify them to a high
enough level that they can actually be

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.100
processed
the antenna works by collecting light

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.080
which is focused on a central mirror and
reflected down into the center of the

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:22.720
dish here the light is directed into one
of several tiny apertures each leading

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:29.830
to a receiver that is tuned to a certain
frequency the delicate receivers must be

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:35.560
cooled to four degrees above absolute
zero the amount of noise this generated

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.000
by any electronics is proportional to
its physical temperature so the colder

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.620
you make something the less noise that
it adds the signal inside a temperature

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.540
controlled cleanroom technicians
carefully install the receivers into the

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.480
front end using a precision guiding
instrument the front end is shipped

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:05.280
fully assembled to the AMA site

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.560
in the Chilean desert almost scientists
and engineers prepare for the most

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:22.640
critical event in the early life of the
observatory they are 24 hours away from

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.680
moving the first North American antenna
to its final destination on the Chuck

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:35.780
Nam tour Plateau decades of design and
testing work are on the line I think

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:43.640
we've been through so many tests to test
the what-ifs that I honestly believe

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:49.310
that barring anything that is just an
absolute unknown out of left field by

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.990
late afternoon tomorrow we're going to
set the antenna down on a certified

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.950
foundation at the high site we're going
to plug it in it's going to operate just

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:03.320
like it was operating here at the test
facility the engineering team performs

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.700
critical tests to make sure no mistakes
happen during the real thing

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:16.190
the success of the move hinges on the
electrical connections between the 11

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.630
million dollar antenna and the
specialized transporter that will haul

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:26.920
it into the high desert the Alma
transporters are engineering Marvel's

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.770
custom built by Alma's European partner
these two 33 foot wide 66 foot long

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:39.940
behemoths are designed to carry loads in
excess of 100 tons

00:29:40.659 --> 00:29:47.499
they're 28 wheels have independent
drivin steering control allowing them to

00:29:47.499 --> 00:29:55.869
maneuver to within millimeters of a
specific spot the transporter drivers

00:29:55.869 --> 00:30:01.419
are equally specialized there are fewer
than a dozen people in the world

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:09.700
licensed to operate these precision
monster trucks drivers steer from the

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.049
transporters main cab

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:21.030
then use a specialized remote control
from a distance when making fine

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:30.390
movements the transporters will be used
throughout the observatory's lifespan to

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:42.600
move the antennas for maintenance and to
reposition them in the finished array at

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:49.560
Alma's Lowe site preparations for the
antenna move are going smoothly but then

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.420
the team encounters a problem

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:04.640
a vital electric current is not reaching
the main receiver cabinet

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.100
we did not find a 24-volt connection
between the antenna the transporter that

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:16.010
24 24 volt source is very critical and
communication between the antenna and

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.640
the transporter

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:24.520
without this connection the emergency
stops that cut power to the transporter

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.050
will not function

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.450
five hours later the engineers are
almost a half day behind schedule and

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:45.340
additional tests still need to be
completed the lead scientists call an

00:31:45.340 --> 00:32:01.210
emergency meeting to discuss the
situation if there is a fire you are we

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:09.730
gonna get some alarm going on the team
makes a difficult decision they will

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:15.510
proceed as planned
with all safety personnel on high alert

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:20.950
the 25 mile road that snakes its way
through the mountains up to the Chuck

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:28.780
non-core plateau is the observatories
most dangerous feature the steep slopes

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.870
require hairpin turns and high
embankments

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:41.710
the road is especially hazardous for the
heavy trucks whose drivers must breathe

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.450
the thin air to take supplies up and
down

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:54.760
Alma's personnel take every precaution
possible but mishaps still occur since

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.110
construction began there have been 33
major accidents three of them fatal

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:20.890
with a historic antenna move only hours
away the risks are very real at Alma's

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:30.790
low site nearly 30 years of work is
about to culminate in a single day about

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:36.610
the way a condition a wind air increase
around 11 we are worried to leave from

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:45.600
here as early as possible for obtain the
best condition for this moment

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:52.310
project engineers prepare to move the
first North American antenna 7,000 feet

00:33:52.310 --> 00:34:05.360
up into the Chilean Andes with so much
at stake there's tension in the cold

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:11.450
desert air one challenge that we have no
control over is going to be the weather

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:18.200
the wind and the chance of a snow out
and we get halfway up the hill and we've

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.250
got to either part or turn around and
come back already up against the clock

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.010
the team performs final safety checks

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:34.240
driver Luis Roja positions the
transporter with careful precision

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:43.690
115 tonnes of antennae are lifted into
the air including the transporter the

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:52.630
total weight is nearly 250 tonnes rescue
teams in front and behind guide the

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:59.590
transporter up the mountainside at the
ready in case of a mishap to protect the

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:08.590
antenna maximum speed is restricted to
12 miles per hour they will have five

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.150
hours to reach the top

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:25.569
on the plateau above desert winds are
already reaching dangerous speeds

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:31.630
part of the team arrives in advance to
brave the sandstorm and keep the antenna

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:37.690
pad drill holes free of sediment even a
small buildup of dirt it could prevent

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:42.150
the antenna from locking correctly to
the pad

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:52.300
on the steep slopes below progress is
slowed by repeated stops for safety

00:35:52.300 --> 00:36:04.870
checks finally the antenna makes its way
for the first time on to the moon scape

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:16.600
of the Chuck Nagpur plateau the dust
storm is now in full force after 25

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:22.240
miles of steady climbing the most
critical step remains setting the

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:31.150
antenna down in 55 mile-per-hour winds
Lewis directs the transporter with

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.870
careful precision

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:41.870
and locks the antenna into position on
the first try

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:57.750
yesterday the critical power transfer
failed this time it works

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.310
today's a very momentous day for us
basically it's the culmination of eight

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.440
months of activity on the antenna this
is the real stepping stone for us to

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.000
completing the array

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.880
after decades of preparation Alma is
mere months from its first large-scale

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.530
observations

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:36.290
October 2003 the aurora borealis or
Northern Lights are seen as far south as

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:41.410
Texas
but their beauty does not imply

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:50.380
celestial calm they signal a coronal
mass ejection a load of charged

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:58.869
particles hurled by the Sun at more than
1,100 miles per second this one is so

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:04.510
strong it cuts power to more than 20,000
homes and knocks out communications

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:11.500
throughout the northern hemisphere it
reminds us how little we know about our

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:19.569
closest star the Sun is a challenging
object astronomically speaking for

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:25.329
astronomers because it's so big and it's
so bright Alma will study the sun's

00:38:25.329 --> 00:38:31.750
chromis fear a violent layer of gas just
above the visible surface helping us

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:39.430
understand and predict solar storms you
need something that can look at very

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.990
bright objects but also can give you a
lot of resolution because these regions

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.160
that you're interested in typically are
quite small Alma can do that and it can

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.230
do it on short timescales so that's the
important thing you'll get these movies

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:58.359
essentially of how these active areas
develop it tells you about that space

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:03.549
weather environment and how these things
do actually propagate into the earth and

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:07.290
and can affect our daily lives

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.540
light from the Sun and other objects is
received and amplified at the front end

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.320
of each antenna

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:27.820
the telescope's back-end is where it is
combined and processed for astronomers

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:35.680
to study to produce high resolution
images the antennas must be precisely

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.510
synchronized using a device called an
oscillator

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:49.780
the Alma local oscillator is the main
tuner the entire array each antenna is

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:55.450
equipped with an oscillator for each
receiver they are synced together via

00:39:55.450 --> 00:40:01.030
hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable
to one central oscillator that controls

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:07.960
the timing of the entire array the
required precision is on the order of a

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:13.660
few femtoseconds femtoseconds isn't a
word that I don't think I was even

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:19.869
familiar with before the project started
it's so short a million times a million

00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:25.599
times a thousand times smaller than a
second in other words it's the time it

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:32.800
takes for light to travel the thickness
of a sheet of paper with more than ten

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.560
miles between antennas an error of even
a few thousandth of a millimeter could

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:49.780
ruin observations the enormous data
stream from each antenna presents

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:55.859
another unique challenge one that
requires a custom-built supercomputer

00:40:55.859 --> 00:40:59.520
the Alma correlator

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:06.410
every antenna is producing 96 gigabits
per second of data

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:13.789
night and day that's enough to fill up a
DVD in less than a second in a personal

00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:19.549
computer you have one or two or
sometimes four processors and all the

00:41:19.549 --> 00:41:24.200
data that you're working on has to go
through a processor be worked on and

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.999
manipulated and come out the other end
in this machine we have a hundred and

00:41:28.999 --> 00:41:35.529
twenty eight million processors built
and tested in Charlottesville Virginia

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:42.680
the correlator is the most powerful
supercomputer in the civilian world it

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.269
would have cost about a billion dollars
worth of pcs to do the arithmetic that

00:41:47.269 --> 00:41:52.190
this machine does so it was clear that
we had to build a special machine to do

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.989
the calculations the correlator is
housed at the technical building at the

00:41:56.989 --> 00:42:02.259
high site to minimize its distance from
the antennas

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:10.630
it will handle some 17 quadrillion
calculations every second and provide

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:16.380
astronomers with 800 gigabytes of new
data each day

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.450
with the correlator and three antennas
now installed Alma is ready for its

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:35.770
initial test as a working telescope for
the scientists it's a critical milestone

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:44.650
in paving the way for large-scale
observations we should be able to be

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:49.510
actually began the commissioning process
of the telescope as an integrated unit

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.620
not just testing individual antennas
which is what we've been doing up until

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.670
now I mean there are many telescopes
around the world that are bigger or

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.930
similar size to an individual Amman tena
but today we start working with the

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:06.670
antennas all working together they will
now move on to testing the telescope's

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.760
abilities as a tool for cutting-edge
astronomy a tool that will search the

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.310
cosmos for the building blocks of life

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.660
in the quest to understand our place in
the universe we are inching ever closer

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:31.690
to some of the biggest breakthroughs in
all of science within the last several

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:38.620
years astronomers have found a number of
planets that could Harbor life but the

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:44.020
secrets of how life begins are likely
shrouded with in the cold gas and dust

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:50.620
of interstellar space a realm we've only
begun to explore well the common thought

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.530
was that there's no way molecules would
ever be able to form in the very harsh

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:58.450
conditions of interstellar space you
have large amounts of ultraviolet flux

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:03.760
x-ray flux cosmic rays newly forming
stars creating shock waves that travel

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.590
throughout the interstellar medium all
these things are going on in these

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:12.060
environments and still large organic
molecules and molecules that make up

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:18.240
life are forming than they're forming in
large abundances in these environments

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.810
the solar system in these planetary
systems had to form out of this

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.860
circumstellar material that contains all
these different organic molecules so

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.070
we're all made of the interstellar
medium that is floating between the

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.310
stars

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.950
at the University of Virginia's Center
for chemistry of the universe a team of

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:44.580
enterprising scientists is figuring out
how complex molecules form in space a

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:53.680
science called astrochemistry using a
specially designed reaction chamber they

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:00.250
recreate the extreme conditions of
interstellar space well what you

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.770
shouldn't really feel bad about the
molecules that were putting into the

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.350
chamber back there we're not torturing
them but what we're trying to do is get

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:10.240
them to react from stops of known
chemicals they are creating new

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:22.600
molecules every line here is a molecule
many of these molecules that are formed

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.520
have never been seen before ever

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:33.650
astro chemists are building a database
of ever more complex molecules that

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:41.030
astronomers can use to identify new
chemicals they find in space these

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.320
experiments will guide almost scientists
in their quest to answer the age-old

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:57.230
question are we alone what we're going
to be able to do now with Alma is to

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.490
make chemical maps and this could have a
lot of different implications especially

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:06.470
for astrobiology or we actually want to
see where do the organic molecules the

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:10.850
molecules that make up life where do
they actually form in these regions of

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:16.010
newly forming stars astrobiology might
actually evolved into astrogeology or

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:20.720
Astro botany we're actually studying
plants and animals on other planetary

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.710
systems and it's very exciting to say
that we're actually starting at first

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.580
step starting now

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:40.430
hi in the Atacama Alma is preparing to
open a new window on the cosmos nine

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.960
antennas now stand ready to make the
highest resolution millimetre

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:52.880
observations in history tonight the team
will focus the array on the star T W

00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:02.060
Hydra to find hard evidence of planet
formation T W Hydra is very young solar

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:07.340
system information we see signatures in
T W Hydra then suggest the existence of

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.540
planets what we need Alma for is to
really hammer down and say you know this

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:16.160
is really a planet orbiting this star
it's cleared out this this gap in that

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.010
disc t do be Hydra is so much better for
this because it's three times closer

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.220
than anything else we have so we've got
a little while to wait before we can

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:29.390
look at the phase calibrator but it
looks like the the operator turns all

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:36.880
nine antennas on the young star and
opens their apertures

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:45.570
as the light from space floods in the
antennas stay locked in precise

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.650
synchronization

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:59.099
and the correlator churns out a steady
stream of entirely new data from space

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:12.700
the observation is a success at two
hours it is the telescope's longest to

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:19.390
date with so much data it takes the team
the rest of the night to make actual

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.960
pictures

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:29.579
Alma's images are computerized
interpretations of the telescope's data

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:42.369
different colors represent varying
intensities of light even these early

00:48:42.369 --> 00:48:48.549
images show previously hidden details
one of the things that it's obvious to

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:52.269
us just looking at this straight off the
bat you would expect it to be a little

00:48:52.269 --> 00:49:00.160
bit brighter in the middle so there's a
hint of some depression this depression

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.250
is further evidence that a newborn
planet is just forming in the disk

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:10.760
clearing out a path of matter as it
grows in size

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.740
as Alma continues to add antennas and
add capabilities we'll be able to get

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.849
not only more sensitive imaging we'll be
able to get the higher resolution which

00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:24.960
will mean that we'll see finer detail
and it's just opening the door we're

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.960
just gonna blow everything out of the
water that's been done I mean it's gonna

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.490
be so much more fabulous in terms of
what we can get out of it that it's

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.839
really sort of a new horizon

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:44.780
as work continues and Alma steadily
grows in size and complexity the

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:50.140
landscape of astronomy is beginning to
change forever

00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:56.999
with each new antenna we get a clearer
picture of the story of the universe and

00:49:56.999 --> 00:50:05.000
our place within it

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.760
even in well-known regions of space
astronomers are uncovering new worlds of

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:17.540
knowledge showing us where we come from
and undoubtedly confronting a host of

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:23.390
entirely new questions astronomy is
unique and a science and that we can use

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:30.740
it to understand where we came from
nature is cleverer than we are just when

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.970
you think you know everything you have a
surprise every single field you can

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:41.390
think of from her solar system to star
formation of all masses and our galaxy

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:48.310
and nearby galaxies to detecting even
light from the first stars that formed I

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.910
don't think there's any field of
astronomy that will remain untouched by

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:58.550
the advent of formal the big question is
how many solar systems turn out like our

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.810
room where we have habitable planets
like Earth how often does that happen

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:07.490
and what are the processes that make
that happen almost really going to break

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:13.089
this field open
named Alma in Spanish means soul when

00:51:13.089 --> 00:51:18.150
Alma is doing is looking at the soul of
the stars

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:44.700
Algirdas internationalist nacionales
recognizes a localize it is an honor for

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.530
me to welcome you to the ceremony in
which will inaugurate the Atacama Large

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:56.760
millimeter/submillimeter Array known as
Alma after 30 years of planning and more

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.650
than a decade of construction the Alma
telescope is inaugurated in the presence

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:06.960
of world leaders foreign dignitaries and
scientists who have dedicated much of

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:14.550
their lives to this accomplishment thank
you very much International Space

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:18.810
Station as we look down upon a
magnificent Atacama Desert high in the

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:23.160
Chilean Andes we can see the results of
an immense effort by the nations of the

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.330
world to study the universe in new ways
we congratulate the scientific

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:32.280
communities of North America and Europe
and East Asia on today's achievement all

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:43.480
the very best to you
and enjoy your new discoveries

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:49.430
at the array operations site the full
complement of antennas has endured some

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:54.230
of the harshest conditions on earth
while undergoing routine maintenance and

00:52:54.230 --> 00:53:01.340
frequent upgrades the first full-scale
observations are already changing our

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:13.550
understanding of the cosmos and taking
us deep into new areas of space 450

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:19.130
light years from us in the constellation
Taurus two newly born stars revolve

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.630
about each other
in a binary system their brightness

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:28.400
obscures planet-forming disks encircling
the stars but when observed in

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.310
millimetre and submillimetre light using
Alma the disks shine as bright or even

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:39.800
brighter than the stars in the clearest
ever image of the system astronomers

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.600
discovered that the planet-forming disks
are surprisingly misaligned with their

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:50.620
stars orbital planes and likely stay
off-kilter for the rest of their lives

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:57.830
closer to us at around 175 million light
years the star T W hide ray is revealing

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:02.570
even more about the birth of our solar
system this time in the form of

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:09.860
something never seen before in a
planetary disc snow by imaging molecules

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:14.720
normally destroyed in the presence of
carbon monoxide gas astronomers using

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.970
Alma were able to infer a snow line of
frozen carbon monoxide particles

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:27.170
encircling the star at a distance of 2.6
billion miles the first ever image of

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:31.820
this phenomenon supports theories that
snow lines contribute to planetary

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.890
formation much as they may have done
nearly 5 billion years ago in our own

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:41.169
solar system

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:46.100
these remarkable discoveries and many
others have been made with Alma's

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:52.070
antennas close together recently the
telescope was reconfigured for the first

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:58.460
time to allow long baseline observations
and the increased resolution resulted in

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:03.280
a remarkable and unexpected discovery

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:08.750
returning to the constellation Taurus in
the distant dust clouds surrounding the

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:14.720
star HL Tauri astronomers captured
stunning evidence of how planets may

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.310
form in an extremely high-resolution
image the first time I saw this image I

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:23.810
thought it was actually probably a
simulation it was just way too good this

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:29.300
star HL Tauri was about a million years
old and as we look at the star with the

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.380
Alma telescope we see gaps in the radio
emission in this dish that's orbiting

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:37.820
the star and quite likely those gaps are
being caused by planetesimals young

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.390
planets which are forming around this
time this is really I think the first

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:46.160
example of the type of science that Alma
will be doing for many many years now it

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.510
could be that as we look at more objects
like HL Tauri we're going to see more

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:54.860
complex discs we will actually at the
higher frequencies may be able to see

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.430
the actual planets causing the gaps in
the Rings so it's an incredibly exciting

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:05.150
time and it's the start of a long
journey for helmet

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.270
you

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:52.700
we got you a TV picture here now
at one

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:59.000
but diet please
