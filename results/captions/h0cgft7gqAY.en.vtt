00:00:06.553 --> 00:00:08.139
- [Voiceover] The U.S.-Mexican
border is the most

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.298
heavily used corridor
for human trafficking

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.375
and drug smuggling in the United States.

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:14.918
The job of the border patrol agent

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:16.056
is one of the most dangerous

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.274
law enforcement jobs in the country.

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:20.236
Moments of high tension
can quickly escalate

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.345
into sheer horror.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.726
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:24.398
- [Voiceover] Unpredictable
captives can turn on

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:26.024
the agents at any moment.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.408
Border patrol agents work
in extreme conditions

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:32.775
endangering their lives
under a scorching sun

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.063
in order to save people in distress.

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.849
Hot zone operations consist of capturing

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.869
dangerous drug smugglers.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:41.494
Every minute of every working day

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.013
agents have to make critical
life and death decisions

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:46.579
that will determine the outcome of events.

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:53.056
(uptempo rock music)

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.301
The Sonoran Desert is one of the deadliest

00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:25.820
terrains on the planet with
blistering temperatures

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.625
of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.449
This unsettling yet beautiful landscape

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:36.925
walks a razor thin line
between life and death.

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:40.304
This harsh environment preys on the weak.

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:45.269
The desperate family of an
80-year old American man

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:47.919
have reported him missing
to local authorities.

00:01:49.448 --> 00:01:51.027
Every passing minute without water

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.472
reduces his chances of surviving.

00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.224
When someone is missing

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.778
in the hostile environment
of the Sonoran Desert,

00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:04.343
Yuma's elite search and
rescue unit, BORSTAR

00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:06.259
are called into action.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.803
BORSTAR are border patrol agents

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:09.927
who specialize in tracking people down,

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:11.946
and are used to working against the clock.

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.897
As soon as the crew are safely buckled in,

00:02:13.897 --> 00:02:15.185
the pilot starts the engine

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:18.100
and the earth slowly begins to fall away.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.398
Within seconds, the engines hit full power

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:21.605
and the Black Hawk helicopter

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:23.184
begins to sweep through the desert

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.645
like a typhoon ripping through the sky.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.478
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:30.638
In order to quickly
survey the vast landscapes

00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:31.856
of the Sonoran Desert,

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:34.097
the pilot has to fly the
Black Hawk helicopter

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:36.059
at dangerously low altitudes,

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.002
at speeds of over 160 miles an hour.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.026
Due to the increase of
traffic in the skies

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:44.406
the pilot has to maintain
a high level of awareness

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:47.227
about his environment at all times.

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:49.340
Maneuvering a two-ton
Black Hawk helicopter

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.079
requires great skill and concentration.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.703
One mistake, one error of judgment

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:57.222
could lead to a deadly crash.

00:02:57.222 --> 00:02:59.126
(radio voices)

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.959
When working in the blistering
sun of the Sonoran Desert,

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.129
BORSTAR agents have to be in top physical

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.978
and mental condition in order
to perform fearless rescues.

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:09.652
- You just got to be aware

00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:11.672
that your environment is not friendly.

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:13.680
And if you get in trouble out there,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.464
you're gonna become the
next person to be rescued.

00:03:15.464 --> 00:03:18.111
You got to be a step above that.

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:19.779
- Say they, you know,
somebody's got to make it

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:20.696
five miles on foot.

00:03:20.696 --> 00:03:22.356
Well, we have to go not only five miles,

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:24.538
we have to go that five miles back.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.476
We got to be able to walk in and walk out.

00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:30.651
So we got to go twice
as much as the next guy.

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:32.647
- [Voiceover] I switched it on.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.237
I've had it on in the--

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.073
- [Voiceover] Once the
helicopter is in the vicinity

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:38.291
of where the elderly man was last seen,

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.191
Agents Emblem and Smith get in contact

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:42.660
with ground agents who
serve as their guides.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.710
- [Voiceover] You're looking for track.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.649
I'm gonna follow the line straight ahead

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.880
to see if anything comes to me.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.705
- [Voiceover] Border patrol
agents are specialized

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:53.908
in tracking the fresh shoe
prints of distressed people.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.863
From treads in the sands,

00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:58.861
border patrol agents are able to determine

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.834
the size of their group, their age

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:02.842
and even the direction they're headed.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.003
- Okay, I got the man right here.

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:05.373
Bring the Black Hawk right where I am.

00:04:05.373 --> 00:04:06.720
Hard left, hard left.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.127
BORSTAR guy, this guy is down hard.

00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:12.873
- [Voiceover] Within seconds
of locating the elderly man,

00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:15.600
the pilot skillfully maneuvers
the Black Hawk helicopter

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.687
into a secured landing position.

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:19.699
Agents Emblem and Smith

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.982
quickly move on to the scene.

00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:23.421
- [Voiceover] 82, 32, 41.

00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:25.058
- [Voiceover] This is the
moment when the adrenaline

00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:27.124
and years of training kick in.

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:29.794
Sprinting over 200 yards in
life sapping temperatures

00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:32.027
of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit

00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:34.686
is both physically and
mentally exhausting.

00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:36.380
One slip on the uneven terrain

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.487
could result in a broken leg.

00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.187
Agent Smith's lungs and heart

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:42.927
are ruthlessly working overtime

00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:44.426
as he has the extra burden of carrying

00:04:44.426 --> 00:04:47.156
100-pound bag of medical supplies.

00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:51.065
As soon as Agent Emblem
arrives at the scene

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:52.807
where the elderly man is lying,

00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:54.525
he realizes that he has died

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.757
through heat exposure and dehydration.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.564
Outcomes like this are a harsh reality

00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:01.827
of the life of a BORSTAR agent.

00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:03.986
- [Agent Tyler] Unfortunately,
this stuff happens.

00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:05.352
This is probably everybody on the

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:06.698
search and rescue team's greatest fear

00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:08.370
is getting here too late.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.737
This is the part of the job that sucks.

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:23.143
- [Voiceover] Tracking someone

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:24.839
in the scorching Sonoran Desert

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.917
often takes time and patience,

00:05:26.917 --> 00:05:28.762
but BORSTAR agents know all too well

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:30.971
that every passing second counts.

00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.594
- There's been times where
we've literally showed up

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:34.857
and it's been, you know, a minute or two.

00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:36.481
You know, five minutes, 10 minutes

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:38.155
to make the difference.

00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:41.237
Yeah, this is pretty common.

00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:42.618
- We're gonna be way too late to this guy.

00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:45.230
This guy was obviously
in trouble at this point.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.152
He's got his pants down,

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:47.337
he's trying to cool himself off.

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:49.716
He took off his shoes at some point.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.874
This is his last minutes right here.

00:05:52.874 --> 00:05:55.240
If we follow his foot sign south.

00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:58.318
- [Voiceover] Before
handing the scene over

00:05:58.318 --> 00:05:59.990
to medical investigators,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.533
Agent Emblem tracks the
elderly man's last steps

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:03.914
in order to see if he can find

00:06:03.914 --> 00:06:07.382
any of his belongings that
may be of value to his family.

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:10.078
It will also enable the agents

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:13.352
to get a positive
identification on the man.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:14.490
- One of his footprints here,

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.557
he's barefoot at this time.

00:06:15.557 --> 00:06:17.010
he's actually in his socks.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.193
Took off his shoes,

00:06:18.193 --> 00:06:20.213
moved around on the ground a little bit

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.769
looking for shade.

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:24.509
Not a whole lot to be found
out here if you look around.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.377
We'll continue to push
him back south from here.

00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:41.168
See, he's staggering at this point.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.925
His steps aren't real coordinated.

00:06:49.837 --> 00:06:52.462
He might have been going
for a morning walk,

00:06:52.462 --> 00:06:55.121
got lost, disoriented.

00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:56.573
Couldn't find his way back to his vehicle.

00:06:56.573 --> 00:06:58.059
He might have bad vision.

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.741
Might not have been able to
see as far as his vehicle

00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:01.699
and he got away from it.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.854
It might have been nice and
cool this morning in the 80s

00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:05.874
but once that sun comes
up it gets hot quick,

00:07:05.874 --> 00:07:09.190
and if you're not prepared to be out here,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.734
this kind of stuff happens unfortunately.

00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.696
- [Voiceover] Once they have
finished assessing the scene,

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:16.547
Agents Emblem and Smith
head back to the base.

00:07:16.547 --> 00:07:21.547
(helicopter choppy whir)

00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:35.645
Although their faces are unknown to many,

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.972
the exploits of Yuma's
BORSTAR unit are legendary.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.681
Agent Emblem reflects on a mission

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.142
that he will remember
for the rest of his life.

00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:45.994
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:07:45.994 --> 00:07:46.717
- A couple years ago,

00:07:46.717 --> 00:07:48.941
we had a kid out here on his motorcycle.

00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:50.823
I believe he's 14, he was
riding his motorcycle,

00:07:50.823 --> 00:07:53.735
it's the end of a busy holiday weekend and

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:56.012
the kid got in a real bad accident

00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:57.742
with the geo buggy

00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:00.284
and ended up ripping his leg off.

00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:03.743
Complete avulsion of
his, of one of his legs.

00:08:03.743 --> 00:08:06.460
Our guys are out here
just getting ready to go.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.803
They treated the kid, they stabilized him.

00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:11.661
Helicopter came out and transported him

00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.186
to Yuma Regional Medical Center.

00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:18.963
That's probably one of
the most rewarding things.

00:08:18.963 --> 00:08:21.598
The kid lost his leg
but surprisingly enough

00:08:21.598 --> 00:08:22.886
he was out there a year later.

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:27.873
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:39.836
- [Voiceover] The U.S.-Mexican
border is 1,951 miles long,

00:08:39.836 --> 00:08:42.148
crossing through the states of California,

00:08:43.098 --> 00:08:47.255
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:51.758
The Tucson sector includes
the border stations

00:08:51.758 --> 00:08:54.906
of Douglas, Naco and Nogales,

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:57.319
and it is the highest illegal alien

00:08:57.319 --> 00:09:00.165
and drug trafficking corridor in the U.S..

00:09:02.456 --> 00:09:07.456
(slow tempo music)

00:09:08.934 --> 00:09:10.698
Nogales is a dusty border town

00:09:10.698 --> 00:09:12.920
60 miles south of Tucson.

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.015
A 15-foot metal wall has been erected

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:19.498
from salvaged aircraft
carrier landing mats.

00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:21.413
This iron curtain cuts straight through

00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:22.818
the middle of the town,

00:09:22.818 --> 00:09:24.942
separating Nogales from its sister town,

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:26.312
Nogales, Sonora,

00:09:26.312 --> 00:09:29.018
which lies on the Mexican
side of the border.

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.453
Illegal immigrants will
travel hundreds of miles

00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:34.821
to Nogales, Sonora hoping to be smuggled

00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:36.768
across the U.S. border.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:41.741
Day after day they try to
crawl under or over the wall

00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:44.170
and illegally enter the United States.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.647
In order to apprehend any terrorists,

00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:50.784
drug smugglers and human traffickers,

00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:52.548
Tucson's border patrol have installed

00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:54.347
high tech tracking devices,

00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:57.323
low light TV cameras and ground sensors.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:00.988
Border patrol agents are
stationed on hillsides

00:10:00.988 --> 00:10:03.286
looking down at everything and everybody

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:05.318
on both sides of the border.

00:10:06.317 --> 00:10:09.346
Routine arrests can turn in
to life-threatening situations

00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:10.902
as numerous agents have been attacked

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.557
with knives and other sharp objects.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.481
Chasing undocumented intruders

00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:21.949
can be seen as a game of cat and mouse.

00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:26.900
The stakes are high and neither
side can afford to lose.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.722
Agents Bob Bushell and Jim Hawkins

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:30.638
are two of Tucson's most experienced

00:10:30.638 --> 00:10:32.820
border patrol agents.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.863
They have been called in
to check one of the cameras

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:36.523
that's installed in a sewage tunnel

00:10:36.523 --> 00:10:38.931
running from Mexico to the U.S..

00:10:40.157 --> 00:10:42.258
The tunnels are often breached by brazen,

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:43.883
armed drug smugglers

00:10:43.883 --> 00:10:46.298
who take deadly pot shots
at border patrol agents

00:10:46.298 --> 00:10:48.624
if they think that they're
going to be caught.

00:10:52.358 --> 00:10:53.415
- Might as well check it.

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:55.366
- We'd go down there and check it out.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.045
- [Voiceover] Taking no chances,

00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:01.505
Agent Bushell gets his M4 rifle ready

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:04.071
and moves into position
with Agent Hawkins.

00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:07.582
They slowly move into the dark corridor

00:11:07.582 --> 00:11:09.342
and position themselves at the entrance

00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:11.364
of the sewage tunnel door.

00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:15.402
One of the greatest dangers

00:11:15.402 --> 00:11:17.688
that any border patrol agent can face

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:20.649
is being blindsided by armed smugglers.

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:25.612
(uptempo music)

00:11:29.902 --> 00:11:31.863
Unaware if there's anyone in the tunnel,

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:34.150
Agents Hawkins and
Bushell brace themselves

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.933
for what could be a fatal encounter

00:11:35.933 --> 00:11:38.551
that could cost both of them their lives.

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:42.875
Once in position, Agents
Hawkins and Bushell

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.359
quickly push the door open

00:11:44.359 --> 00:11:46.936
and shine their flashlights
towards the camera.

00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:49.422
- The door's open.

00:11:49.422 --> 00:11:51.491
- Shine the light at the camera.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.395
- Okay.

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:55.459
- [Voiceover] They
realized that the camera

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:56.957
has been smashed.

00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:59.397
Agent Hawkins quickly enters the tunnel.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.179
He has to stay alert at all times

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:05.118
as his visibility is restricted

00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:07.233
narrowing his window of safety.

00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:16.339
(bats squeaking)

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:18.889
- There have been people
through here very recently.

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:21.621
And then typically they'll come up

00:12:21.621 --> 00:12:23.930
and they also go up
these side tunnels here.

00:12:26.682 --> 00:12:28.400
And then they'll come out of a storm grade

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.140
on a side street hoping
our cameras don't see them.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.114
We wouldn't go any deeper than this

00:12:33.114 --> 00:12:35.017
normally without support

00:12:35.017 --> 00:12:37.154
because it's a very narrow area,

00:12:37.154 --> 00:12:40.671
and any kind of fight in here
you're in an enclosed area

00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:42.537
and it can be very dangerous.

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:48.414
- [Voiceover] After inspecting the tunnel,

00:12:48.414 --> 00:12:50.968
Agent Hawkins radios
the Tucson headquarters

00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:52.628
and informs them that a maintenance crew

00:12:52.628 --> 00:12:54.993
will have to come out and fix the camera.

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.901
Within an hour of leaving
the sewage tunnel,

00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:05.700
Agents Hawkins and Bushell get a call

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.417
to chase down a group of
undocumented immigrants

00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.077
that have triggered one
of the ground sensors

00:13:10.077 --> 00:13:12.569
while walking through the Sonoran Desert.

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.563
The job of a border patrol
agent is not just risky,

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.100
it's life-threatening.

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:22.625
A routine search can often escalate

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.564
into a perilous situation.

00:13:24.564 --> 00:13:26.584
- I was just finishing up a midnight shift

00:13:26.584 --> 00:13:28.895
and I was out tracking in a canyon,

00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:32.540
and I ran into a group of about 30 people

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.674
and the smuggler told
them that to pick up rocks

00:13:35.674 --> 00:13:37.763
and basically kill me so they can get away

00:13:37.763 --> 00:13:38.924
because there was only one guy.

00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:41.282
If they got past me they
thought they'd get away.

00:13:41.282 --> 00:13:43.499
So I had 30 people trying to surround me

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:46.617
and basically smash my
head in with big rocks.

00:13:57.441 --> 00:13:58.997
- [Voiceover] Tracking a
group of illegal aliens

00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:01.184
often takes several days.

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:04.162
However, it does not take long

00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:07.320
before Agent Hawkins notices
some fresh footprints.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.962
- This is really fresh.

00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:14.288
- [Voiceover] Once he identifies them

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:16.668
and locates what direction
the prints are headed,

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:18.423
he begins his pursuit.

00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:25.150
- Five, November 2--

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.949
- [Voiceover] Tracking a
set of fresh footprints

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.735
for several hours requires
a great deal of knowledge,

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:32.157
skill and concentration.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.634
Border patrol agents are taught

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:37.498
ancient tracking skills
called cutting sign.

00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:40.833
These hunting techniques
have been used by tribes

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:44.328
such as the Sioux, Navajo, Lakota,

00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:46.692
Kickapoo and Chickasaw.

00:14:51.873 --> 00:14:53.128
Agents Hawkins and Bushell

00:14:53.128 --> 00:14:54.764
can look at desert vegetation

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:56.714
and tell you how recently a blade of grass

00:14:56.714 --> 00:14:59.350
has been touched by a human.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.846
They can spot a hair
snagged on a low branch,

00:15:01.846 --> 00:15:04.353
twigs bent or broken by a passerby,

00:15:04.353 --> 00:15:05.932
or even a single fiber strand

00:15:05.932 --> 00:15:08.730
left by a marijuana-filled sack.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.890
They can quickly discern

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.642
faint footprints in the desert dust.

00:15:12.642 --> 00:15:14.604
- These are old.

00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:16.612
You can tell by the way

00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:18.667
the rain has textured the soil inside.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.929
There's a new track, here's an old one.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:24.150
You can see how it's
dimpled from the rain.

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:29.598
November Bushell. November 28--

00:15:29.598 --> 00:15:31.177
- [Voiceover] After
tracking the illegal aliens

00:15:31.177 --> 00:15:32.570
for nearly three hours,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.289
Agent Hawkins calls for assistance

00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:36.309
from one of the air units.

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:39.764
The pilot of the helicopter flies ahead

00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:41.180
in the direction of the footprints

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.385
to see if he can locate
the fleeing suspect

00:15:43.385 --> 00:15:45.968
who was trying so desperately to get away.

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:48.517
Years on the job have enabled

00:15:48.517 --> 00:15:49.863
Agents Hawkins and Bushell

00:15:49.863 --> 00:15:52.417
to gain a great deal of knowledge.

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:54.136
They know that patience and persistence

00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:57.479
are as important as
technical tracking ability.

00:15:57.479 --> 00:16:00.624
They can't push too hard in
the unforgiving Sonoran Desert

00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:02.099
or else it will be them who will be

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:04.066
in need of medical attention.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.004
Within a few minutes, the
pilot is able to locate

00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:09.467
a suspicious-looking person

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:10.488
only a few hundred feet

00:16:10.488 --> 00:16:13.095
from Agents Hawkins and Bushell.

00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:15.060
- Bob, I've got something here.

00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:19.508
- [Voiceover] As the
helicopter hovers above,

00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:20.948
Agent Hawkins quickly moves

00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:23.794
and digs a 36-year old
man out of the bush.

00:16:23.794 --> 00:16:28.794
(slow tempo music)

00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:33.546
- When you're in a foot pursuit
it is kind of dangerous.

00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:34.986
You see how rough the terrain is

00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:36.472
so you have the risk of personal injury

00:16:36.472 --> 00:16:38.433
just falling, breaking
bones, that sort of thing.

00:16:38.433 --> 00:16:41.707
Going off the cliff which
I've done twice already.

00:16:41.707 --> 00:16:44.610
But also, you can't see the person's hands

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.630
or the front of their body typically.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.952
You don't now if they have a weapon or not

00:16:47.952 --> 00:16:50.472
and they can turn around
and open fire on you

00:16:50.472 --> 00:16:53.293
in a matter of, you know, one second.

00:16:53.293 --> 00:16:54.802
So it is dangerous.

00:16:54.802 --> 00:16:56.810
And again, if you have to
put your hands on the person

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.122
and physically subdue them,

00:16:58.122 --> 00:17:00.642
you don't know if they have
a knife on them or a gun.

00:17:00.642 --> 00:17:02.760
So, it can get very hairy.

00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:06.271
- [Voiceover] The pilot of the helicopter

00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:08.106
calls for transportation.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:10.683
Agent Hawkins hands him
over to a fellow agent

00:17:10.683 --> 00:17:12.970
who will take them back to
their Nogales headquarters

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.810
where he will check to see
if he has a criminal record.

00:17:17.882 --> 00:17:20.158
The UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter

00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:23.792
is 64 feet long and
almost eight feet wide.

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.336
This powerful aircraft is fitted

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.994
with two twin turbo shaft engines.

00:17:27.994 --> 00:17:29.933
Within seconds the pilot
can be racing through

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:33.218
the Sonoran Desert at
speeds of 180 miles an hour

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.979
and can climb to a height
of 3,000 feet in the air.

00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:38.419
This gives the border patrol agents

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:40.880
the advantages of high
altitude surveillance,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.958
peripheral vision and a
rapid speed of response.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:46.894
For the pilot to get a clear view at night

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:49.575
of terrorists, drug smugglers
and human traffickers,

00:17:49.575 --> 00:17:52.675
he uses lightweight night vision goggles.

00:17:52.675 --> 00:17:55.032
The light amplification
device takes available light

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.641
from the moon or stars and intensifies it.

00:17:59.207 --> 00:18:00.681
This gives the border patrol agents

00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:01.830
an element of surprise

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.247
as they can emerge from darkness

00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:06.434
and be on top of their
assailants before they know it.

00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:13.714
For Yuma's border patrol agents,

00:18:13.714 --> 00:18:15.049
the night shift is the busiest

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:16.187
and the most dangerous time

00:18:16.187 --> 00:18:18.913
to patrol the U.S.-Mexican border.

00:18:21.959 --> 00:18:24.443
Smugglers of drugs and
people will stop at nothing

00:18:24.443 --> 00:18:25.860
in order to ferry their cargo

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.022
to its drop off point in the U.S..

00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:30.912
(helicopter choppy whir)

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:32.558
They will dash across the desert

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:35.467
with little care for anyone
who gets in their way.

00:18:41.218 --> 00:18:42.495
30 minutes after takeoff

00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:43.958
and the radio is already buzzing

00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.458
with urgent calls for assistance.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.741
Agent Emblem responds
to a high speed chase

00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:51.503
between a ground agent and
a driver in a white van

00:18:51.503 --> 00:18:54.738
who's traveling at 70 miles
an hour down the highway.

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.122
The van contains a smuggler

00:18:57.122 --> 00:18:58.805
and 10 undocumented immigrants

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.266
who are packed airtight in the back.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.577
- Right now we got us
a large group down here

00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:05.951
just came in on the west side of San Luis.

00:19:05.951 --> 00:19:07.318
They're down in the sudangrass.

00:19:07.318 --> 00:19:08.960
We're gonna see if we
can light up the area

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.953
and find out further (mumbles).

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.435
Okay. Yeah, we got it.

00:19:14.435 --> 00:19:15.434
We got it.
- [Voiceover] There you go.

00:19:15.434 --> 00:19:16.741
- [Agent Tyler] Okay, keep moving.

00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:19.247
Okay guys, vehicle is
northbound on (mumbles),

00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:22.974
it's gonna be a white four-door SUV

00:19:22.974 --> 00:19:25.503
West of Foothills Boulevard.

00:19:25.503 --> 00:19:27.522
- [Voiceover] As soon as
Agent Emblem spots the van,

00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:28.962
he illuminates it.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.179
This permits the ground agents

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.413
to lock on to its location.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.541
- [Voiceover] G326 (mumbles)--

00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:38.802
- [Voiceover] Suddenly, the smuggler

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.196
takes a sharp turn to the right

00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:42.842
and heads off into the desert.

00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:44.421
The dangers are rapidly heightened

00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:46.136
when the smuggler turns off his headlights

00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:48.040
in an attempt to get
away from the oncoming

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.875
border patrol agents.

00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:52.858
Such reckless action puts the undocumented

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.855
immigrants in immense danger.

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:56.051
The smuggler can't see more

00:19:56.051 --> 00:19:59.197
than a few feet in front of his van.

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:01.669
If he hits a divot then it
could catapult the vehicle

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.221
killing everybody inside it.

00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:04.594
- [Agent Tyler] Yeah, they
said there was a group of--

00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:05.531
- [Voiceover] Agent Emblem has been a

00:20:05.531 --> 00:20:08.398
border patrol agent for over nine years,

00:20:08.398 --> 00:20:11.092
and still to this day
he can't come to terms

00:20:11.092 --> 00:20:14.548
with smuggler's utter
disrespect for human life.

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:15.979
- It's a business to them.

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:19.752
They need to get their
human cargo if you will

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:23.063
from Mexico to the
smugglers on the U.S. side

00:20:23.897 --> 00:20:25.285
as quick as possible.

00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:28.547
And then they go back and
they smuggle another group.

00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:30.080
If they lose a few on the way,

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.204
I don't think they'd care less.

00:20:32.204 --> 00:20:34.255
I think what they do is despicable.

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:39.038
The best part of our job
is when we catch them.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.348
- [Voiceover] Even though
the smuggler is aware

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:42.962
of the pursuing helicopter,

00:20:42.962 --> 00:20:45.028
he continues to press on the accelerator,

00:20:45.028 --> 00:20:47.590
barreling through the desert
at over 50 miles an hour.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.614
- [Voiceover] Further
are throwing rocks at us.

00:20:50.614 --> 00:20:52.045
- [Agent Tyler] He's
coming up on that first

00:20:52.045 --> 00:20:53.856
turn intersection there, guys.

00:20:53.856 --> 00:20:55.494
Right underneath the hawk.

00:20:56.537 --> 00:20:58.395
- [Voiceover] He suddenly
makes an abrupt right turn

00:20:58.395 --> 00:20:59.822
and heads for a suburban area

00:20:59.822 --> 00:21:02.424
only a few feet from the desert highway.

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:05.109
- [Agent Tyler] If you
guys get into position

00:21:05.109 --> 00:21:07.048
just underneath the hawk here.

00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:10.423
He's bound underneath the
hawk on the black top.

00:21:12.608 --> 00:21:13.723
- [Voiceover] The police and land agents

00:21:13.723 --> 00:21:16.077
come swarming from all directions.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.479
- [Agent Tyler] Okay, I'm
gonna light the guy up now.

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:19.756
- [Voiceover] Yeah.
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:20.367
- [Voiceover] Light him up.

00:21:20.367 --> 00:21:23.719
- [Agent Tyler] He's going north one block

00:21:23.719 --> 00:21:26.215
west of Fortuna Road.

00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:28.119
- [Voiceover] The chase
comes to an abrupt stop

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.953
and the occupants make a run for it.

00:21:29.953 --> 00:21:31.474
- [Agent Tyler] Okay
guys, they're bailing out.

00:21:31.474 --> 00:21:32.878
They're bailing out.

00:21:32.878 --> 00:21:34.503
- [Voiceover] Agent Emblem
relays the information

00:21:34.503 --> 00:21:35.560
to the ground agents

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.463
who then begin to chase down the smuggler

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:38.612
and the illegal immigrants.

00:21:38.612 --> 00:21:39.190
- [Agent Tyler] We need body,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.787
we need to get some people
over here ASAP guys.

00:21:41.787 --> 00:21:42.512
- [Agent Boone] They're running, okay.

00:21:42.512 --> 00:21:45.541
I got a guy in the front
yard, the guys on the field.

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.033
Tell them to stop, they're
gonna come out the field.

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:50.881
- [Voiceover] The Black
Hawk continues to hover

00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:52.402
over the housing estate

00:21:52.402 --> 00:21:55.537
allowing Agent Emblem to
comb the nearby gardens,

00:21:55.537 --> 00:21:57.661
fields and alleyways,

00:21:57.661 --> 00:22:00.400
flushing out several of
the illegal immigrants.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.621
- [Voiceover] I just had a
flare out on the night sun.

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.221
- You just got to keep hammering
on it, it will come on.

00:22:05.221 --> 00:22:06.527
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:10.978
- Turn to your right.

00:22:10.978 --> 00:22:12.669
Right there.

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:13.911
There you go.

00:22:13.911 --> 00:22:15.049
- [Voiceover] When one
of the ground agents

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:16.767
heads into a nearby field,

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:19.008
Agent Emblem illuminates it with the beam

00:22:19.008 --> 00:22:20.075
providing him with enough light

00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:22.525
to safely apprehend
four illegal immigrants.

00:22:22.525 --> 00:22:24.031
- [Agent Tyler] Charlie,
how many bodies do you have?

00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:24.890
- [Voiceover] Nine.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.854
(speaks in foreign language) Alcaraz.

00:22:27.854 --> 00:22:28.719
- [Voiceover] As soon as the last

00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:30.489
of the illegal immigrants are in custody,

00:22:30.489 --> 00:22:32.788
Agent Emblem knows that his job is done

00:22:32.788 --> 00:22:36.043
and he and the rest of the
crew head back to base.

00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:41.882
(slow tempo music)

00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:52.484
Agents Boone Smith and Tyler Emblem

00:22:52.484 --> 00:22:55.964
finished their shift by
checking in their M4 rifles.

00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:01.157
Tomorrow brings another day

00:23:01.157 --> 00:23:03.362
that will put their
survival skills to the test

00:23:03.362 --> 00:23:06.990
as they continue to secure
the U.S.-Mexican border.

00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:17.258
The following morning and Sonoran Desert

00:23:17.258 --> 00:23:19.390
seems at peace with the world.

00:23:20.277 --> 00:23:23.883
It covers a region of more
than 100,000 square miles.

00:23:26.464 --> 00:23:28.402
An arid and rugged place,

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:30.968
riddled with hundreds of
deep canyons and caves

00:23:30.968 --> 00:23:32.745
that offers superb coverage

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:35.008
for the hundreds of
thousands of illegal aliens

00:23:35.008 --> 00:23:38.098
that cross the U.S. border annually.

00:23:45.422 --> 00:23:47.650
The BORSTAR team start
their afternoon shift

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.475
in a relaxed manner.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.581
The mood changes when Agent Tyler Emblem

00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:57.169
gets a call to survey the Colorado River

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.108
as there has been a sighting
of several intruders

00:23:59.108 --> 00:24:01.581
attempting to cross into the U.S..

00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:06.452
(slow tempo music)

00:24:07.347 --> 00:24:09.138
- We got a group of aliens that

00:24:09.138 --> 00:24:10.308
jumped the border fence

00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:12.200
and they're skirting
the edge of the canal.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.199
There's usually two routes
that they can take in this area

00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:17.485
where they cross down along the water,

00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:21.351
along the edge of the All-American Canal

00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:24.553
or up and over this hill up
here called Garcia's Hill.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.659
- [Voiceover] Also en
route is Agent Boone Smith.

00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:31.178
As temperatures rise to 125 degrees,

00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:33.477
the state of Arizona is
currently experiencing

00:24:33.477 --> 00:24:37.025
one of the most severe
heatwaves in the last 10 years.

00:24:40.338 --> 00:24:42.451
Agent Smith and Emblem arrive at the river

00:24:42.451 --> 00:24:44.355
and are joined by Agent Michael Bailey

00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:46.104
who is carrying an M4 rifle.

00:24:46.104 --> 00:24:47.103
- [Agent Michael] Yes, I do.

00:24:47.103 --> 00:24:47.724
- [Agent Tyler] What's that?

00:24:47.724 --> 00:24:48.850
- [Agent Boone] Which
side are you gonna be on?

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.180
- [Voiceover] Once they are
ready, they head upstream.

00:24:52.263 --> 00:24:54.132
Agent Smith and Emblem know these waters

00:24:54.132 --> 00:24:55.929
like the back of their hands.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.410
They know every trail where
illegal aliens hide out.

00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:05.729
Although the water looks quite calm,

00:25:05.729 --> 00:25:06.821
the border patrol agents

00:25:06.821 --> 00:25:09.526
never underestimate their terrain.

00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:11.069
The river is notoriously known

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:13.089
for its deceivingly fast under currents

00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:15.665
and steep non-negotiable banks.

00:25:16.944 --> 00:25:19.243
10-foot reeds restrict their view.

00:25:19.243 --> 00:25:21.390
Without being able to see
what's on the other side,

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.969
border patrol agents run the risk

00:25:22.969 --> 00:25:24.502
of having rocks thrown at them

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:25.954
or even being shot at.

00:25:25.954 --> 00:25:27.589
- All right here, guys, on the right.

00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:29.180
We're pulling right over here.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.045
- [Voiceover] Agent Emblem
spots movement to his right.

00:25:32.941 --> 00:25:35.666
He carefully steers the
boat towards the bank.

00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:37.313
- We're gonna grab a line too.

00:25:37.313 --> 00:25:38.451
- [Voiceover] Once they hit land,

00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.843
Agent Smith and Bailey
head through the thick,

00:25:40.843 --> 00:25:42.828
dense, snake-infested bush

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:46.193
where temperatures rise
to over 140 degrees.

00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:49.753
Throughout a 12-hour shift,

00:25:49.753 --> 00:25:52.074
each agent must drink
up to a gallon of water

00:25:52.074 --> 00:25:54.911
if he is to avoid severe dehydration.

00:25:57.473 --> 00:26:00.177
The border terrain is no
place for the faint-hearted

00:26:00.177 --> 00:26:01.512
as Agent Smith and Bailey

00:26:01.512 --> 00:26:04.496
are constantly bitten by mosquitoes.

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:06.516
They also have to walk and crawl over land

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:09.314
that is littered a foot
deep with broken bottles,

00:26:09.314 --> 00:26:13.311
soiled disposable diapers,
clothes and syringes.

00:26:15.536 --> 00:26:17.056
When pursuing illegal aliens,

00:26:17.056 --> 00:26:20.632
Agent Smith and Bailey have
their senses on full alert.

00:26:20.632 --> 00:26:22.675
They know they could
be ambushed at any time

00:26:22.675 --> 00:26:24.313
with little space to maneuver.

00:26:24.313 --> 00:26:25.288
- Right up around that next corner

00:26:25.288 --> 00:26:26.170
there could be a group

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.969
or there could be, you
know, people waiting for you

00:26:27.969 --> 00:26:29.873
or just dug into the brush.

00:26:29.873 --> 00:26:34.064
It's really risky coming
through these trails like this.

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:35.283
You know, these maze of trails

00:26:35.283 --> 00:26:37.543
and trying to find the
group that you want to find.

00:26:37.543 --> 00:26:39.540
Not to mention that it's
real tough to cut sign on,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.444
it's almost near impossible.

00:26:41.444 --> 00:26:44.853
So, the best you can do is
know where the aliens went in

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:46.536
and just pursue them.

00:26:46.536 --> 00:26:47.755
- [Voiceover] For many illegal aliens,

00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:51.250
the journey to the U.S.
is the ultimate dream.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.455
Unfortunately, for others the road leads

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:56.555
to a parched, everlasting hell.

00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:58.308
- For a lot of times,
the smugglers will give

00:26:58.308 --> 00:27:01.674
the aliens medication essentially speed

00:27:01.674 --> 00:27:03.195
which increases their heart rate,

00:27:03.195 --> 00:27:05.958
increases the body
temperature, causes dehydration

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.119
and act as diuretics,

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:08.500
and it will dehydrate the people even more

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.171
but they could keep going
without stopping to eat.

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.783
And, you know, they get that kind of rush.

00:27:13.783 --> 00:27:16.774
They get the rush from the
speed to sort of keep going.

00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:18.376
The smugglers will give them medication

00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:19.978
and not even tell them,
you know, what it is.

00:27:19.978 --> 00:27:20.872
They're like, "Here, take this pill.

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.229
"Here, take this pill."

00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:23.774
It will keep giving them speed as they go

00:27:23.774 --> 00:27:25.492
so that just compounds the fact

00:27:25.492 --> 00:27:27.094
you know, the heat factors on them

00:27:27.094 --> 00:27:29.451
and the dehydration factors on them.

00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:30.677
So a lot of these people are,

00:27:30.677 --> 00:27:32.051
have taken medication and stuff

00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:34.094
and we'll find caffeine pills

00:27:34.094 --> 00:27:36.079
and ephedra pills on aliens all the time,

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:37.983
aliens and smugglers all the time.

00:27:44.762 --> 00:27:46.574
- [Voiceover] After
tracking for over an hour,

00:27:46.574 --> 00:27:48.977
Agents Bailey and Smith
are unable to catch up

00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.822
with the group of illegal immigrants

00:27:50.822 --> 00:27:53.099
who have been squatting in the reeds.

00:27:59.739 --> 00:28:01.758
They take a few moments
to pay their respects

00:28:01.758 --> 00:28:03.395
to a fellow agent who perished

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:05.276
while trying to capture a smuggler

00:28:05.276 --> 00:28:08.839
and saved the lives of
several illegal aliens.

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:12.519
- This right here is a
monument to Agent James Epling

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:16.119
that died out here on December 16th, 2003.

00:28:17.593 --> 00:28:20.112
He was chasing a group of
aliens right off of here,

00:28:20.112 --> 00:28:21.377
it was the winter time.

00:28:21.377 --> 00:28:26.377
The aliens were I believe
Chinese immigrants.

00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:28.657
So he's yelling at them
in Spanish and English

00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:29.875
and weren't understanding of him.

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:30.940
They've been out in
the middle of the river

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.272
on a sandbar for quite some time.

00:28:34.272 --> 00:28:38.439
Agent Epling went out, rescued the aliens

00:28:38.439 --> 00:28:41.156
and was passing them up
to his partner and said,

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:42.897
"I'm gonna go after a smuggler."

00:28:42.897 --> 00:28:45.834
He was standing about
knee-deep water at this time.

00:28:45.834 --> 00:28:47.076
So he took off after the smuggler

00:28:47.076 --> 00:28:49.630
who was on an air tube and
starting to float back south

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.778
and he took off running
in this knee-deep water.

00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:54.024
The depth changed,

00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:56.360
kind of fell into a
hole near as we can tell

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.306
and ended up drowning in the line of duty.

00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:18.742
- [Voiceover] Coyotes are individuals

00:29:18.742 --> 00:29:20.308
that are secretly hired to smuggle

00:29:20.308 --> 00:29:23.081
illegal immigrants into the United States.

00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:30.142
Mexican drug smugglers will
often use them as decoys

00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:31.558
so that the border patrol agents

00:29:31.558 --> 00:29:34.344
will focus all their efforts
trying to capture them

00:29:34.344 --> 00:29:36.283
while the drug smugglers ferry their cargo

00:29:36.283 --> 00:29:38.950
into the U.S. without being detected.

00:29:41.147 --> 00:29:42.703
The coyotes will transport up to

00:29:42.703 --> 00:29:45.582
100 illegal immigrants at a time.

00:29:45.582 --> 00:29:46.905
If any of them fall behind,

00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:48.356
the coyotes will not think twice

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:50.943
about leaving them to
perish in the desert.

00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:57.156
Pregnant women and
children have been found

00:29:57.156 --> 00:30:00.836
severely dehydrated only
a few minutes from death.

00:30:00.836 --> 00:30:05.836
(slow tempo music)

00:30:07.244 --> 00:30:10.413
The life of a border patrol
agent is a never ending drill,

00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:13.443
often with life and death stakes.

00:30:13.443 --> 00:30:15.475
Agent Jones spends over 10 hours a day

00:30:15.475 --> 00:30:16.961
perched on a hill that overlooks

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:19.164
the U.S.-Mexican border.

00:30:20.954 --> 00:30:23.358
He is constantly on the
lookout for terrorists,

00:30:23.358 --> 00:30:25.332
drug smugglers and illegal aliens

00:30:25.332 --> 00:30:26.934
trying to cross the border,

00:30:26.934 --> 00:30:29.175
as well as snipers who
use high-powered weapons

00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:31.547
to fire at border patrol agents.

00:30:31.547 --> 00:30:36.498
(slow tempo music)

00:30:40.521 --> 00:30:42.901
Just when they thought the
day was coming to an end,

00:30:42.901 --> 00:30:44.909
Agents Hawkins and Bushell get a call

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.348
to say that there has been a sighting

00:30:46.348 --> 00:30:48.287
of around 20 illegal aliens

00:30:48.287 --> 00:30:51.542
who are being escorted across
the border by a coyote.

00:30:52.722 --> 00:30:54.428
As soon as they get within a few miles

00:30:54.428 --> 00:30:56.518
with the group of illegal aliens,

00:30:56.518 --> 00:30:58.843
Agent Hawkins hits the gas.

00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:02.485
He test the truck's every
component to the maximum

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:05.071
as it picks up speed around every corner.

00:31:06.479 --> 00:31:08.278
When pursuing someone at high speed,

00:31:08.278 --> 00:31:11.505
a border patrol agent
needs nerves of steel.

00:31:11.505 --> 00:31:12.957
There is no room for hesitation

00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:15.940
when hurdling your truck through
the desert's narrow roads

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.425
and traveling at dangerous speeds

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:19.431
of over 50 miles an hour.

00:31:20.456 --> 00:31:21.640
It only takes one mistake

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.469
to catapult the truck into a ditch.

00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:26.805
Several border patrol agents
have already been killed

00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:30.454
when their truck hit a divot
in the road and crashed.

00:31:30.454 --> 00:31:32.784
- I'll drop you off and I'll go up here.

00:31:32.784 --> 00:31:34.804
- [Voiceover] In order to
corner off the illegal aliens,

00:31:34.804 --> 00:31:36.662
Agent Bushell jumps out of the truck

00:31:36.662 --> 00:31:38.299
and heads off into the desert,

00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:40.895
while Agent Hawkins speeds
off towards the border

00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:44.100
flying over bumps and
skidding around corners.

00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:46.804
Agent Hawkins has to stay alert

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.325
as he chases down the coyote

00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:51.181
who is trying to make
his way back to Mexico.

00:31:58.053 --> 00:32:00.642
Despite all of his training
and protective equipment,

00:32:00.642 --> 00:32:01.989
Agent Hawkins never knows

00:32:01.989 --> 00:32:04.335
how the situation is going to play out.

00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:08.165
Agent Jones is supporting
tactical operations

00:32:08.165 --> 00:32:11.060
by watching every move
that Agent Hawkins makes.

00:32:25.718 --> 00:32:26.832
- [Voiceover] As soon as Agent Hawkins

00:32:26.832 --> 00:32:28.492
handcuffs the coyote,

00:32:28.492 --> 00:32:29.595
he hauls him to his feet

00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:31.561
and marches him back to his truck.

00:32:33.531 --> 00:32:35.574
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:44.268
- [Voiceover] Agent Hawkins
has to constantly scan the area

00:32:44.268 --> 00:32:47.216
as he never knows who else is out there.

00:32:47.216 --> 00:32:48.668
One thing is for sure,

00:32:48.668 --> 00:32:50.734
border patrol agents
are constantly watched

00:32:50.734 --> 00:32:53.816
by drug smugglers on the
Mexican side of the border.

00:32:54.809 --> 00:32:57.276
- The immediate danger is the
person you're dealing with.

00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:58.187
You don't know who you have

00:32:58.187 --> 00:32:59.580
until you get them back and screened

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.286
and put through the system.

00:33:01.286 --> 00:33:03.422
You have to treat that individual

00:33:03.422 --> 00:33:06.406
as if they are a threat
until you have them secure.

00:33:06.406 --> 00:33:08.484
Handcuffed in a vehicle, properly searched

00:33:08.484 --> 00:33:10.526
and they'd no longer pose a threat.

00:33:10.526 --> 00:33:11.467
But while you're doing that,

00:33:11.467 --> 00:33:14.161
you also have to be aware
of your surroundings.

00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:15.507
There could be somebody else out there,

00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:17.585
somebody trying to come up behind you.

00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:18.920
If you don't have a partner

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.566
or a camera watching
your back, it's up to you

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:23.145
and you have to be aware
of your surroundings

00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:26.222
because if you focus on
that one person too much,

00:33:26.222 --> 00:33:28.660
you'll get what we call tunnel vision.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.703
And at that point somebody
could walk up behind you

00:33:30.703 --> 00:33:32.287
and take you out while
you're trying to deal

00:33:32.287 --> 00:33:34.053
with the other person.

00:33:35.526 --> 00:33:37.151
- [Voiceover] With the
coyote safely secured,

00:33:37.151 --> 00:33:39.427
Agent Hawkins drives a half mile down hill

00:33:39.427 --> 00:33:42.015
to help process the 17 illegal immigrants

00:33:42.015 --> 00:33:44.402
that were caught by Agent Bushell.

00:33:50.548 --> 00:33:52.693
(dog whining)

00:33:54.228 --> 00:33:55.807
Arizona has become the principle

00:33:55.807 --> 00:33:59.150
and deadliest gateway
for illegal immigrants.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.331
It accounts for nearly 1/3
of the 1.5 million people

00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:05.370
captured illegally crossing
the border each year.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.832
An average of 400 people die every year

00:34:08.832 --> 00:34:09.911
while attempting to cross

00:34:09.911 --> 00:34:12.614
the border from Mexico to the U.S..

00:34:13.591 --> 00:34:15.182
They are willing to risk everything,

00:34:15.182 --> 00:34:17.132
even death under the scorching sun

00:34:17.132 --> 00:34:19.129
to get to their destination.

00:34:26.623 --> 00:34:31.623
(slow tempo music)

00:34:43.249 --> 00:34:45.685
Agent Tyler Emblem has
been tracking a large group

00:34:45.685 --> 00:34:48.146
of illegal aliens throughout
the Sonoran Desert

00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:49.701
for over three hours.

00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:52.940
- We're going up to the north river area

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.181
on the Arizona side of the Colorado River.

00:34:55.181 --> 00:34:56.760
There's a lot of people
crossing in this area.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.489
It's one of the busiest
if not the busiest area

00:35:01.489 --> 00:35:02.720
of the United States right now

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.589
for illegal border crossers.

00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:07.294
This is pretty much ground
zero where we're at.

00:35:07.294 --> 00:35:08.351
- [Voiceover] While tracking at night,

00:35:08.351 --> 00:35:10.429
border patrol agents do
it from their Hummers

00:35:10.429 --> 00:35:13.911
in order to cover more
ground in less time.

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.256
Agent Emblem is able to
track a set of prints

00:35:16.256 --> 00:35:18.798
by shining his flashlight
along the ground.

00:35:18.798 --> 00:35:23.798
(slow tempo music)

00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:35.713
Working alone at night can be daunting

00:35:35.713 --> 00:35:38.946
for even the most experienced
border patrol agent.

00:35:40.252 --> 00:35:42.806
Agent Emblem has to keep cool at all times

00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:44.953
especially when moving
through the narrow reeds

00:35:44.953 --> 00:35:46.666
near the water's edge.

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.969
If he was ambushed by
armed drug smugglers,

00:35:49.969 --> 00:35:52.807
he would have little room
to maneuver or escape.

00:35:53.753 --> 00:35:54.833
- Just checking the water's edge

00:35:54.833 --> 00:35:55.715
to see if there's any groups

00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:57.956
that have crossed here on the rafts

00:35:57.956 --> 00:35:58.896
that would be making their way up

00:35:58.896 --> 00:36:00.725
along the river trail here.

00:36:02.216 --> 00:36:03.250
As you can see, it's real easy

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.536
for them to hide down in here.

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:06.349
You won't know they were here

00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:07.236
unless you got out on foot

00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:09.743
and came down here looking for them.

00:36:09.743 --> 00:36:10.823
You can't just stay in your vehicle.

00:36:10.823 --> 00:36:12.624
You got to get down here and

00:36:13.481 --> 00:36:16.361
beat the brush with the aliens down here.

00:36:16.361 --> 00:36:18.773
You can see right here where
they came out of the water.

00:36:19.541 --> 00:36:20.614
There's a barefoot right here

00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:23.734
and a couple running W tennis shoes.

00:36:23.734 --> 00:36:26.812
They'll swim across or
raft across right here

00:36:26.812 --> 00:36:28.535
and then they'll make their way

00:36:28.535 --> 00:36:31.135
along the edge of the river,
see a thick brush here.

00:36:31.135 --> 00:36:34.270
It's real easy for them to get
right back across the river.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.534
It's only maybe 50 yards here to my left.

00:36:43.313 --> 00:36:45.425
- [Voiceover] Agent Emblem
picks up fresh foot signs

00:36:45.425 --> 00:36:47.011
and is able to locate the direction

00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:49.654
the group of illegal aliens is going in.

00:36:51.515 --> 00:36:53.616
Once on the move, Agent Emblem radios

00:36:53.616 --> 00:36:55.555
Agent Boone Smith for assistance.

00:36:55.555 --> 00:36:57.076
- 10-4.

00:36:57.076 --> 00:36:58.295
- [Voiceover] He then heads back north

00:36:58.295 --> 00:37:00.610
into the heart of the Sonoran Desert.

00:37:04.215 --> 00:37:07.013
Tracking illegal aliens can
be a frightening experience

00:37:07.013 --> 00:37:09.475
especially when it's a
large group of people.

00:37:09.475 --> 00:37:11.377
- Well, when we're out
here working in the desert

00:37:11.377 --> 00:37:14.133
we typically come across,

00:37:14.133 --> 00:37:17.952
it's usually groups of people,
large groups of people.

00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:21.116
It's not just you know,
one on one or one on two,

00:37:21.116 --> 00:37:23.867
you know, there's one agent

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:26.455
for probably, you know, 20, 30.

00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:28.974
Sometimes 40 people.

00:37:28.974 --> 00:37:30.390
And one of the biggest groups I ever had

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.433
it was me, two other guys

00:37:32.433 --> 00:37:34.882
and we had 99 people out here.

00:37:34.882 --> 00:37:37.437
If a group was really
willing and really aggressive

00:37:37.437 --> 00:37:39.457
they could turn on the agent

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:42.069
and then you're in a really bad situation.

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:43.415
You're outnumbered

00:37:43.415 --> 00:37:45.981
and your backup could be you know,

00:37:45.981 --> 00:37:48.001
20, 30 to 40 minutes away.

00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:50.683
That's if you can get to
your radio to call for help.

00:37:50.683 --> 00:37:53.678
When that happens you got
to control the situation.

00:37:53.678 --> 00:37:56.023
You offer a strong, confident presence,

00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:58.019
a lot of the times that's good enough.

00:37:58.019 --> 00:38:00.678
The important thing is to go
home at the end of the night.

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:02.296
You know, go home safe

00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:04.645
and do your job as best to your ability.

00:38:05.674 --> 00:38:07.416
- Agent Emblem has to pay attention

00:38:07.416 --> 00:38:09.737
and focus on where the tracks are going

00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:11.154
as there are various footprints

00:38:11.154 --> 00:38:13.247
heading in different directions.

00:38:15.612 --> 00:38:18.037
- You really, really have to concentrate

00:38:18.037 --> 00:38:20.488
on this stuff out here when it
gets into this harder ground

00:38:20.488 --> 00:38:21.614
because there's so many other groups

00:38:21.614 --> 00:38:23.634
that have crossed out here.

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:26.907
You lose concentration
just for a little bit,

00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:28.884
you go to pick up your radio or

00:38:30.763 --> 00:38:32.922
just take your eyes off
it for a little bit,

00:38:32.922 --> 00:38:35.388
get on the wrong stuff and spend

00:38:35.388 --> 00:38:38.016
a little bit of time trying
to straighten things out.

00:38:38.882 --> 00:38:40.333
You get up here into the softer sand

00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.204
it will be a little bit easier.

00:38:48.135 --> 00:38:49.080
- [Voiceover] Even though tracking down

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.680
illegal intruders can take a long time,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.985
Agents Emblem and Smith

00:38:52.985 --> 00:38:55.585
are working against the clock.

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:57.024
They can tell by the footprints

00:38:57.024 --> 00:38:59.637
there are small children in the group.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:02.423
If they do not apprehend
the group before sunrise,

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:04.234
then by midday, the young and the old

00:39:04.234 --> 00:39:05.952
will stand little chance of surviving

00:39:05.952 --> 00:39:08.417
the penetrating heat of the desert.

00:39:10.352 --> 00:39:12.511
- Got them up here, Boone.

00:39:12.511 --> 00:39:15.152
I got to throw him the overheads him now

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:18.357
that I've got the foot sign up here.

00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:20.644
All right, the chase is on.

00:39:20.644 --> 00:39:24.689
(uptempo music)

00:39:24.689 --> 00:39:26.349
- [Voiceover] Agent Smith hits the gas

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:28.903
and his truck accelerates
through the desert.

00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:31.410
He knows that he is Agent
Emblem's only backup

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.047
within 10 square miles.

00:39:33.047 --> 00:39:35.369
- And here they are.

00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:37.505
Okay, Boone, I got bodies here.

00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:38.908
Can just light up.

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:43.918
- [Voiceover] Once Agent Emblem catches up

00:39:43.918 --> 00:39:45.578
to the group of illegal immigrants,

00:39:45.578 --> 00:39:47.486
he stops his truck and instructs them

00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:50.428
to stand up slowly and put
their hands on their head.

00:40:01.912 --> 00:40:06.803
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.475
- [Voiceover] He then tells
them to get into a single file.

00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:11.048
Agent Smith arrives on the scene

00:40:11.048 --> 00:40:14.420
with a 50-year old man that
was hiding behind the bush.

00:40:16.283 --> 00:40:18.326
Illegal immigrants are
willing to risk everything

00:40:18.326 --> 00:40:19.801
in order to get to a safe house

00:40:19.801 --> 00:40:21.548
in the U.S. border town.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.723
They will often travel
through the sun-seered terrain

00:40:24.723 --> 00:40:27.527
for numerous days on
end with little water.

00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:37.156
- And this little one here is four.

00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:40.291
This is a perfect example of a group,

00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.718
you'll get out here.

00:40:41.718 --> 00:40:44.413
Right now it's 1:00 in the morning.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:46.652
You look north up here

00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.253
there's nothing but open desert.

00:40:49.253 --> 00:40:50.985
This group gets out here.

00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:53.513
It doesn't look to me
like they have much water

00:40:53.513 --> 00:40:54.494
and we'll check here in a minute

00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:57.221
but come sunrise, eight,
9:00 in the morning,

00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.643
it's gonna be 90 degrees at
eight, 9:00 in the morning.

00:41:01.575 --> 00:41:04.559
By 10:00 it might already be 100.

00:41:04.559 --> 00:41:07.806
You meet a group like with
these kids, they can't keep up,

00:41:08.796 --> 00:41:10.735
you're just looking for problems here.

00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:14.078
There are the groups that
it's important we catch

00:41:14.078 --> 00:41:15.192
before they get too far north

00:41:15.192 --> 00:41:17.560
and they get into the danger zones.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.661
- When we have kids, the
parents over compensate.

00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:21.798
There's women out here who
will be carrying their kids

00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:25.924
and just they can't, they
suffer from heat distress,

00:41:25.924 --> 00:41:28.594
heat illness, dehydration.

00:41:28.594 --> 00:41:32.360
And like I had mentioned earlier,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.762
there's times where
you'll find the children

00:41:35.762 --> 00:41:37.944
and they're still alive and
they're still doing fine

00:41:37.944 --> 00:41:39.279
but the mother is dead

00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:40.881
because she's been carrying
the children across,

00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:43.400
you know, across a hot desert all day,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.198
and given the children all her water.

00:41:46.198 --> 00:41:49.872
The young males that have
made this trip a couple times,

00:41:49.872 --> 00:41:51.972
they're healthy, they're in good shape.

00:41:51.972 --> 00:41:54.805
They can usually fight through this stuff

00:41:54.805 --> 00:41:57.963
but it's the young kids,
the women, the older people,

00:41:57.963 --> 00:41:59.093
they're gonna have real problems

00:41:59.093 --> 00:42:01.967
crossing this desert in day or night.

00:42:02.941 --> 00:42:06.458
I have a daughter that's
one of those kid's age

00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:09.162
and I'll tell you, I would never ever

00:42:09.162 --> 00:42:11.705
put my kids through what these guys

00:42:11.705 --> 00:42:13.737
are putting their kids through tonight.

00:42:13.737 --> 00:42:15.641
Not in a million years.

00:42:15.641 --> 00:42:18.987
- Six, two? Tres?

00:42:18.987 --> 00:42:21.276
So we got nine bottles of water here,

00:42:21.276 --> 00:42:24.237
that's total of maybe
four gallons of water

00:42:24.237 --> 00:42:26.419
in whole for one, two, three, four, five,

00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:29.681
six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12 people.

00:42:29.681 --> 00:42:32.410
So, four gallons for 12 people.

00:42:34.225 --> 00:42:36.553
This is an accident
waiting to happen out here.

00:42:39.809 --> 00:42:41.213
- [Voiceover] After
Agents Emblem and Smith

00:42:41.213 --> 00:42:42.100
have checked that the group

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.341
are not suffering from dehydration,

00:42:44.341 --> 00:42:45.641
they begin to search the bags

00:42:45.641 --> 00:42:47.757
of those they suspect are smugglers.

00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:52.124
- [Voiceover] When apprehending smugglers,

00:42:52.124 --> 00:42:54.608
border patrol agents have
to interpret their actions

00:42:54.608 --> 00:42:56.071
in a fraction of a second

00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:58.738
as events can spiral out of control.

00:43:00.123 --> 00:43:02.247
While Agent Emblem searches the coyotes,

00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:05.367
Agent Smith checks their
bags for concealed weapons.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.480
- This guy's got a cellphone battery.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.919
He's got inside his bag there.

00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:14.392
This guy is probably our smuggler.

00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:18.281
We'll talk to the FOIs on duty tonight

00:43:18.281 --> 00:43:19.715
when we get back to the station.

00:43:19.715 --> 00:43:21.793
This guy's a little bit shady.

00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:22.668
Okay.

00:43:22.668 --> 00:43:27.074
(speaks in foreign language)

00:43:27.078 --> 00:43:29.144
- They're young, they're in the front.

00:43:29.144 --> 00:43:30.473
They don't really fit in.

00:43:30.473 --> 00:43:32.307
You know, you got a bunch of young kids

00:43:32.307 --> 00:43:34.396
and families and stuff
and then these two guys,

00:43:34.396 --> 00:43:36.341
or this guy right here.

00:43:36.341 --> 00:43:39.462
I think this guy is, I don't know.

00:43:39.462 --> 00:43:41.767
We'll have to look into it more.

00:43:59.615 --> 00:44:04.615
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:44:04.853 --> 00:44:06.261
That's it.

00:44:06.908 --> 00:44:08.475
Okay.

00:44:08.475 --> 00:44:10.070
(speaks in foreign language)

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.452
- [Voiceover] Once all
of the illegal aliens

00:44:11.452 --> 00:44:12.508
are in the truck,

00:44:12.508 --> 00:44:14.713
they are taken to a holding center in Yuma

00:44:14.713 --> 00:44:15.828
where they will stay overnight

00:44:15.828 --> 00:44:18.579
before they are deported back to Mexico.

00:44:25.753 --> 00:44:27.670
On a quiet road less than a mile outside

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.771
the city of Nogales, Arizona,

00:44:29.771 --> 00:44:31.129
Agents Hawkins and Bushell

00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:33.461
are sitting quietly in their truck.

00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:36.632
They are awaiting orders
to assist fellow agents

00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:39.267
who have been tipped off
about the illegal import

00:44:39.267 --> 00:44:42.958
of over 200 pounds of marijuana
into the United States.

00:44:44.293 --> 00:44:46.569
They gear up testing
their night vision goggles

00:44:46.569 --> 00:44:48.472
that turn the night from dense blackness

00:44:48.472 --> 00:44:50.051
punctured by stars,

00:44:50.051 --> 00:44:52.374
into an eerie green-tinted landscape

00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:54.277
on which they can see every bush,

00:44:54.277 --> 00:44:57.515
and on which people show
up like glowing ghosts.

00:45:01.358 --> 00:45:04.296
- [Voiceover] Head November 583, 10-98.

00:45:04.296 --> 00:45:05.677
- [Voiceover] As soon
as they've been informed

00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:07.557
that there's been a
sighting of several mules

00:45:07.557 --> 00:45:10.518
who are responsible for
transporting the marijuana,

00:45:10.518 --> 00:45:12.257
they move into action.

00:45:14.291 --> 00:45:16.560
U.S. border patrol agents
are a special breed

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.661
of law enforcement officers.

00:45:18.661 --> 00:45:20.565
At night, the U.S.-Mexican border

00:45:20.565 --> 00:45:23.319
can become a place of incredible violence.

00:45:24.686 --> 00:45:28.157
(thunder rumbles)

00:45:28.157 --> 00:45:30.339
- You need those extra mags, Bob?

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.997
- [Agent Bob] No.
- [Agent Jim] Okay.

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:36.504
- [Voiceover] Agent Bushell
quickly checks his M4 rifle

00:45:36.504 --> 00:45:38.570
as a split second decision
makes the difference

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.458
between life and death.

00:45:43.168 --> 00:45:44.190
(dog barking)

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.604
The border patrol agents
begin the comb the hillside

00:45:46.604 --> 00:45:48.878
in search of drug smugglers.

00:45:52.107 --> 00:45:53.988
While some agents search for the drugs,

00:45:53.988 --> 00:45:55.296
others stand guard,

00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:57.258
as their biggest fear
is the sharp shooters

00:45:57.258 --> 00:45:59.408
that work for the drug smugglers.

00:46:00.381 --> 00:46:01.554
They only have to pop their heads

00:46:01.554 --> 00:46:03.516
over the fence for a split second,

00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:06.499
and it could result in
the death of an agent.

00:46:06.499 --> 00:46:08.793
- This close to the fence
is especially (mumbles).

00:46:08.793 --> 00:46:10.354
Now we can't chase them into Mexico

00:46:10.354 --> 00:46:13.094
and they'll stand on the
Mexican side and shoot at us.

00:46:13.094 --> 00:46:15.540
So that's why we waited
until we had critical mass

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.235
and a lot of support agents.

00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:20.013
And when we go up here,
we come up in force.

00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:24.084
You notice, none of the guys
have their flashlights on

00:46:24.084 --> 00:46:25.744
so we're using light discipline.

00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:27.543
None of them are really talking very loud

00:46:27.543 --> 00:46:29.041
because we don't want to
give our positions away.

00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:31.839
It's still very hard to see at night.

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:35.241
Typically we wouldn't jump
narcotics as close to the fence

00:46:35.241 --> 00:46:36.622
but they're only going
to this neighborhood

00:46:36.622 --> 00:46:38.022
right down here to a safe house

00:46:38.022 --> 00:46:39.973
so it's a matter of two minutes

00:46:39.973 --> 00:46:41.286
before they get to where they need to go.

00:46:41.286 --> 00:46:44.246
So we had to jump them
as quickly as possible

00:46:44.246 --> 00:46:46.609
and it's a very dangerous
situation for us.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.271
- [Voiceover] Agents
continue to sweep the area

00:46:50.271 --> 00:46:51.966
unearthing every hiding place,

00:46:51.966 --> 00:46:55.228
searching for the mules
and the shipment of drugs.

00:46:55.228 --> 00:46:58.606
(thunder rumbles)

00:46:58.606 --> 00:47:00.231
- The camera's picked
up two more of the mules

00:47:00.231 --> 00:47:01.752
and they're running to the east.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.614
They were just down right here

00:47:03.614 --> 00:47:06.423
and we picked them up
on our infrared cameras.

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.537
And Bob is actually
the closest one to them

00:47:08.537 --> 00:47:11.990
so he's gonna go try to
see if he can find them.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.234
- [Voiceover] There is no room for error

00:47:13.234 --> 00:47:16.125
or second guessing a
fellow agent's actions.

00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:18.552
Everything has to run
smoothly and without a hitch

00:47:18.552 --> 00:47:20.630
as their lives are on the line.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:25.500
(slow tempo music)

00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:31.414
An agent finds several
containers of marijuana.

00:47:31.414 --> 00:47:33.132
The smugglers have abandoned their cargo

00:47:33.132 --> 00:47:35.348
and headed back across the border.

00:47:36.591 --> 00:47:38.728
As soon as they feel their job is done,

00:47:38.728 --> 00:47:42.046
border patrol agents start
pulling out of the danger zone.

00:47:44.846 --> 00:47:45.995
- [Agent Jim] He's
gonna run his dog again.

00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:47.307
- [Voiceover] Although
no arrests were made,

00:47:47.307 --> 00:47:50.576
the agents seized over
200 pounds of marijuana.

00:47:51.892 --> 00:47:54.353
If they did not take control
of the marijuana then,

00:47:54.353 --> 00:47:55.747
within days it would have been sold

00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:58.342
on street corners throughout the U.S..

00:48:01.307 --> 00:48:04.042
It's estimated that nearly
half the $65 billion

00:48:04.042 --> 00:48:07.317
U.S. worth of narcotics
bought by Americans each year

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:09.301
comes through Mexico.

00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:14.897
As much as 90% of cocaine
sold in the United States

00:48:14.897 --> 00:48:17.416
is smuggled through the Mexican territory.

00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:21.213
Mexico is also the number
two supplier of heroin

00:48:21.213 --> 00:48:24.271
and the largest foreign
source of marijuana.

00:48:25.334 --> 00:48:27.744
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:48:27.744 --> 00:48:29.381
- [Voiceover] It's 3 am and agent Emblem

00:48:29.381 --> 00:48:32.101
has caught his fifth
group of illegal aliens.

00:48:33.188 --> 00:48:34.393
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:48:34.393 --> 00:48:35.839
Okay.

00:48:40.615 --> 00:48:42.334
- [Voiceover] Even though
he understands their quest

00:48:42.334 --> 00:48:44.655
for a better life in the United States,

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:47.696
he is bound to his duty to uphold the law.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.664
- You just never know who's coming in.

00:48:54.128 --> 00:48:55.834
Yeah, it's true, majority
of the people want to come

00:48:55.834 --> 00:48:58.585
and earn an honest living.

00:49:00.188 --> 00:49:02.184
I understand that but

00:49:03.613 --> 00:49:06.248
people need to come through
the front door here.

00:49:06.248 --> 00:49:07.521
We have immigration laws

00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:08.728
that are set up for a reason

00:49:08.728 --> 00:49:11.379
and they should be followed.

00:49:12.524 --> 00:49:14.498
We need to assure that people that

00:49:14.498 --> 00:49:16.116
wish to do this country harm

00:49:16.116 --> 00:49:19.715
and the people that live
in this country harm,

00:49:19.715 --> 00:49:21.803
we need to make sure that we,

00:49:22.919 --> 00:49:24.678
that we're there to intercept them

00:49:24.678 --> 00:49:26.270
as they cross our border.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.734
That's what everybody does
out here day in and day out,

00:49:29.734 --> 00:49:31.510
night in and night out.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.273
There's people working this border

00:49:34.273 --> 00:49:36.524
to intercept everybody that comes in.

00:49:37.918 --> 00:49:41.128
Some do get away and we hope
that they're not bad ones.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.960
(uptempo music)
