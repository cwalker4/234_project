00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.200
The Olympic marathon
affords its runners

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.760
at least one moment of glory.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
After more than 25 miles of
punishment along city streets -

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.400
that's more than
40,000 metres -

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.320
the final lap of the race

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.600
takes place inside the Olympic
Stadium.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.600
When an athlete arrives
at the stadium

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800
and hears the roar of the
crowd,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.600
the pain and the suffering
becomes worthwhile.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.680
Amazingly, the 1984 Marathon
in Los Angeles

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.080
was the first time

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.920
that moment of glory could be
experienced by female athletes.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680
Before the 1984 Games,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.960
the longest race available for
women was the 1,500 metres.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.120
Women had been barred

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.680
from track-and-field
competition altogether

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.400
until 1928, where the 800
metres

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.240
was the longest race
they were permitted to run.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920
Olympic officials considered
long-distance running

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.240
to be too demanding for women.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.200
The Los Angeles marathon was
a huge step towards equality,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760
and the crowd knew it.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.720
The noise that greeted
the USA's Joan Benoit

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.600
as she entered the stadium,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.680
becoming the first female
marathon winner in history,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.480
was spine-tingling.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.920
She won by nearly
a minute and a half.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.920
But not everyone came
bursting into the stadium

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.880
riding a crest of adrenaline.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.600
Here, for instance, is how

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.520
Gabriela Andersen-Schiess
of Switzerland

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.000
entered the Los Angeles
Coliseum on August 5th 1984.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.680
Just look at her go.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.240
OK, perhaps Andersen-Schiess
is not the best example

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.120
of record-breaking speed,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.920
but the performance of
this 39-year-old Swiss athlete

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.800
is far more memorable than
anything

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.520
even the winner managed
that day.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.600
Despite battling heat
exhaustion,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.400
and seemingly on the brink of
complete physical collapse,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.400
she got around the course.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.280
Sometimes, one lap of the track

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.280
can seem like a very long way
to go.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.000
The crowd in the stadium sensed

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.200
that it was seeing something
special.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.440
It stood to applaud
her every uncertain step.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.040
Marathons are never easy,
but this one was brutal.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360
The race had started that day
in Santa Monica,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760
with temperatures of
around 19 degrees Celsius.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.720
But by the time the race ended,
it was up around 25 degrees.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.760
But more troubling than that
was the humidity -

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.760
that was climbing close to 95%.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.920
Andersen-Schiess later admitted

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360
that she didn't acclimatise
properly

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.520
to the conditions in Los
Angeles.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.400
Crucially, she missed
the last aid station

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.200
before getting to the stadium.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.320
She failed to take on water
when her body needed it most.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.720
By the time she arrived
to the stadium,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.640
a staggering bundle of agony,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.960
Joan Benoit had been
the champion

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.480
for about 20 minutes.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.600
Benoit ran way ahead of the
pack after about 15km

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.040
and never looked back.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.440
When Andersen-Schiess appeared,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.800
she was running on willpower
alone.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.440
Medics immediately ran to her
aid,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.800
but Andersen-Schiess
shooed them away -

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.960
if they gave her assistance
she would be disqualified.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.840
It was no idle threat -
there was precedent.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.960
Italy's Dorando Pietri had
his gold medal revoked in 1908,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.320
when he had been helped
across the line.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
Andersen-Schiess didn't
have a gold medal at stake

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.080
but her pride was on the line.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.840
The medics saw that
Andersen-Schiess

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.080
was still perspiring,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.800
which was a good thing.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.960
It meant she did not
have heat stroke.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.280
The medical situation was not
as dire as might be feared.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
They allowed her to make her
journey

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.120
to the finish line unassisted.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.880
When she got to the line

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.040
after 5 minutes and 44 seconds
on the track,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.160
Andersen-Schiess finally broke
down.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.320
Her time of 2 hours
48 minutes and 44 seconds

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.800
placed her 37th of
the 44 runners who finished.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.560
It wasn't gold-medal pace,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.600
but it was something to be
proud of.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.440
Few performances
have ever represented

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.000
the spirit of competition,
determination and grit

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.000
as much as that lap by
Gabriela Andersen-Schiess,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.840
and it made a mockery
of the old idea

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720
that female athletes lacked
the heart and the willpower

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.360
to take on the toughest
long-distance challenge of all.
