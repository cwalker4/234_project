(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.804 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So what's fun
sometimes is, I mean,

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.873
we're done taping now, so.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.375
(audience laughing)

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.309
Now we can say the real things.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.643
- Now we can really talk.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.578 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Now we can really get down.
(Kamala laughing)

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.846
Now we can really get down.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.981
I have one question, and
then, think of questions

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.916
that you have as well,
and then I'll come to you

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.219
in the audience, and
please, this is someone

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
who's running for
president, so don't be like,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.454
what's your favorite color?

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.822
Like, think of a real question,

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.125 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience laughing)
and then you'll get to ask it.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.560
I have one question,
which is a silly one,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.663
but it goes to what we
spoke about earlier,

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.333 align:start size:88% position:13%
in terms of what
people consider scandal

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.701
for everyone who's not Trump.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.236
- Yeah.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.804 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You are on The Breakfast
Club and they asked you

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.006
if you'd ever smoked
weed, and you said yes,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.574
and then, someone said to you,

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.009
oh, what music were
you listening to?

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.977
Someone said, what
were you listening to

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.478
when you were getting high?

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.179 align:start size:97% position:3%
Everyone asked you four
questions at the same time.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.680
- Right, right.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.948 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And they came out, and
you said, I listen to Snoop,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.216
I listen to Cardi B,
I listen to Tupac,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.885
and then, Fox News
and stuff came out,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.686
and they were like,
there was no Tupac

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.888
when you were in college.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, right.
(audience laughing)

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.624
It was crazy.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:01.227 align:start position:0%
It was literally, my
communications team said to me,

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.397
there's thing that's going on
out there that has happened,

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.232 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I was like, I
thought they were joking,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.601
I literally thought
they were joking.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.204
I don't, listen, I don't know,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:12.505
are people just bored?

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start size:97% position:3%
Or are they not
understanding complex issues,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so they have to
be distracted by those

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.213
that really have no difference
in the lives of other people?

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.881
- I genuinely think
it's that people

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.316
have gotten used to it.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.953 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think, unlike Trump,
because regular politicians,

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:29.222 align:start size:88% position:13%
as in normal people
don't have the scandals

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.558
that he does, you don't
have a porn star, so.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:32.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Right.
(audience laughing)

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.726 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So we have to focus on--
- Right.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:34.994
- [Trevor] Tupac.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.297
My part of that, the
scandal for me was,

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.333
how were you listening
to Tupac and enjoying him

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.701
as a prosecutor?

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
Because he said some
things about prosecutors

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.405
in his songs, and
I was like, damn,

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.707
were you never personally
offended by any of that?

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, of course not.
- No?

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.211
- No, I mean, and listen.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.114 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, Tupac also sang
about the love of a mother.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.648
- Oh, that's true.
- Remember that?

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.951
- That's true, Dear Mama.
- I mean, Dear Mama, right?

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.252
- That's true.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.154
- I mean, she would be,
you know, she loved him.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.622
- Right.
- And so,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.491 align:start size:94% position:6%
that was the range of
Tupac, and Tupac also had

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.427
his Bay Area connection,
and so there was a pride

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.864 align:start size:97% position:3%
that was associated with
that, but Tupac was prolific.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.233
He really was, and he
died far too young.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.402
I mean, you know, he, it
would be interesting to see

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.505
where that whole genre went,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.039
had he lived longer.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.508
- Huh, interesting.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.577
- Because he was so smart,
in the way that he understood

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
politics, social justice
issues, you know,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.115
and if you know his background,

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.517
his family was active before.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.985
- [Trevor] Yes, yes.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.289
- So he actually was speaking
to large numbers of people

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a historical
context, and some idea

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:42.629
about where we should be, but
also, really well-articulate

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
about the social injustice
that was happening

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.768 align:start size:94% position:6%
at that moment, which
included the war on drugs,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.937
which included what
was going on in terms

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:54.107 align:start size:97% position:3%
of massive incarceration of
young black men in particular,

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.975 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he spoke to that.
- He really did.

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:57.477
- And he was right.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Trevor] Now I'm imagining
Tupac just around today,

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
as like a businessman.
(audience laughing)

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.816
- I mean, it'd be interesting.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.984
- It would be interesting,
no, 'cause a lot of them

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
have become very
like, I mean, you look

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.554
at how rap has changed
and evolved, you know,

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.523 align:start size:84% position:16%
just picture Tupac
just in the boardroom.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.025
- Well, you know,
I mean, everybody.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.860
- My shareholders and my
plan is to pay you back.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.128
(audience laughing)

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.563
Did you guys think
about your questions?

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.830
What do we have?

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.732
You were jumping up there.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.301 line:0%
You were jumping up hard.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.293 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- Yeah, so that's, that's
an interesting point.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.462
Here's how I think about it.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
First of all, especially
to your point,

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:57.003
in this moment, where we
have such powerful voices

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.672 align:start size:97% position:3%
that are trying to sow
hate and division among us,

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think it's really important
that we reject that,

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:06.479
and we reject it in a way
that also speaks the truth,

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.615
which is that the
vast majority of us

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.584 align:start size:97% position:3%
have so much more in common
than what separates us,

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.086
and I know that to be true,

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.288
and the way that I think of
it and that I talk of it,

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
wherever I go, whatever
the demographic

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the group I'm
speaking with is this.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.928
I talk about it in the context

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.830
of the middle of
the night thought,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.632 align:start size:97% position:3%
some people call it the
three in the morning thought,

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.433
other people call it
the witching hour,

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:28.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know, in the
middle of the night,

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.036
when you wake up
with that thought

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.304
that's been weighing on you,

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.339
sometimes, you wake
up in a cold sweat.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.441 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's when Trump tweets.
- Well--

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.909
(audience laughing)

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.845 align:start size:97% position:3%
Right, and so for that reason,
some of us wake up, just,

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know, right, exactly.
(Trevor laughing)

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:43.416
Panicked, but for the
vast majority of us,

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
when we wake up in the
middle of the night

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:48.388
with that thought, one, it
is never through the lens

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start size:94% position:6%
of the party with which
we are registered to vote,

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.093
it is never through the
lens of some demographic

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.230 align:start size:97% position:3%
a pollster put us in, and
for the vast majority of us,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.631 align:start size:84% position:16%
when we wake up
thinking that thought,

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.034
it has to do with one of
just a very few things,

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.069
our personal health, the
health of our children,

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.838
or our parents, can I
get a job, keep a job,

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.173 align:start size:84% position:16%
pay the bills by the
end of the month,

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.108
retire with dignity?

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.677
The vast major, or students,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.111 align:start size:84% position:16%
can I pay off those
student loans?

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.882 align:start size:97% position:3%
So many families in America,
can I help my relative

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:19.952
get off of the opioids
that have addicted them?

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
The vast majority of us
have so much more in common

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:26.459 align:start size:84% position:16%
than what separates
us, and so part of how

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.595
we get to that place
is we start with that

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.898 align:start size:94% position:6%
as our premise and really
know it in our heart,

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:35.335
in our mind, in our soul,
and then go from there,

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.337
and it's gonna be about
unifying the country

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
around the commonalities
that we have.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:42.975 align:start size:97% position:3%
There are certain people we'll
never be able to talk with

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.412
on any extreme spectrum, right?

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:49.716
But I'll tell you, as
another kind of story

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:53.519
about the campaign
trail, yesterday, I
was in New Hampshire.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.622 align:start size:84% position:16%
And when I was
there, the reporters,

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:59.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
the first line of
questioning I got was

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.560
you're in New Hampshire,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.195
we heard you're not gonna
come to New Hampshire.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.463
We thought you weren't gonna try

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.164
and compete in New Hampshire,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.267
and what no one said
but the inference was,

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.938
well, the demographic of New
Hampshire is not who you are

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.607 align:start size:94% position:6%
in terms of your race
and who you are in terms,

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.876
and I was like, no, I am
competing in New Hampshire.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.213
I'm gonna be here, and I'm
gonna tell you something.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.182 align:start position:0%
To the point of the
universality and the commonality

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.819
of the message, I got to
New Hampshire, Trevor,

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.321
there was a line
around the block,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.656
there were 1500 people who
showed up for our event.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.225
- You had overflow,
we saw that, yeah.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.227
- But, and what that tells me,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.830
it reinforces for
me the commonality,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.534 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the demographics
don't matter.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.437
When it comes down to it,
it is going to be about

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.739
that when we're waking up
in the middle of the night

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.609
or at that kitchen table,
you know, after dinner,

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:52.078
trying to pay the bills
and get through the week,

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:55.381 align:start position:0%
the biggest issues that
concern us are the same issues,

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:58.584
and that is not to say that
we also should not talk about

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.920
and don't need to deal with
the issue of race in America,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.656
the issue of sexism and
homophobia, transphobia,

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:07.126 align:start size:88% position:13%
antisemitism, because
those all are real, too.

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:08.828
And if nobody was
clear about that,

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:11.531
then Charlottesville and
the Tree of Life synagogue

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
and Mother Emanuel Church should
make it clear to everybody

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.269
that we still have
a lot of work to do

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.970
on those issues, as well.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.307
But I find that most people,
regardless of their demographic

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.976 align:start size:97% position:3%
want to have that
conversation and are willing

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.179
to have that conversation
in our country right now.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience applauding)
- Let me,

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:31.250
we'll take one from this side.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.020
Yes, sir?

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:24.136 line:0%
- Yep.

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.950 line:0%
- [Kamala] Path, and a path.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.753
- [Trevor] How do you?

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:41.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's a great question.
(audience applauding)

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.788
- Right, right.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.194 align:start size:94% position:6%
So first of all, Jesus,
thank you for your courage

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.397
to speak up and speak
out at this moment,

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.598 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience applauding)
and to do what you're doing.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:57.236
'Cause that's really important.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.705
And I think part of how
we will get to the place

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.642
that we need to be, but also,
the place we're going to get,

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.545
history is gonna show that
there are a bunch of people

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.179 align:start size:88% position:13%
right now who are on the
wrong side of history

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.181
on this issue of immigration.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.685 align:start size:94% position:6%
The reality is that we are
a nation of immigrants.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.021 align:start size:84% position:16%
It has been a source
of our strength,

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:19.725
and part of the way that we
do is that we have a plan

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.261
and we stick to
the plan, but we,

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.331
Congress has not passed a bill

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.199
around comprehensive
immigration reform,

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.001
and by every indication,

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.237
this president wouldn't sign it.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.939
The way we get there
is we have to pass

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.607 align:start size:84% position:16%
comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:38.544
We have to put in place the
rules that are consistent,

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.613
and equally applied to everyone,

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.516 align:start size:97% position:3%
around how people get on the
path towards citizenship,

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:47.286
how people apply, what
are the qualifications?

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:50.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
As you know, this is also
not, the immigrant population

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start size:94% position:6%
coming to the United
States is not a monolith.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.428
There are people who
come with H1B visas,

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.197 align:start size:88% position:13%
there are people who
are DACA, like yourself,

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:01.801
young people who, you still
had to qualify for DACA,

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.437
you went through a process
and you passed that process,

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.106
that's why you got
the DACA coverage,

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.508 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we have to
keep our promises.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.611
Part of the failure of
our system right now

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that this administration
is not keeping

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:16.716
America's promise to
you as a DACA student

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.218
or a DACA young person,
and we're not keeping

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:22.855 align:start size:94% position:6%
our promise to who we
are as a nation by having

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.124
a meaningful path
for citizenship

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.892
around comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.628
But what awe have to do
is Congress has to act

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.630 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the president
has to sign the bill.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.366 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I will ask you one question
to that before you leave.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.736
There was a time when
the negotiation landed

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.439
in and around a wall
in exchange for DACA,

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:42.675 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it was give us
this one time payment,

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.578 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we will give you
DACA in exchange.

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
You were one of the
three senators, I think,

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
who voted against that.
- Yes.

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.318 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Some would say, Senator
Harris, why wouldn't you give

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.655 align:start size:94% position:6%
Trump his wall in exchange
for all of these people

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.924
to receive the DACA and to
stay in the United States?

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.292 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Kamala] Because
I did not agree

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.094
with holding these kids ransom.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.029 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There you go.
(audience applauding)

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.031
- And that's what that was.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.766
That's what that was.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:10.603
Period.

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:13.239
We made a promise to these kids.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:16.409
He can tell you, in a
longer conversation,

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.711
how he went through a
process of answering

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:22.381
a multitude of questions,
about the circumstances

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
of his arrival, about
what kind of life

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.952
he is living right now.

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.320
Is he living a productive life?

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.655
Has he ever committed a crime?

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.290
They went through
a whole series,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start size:88% position:13%
and when they vetted
and passed, we told them

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
that they would
receive protection,

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:39.165
and one of the most important
aspects of what we told them

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:44.170 align:start size:97% position:3%
is we told them, if you answer
these questions to qualify,

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.039
we will not share that
information with ICE,

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
we will not deport you,
that's what we told

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:52.211
these young people, and now,

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:56.549 align:start size:97% position:3%
this administration is
prepared to break that promise

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.484 align:start size:84% position:16%
and share that
information with ICE.

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.786
That is wrong, and I'm
not gonna support that.

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.088
I'm not gonna support that,

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.355
and that's why I
voted against it.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.324
(audience applauding)

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:07.993
(upbeat music)
