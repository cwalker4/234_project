Margaret Atwood, Tarana Burke,

your work gives truth
to the words:

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:45.811
"When women succeed,
America succeeds."

the election of
more than 100 women

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.526

These women are fighting
to see a paycheck fairness,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:16.242

equal pay for equal work.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.144
- [cheering and applause]

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.414

and assault on women
in our country,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.596

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.835

every place in our community.

for America's future
and for all Americans.
