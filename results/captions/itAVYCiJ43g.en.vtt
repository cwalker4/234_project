00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.670
Robert Reilly: David Goldman is not only an
economist with a lot of experience on Wall

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:22.180
Street, he’s a music critic and a music
theoretician who has taught on that subject.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.320
Of course he’s best known not as David Goldman
but as Spengler through his years and years

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.380
of extraordinary articles and columns in the
Asia Times, which I have followed [and] which

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:47.460
I’m sure many of you did as wel always wondering
who could this man be who knows Islam so well,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.340
knows the Middle East so well, Turkey, who
knows of course the Asian War affect, the-

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:03.480
who knows everything and so finally he’s
been exposed as indeed David Goldman who’s

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.140
going to talk to us tonight on, “Will China
Overtake the US as the World’s Leading Superpower?”

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.469
question mark. I just want to share with you
because it’s such a delicious quote and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.549
there are a number of you in the audience
tonight who have worked in the intelligence

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.929
world, the quote about our speaker by the
former CIA National Intelligence Council vice

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:37.340
chairman Herbert E Meyer. Quote, “Ask anyone
in the intelligence business to name the world’s

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.820
most brilliant intelligence service and we’ll
all give the same answer: Spengler. David

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.639
Goldman’s Spengler columns provide more
insight than the CIA, mi6, and the Mossad

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.799
combined.” Please join me in welcoming David
Goldman.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.859
David Goldman: I’m humbled to be invited
to such a distinguished group in the presence

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.550
ofso many people as work I’ve admired for
many years, including Bob Reilly’s. Bob’s

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.351
work on music by the way is some of the most
interesting and important I’ve read. His

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:25.110
book in 20th century music I think should
be the standard on the subject so I throw

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.110
that in as a free advertisement. The good
the simple answer to the question, “will

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.770
China try to overtake the United States as
leading world as a new superpower?” is yes

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.770
unless we change the course. The hour is late
and it’s time to be alarmed. I’ll explain

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:53.730
the point of my title, “Geeks in a new Roman
Empire in a moment. How you measure the Chinese

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.920
economy… the Chinese economy is either 20
percent larger than ours or 20 percent smaller,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.590
what the world bank calls purchasing power
parity, that’s the actual cost to do business.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.230
So for example if you want to create a research
lab and develop a new hypervelocity missile

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.780
inside of the costs of the engineering personnel
will be considerably less so the GDP of China

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.440
that respect to be upgraded a bit if you calculate
it in ordinary U.S. dollar terms they’re

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.760
still somewhat behind us but even so given
the growth rate of the Chinese economy sometime

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.810
in the early 2020s it is very likely that
China over it will overtake us in nominal

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.960
dollar terms and however we measure it it
will be roughly our size given that China

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.210
is growing at six or seven percent a year
which is a doubling every ten or twelve years

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.460
not very long from now the Chinese threat
that we have now will double we’re like

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.700
hercules wrestling the giant and TAS the daughter
of gaia ‘the the earth goddess who every

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.850
time he touches the ground doubles in strength.
Hercules finally had to strangle him in midair

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.700
and the problems that we now face are going
to be much greater in the future and if we

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.320
don’t address them we’ll be dealing with
a power that will in many ways swamp us I’ll

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.650
try to explain what those ways are first I’d
like to say something about what China is

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.530
China is a civilization that has been with
us for five thousand years does much more

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.939
much older than us it has had periods of extreme
decline and chaos followed by periods of reconstruction

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:53.629
but overall it’s certainly one of the world’s
few truly successful civilizations according

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:59.930
to the linguists not quite a hundred and fifty
thousand languages have been spoken on planet

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.590
earth since the dawn of man of those perhaps
five thousand is still spoken but if you eliminate

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.780
the languages spoken by a few hundred people
in the New Guinea Highlands and the ones that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:21.360
are likely to survive another 100 years you
get into the hundreds so of this enormous

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.319
pool of languages and cultures Chinese culture
has been one of the very few successes coming

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:36.630
from a younger and also reasonably successful
culture which is the Jewish culture I look

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:45.710
at the Chinese in all they should never be
underestimated what makes China China what

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.669
is it how does it understand itself until
the Jesuits turned up in the 16th century

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.740
matera Ricci and his colleagues China simply
understood itself as civilization China was

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:08.289
a civilizing principle it was a means of unifying
different ethnicities on the basis of very

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:16.139
different principle than Rome or Alexander
or the Holy Roman Empire or any entity in

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.979
the West or its antecedents and I think that’s
best illustrated by what it’s like to be

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:31.050
a Chinese child Chinese children but I was
very bumptious and sort of have a free happy-go-lucky

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.219
kind of existence until they’re about six
at which point they’re given a pen and the

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.650
pot of ink and a piece of paper and they’re
told now you’re going to learn the characters

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.490
and for the next six or seven years they’ll
spend four hours a day learning the characters.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:56.509
China managed to combine roughly 70 major
language groups by having a unified written

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:04.979
language and entirely diverse spoken languages
it’s not until very recently with the advent

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:11.029
of telecommunications and the centralizing
influence the Mandarin dialect the old Beijing

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:17.249
imperial court dialect that China has said
anything like the unifying culture in the

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:22.999
sense that we understand culture know what
Chinese mother for thousands of years sang

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:31.180
a lullaby to a child in Chinese Chinese was
what you wrote this duality lies at the heart

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:40.060
of Chinese strength and Chinese fragility
China has never quite been unified it’s

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:51.430
like a bag full of operas Lee charge magnets
held together by super glue. China’s trying

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:59.849
to spend a hundred years until the Communist
revolution the so-called century of humiliation

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:07.580
disunited dominated by warlords with civil
wars that may have cost up to a hundred million

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.869
lives in the middle of the 19th century the
Taiping rebellion for example this is still

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:20.059
a living memory there are people who remember
this in the 1930s and 1940s so China’s paranoia

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:28.499
about a rebel province Taiwan breaking away
or a Tibet is deeply rooted in the fragility

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:36.620
of Chinese history but at the same time the
process of acculturation of Chinese citizens

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:45.279
is so intense and so deep requiring so much
effort and felt hood that the unifying characteristics

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:50.411
have a kind of have a different kind of strength
which no supranational entity in the West

00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:57.230
has ever achieved important to remember that
China had by some estimates 30 percent literacy

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:06.490
2,000 years ago when literacy in the West
was a tiny fraction of that now China essentially

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:14.820
grew from the tiny area to notify the Shang
Dynasty 3,500 years ago by making its neighbors

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.160
an offer they couldn’t refuse. The offer
was you become Chinese which is you learn

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.380
the characters you adopt Chinese dress, Chinese
customs, and you pay taxes to the Emperor

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:32.279
who will be the arbiter of conflicts among
various ethnicities and so forth. That’s

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:41.380
a option one. Option two is we kill you all
and it won’t well effectively fine a basically

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.709
reached its current geographical boundaries
which were natural the Gobi Desert that million

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:54.300
mountains and the oceans by the year 700 they
haven’t changed substantially since then

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.900
nor are they likely to change this is not
Rome or Alexander or the British Empire or

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.220
the Comintern which wants to conquer masses
of territory China wishes to project influence

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:15.209
but it does not look it is not in thirteen
hundred years fourteen hundred years look

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:23.519
for territorial expansion the differences
between China and the West are deeply set

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:30.410
the most important thing we’ll notices in
China is that there are no subsidiary institutions

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:37.810
to use the terminology from Catholic social
theory there’s no Football League no Church

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:47.930
bingo game no Board of Education that is or
that’s organized outside the imperial struck

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:55.360
which is run by the Communist Party which
tolerates no competition the fundamental unit

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:03.920
in China’s society was never a subsidiary
organization like New England churches that

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.050
elected their own clergy and didn’t like
Anglican bishops telling them what to do it’s

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:19.569
nested dolls the fundamental unit was the
extended family form in which the head of

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:27.639
the form was admitted for Emperor and many
forms formed a clan which had a head who was

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:32.100
another slightly less miniature Emperor going
up to a provincial governor going up to the

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:38.089
Emperor it was a structure that reproduced
itself down to the capillary level of society

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:46.670
that in a deeply oversimplified summary is
what Confucianism is my friend Francesco see

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:53.320
she came from a writer for ancient times points
out that the Chinese conception of law rights

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.260
and obligations is radically different from
the West starting with the Romans and certainly

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.420
ancient Israel elsewhere the state was an
entity to which one had obligations and from

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.540
which one derived rights and privileges in
Rome he paid her taxes he served in the army

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.480
you could demand certain things of the state
you had certain economic benefits as it is

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:22.630
in you’d deserve protection and so forth
it was a very well defined quid pro quo engraved

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:30.839
in common law shana you do what the emperor
feels like at the moment and you hope you

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:36.570
get a reward there’s no sense of rights
and privileges. China is radically different

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.770
than Japan. Japanese love their emperor. The
Chinese have never loved their emperor. The

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:47.089
emperor is a necessary evil. Chinese will
tell you today we’ve always had a temper.

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:51.779
Why should we change now? When we didn’t
have a strong Emperor we killed each other.

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.440
Look at the century of humiliation so we don’t
like the common party we don’t like any

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.550
of these people they’re tax collectors they’re
brutal and they’re arbitrary but without

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:07.880
them we would all kill each other close this
part of it with an anecdote I I worked for

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:17.500
several years for an investment banking boutique
in Hong Kong Chinese owned we took a number

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:24.060
of tech companies public and got a good view
of some of the more interesting things happen

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.300
in the Chinese economy at once and I wrote
a research report and included the name of

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.930
young Chinese colleague otic he said why did
you do that I said well I’m trying to give

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.290
your career a little help it’s what you
do he said no one in China does that I said

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:48.300
really you said in China no one has any friends
at age six you look around yourself in primary

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:54.620
school and try to figure out whom you’re
going to walk over to get ahead that is not

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:03.629
a lack of altruism it’s the way the system
is gamed because in parallel to this arbitrary

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:12.139
Imperial structure China said it for 3,000
years of form of meritocracy which has been

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:17.019
on many occasions highly effective that’s
the Mandarin system you passed the Mandarin

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:25.440
exams your family becomes rich so a vast number
of people spend their families will find one

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.830
talented boy invest all the resources to try
to get him to pass the matter of exam so it

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:38.199
can elevate the entire family China has no
header hitter had hereditary aristocracy unlike

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:44.220
the west no Dukes counts princes and so forth.
There are no aristocratic families but they

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:50.029
tend to last two or three hundred years. They
keep turning over because talent from the

00:14:50.029 --> 00:14:57.860
base is allowed it’s a cold-hearted and
merciless meritocracy but it still works the

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:06.589
one thing she Jinping cannot do is to get
one of his children into Peking University

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:13.450
or Shema university you have to pass the exam
and get the right score of course there are

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.351
people who hire professional exam passers
and with fake fingerprints to get to the security

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:24.000
there’s a whole industry and cheated on
exams but the principle is nonetheless there

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.560
that’s one of the great difficulties we
have in communication with Chinese if you

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:35.399
meet any Chinese public official of any significant
rank you’re guaranteed that he or she has

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:42.139
an IQ of over 150 it’s as if we had a government
entirely composed of National Merit Scholars

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:51.670
not semi-finalists because out of the vast
population you select out the brightest by

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:58.529
competitive exam systems and those are the
people who manage the government the difficulty

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:04.120
the Chinese have is understanding that democracies
frequently advance stupid people you’re

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.810
talking to people who since the age of 12
have never met a stupid person and they’re

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:16.889
completely unable to believe that some of
the things we do are not conspiratorial subterfuges

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:29.420
but simply incompetence and 
dynasties have always fallen in China because

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.800
they become soft and corrupt of it and then
get invaded or because they’re successful

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.490
and the population expands faster than the
arable land China’s cursed with a very small

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:48.629
portion of arable terrible territory so lack
of arable land has always produced peasant

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:55.750
rebellions chronically the current dynasty
has had a very simple solution decimate the

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:01.629
peasants and there won’t be a rebellion
that’s the reason for the one-child policy

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:07.910
it’s a social control mechanism overpopulation
overthrew other dynasties okay we get rid

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:14.740
of the population you’ve always been plenty
of side it’s one of the cruelest policies

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:22.539
that any government in history has ever adopted
really ruthless but that’s the motivation

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:30.540
second thing of course is since peasants tend
to be fractious as Mao Zedong observed famously

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:38.410
in his report on Hunan in the 1930s eliminate
the peasantry moved them to the cities put

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.909
them into a polygon block of urban residents
with people who come from other provinces

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:53.900
can’t even talk to each other and of course
keep trying to prosperous maintain the mandate

00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:01.169
of heavy and make China impregnable so what
is fine is problem China’s problem is the

00:18:01.169 --> 00:18:07.770
same as that of every other country in the
world and I’d like to step back and mention

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:15.230
a bit of wisdom from Robert Mundell the grandfather
of supply-side economics, 1999 Nobel Prize

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:22.270
winner in economics who observed that chronic
current account deficits are the result of

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:29.120
aging all capital markets are as young people
borrowing from old people old people need

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.760
to retire young people need to raise families
start businesses old people of savings and

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.789
they lend money to young people what happens
if you have a country with lots of old people

00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:46.809
who need to lend money to retire on but they
don’t have a lot of young people well you

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:52.409
find another country which has young people
and you lend the money to them how do you

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:58.150
get the money you sell the more Goods than
they sell to you that’s what national savings

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:06.340
is it turns into a current account surplus
so there’s a relationship and a loose relationship

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:11.650
between the percent of population over 65
and the current account balance as a percentage

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:18.049
of GDP this is what Mandela predicts now of
course it’s a loose relationship and how

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:24.250
far you are from the regression line is an
important data point so I’ve labeled the

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:30.049
one the countries who have more of a current
account balance then their position and age

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:34.159
would indicate it’s the ants and the ones
below it as the grasshoppers the ants are

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:39.220
saving the grasshopper it’s a district because
I’m try that is way above the line we’re

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.760
way below the line now since the whole world
the whole world doesn’t appear to be age

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.610
if you look at the UN population tables it
appears static but that’s deceptive because

00:19:50.610 --> 00:20:01.049
most of the young people are in Africa or
South Asia and it’s very difficult to invest

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:09.820
Western capital in a politically safe product
productive fashion in countries with low educational

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:15.929
infrastructure poor political governance and
so forth so actually there’s a race on to

00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:23.030
control those markets which are investable
and that’s the decisive race in the world

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:29.360
today Chinese have a rapidly aging population
the question for every population of the world

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:36.559
is will you get rich before you get old in
the past I’ve drawn attention to the extraordinary

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:43.610
fact that Iran will without any doubt be the
first country that gets very old without getting

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:50.240
rich and all this is because of the extraordinary
fact that the Iranians running around today

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.809
in their 30s 40s childbearing age come from
families with an average of seven children

00:20:56.809 --> 00:21:04.409
they’re having one and a half to two children
1.6 1.7 never in the history of the world

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:15.149
has there been such a radical and sudden shock
to fertility behavior that means in 20 years

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:22.549
from now there will be only one and a half
Iranians of working age to support every elderly

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:27.940
Iranian so grandma’s going to be left to
starve in a garret and the society will break

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:36.480
down Iran is the Walking Dead you can now
China is age not as fast as Iran but it’s

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.789
aging as a result of the one-child policy
that’s been rescinded it’s our – child

00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:50.120
policy it’s yet to be seen whether it having
been muscled into a certain kind of fertility

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:56.100
behavior that findings population will change
but China’s problem is they need to save

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:04.649
massively in order to meet their their future
obligations to an age and generation Germans

00:22:04.649 --> 00:22:12.640
will tell you exactly the same thing so China
is proposing to take over Eurasia and make

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:22.559
it a greater age greater a ragin co-prosperity
sphere or in their language one belt one road

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:27.929
this is a trillion-dollar investment program
three years ago this looked like one more

00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:35.590
propaganda exercise by Chinese leadership
that couldn’t find its way to the sanitary

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:41.590
facility it was launched with great fanfare
publicity nothing seemed to be happening but

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:49.720
now a great deal is happening there are now
two rail lines going from China to Iran which

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:59.630
cut the cost and time of shipment to Iran
in half there’s a fast train from Beijing

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:07.830
to Istanbul it goes through a Caspian Sea
ferry to Baku and Arzo bajean then on to the

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.929
blue sea and Georgia and then two cops in
eastern Turkey and then to Istanbul it also

00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:20.779
cuts the time in half we wonder looking at
Turkey why Turkey seems to be impervious to

00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:27.929
threats menaces bribes or whatever we try
to offer them to keep them in the Western

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:36.020
alliance turkey now is profile itself as the
Western economic province of China and among

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.460
other things you can see they’re behaving
on the matter of the weekers which was a sore

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.679
point between Turkey Chinese for quite some
time the other thing that the Chinese are

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:53.490
doing a Turkey which is a good segue into
another aspect of Chinese plans is transforming

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:59.830
the Turkish broadband system mobile broadband
is having a transformational effect politically

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:05.549
and economically that very few people anticipated
until very recently for my sins in the past

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:11.160
I did some develop a economics I did some
work in place like Mexico Nicaragua Peru Russia

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:17.110
after the fall of Communism the main thing
one notices about so-called developing countries

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.659
is that most people sit around doing very
little most of the day you work this persistence

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:26.500
plot you sit in a market stall swat flies
and wait for someone to come along and buy

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:32.520
a liter of cooking oil you don’t pay taxes
you work off the books you scrape out a living

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:40.440
30 or 40 percent of economic life is the so-called
informal economy official labor participation

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.789
rates are abysmal people are lost in a cycle
of poverty what mobile broadband has done

00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:55.340
is to reach into the capillaries of emerging
economies and locate the intrapreneurs the

00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:02.340
talent give them access to a world market
platform and increasingly give them access

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:09.870
to microfinance and the entrepreneurial genius
who created this model in China where it’s

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:18.080
most advances of course Jack Ma of Alibaba
now as big as Amazon Jack Ma is joined-at-the-hip

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.700
bees the Siamese twin of Xi Jinping there
are two sides there’s a bright side and

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:31.610
a dark side to what Big Data and mobile broadband
do you know the turn villages in China which

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.900
are working for one person who figured out
how to make a product and sell it on the Alibaba

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:41.770
platform and you’d have something called
ant finance and a number of other microfinance

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:48.169
platforms which are making small loans to
businessman all over China something the banking

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:54.070
system state banking system doesn’t do state
banking system is based a bucket full of cash

00:25:54.070 --> 00:26:00.289
with a shovel which is used when a state of
an enterprise comes by and this is transforming

00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:07.970
the capillary level of China the most important
thing that China has managed to do that no

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:14.950
other so-called emerging economy has done
in the past while Korea has done it becoming

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:25.390
it has emerged is to mobilize the human capital
of its citizens make the whole world available

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:32.769
to them but because the Chinese have successfully
protected their intranet the Great Wall of

00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:40.460
China there’s a dark side to this as well
all the data that Alibaba and 10 cent and

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:45.490
the other great internet organizations in
China collect is of course at the disposal

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:53.570
of the Ministry of State Security the greatest
telecom communications equipment provider

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:59.610
in the world is now Huawei founded by a former
officer in the Chinese Signal Corps a couple

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:05.480
of years ago as an anecdote I wanted to get
a tour of Huawei headquarters and to do that

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.039
I had to find some unsuspecting Latin American
ambassador to take the tour so I could tag

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:16.990
along as the escort and we were shown the
Huawei exhibition hall which is a three-hour

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:22.720
extravaganza it looks like two wings of the
Smithsonian we came to a wall at Norma’s

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.760
wall and as several times the size of that
screen which the city of Guangdong map with

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:34.400
lots of points of light they said very proudly
every one of those is every smartphone in

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.100
the city and we can correlate the location
of the smartphone and its movement with online

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:49.820
searches online shopping Facebook about Facebook
WeChat postings and so forth so they know

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.590
where everybody is who they’re with and
what they’ve done and what they’ve said

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:59.539
at a little times plus they’ve got cameras
everyone meters or so which do very effective

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:04.029
faithful recognition so if you happen to be
holding someone else’s smartphone they’ll

00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:11.510
figure that out quickly enough which gives
the Chinese Communist Party without any doubt

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:23.929
the cruelest dictatorship in modern history
to Tollett Aryan social control capabilities

00:28:23.929 --> 00:28:35.940
that the likes of a Hitler or Stalin could
not have dreamed of overthrowing this entity

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:43.791
is not an easy proposition I don’t know
where we begin and I wouldn’t undertake

00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:52.630
the task we’re dealing with an entity which
is not going to be cowed politically we’re

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.429
a few Op-eds about dissidents or human rights
are going to have much of an effect this is

00:28:56.429 --> 00:29:03.190
not Poland with a subsidiary Catholic Church
or Hungary it’s a very different entity

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:09.220
it’s a society with no subsidiary hollowed
out except for the Catholic Church except

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.649
except for the Communist Party I just spoke
for a second there is a Catholic Church in

00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:19.649
China it’s tiny it’s split into a Catholic
patriotic Association controlled by the state

00:29:19.649 --> 00:29:26.900
and a very small underground Catholic Church
you do have perhaps a hundred billion Chinese

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.500
who consider themselves in one way or another
to be Christian and they’re tolerated as

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:38.580
long as they meet in homes and form no visible
organizations so they tend to be very low-profile

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:46.190
for that reason it’s extremely difficult
to gain an overall profile of what the content

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:51.050
of Chinese religious life is you have any
people who identify as Christians who’ve

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:57.100
never had a Bible and many who are deeply
learning and profound but we only have anecdotal

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:02.340
evidence about that that might be over the
very long term of soft underbelly of Chinese

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:09.429
culture but it’s something we can only speculate
about and in the horizon of any viable strategy

00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:18.040
I don’t believe will be a factor so this
chart shows the percentage of population owning

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:25.710
a smartphone Turkey and China are right there
around 50 percent China has become a cashless

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:31.690
society effectively no a few years ago the
Apple store in Hong Kong had the calf counting

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.429
machines that drug dealers use and people
have come from the mainland with suitcases

00:30:36.429 --> 00:30:43.029
full of cash and they go down the cash counter
machine and walk out with a hundred iPads

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:50.049
taken back to the mainland and sell them not
anymore Ali pay and other electronic payment

00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:57.019
systems have largely eliminated cash this
is the core of the anti-corruption campaign

00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:03.620
which is enormously successful because it’s
technology driven the government can track

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:10.179
every transaction because they’re electronic
the most important appointment that came out

00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:17.360
of the Chinese Party Congress in the view
of our China editor days at times Jeff Tao

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:30.970
was the elevation of yeah who was the reforms
are under under Xi Jinping the author of the

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:37.170
famous dot now famous document called a proposal
for supply-side structural reforms in the

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:45.700
Chinese economy what are these reforms law
in the case of Turkey Turkcell is now in a

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:54.000
joint venture with one way to help the Finance
Ministry eliminate cash payments by 2023 broadband

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.700
and physical transport or hard wiring turkey
into the Chinese economy that’s why the

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:07.840
West has lost leverage and Turkey Iran with
its two rail lines going to China they’ve

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.830
always believed in dependent on the Chinese
economy for many years that’s also a problematic

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:22.519
consideration what kind of pressure would
sanctions effect on Iran given their dependence

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:30.250
on China Russia has quadrupled or quick toppled
it’s oil exports to China over the last

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.820
four or five years mainly the expense of Saudi
Arabia Russia will be bankrupt without the

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:42.020
Chinese favoring oil imports from Russia Russia’s
incredibly important adjunct to China one

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.429
of the things China doesn’t have a culture
hasn’t favored it is a foreign intelligence

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:52.070
services speaker for a diplomatic service
in China if you meet somebody in the Diplomatic

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:58.779
Service who’s lived abroad speaks four languages
at ease of Western culture you know for sure

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:04.100
he’s the near to well brother-in-law of
some party official who didn’t think it

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.750
was worth putting them up the fast-track of
the peoples of the race and arming of the

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.630
regional party organizations it’s a dumping
ground for people who aren’t that important

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:21.230
so the Ruffins with their great expertise
in Turkey in the Caucasus and Persia and so

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:26.500
forth they’re excellent intelligence service
language capabilities are critical adjunct

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:36.220
very fine now is trying to kind of go bankrupt
I’ve been reading articles about China’s

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:46.200
debt and debt problem and so forth I think
many of the reports we’ve had have been

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:53.690
a quick first cut and superficial I’m a
banker and the question bankers wanted it

00:33:53.690 --> 00:34:00.429
was what’s the collateral if there’s a
loan what’s behind it the debt to the laboratories

00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:07.389
of a company is less important than its underlying
carrying capacity so our team at age of x

00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:14.030
broke down the balance sheets of the 300 top
companies in the shinjin 300 index that’s

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:21.530
the closest thing China has to an S&amp;P 500
index and we discovered that two-thirds the

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:29.720
total debt is attached to infrastructure companies
biggest is petrified the others are real companies

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:35.380
and metal companies power development nuclear
power take out the fine and not putting me

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:45.340
including the financials a couple of airports
this is theme this is China’s infrastructure

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:53.099
which is includes now close to thirty thousand
kilometers of high-speed rail which is an

00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:59.190
enormous productivity booster now there’s
a lot of inefficiency obviously but it’s

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:06.460
not the same thing as the great American bubble
of 1998 to 2008 where foreign money bought

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:13.530
American mortgages American mortgages finest
house speculation by households how speculation

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:22.589
was used to artificially boost consumption
so the problem we had was financial distress

00:35:22.589 --> 00:35:31.200
in the population itself this is debt backed
by infrastructure which has a productivity-enhancing

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:38.349
effect why did this happen this way well one
of the oddities I don’t want to go through

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:43.900
the details of this if I’ve got some data
I’d be glad just and send you if you talk

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:49.970
to me afterwards but if you look at the debt
ratios in China versus almost any other country

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:55.091
in the world you see this huge corporate debt
component very small government and household

00:35:55.091 --> 00:36:00.930
debt components compared to everyone else
China until very recently had effectively

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:06.170
no taxes there’s no personal income tax
they had what’s called the corporate tax

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:13.880
which is just a top-line tax recently they
adopted value-added tax being introduced that’s

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.730
being corrected but in the meantime if you
wanted to build the infrastructure oh and

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:23.410
they didn’t have a domestic bond market
to speak up so in the U.S. you issue bonds

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:27.970
and you raise tax revenues down to tax revenues
you borrow money against tax revenues those

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:33.550
mechanisms simply didn’t exist in shock
they’re now being built rapidly so to get

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:39.300
the infrastructure built the Chinese government
simply told the state banks we’re printing

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.440
money give that money to state companies so
it shows up as a ballooning of corporate debt

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:51.490
that’s an inefficiency in the structure
the Chinese economy which is one of the many

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:58.310
things that the Xi Jinping regime will address
in the course of the reforms but it’s not

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:06.970
a financial crisis the hedge fund community
is littered with corpses of people who shorted

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:16.390
China believing it was a crisis there’s
a before I get to the the Rd stuff famed just

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:24.900
as a quick aside China lost a trillion dollars
worth of reserves 2015-2016 and the papers

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.910
were full of reports saying there’s a massive
run out of Chinese assets Chinese are panicking

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:35.109
China’s going to go backward what the papers
did not report but the Bank for International

00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:42.030
Settlements Economics staff documented a great
detail is that while the Chinese government

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:48.480
was losing a trillion dollars of reserves
Chinese companies mostly state-owned companies

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.480
were paying down a trillion dollars worth
of foreign debt it was simply an internal

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:59.980
bookkeeping transaction and it was undertaken
because the Chinese had let their currency

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:07.130
appreciate for years so it was the advantage
of corporation to borrow in dollars use the

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:12.680
proceeds in RMB and then pay the dollars back
and a more favorable exchange rate in the

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:19.510
future but the Chinese were the very fast
drives of the dollar 2015 Chinese had to turn

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:25.920
that around so you had to turn around the
super tank of a balance sheet or replace the

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:33.890
dollar debt with local currency gain and so
anyway a lot of very poor superficial analysis

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.990
has been done on the Chinese economy but also
some really excellent work for example as

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:43.099
I mentioned by the Bank for International
Settlements the data and the analysis are

00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:50.090
out there if you look for them unfortunately
the gullible and lazy reporters of the mainstream

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:57.560
media who give us most of our daily feed don’t
bother to do their so China’s now has R&amp;D

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:04.520
at 2% of GDP what does that go into well I’ve
got the fastest supercomputers in the world

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:10.609
they have a functioning quantum satellite
in other words a quantum a quantum link between

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:16.140
satellite earth means that if there’s any
attempt to interfere with a signal for example

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:23.040
to eavesdrop on it it immediately destroys
the signal itself liquidates Chinese scientists

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.540
had a conversation over the satellite link
with the French counterpart massive investments

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:36.500
in supercomputer also investments and things
like services to ship missiles which may or

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:42.839
may not be able to take down an American carrier
we probably don’t want to find out diesel-electric

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:46.370
submarines of the kinds of Germans that for
a long time that can lurk on the bottom and

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:51.740
batteries and at this point are virtually
undetectable hypersonic missiles designed

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:57.119
to defeat not only fat or Patriot or other
systems that we currently have but systems

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:03.130
that we might develop in the future satellite
killer missiles and a range of things to make

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:11.579
themselves and pregnant now one important
caveat about Chinese military spending is

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:19.790
shown by the difference between how they equipped
a ground soldier and how they equip their

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:25.150
space forces and missile forces the United
States spends last I checked something over

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:29.190
a hundred thousand dollars maybe one hundred
ten hundred twenty thousand dollars to equip

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:34.630
a single infantryman Chinese spend about fifteen
hundred dollars twelve hundred fifteen hundred

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:40.390
dollars that’s basically a Kalashnikov rifle
pair of boots couple spare uniforms and that’s

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:46.290
it Chinese have no grab attack aircraft nothing
like the warthog nothing like the Russian

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:51.510
frog but simply not in the inventory Chinese
are not preparing for a land war the only

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:56.750
land where they could conceivably fight might
be with India or Vietnam that really doesn’t

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:02.650
fit into their objectives but they want to
absolutely dominate the South China Sea make

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:13.230
Taiwan entirely dependent on and control everything
around them one of the companies that we took

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:21.290
public at when I was at reorient group in
Hong Kong kwangji science run by a bunch of

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:27.680
materials PhD is from Duke I walked into the
office of the chairman that he had his iPhone

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.800
out and he said I want to show you something
they showed me a little map of the South China

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:40.410
Sea with lots of triangles so that’s cool
what are those triangles so that is the location

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:47.890
speed direction and condition of a motor of
every ship in the South China Sea so we can

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:57.020
distinguish a fishing trawler from a destroyer
how do you do that it said balloons they have

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:02.240
some very strong materials they develop so
they put a pie out to balloons all over the

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:08.480
place with coaxial cables they can monitor
the South China Sea if God forbid we had a

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.710
wall of China and we each take out of each
other satellites the US military is blind

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:20.309
Chinese have a much more primitive but robust
technology covering their entire Coast so

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:48.230
roughly six or seven percent of undergraduates
major in engineering in China it is 33% Chinese

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:55.740
produce twice as many stem PhDs as we do now
and four times as many stem undergraduates

00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:01.810
now granted the saw the quality of the Chinese
educational system is spotted remember that

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:08.460
the Cultural Revolution leveled the universities
they had to be rebuilt from scratch but in

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:16.470
the view of many the better schools are as
good as ours then you have some crappy diploma

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:22.760
mills at the bottom of the pile but I urge
you to go on the internet and simply look

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:28.839
at the equivalent of New York regions test
for graduating high school seniors in China

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:34.000
I know a little math and it made me sweat
I guarantee that if that were the standard

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:44.089
test for Americans you know 1/10 of 1% competency
right now in America there’s a lot of warranty

00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:51.760
plenty of people doing R&amp;D to try to find
a better breakfast cereal but federal R&amp;D

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:59.760
is a good proxy for hard science long-range
R&amp;D and that was in the Reagan administration

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.580
of blessed memory roughly you know close to
about 0.8 percent of GDP and it’s fallen

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:15.530
by half to about 0.4 percent of GDP remember
in the 1980s we had corporate laboratories

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:22.809
we had GE RCA IBM Bell Labs none of them exists
anymore they’ve all been shut down the National

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:29.190
Labs are you know shadow of themselves we’ve
got plenty of people at universities doing

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:36.290
things but we don’t have the kind of concentrated
industry science relationship which holds

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:42.910
these things together and is related to do
this in productivity which I don’t want

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:48.070
to go into the case where’s the money going
in the U.S. well there’s tons of money going

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:54.880
into software this is a venture capital commitments
but nothing going into computers peripherals

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:04.240
semiconductors telecom networking why don’t
we invest in capital intensive high-tech manufacturing

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:12.130
because every venture capitalists out there
is scared witless of the agents who subsidize

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:19.460
this stuff they’re afraid they’ve got
Christ so we invest it apps capital white

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:27.760
stuff we’ve got a trillion dollar valuation
on an app to search for used cars we’ve

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:36.590
got 120 different dating sites we are geeks
in a new roman empire now what do we do about

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:41.681
we’re gonna have to do subsidies I’m a-free
marketer. I’m a supply-side I’m a free

00:45:41.681 --> 00:45:46.620
trader this is war war you do things differently
where you put the subsidies you put them in

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:52.210
the hard science hard Rd let businesses take
the risk but the Defense Department may have

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:59.461
to do direct investments in some industries
we start with inherent Dr. Henry Cassell and

00:45:59.461 --> 00:46:06.000
I proposals in the World Street Journal just
after the election start with the rule sense

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.640
of defense goods have to be made in the U.S.
under secure conditions period that’s a

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:16.990
gazillion percent tariff how do you like them
apples I don’t care about tariffs on steel

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:21.470
or aluminum the Chinese want to get rid of
that stuff anyway Chinese would love us to

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:30.800
be Brazil let agriculture energy of semi-finished
goods and of course politically a steel plant

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:38.309
has more workers to give a speech in front
of then semiconductor fab plant does not quite

00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:47.940
a sexy so politically it may not fit the profile
quite as smoothly as some other things but

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:56.000
if we don’t do this we’re going to lose
this one belt one road thing well lots of

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.300
people hate the Chinese they’re horrible
they’re aggressive they’re nasty they

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.890
in debt countries they bully them well what
if we could to get together with the Japanese

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:14.500
who’ve got more foreign assets than the
Chinese and the Indians and compete with them

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.410
the Chinese and sorry the Indians of Japanese
ordered of something already have something

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:24.400
called the Asian growth car which is supposed
to be but it’s tiny if we got behind that

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:33.280
in a three-way effort we could offer the Chinese
a serious competition and then stop Intel

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.140
and other companies from getting access to
the Chinese market by giving away the store

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:43.240
a lot of companies won’t like that because
it’s good for their stock price in the short

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.339
run a lot of people are getting rich on the
decline of the West but there are some things

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:53.329
more important than Intel stock price a lot
of people don’t like it but it’s got to

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:57.950
come down to the top my conclusion ladies
and gentlemen thank you for your patience

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:04.270
is that we have done this before we did it
in World War II we did it with a Kennedy moonshot

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:08.271
we did it with Reagan and the military buildup
in the SDI we know how to do it a lot of the

00:48:08.271 --> 00:48:15.530
people who did it are still around it’s
not that we can’t do we just have to determine

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:20.230
that we want to do it and get it done otherwise
we’re going to live in a world that none

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:28.180
of us are going to be really pleased with.
Thank you very much for you. I have a lot

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.470
of neighbors who are Chinese Americans and
they’re on WeChat here so two questions

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:44.930
one is there any way that the Chinese government
can be America and to word about from lack

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:51.000
of time I think North Korea is a case of the
Chinese wanted play arsonist and Fire Brigade

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.180
at the same time they’ve encouraged the
Chinese they’ve encouraged the North Koreans

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:02.800
and given them some covert help and then you
know President Trump will go to China and

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.460
tell the Chinese we need your help to deal
with these nutcases Xi Jinping will say well

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.500
we can help little cost you now that’s a
dangerous game to play because I say the Japanese

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.930
decide to develop nuclear weapons I can tell
you the Chinese won’t like that they’re

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:23.200
very afraid of the Japanese so it could backfire
on them it’s a delicate game but that is

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:31.260
an example of the Chinese using well their
play play go you surround the opponent with

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:38.400
your pieces you don’t do obvious dramatic
moves you play for the very long-term very

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:45.570
patient very strategic whereas we are impatient
and tactical they’re playing go we’re

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:58.549
playing Monopoly Brendan thank you for your
time honored but my real question is the Russian

00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:14.900
Far East and Chinese Leeson the far-east is
kind of a quasi-vassal state how do we get

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:26.790
well Chinese look at everybody and think protein
source reference included but now the Russians

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:31.700
simply don’t have a population to dominate
the Far East so the Chinese it’s not worth

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.079
their fighting over it because long term it’ll
fall into Chinese hands the Chinese won’t

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:41.890
fall over it because long term it will be
theirs just due to Russia’s population at

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:47.470
riffin how do you get the Russians to understand
that well I think there are a lot of things

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.750
we could do with the Ruffins that’s a whole
other presentation I think we’ve mishandled

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:58.400
it I think you need a very big stick and a
very juicy carrot at the same time we won

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:05.820
the Cold War in large part because Henry Kissinger
god bless him helped split and Nixon helped

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:14.760
split China from Russia and get in the back
together again cannot possibly be in our interests

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:21.569
but given in China’s the fact that China
dominates the raw materials demand side and

00:51:21.569 --> 00:51:27.460
Russia depends on raw materials there’s
very little we can do in the short term to

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:32.740
change that dependency that Russia has on
China so although in principle I agree with

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:38.280
you tactically that’s a much longer term
kind of consideration that’s just the way

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:54.480
the cards are dealt then you should be writing
four times I’m delighted to meet you in

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.580
person my pleasure – yeah two questions
one with China’s economic penetration in

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:12.309
the de Central Asia as far as Iran and Turkey
what impact do you think this might have along

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:17.119
the instability and chaos in the Middle East
well that’s one second the US has turned

00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:25.840
its back on the TPP how serious of blunder
do you think that is well I don’t think

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.280
the TPP is going to help us at this point
I think it’s much more a matter of fighting

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.640
economic war with the Chinese they’ve got
there greater co-prosperity sphere we want

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.460
to set up competition so I think you should
just sort of move on and adopt a different

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:48.119
policy as far as instability it’s very hard
to know it is possible that the Chinese will

00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:53.369
exercise a moderating influence on the irradiance
the Chinese want to get rich want it but powerful

00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:59.260
and they want everyone to behave and pay them
tribute they don’t want the meijer tribes

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:05.320
to war with each other and they have a 3,000
4,000 year history of exterminating unruly

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:16.319
barbarians so they would certainly encourage
the Iranians to cool it with the Israelis

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:20.980
they like the Israelis they get you know they
get along they want is really technology they

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:27.829
don’t want a war between Iran and Israel
for example on the other hand all of this

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:35.660
may variable embolden an Iranian regime which
is increasingly desperate and strident and

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:41.730
Chinese are very poor at managing relation
so they may have quite different effects very

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:47.540
hard to know the worlds being transformed
so quickly that it’s very hard to make a

00:53:47.540 --> 00:54:05.869
blank judgment it’s a great question I wish
I could be are using their gene-splicing to

00:54:05.869 --> 00:54:11.690
be able to look at embryos and try to determine
which are smarter so parents can create a

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:17.339
bunch of fertilized embryos and then decide
which to plant later in the womb and create

00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:25.890
the smartest kids in the world how effective
they will be I have no idea but this is not

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:32.210
an urban legend. This is real. They are doing
it and that’s how they think as I said it’s

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:40.460
a very cruel society. It’s an absolutely
ruthless meritocracy and which does not give

00:54:40.460 --> 00:55:32.040
any mercy to the hindmost parties consistently
well I think China wants Russia to be its

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:37.700
cat’s paw in a number of strategic operations
it wants to make the Shanghai Cooperation

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:45.190
Organization a successful competitor NATO
wants to harness all of Russian military technology

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:50.870
to Chinese ends and China has some significant
gaps in their military profile which the Russians

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:55.620
have historically filled for example Chinese
still can’t make a good jet engine their

00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:02.119
metallicky is behind the Russian so they use
Russian jet engines they only just got the

00:56:02.119 --> 00:56:08.730
s400 which is important because with a range
of several hundred kilometers it can control

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:16.119
the skies over Taiwan from land bases on the
mainland that probably want the s500 so they

00:56:16.119 --> 00:56:23.869
won thrushes to do their bidding at effectively
be their vassal state at a hundred year horizon

00:56:23.869 --> 00:56:29.890
roughest population will have shrunk it’s
even though Russian fertility has actually

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:37.400
recovered a good deal the pool of women of
childbearing age fell so quickly that a decline

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.470
is inevitable and that means that it’ll
be the marginal areas like Siberia that lose

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:47.369
the most population so it’ll fall into Chinese
hands the Chinese set up to fight for it they’re

00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:52.640
going to get it anyway you swear well circle
for me while while seeing paradox they all

00:56:52.640 --> 00:57:00.980
have the most strategic nation out there right
now but at the same time you correctly demonstrated

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:10.589
that they don’t know how to before intelligence
they’re rubbish at the close why is that

00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:16.599
there’s a lack of capital empathy how can
they be uber strategic with the one belt one

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:28.609
Road at the same time the further eight intelligence
and all Chinese culture has been to push inward

00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:35.410
to take peach to take the periphery and force
it inward and homogenize it with the with

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:43.849
the single written language with the ideograms
because china had no interest in getting through

00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:49.750
the getting to the rest of all that reached
natural natural borders by about 700 with

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:57.119
the Tang dynasty they really didn’t have
pressure to do so China’s economic basis

00:57:57.119 --> 00:58:01.360
has always been agriculture never been a colonial
power like the British the Emperor had an

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:09.000
annual ceremony where he put his hand on the
plow which say the son of heaven himself is

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:17.789
symbolically a plough it’s deeply embedded
in Chinese history when you spend your entire

00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:24.640
childhood I mean after the age of 11 or 12
if you know working four hours a day you can

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:31.820
read 2,000 characters perhaps that right mm
maybe 1,500 to 2,000 and ames 11 means you

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:38.760
can read a newspaper to get to 10,000 characters
which is high literate you do everything else

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:44.089
the ability to learn languages phonetically
that we have in the West is something that

00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:51.079
has never been developed as part of Chinese
culture that Roman polyglot or Greek polyglot

00:58:51.079 --> 00:59:00.910
capacity was simply never part of the culture
the Chinese feel so drawn centripetal to their

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:06.650
own culture that they simply don’t like
living anywhere else when they go to other

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.200
countries they bring their own war teams their
own wheelbarrows their own cooks their own

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:15.220
food that open next to the locals because
they feel out of sorts on the other hand Chinese

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:22.650
who as individuals emigrate er some of those
adaptable people in the world from the Chinese

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:30.349
diaspora has been remarkably adaptable both
culturally and economically so it is it is

00:59:30.349 --> 01:00:21.270
a it is a difficult contradiction

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:26.320
to shyness Turkish relations were at a low
two or three years ago because the Chinese

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:33.140
believed with some justification that the
Turks were supporting wigglers who were moving

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.680
in large numbers Syria fighting in Syria getting
trained as terrorists a lot of them there

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.710
was a route that went from China to Southeast
Asia at the Yunnan Province they go to Turkish

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:50.799
consulates they present themselves as Chinese
Turks get Turkish passports Chinese officials

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:57.610
locally the Turks had fifty thousand blank
passports and their consulates to serve us

01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:01.030
the weavers whether that’s true or not I
don’t know but I think the Chinese actually

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:09.440
believed that they were very afraid of weaker
terrorism since then Erewhon has started behaving

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.880
himself he cracked out of the weavers in Syria
and Turkey he’s not letting them travel

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:21.010
back and forth without any fanfare there been
a very few reports in the media dothis air

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:28.900
Dhawan has completely exceeded two Chinese
demands so air the ones national interest

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:36.099
his desire to gain independence from the West
has trumped his ethnic solidarity with his

01:01:36.099 --> 01:02:14.470
weaker cousins when our people thank you very
much for

01:02:14.470 --> 01:03:16.170
that comment I

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:22.770
deeply share your concern and if it weren’t
for the fact that we’ve lost our moral compass

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:29.730
we wouldn’t be having these concerns at
all to begin with but I do I certainly want

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.900
trying to do the prosperous and to be a piece
and to be secure I don’t think the United

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:44.770
States should attempt to break Taiwan or from
China I think the one policy one China policy

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:50.190
simply is a banner of realism I don’t like
it particularly but I think that’s the way

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.680
the cards are dealt I don’t think we’re
going to get any worth to bet so I don’t

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.600
want to mess with that I’m all for China
being secured at U.S. borders however it’s

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.970
like steel in 1870 very European country they
don’t have high quality steel mills you

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:12.450
can’t make cannon you’re dead militarily
if we lose our semiconductor industry our

01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:18.809
edge in semiconductors militarily we become
a second-rate power and that has all kinds

01:04:18.809 --> 01:04:24.090
of terrible consequences which are almost
impossible to predict apart from the fact

01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:30.750
will be a great deal poorer as well so I’m
all for China being prosperous but I’ve

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:38.280
I deeply want America to have a technological
edge that’s tangible and keeps everyone

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:44.160
afraid of us I very much believe if you want
peace you prepare for war relatively little

01:04:44.160 --> 01:05:04.190
reserves of energy great day little cold not
very much else 25 million cars that are produced

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:23.340
there now running this is the imported fuel
well they’re turning coal into methanol

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:34.900
well they do have a huge potential for fracking
probably as large as the United States Romney

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:41.430
takes a lot of water in one hears stories
that water is our premium and processes just

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:56.670
get a Ford there’s definitely true what
do you hear about any plans actual investment

01:05:56.670 --> 01:06:03.809
going into it’s not my field that’s a
gray it’s an excellent question I wish I

01:06:03.809 --> 01:06:08.230
knew more about it from what I’ve heard
you’d have to construct a pipeline from

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:14.849
the sea to bring in seawater because the air
is where the shale deposits located or mountainous

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:21.430
and extremely dry so there isn’t any water
source ready to have that would be an enormous

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:26.720
expense and the Chinese have to weigh that
against for example building pipelines interruption

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:33.400
well a natural gas which they’re doing and
creating the pipelines to through Pakistan

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:45.549
to the Indian Ocean which would give him better
access to Iranian and and belayed and Iraqi

01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:50.160
crude without going without the vulnerability
of going through the Straits of Malacca so

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.589
I think the Chinese tension is much more an
energy security replacing the existing routes

01:06:55.589 --> 01:07:05.079
and increasing their supply from Russia that
on fracking they also of course if announced

01:07:05.079 --> 01:07:09.440
that they’re going to eliminate the internal
combustion engine entirely in China but what

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.170
2030 I wouldn’t take that too seriously
but it is an important effort they’re building

01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:22.090
nuclear power plants as fast as they can several
a year that will not have a huge effect on

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:27.220
their total energy output for several years
to come but at a 15 year horizon it will make

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:35.339
a very big difference further alarming they
have a plan is beyond the one belt one road

01:07:35.339 --> 01:08:15.230
to build a grave it connects the entire world
including us is but which way do you pay the

01:08:15.230 --> 01:09:03.120
tolls thank you for that thank you good for
whom Xi Jinping is a very capable leader and

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:09.290
his Chinese patriot is doing what he’s thinking
thinks is best for his country in ways that

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:15.060
in many cases I found repugnant in the extreme
but I don’t propose to criticize and the

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:21.340
Chinese are going to have to work out their
own problems I think Trump trap is being set

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:28.160
for the United States which is will make a
fuss about aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.770
and dumping and various other things Chinese
will kick and scream and negotiate and finally

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:41.250
they’ll give in and trumple of a great victory
we saved the American aluminum industry from

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:46.750
Chinese dumping we saved steel Chinese officials
told me why does Trump want to save all the

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:54.310
industries who want to get rid of China is
happy for us to be Brazil semi-finished goods

01:09:54.310 --> 01:10:02.070
and raw materials so I think that’s what
the habitus ocean is going to go and I think

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:08.170
the first thing I would tell if I were trumpet
here’s what I would tell Xi Jinping for

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:17.410
the last 30 years you and the Russians have
told us it would be unacceptable for us to

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:23.540
develop and implement a space-based anti-missile
system because he’d consider that a tenable

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.430
change in balance of power like to acknowledge
the presence here the distinguished political

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:32.870
scientist Angela Kota Villa one of the world’s
experts on this may want to say something

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:44.450
more about it I would say see we understand
your concerns but you loused up you let the

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.890
North Koreans get out of control everybody
was relying on you and look what a mess you

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:54.740
made of it that leaves us no choice so as
soon as I come back I’m going to announce

01:10:54.740 --> 01:11:00.970
the American people to the American people
a Manhattan Project to develop a space-based

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:05.970
anti-missile system to make the United States
impregnable and if you don’t like it go

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:52.500
jump on 
the belief system to sustain is that in China

01:11:52.500 --> 01:12:02.440
I know she is working hard to promote the
per diem ideology and is thinking how vulnerable

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:13.890
is it to a change such as that since it’s
been said for so many years that is the great

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:22.770
question Bob and the riddle wrapped in an
enigma is the status of Chinese Christianity

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:30.000
if ever a country were ripe for Christianity
that would be China look at the late Roman

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.190
Empire with tribes migrating disappearing
losing their national identity losing confidence

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:42.150
in their preworld gods well China’s a nation
of my currency 600 million people have moved

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:49.560
from countryside to the city it’s spiritually
empty human beings do not do well in a spiritual

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.890
vacuum but because the movement has been so
subtle and so located it’s been a house

01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.430
church movement not an organized movement
it’s extremely difficult to gather data

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:07.930
on it there’s a recent book on Christianity
in China a good book but entirely Anto almost

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:15.950
impossible to get real data on this so that
certainly could be a game-changer is not the

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:23.450
right word for it that could be the transformational
change that would that would make China an

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:28.750
entirely different place but I’ve got no
means to evaluate it I’ve been trying to

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:34.120
learn about it for years and you only hear
anecdotes because with very good reason Chinese

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.730
Christians are keeping their heads down.
