00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.520
- Can I touch your boobs for science?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.353
- Yes.
- Okay, I've always

00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:04.694
just been curious, gotta feel it.

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:05.930
Do you wanna feel mine?

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.420
For science.
- Oh, science.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.890
- We're doing science right now.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.723
(whimsical music)

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.907
Hello (laughs).

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:16.324
Hi!

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.040
I'm here to guess who
has what plastic surgery,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.590
I believe is what I'm here for?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.180
Oh my god, okay, so I
wanna get a nose job.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.010
Get my nose fixed, I would
love to get a boob job,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.350
and I would love to get my lips filled.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.810
I was hoping you could get a leg job.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.950
Break them and put a stilt in there

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.870
and make myself taller,
like in a heartbeat.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.690
Totally would do it, I'd
do it all, I'd go crazy.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.921
I'm ready, okay, first person.

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.130
- Hi, I'm John.
- Okay.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.570
Hello, John.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.950
- I'm gonna judge you now.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.280
Let's see, we got little, no scars here.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.960
Open up wide.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.890
Okay, lift your tongue up.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.080
What do you do for a living?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.870
- I'm in healthcare.
- Okay, okay.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.080
You could afford it, okay.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.890
I'm gonna say he hasn't
had plastic surgery.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.300
Is that right, am I right on this one?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840
- I haven't had any plastic
surgery, so to speak.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.440
But I have had cosmetic surgery.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.050
- Okay, what was it?
- I had the fat

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.110
from underneath my chin removed.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.920
- Okay.
- I've had Botox.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.529
- Wait, go like this.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:15.410
Oh my gosh, you don't get
wrinkly on your forehead.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.680
- Right.
- I should've asked for that.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.390
- Thank you.
(people clap)

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.423
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.260
- Turn around for me.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.540
Can I feel your spine?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.040
- Okay, can I touch
your boobs for science?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.910
- Yes.
- Okay, I've always

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.300
just been curious, just gotta feel it.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.600
Do you wanna feel mine?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090
For science.
- Oh, science.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.360
- We're doing science right now.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.966
Oh, yours feel pretty good,
just tell me mine feel good.

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.400
(woman laughs)

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.233
- Yours feel good,
you're good, you're good.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.000
- Okay, I'm just gonna go with boob job.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.833
- I got a boob job.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.520
And I also had a vaginoplasty done.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.553
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.560
What I'm talking about.
(both laugh)

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.570
- Four surgeries

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.226
since they're making
external stuff internal.

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:53.630
It's a lot of pre-work to
do, like called a chalsis.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.490
Let's talk about permanent hair removal.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.130
They like fry a hair
follicle one at a time

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.120
and like remove the dead hair.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.197
So I did 50 hours with that, but--

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:03.173
- Wow.
- It's all good.

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.120
- Good for you though,
yeah, that's awesome!

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.280
Yeah, that sounds painful
though, I'm like (grunts).

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.943
- Hey, cutie.
- Okay, first thing is first.

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:12.268
Now, lift your eyebrows up, okay.

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:13.350
I don't think we, it doesn't look

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.540
like we have any reconstructive
surgery on the face.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.562
I have a feeling you're one
of my no plastic surgeries.

00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:22.479
Am I right?

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.230
No, no, I haven't gotten one (laughs).

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.270
- I actually had orthognathic jaw surgery.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.600
So I have had facial reconstruction,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.210
but I've also had my boobs done.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.050
- Oh yeah, I think it's
good that I'm doing terrible

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.883
'cause that means the surgeons are doing

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.050
a really good job, right?
- Right, exactly.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.587
- You're doing good,
surgeons, keep up the work.

00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:42.250
- I like that, so thank you.
- Alright.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.930
Hello, what's your name?
- I'm Curtis.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.550
- Hello, Curtis.
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.593
- Okay, okay, turn around.

00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:50.495
Alright.
- My butt (laughs).

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:51.973
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.370
- No, that just feels like a butt.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.680
You clearly moisturize.
- Okay.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.790
- Like a lot, like your skin is--

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.440
- Like I look greasy as fuck?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.030
- No, like that's probably
like the best skin

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.370
I've ever seen in my life.
- Okay.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.080
- Okay, you have had lip fillers.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.340
Did I get it right?
- You did not.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.173
- Are you a no plastic surgery?

00:03:08.173 --> 00:03:09.790
- I have had no plastic surgery.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.630
- See, I should've went with my instinct.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.490
- Would you like your lips
to be a little bit bigger?

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.350
- Oh heck yeah.
- Like right now?

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.710
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna put

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.950
on some lip pumper?
- Oh my gosh.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.140
Wait, is it FDA approved?
- Probably not.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.320
- Okay.
- Try it, here.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.975
- Okay, YOLO.
(Curtis laughs)

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:26.873
- Get ready for it.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.820
- Feel like I just ate a jar of jalapenos.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.287
- Like in a good way?
- Yeah.

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:33.230
I feel like I'm becoming more beautiful.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.966
Wow, my lips are really burning!

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:36.640
(people laugh)
Wow!

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.120
When you kiss people, does
it like rub off on them?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
- Yeah, lick your lips.
- No.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.040
I'm not gonna lick my lips.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.235
Who's next?
(people clap)

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:45.230
Do my lips look big?
- (laughs) Not yet.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.850
- Okay.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.400
I want you to wiggle your butt.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.810
Oh man, that's a good butt, I don't know.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.160
Can I touch that booty?
- Sure.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.630
- This is a real butt.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.020
This is a really nice, juicy butt.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.330
The size of your butt, you
could've had your breasts

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.470
reduced, you had a breast reduction.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.920
- Yes, and they put an implant too.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.120
- Oh, and they put an implant,
so I got it half right.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.799
And your butt, your butt's real, right?

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.140
- I did a tummy tuck.
- Oh, you did a tummy tuck.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.120
- And Lipo, and they
transferred the fat to my butt.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.200
- So it's still you.
- Yeah, it's still mine.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.500
- It's still your butt,
like it came from you.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.790
So that counts, okay.
- Yeah.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.410
- Last question, do my
lips look bigger now?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.610
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.530
I need more!
(man laughs)

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.913
This isn't working, okay.

00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:36.400
- Thank you.
- Okay, no, thank you.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.633
You better watch out who's
next 'cause I'm on a roll now.

00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:42.890
(woman laughs)
Okay, wait a second.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.800
Stick out your tongue, okay,
your tongue looks normal.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.130
You might be the prettiest
person I've ever seen,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.690
so like, I don't think you
should have plastic surgery.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.760
- Should I get anything done?
- No, no.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.010
Mommy and daddy did good.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.010
Should I get anything, be honest with me?

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.430
It's okay.
- No.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.490
I've had plastic surgery.
- So you had boobs,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.890
but then, you removed them?
- Mhm.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.320
- Oh wow, really?
- Mhm.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.133
- Girl, you didn't need
to, you are perfect!

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:08.159
I would've told you, "Girl,
you don't need that."

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.992
You look good.
- I know.

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:10.050
- Why'd you remove them though?

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.080
- Because I didn't feel
like I was myself anymore.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.310
- Mm.
- It felt like everybody

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.940
was just like staring at your boob.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.287
- I wouldn't mind if people
were staring at my boobs more.

00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:18.010
I'd be like, dream come true!

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.970
- Do you know a lot about
what's gonna happen afterwards?

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.320
- No, I haven't--
- Outside of the surgery.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.140
- No, I haven't like actually
looked into it in detail

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.470
because yeah, that would be awhile

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.060
before I could afford that, I think.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.870
- So I can tell you that
I don't have any fillings

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.140
on like one-third of my breasts.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.190
- Mhm.
- And some people

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.760
lose sensation on their nipples.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.030
- Now, I'm like scared,
you're like scaring me.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.883
Okay, well.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.640
Maybe I won't get a boob job.
- Yeah.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.610
- Maybe I won't, now, I'm scared.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.443
Okay, girl.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.690
Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.870
- Okay, okay.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.670
I think your boobs are real.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.552
Okay, turn around.
(whimsical music)

00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:58.610
I don't know, this is a Nicki
Minaj butt, I don't know.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.443
(woman laughs)

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.010
Okay, this is the biggest
booty I've ever seen

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.733
in real life, okay.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.930
Oh, dude, is this a fake booty?

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.960
This is totally a fake booty.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.500
- Why, why do you think that?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.360
- Because it feels like one
of those really nice beds

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.196
that you bounce on, like a waterbed.

00:06:13.196 --> 00:06:14.927
Shake it, shake it, shake it!

00:06:14.927 --> 00:06:16.487
That's a Minaj booty,
that's fake, it's fake.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:18.840
You got a fake booty.
- My butt's not fake.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.710
- That's not a fake butt, no!
- No, that's not fake.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.350
- No way, that's your real butt?

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.120
- Yeah.
- What is your diet?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.590
I want that!
(people laugh)

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.130
- It's natural, you know,
you look at the thighs.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.230
Like your thighs, do
they rub when you walk?

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.090
- Like if I, yeah, no.
- That must be nice.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.110
My thighs rub until they bleed

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.027
if I don't put like a
body butter, Vaseline.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.470
- Man, I can't believe that's real.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.280
Shake it, shake it, shake
it, shake it, shake it,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.745
shake it, shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it.

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.980
That's a real butt, okay.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.970
My last contestant, okay, let's see.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.655
Lift up the shirt.

00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:52.959
- Lift my shirt up?
- Is that okay?

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.720
- Yeah.
- Lift up the shirt.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.160
- Okay, you don't have
any scarring there, okay.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.607
I'm gonna go with you're another,

00:06:58.607 --> 00:07:00.316
"I have had no plastic surgery."

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:02.320
(man laughs)
Was I right?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.620
- No, I've had plastic surgery.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.090
- No!

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.870
- And you even asked
me to lift my shirt up.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.400
And you--
- I didn't see it?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.387
- No.
- Okay, wait.

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:13.320
Lift up your shirt up
again, oh, right here?

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.010
- Yeah.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.440
- Wait, what was your plastic surgery?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.160
- I had a double mastectomy.
- Oh, I don't what that means.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.900
- So I had like my breasts removed.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.600
- Ow.
- Yeah.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.067
- Why?

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.040
- 'Cause like I was born a female,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.700
and then, I transitioned to a male.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.874
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:32.304
- Congratulations, dude, that's awesome!

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:35.086
I had no clue, that's awesome, rad.

00:07:35.086 --> 00:07:35.919
Are you gonna do bottom surgery?

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.320
- Yeah, I'm in the process right now,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.745
but I have to have a hysterectomy first.

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:41.078
- That's so rad.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.320
I got like one-third correct.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.750
When I think of plastic surgery,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.380
the first thing I think
of is like instant beauty.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.543
I don't think of like
sex changes or removing,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.240
removing your boobs right away.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.310
I still can't believe that

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.942
that booty is real.
(people laugh)

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:57.892
I can't believe it.
