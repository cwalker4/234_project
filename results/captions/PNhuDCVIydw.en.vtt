00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.500
Hey guys! ChrisFix here, and today I'm going to show you how to diagnose and fix an engine that'll crank

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.900
but won't start.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.860
So when you turn the key, the starter will engage,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
the engine will spin, it'll turn over, but it just won't start.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.000
And this is a situation that most people who drive will encounter at least once.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.060
But don't worry, because after watching this video, you're going to learn everything you need to know

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.800
on how to figure out what the problem is, and then hopefully you'll be able to fix that problem

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.420
and get your vehicle running.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.640
And this car is the perfect example of that.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.020
This is my new 1998 Honda Civic, has 90K miles.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
I got it for free from my neighbor.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.480
Now, my neighbor used to daily drive this car,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.160
he'd go to work every single day in it, and it was very reliable.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.059
But one day, he pulled up to a red light and out of nowhere, the engine died on him.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.000
He tried to turn it on multiple times, it wouldn't start, so he got it towed to his local mechanic.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.980
Now his mechanic put in a brand new computer,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.160
a brand new coil, and a brand new distributor,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
and none of these things fixed the car, this cost my neighbor a ton of money!

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.460
And he didn't want to pump any more money into this car,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.760
so he towed it home, got a new car, and parked this one indefinitely.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.100
This is a pretty nice car, again 90K miles, it's the EX version.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.420
Sunroof, cruise control, so it's the top of the line.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.960
And if I cleaned it up and got it running, it's worth between 2 and $3,000.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.380
So after sitting for four years in his driveway, the owner wanted to get rid of it.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.200
And instead of junking it, the owner gave it to me as kind of like a challenge.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
He sees me fixing cars in my driveway all the time

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.640
and he wants to see if I could get it started because his mechanic couldn't.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.820
So, in order to figure out what the problem is, you want to break it down into the five things an engine needs to run.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.180
The first three main things are fuel, air, and spark,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.160
but we also need compression and correct timing.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.900
So you can actually visualize it;

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.240
The air and the fuel have to mix together in the cylinder,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.300
and then the spark has to ignite that and create an explosion.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.720
Your engine needs compression so that piston can be forced down from that explosion

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.560
and all that has to happen at the exact correct time

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
in order for the engine to start and stay running.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.060
Now, before we go and diagnose those five things, real quick I want to mention

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.460
this engine hasn't run in over four years.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.060
So if your engine hasn't run in a year or longer,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.820
there's a few things you would want to do before you go and turn that key and try to start it.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.860
First, I had to charge up the battery because car batteries go dead in a couple of months if the car doesn't get used.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.180
Next I made sure that the coolant was filled so when we get the car started, it won't overheat.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.960
And then I checked the oil to make sure it was filled to the correct level,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.360
and this oil was fine.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.500
And finally, I pulled all the spark plugs out of the engine,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.220
grabbed some fogging oil which is a sprayable oil,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.720
and I sprayed it into each cylinder to lubricate the piston rings and cylinder walls.*

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.960
And since the spark plugs were out, I made sure to measure the gap, and all of them were good to go.*

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.380
So I installed them back into the engine and reconnected the wires so she was ready to get started.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.820
And now, we're ready to diagnose the problem.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.920
Now out of those five things that we talked about,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.880
the first thing I like to check is the fuel system, we want to make sure that fuel is getting into the engine.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.060
When I hear that a car just dies out of nowhere,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.560
I think right away that the fuel pump could have gone bad.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.160
So a real easy way to check that is to get in your car, grab your key, and put the key in the ignition.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.920
Now, you want to turn the key to the 'run' position,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.740
which is one click before it starts.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.460
When you put it in the 'run' position, what we're gonna be doing is listening for a hum.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.360
The hum is probably gonna come from around the back seat where the fuel tank is,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.920
and that hum means that the fuel pump is working.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.240
It's spinning, it's pressurizing the fuel system.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.120
If you don't hear a hum, that means the fuel pump is probably not getting power or the fuel pump is bad.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.760
So, ready? I'm going to have you listen to this. I'm not going to say anything...

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.280
We'll do that one more time...

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.080
And you can hear it turn on and then shut off which is perfect.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.820
That means our fuel pump is working.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.440
If you don't hear that, I have a whole video on how to diagnose and replace the fuel pump.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.320
There's a few things you can look for. A fuse, I could hear the relay clicking in there,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.140
and then the fuel pump itself.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.000
Now, in this case I could hear that pump, it's humming, that's good, it means it's working,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.220
but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're getting fuel pressure to the engine,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.260
and that's important, so we have to check that.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.920
And now's a good time to get some safety glasses on so we don't get fuel in our eyes.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.300
And what we're gonna be looking for is the fuel rail.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.220
So that's where the fuel injectors connect, you can see that rail right there, and you can see all four injectors.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.980
That fuel rail sometimes has a little Schrader valve on it or right near it,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.080
and it's almost like a valve for your tire stem that you add the air into the tire,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.260
but I don't see it anywhere, so this engine probably doesn't have one.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.060
But the next thing you could do if you can't test fuel pressure that way,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.300
what we could do is, you see this nut right here? That holds the fuel line into the fuel rail.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.280
If we loosen that just a little bit, when we turn the key, fuel should squirt out of here.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.040
So grab a cup or something to slide underneath

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.900
and this will catch the fuel that leaks out so we don't make a mess.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500
Next, I'm going to use a wrench to crack this open...

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.360
Good.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.420
And I'm also going to get a paper towel around here,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.020
to again try to prevent the gas from getting all over.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.700
Okay, so now turn the key to the 'run' position.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.460
And beautiful, we can see there's good fuel pressure because the fuel is squirting out nice and strong.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.020
So now we know there's fuel pressure.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.560
Let's tighten this up so it won't leak,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.120
and let's carefully remove the cup filled with gas.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.860
And that's an easy way to check for fuel pressure without a fuel pressure gauge.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.900
Now you saw we spilled a little bit of fuel, you want to make sure you clean that up right away.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.760
You don't want fuel vapors in the engine bay, especially when we go and test the ignition system for spark.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.580
Now, we know we have fuel pressure at the fuel rail,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.200
but are the fuel injectors working?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.280
Are they firing fuel into the engine?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
Well, an easy way to figure that out is to use a mechanic's stethoscope.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.900
And I do know not everybody has these so...

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.800
Instead, you could use a long flat-head screwdriver like this.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.000
The longer the better.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.660
So what you want to do is you want to get the end of the flat-head screwdriver

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.140
and touch it up against the fuel injector, make sure it's the only thing it's touching.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.360
And then on the other end of the screwdriver, you want to press your ear tight against this end,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.320
and if you listen closely while the engine is cranking, you should be able to hear rhythmic clicking,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.300
which means the fuel injector is firing.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.700
So you're able to hear that clicking, which means that fuel injector was working.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.100
Now, we need to test the other fuel injectors.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.740
So that one works.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.220
That one works.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.140
And that one works.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.300
So all four of our fuel injectors are firing and that means the entire fuel system is working on this car, that's great.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.320
But now let's just say all four of your fuel injectors weren't firing.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.900
The next thing to check would be the throttle position sensor.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.200
It's connected to the throttle body right back here,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.900
and it's this right there.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.440
What happens is these sometimes fail, they break, and they say that you're at wide open throttle.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.220
When your engine's at wide open throttle when you go to start a car, it starts in flood mode,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.600
so it doesn't use the fuel injectors, and that could be the cause of your problem.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.240
Sometimes, you could test the sensor just by removing the electrical connector to it

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.880
and then you can go and try to start the engine.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.320
If the engine starts, you definitely know it's that.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.980
I don't need to do that because all of our injectors are working,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.220
and our entire fuel system's working, so that's great.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.760
Now the next thing to check is the air, we need to make sure air is getting into the engine.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.660
And the first thing I want to do is just make sure that our air filter isn't clogged.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.600
Oh wow, that looks brand new on this side.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.560
Yeah, this looks good.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.180
And we want to make sure there's no animals nesting inside the intake tubing.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.500
And I don't see any evidence that there's an animal in here, like droppings or

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.180
a nest or anything like that.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.560
So it looks like our system is clog free, which is good.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.120
So let's get the air filter back in place and then clamp down the cover.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.440
So the filter and the intake are clog free which means air is getting into the engine,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.980
but that doesn't mean our sensors are working properly.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.460
So there's something called a mass airflow sensor, which is on the intake tubing on some cars.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.520
We don't have it here, but we do have a MAP sensor.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.900
Now both of these sensors tell the computer how much air is coming into the engine.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.100
If the sensor is not working, the car might not be able to start.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.940
Now, you could always test the sensors

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.440
or you could just try unplugging the sensor and seeing if she'll start.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.480
In this case, still not starting. I'm pretty sure it's not a sensor that's bad.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.020
But that's one way to check it out.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.180
So we know we have fuel and we know we're getting air into the engine, now the third thing to look for is spark.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.300
And now that starts at the distributor right here, which was replaced.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.900
I'm hoping they replaced it right, we're just going to assume for now that they did,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.580
and the spark is going to travel through the spark plug wires,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.500
into the spark plug, and hopefully it sparks inside the engine.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.480
Now to test that is actually pretty simple.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.060
They make a real inexpensive tool, I'll link it in the description.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.280
All you have to do is pull the wire out,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.280
you plug the tool into the wire,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.380
and then you plug this side of the tool over the spark plug,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.120
and now with everything plugged in, what we're going to be looking for

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.640
when you turn the key and you crank the engine, there's a light bulb in here.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.080
The electricity should pass through here and flash that light bulb.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.260
The light bulb should flash with a consistency.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.060
It shouldn't be sporadic and that means the ignition system is working.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.360
If there's no flash or it's sporadic,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.460
that means we could have a problem with the ignition system.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.100
So now we're gonna try to start the car and see if it lights up.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.680
And you can see the consistent flash, which means we're getting spark to that cylinder.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.620
Good. Now you want to repeat this test and check each cylinder to make sure you're getting spark in each one.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.500
So cylinder 2's getting spark.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.920
And cylinder 3.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.160
And cylinder 4.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.540
And it's that easy to check for spark.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.740
That's why I like using this tool, it makes it fast.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.980
Now we did find out that all four of our cylinders are getting spark.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.440
So we have fuel, we have air, and we have spark,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.820
but let's just say in your situation, you have no spark in any of the cylinders.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.440
It could be a bad distributor.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.540
Although distributors are on older cars, newer cars have something called coils.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.339
Usually, you'll notice a misfire before a coil goes out,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.840
but sometimes they do just quit.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.820
Even newer cars have something called a coil-on plug.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.960
Which it goes right on top of the plug like that.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.160
And a lot of times, these don't go bad all at the same time, you'll get one or two that go bad.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.920
So your engine should still run, it'll just run really rough.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.840
But those are all things to look at. In this case, we have spark, so there's two other things that we need to check,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.620
and that is compression. Hopefully we don't have bad compression.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.720
And we have to check to make sure we have good timing.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.199
Now a compression test is actually pretty simple to do. I'm going to give a quick overview.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.360
You could either rent one of these tools at your local parts store for free

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.940
or you could buy them, they're inexpensive,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.840
and they give you a lot of good information on the health of the engine.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.440
All you need to do is remove the spark plug wires

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.940
and all four spark plugs.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.100
And then we're going to take our compression gauge and we're going to thread it into the spark plug hole.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.639
And once it's threaded in there, now we can do our compression test.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:57.880
Now compression is how much pressure there is when the piston compresses in the cylinder.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.240
The higher the compression, the healthier the engine.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.220
So what we want to see is we want to see at least 90 psi of compression.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.900
Any lower than that, the engine might not start.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:11.020
Now when testing for compression, you want to turn the key and crank the engine four times per cylinder.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.320
You also want to make sure that you have the accelerator completely floored.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.020
That does two things; One, that shuts off the fuel injectors in most vehicles,

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:19.880
so we're not going to have gas shooting out of here,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.840
and it's also going to open up that intake so air could easily go into the cylinder,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.620
then we'll get an accurate compression reading.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.060
So you can see we have about 170 psi, which is really good,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.900
but that doesn't mean the other cylinders are good.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.620
So let's test each one out.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.500
Cylinder 2 is the same at 170 psi.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.500
Cylinder 3 is slightly lower at 160 psi, but that's fine.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.300
And cylinder 4 is 170 psi.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.720
Now all four cylinders were way above 90 psi and they were all pretty even.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.860
So that's good, we have a nice healthy engine.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.200
Now let's just say you had 90 psi or lower.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.640
One thing that you could do is you could put a little bit of oil in each cylinder

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.940
and then run it and see if your compression bumps up.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.020
If it does, your piston rings are bad.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.360
If it doesn't, you probably have something wrong with a valve or a crack somewhere.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.100
But we're good to go, we have compression. So we have...

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.440
fuel, air, spark, compression.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.220
There's one more thing, and that is timing.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.980
And to check the timing, we have to remove the timing belt cover,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.060
and to do that, we need to remove the valve cover.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.560
So there's five bolts right at the top of the valve cover that need to come off.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.500
And now we can wiggle this cover loose and set it off to the side.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.920
Oh boy, and this is not what you want to see when you pull a valve cover off.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.260
This is all sludge buildup from old oil that either didn't get changed often enough,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.120
or just sat for a long time, either way, it's not what you want to see.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.860
It won't stop the engine from running,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.400
and we can clean it up, but that's not the focus right now.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.080
The focus is checking out the timing.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.120
So let's remove the timing belt cover to get a better look.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.560
So I don't see any damage to the timing belt, it's not frayed, it's not cracked.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.040
But what I do want to check,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.420
you want to make sure that the timing belt is tight,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.240
and that is very loose.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.460
Your timing belt should be a lot tighter than that.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.520
Now with a loose belt, that could cause issues because the belt could slip on top of this camshaft gear.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.040
It could jump a couple of teeth, and then the camshaft won't be aligned with the crankshaft anymore.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.980
The engine will be out of time, and it'll shut off and it won't be able to restart.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.860
So now what we want to do is we want to see if the engine's in time, and to do that,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.560
let's take a look at the plastic marks on the timing cover right down here.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.680
You can see the two timing marks on the cover,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.400
which need to line up with the mark on the crankshaft pulley, which you can't see right now.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.160
So you need to line up both timing belt cover marks like you would the sights of a gun just like that.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.980
Now, we need to spin the engine in order to align those marks.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.840
And in order to do that, on this car, it's nice and easy.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.420
You turn the wheel outwards,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.320
use a really long extension,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.880
and push it through the slot in the plastic onto the crankshaft pulley bolt.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.720
Now spin the engine slowly until you can see the marks on the crankshaft pulley

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.860
line up with the timing belt cover marks.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.480
Oh, I went just a little bit too far. So reverse it ever so slightly.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.160
And get that aligned with that single line...

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.820
Perfect.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.200
Alright, with that crankshaft pulley aligned,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.760
now we have cylinder one, piston number one is all the way up on the compression stroke,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.720
and that is top dead center.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.060
So now what we want to do is we want to see what our camshaft alignment is.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.460
And if we take a look at our camshaft gear,

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.940
there should be an up arrow right on this right here.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.820
But there isn't, instead, the up arrow is down here.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.940
So this is completely out of alignment.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.580
So we're gonna want to get this camshaft back into alignment.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.520
And to do that, we're gonna try to remove the belt perfect.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.940
Normally, you have to loosen a tensioner, but this is so loose...

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.240
...I'm able to loosen this by hand.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.000
Good, now with the belt off, don't crimp it, and don't bend it, just set it aside.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.360
And you're going to want to get a ratchet on that camshaft gear to help you spin it by hand.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.560
Now you want to carefully spin the camshaft gear until the arrow faces up.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.200
And then on the timing belt cover, there's a mark right here,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.800
which has to align with the mark right on the cam gear.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.200
And that lines up there.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.340
And then the last alignment mark is this right here where it says "up."

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.580
I made this black so you could easily see it,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.120
and if we come over here,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.120
you can see it lines up with that mark right there.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.740
So the camshaft gear is in complete alignment.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.700
Let's slide the belt back on there.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.000
Good, and now the final step is to tighten down the belt.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.600
We don't want this to be loose and skip teeth again.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.120
So on these Hondas, just turn the crank shaft clockwise just a little bit,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.080
and what that does, that gives us belt tension on this side, this belt is nice and tight,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.420
but now the other side is still loose.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.560
So in order to get that tight,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.660
we need to tighten the belt tensioner pulley,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.400
and there's a little access port right where that sight is

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.520
that we used to align the crankshaft pulley.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.900
And we're gonna cinch that down nice and tight, so it doesn't loosen up again.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.980
Good.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.040
So I'm not going install the timing belt cover right now,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.880
I just want to see if we could get this started.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.760
So let's get the valve cover back on

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.240
and tighten down all five volts that hold it in place.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.600
Next, let's install all four spark plugs into the engine,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.980
and we're getting real close to firing this baby up!

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.760
And finish up by putting the wires back onto the plugs.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.400
Alright, everything's back together.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.280
We aligned this correctly at top dead center,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.060
and let's see if she'll start up.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.720
Moment of truth, here we go.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.960
Will she start?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480
YES!

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.940
Woo, baby! Alright!

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.520
And she is alive!

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.340
After four years of sitting there!

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.660
Holy smokes, this is awesome!

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.980
So that is how you diagnose a no start condition

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.500
when your engine cranks, but it just won't start.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.600
In this case, it ended up being the timing,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.220
but you saw those five different things that you would want to look at.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.320
I got this done in one hour,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.100
and we have basically a perfect car to use.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.300
I can't wait to tell my neighbor. He's gonna be so excited. I'm like shaking, this is so awesome.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.520
So I'm just gonna go let this run for a little bit.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.880
I'm probably gonna have to change the oil, I might want to change that timing belt too,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.540
but at the end of the day, we got the car started and that is-- oh man, that's so exciting!

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.160
