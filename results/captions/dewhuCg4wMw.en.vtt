00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.671
We're joined today by
college students, young

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.675
entrepreneurs, families,
workers, mothers, and

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.677
fathers from all
over our nation.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.647
You make this country run.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:18.284
It's an honor to be with
you, and it's an honor to

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.352
have you at the
White House.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.488
And thank you all for
being here --

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.188
really fantastic.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:22.989
Thank you.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.758
Great people.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:30.864
(applause)

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.167
As a candidate, I promised
we would pass a massive

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:38.905
tax cut for the everyday,
working American families

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.274
who are the backbone and
the heartbeat

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.209
of our country.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:47.580
Now we're just days away
-- I hope, I hope -- you

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.317
know what that means,
right -- from keeping that

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:55.221
promise and delivering a
truly amazing victory

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.557
for American families.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.560
We want to give you, the
American people, a giant

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.696
tax cut for Christmas.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.832
And when I say
giant, I mean giant.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.768
(applause)

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:18.178
As we speak, Congress has
reached an agreement on

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:23.082
tax legislation that will
deliver more jobs, higher

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.287
wages, and massive tax
relief for American

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.056
families and for
American companies.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:35.862
The typical family of four
earning $75,000 will see

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.631
an income tax cut of more
than $2,000, slashing

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.367
their tax bill in half.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.304
It's going to be
a lot of money.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.473
You're going to have
an extra $2,000.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.808
But there are many
more things than that.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.579
Our plan expands the child
tax credit for

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.446
working families.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.248
You'll hear the numbers
very soon, but they're

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.051
even larger than
anticipated.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.254
It nearly doubles the
amount of income taxed

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.956
at the rate of zero.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.592
I don't know if any of
you are paying zero.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.495
I hope you're not; I hope
you're paying above that.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:11.364
But a lot of people who
are having it a little

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.000
bit tough are going
to be paying zero.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.938
It closes special interest
loopholes; it lowers tax

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:23.042
rates for families; and
our plan also cuts taxes

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:28.114
on businesses, which is
expected to raise income

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.984
by an average of
more than $4,000.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.785
So your income goes up.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.388
It's like having a $4,000
increase, which isn't

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.724
bad, which isn't bad.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.325
a lot of money to spend.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.394
A lot of jobs are going to
be created with the

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.664
money that you spend
-- very special.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.233
And it makes America
competitive again so we

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.336
can bring back that simple
but beautiful phrase,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.139
you've heard it before:
Made in the USA.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:53.806
Right?

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.275
I don't know if they've
heard it, but

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.075
you've heard it.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:00.013
(applause)

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:06.953
Our current tax code is
burdensome, complex, and

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.455
profoundly unfair.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.226
It has exported our jobs,
closed our factories, and

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.228
left millions of parents
worried that their

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.731
children might be the
first generation to have

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.101
less opportunity
than the last.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.570
Our factories have left.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.805
So many of them, gone.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.073
But they're all
coming back.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.642
And you see it, even
before we do this, that

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.978
they're starting
to come back.

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.514
Our country is starting to
do really well again, and

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.784
as a country we're
being respected again.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.452
We're being
respected again.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:45.258
I'm here today to tell you
that we will never let bad

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:48.928
things happen, with
respect to the economy

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:49.896
of our country.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.432
We're not going to lose
our businesses again like

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.568
has happened over the
last number of decades.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:59.205
America is coming back
bigger and better and

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.941
stronger than ever before.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.609
Okay?

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.943
They'll see it, and
they're going to

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:04.944
see the result.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:09.616
America isn't content
just by getting by.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:13.853
America is about getting
ahead, about finding the

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:17.123
best in ourselves
and in each other.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:21.160
We are reclaiming our
destinies as Americans, a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.931
nation that thinks big,
dreams bigger, and always

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.433
reaches for the stars.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.604
We didn't become great
through massive taxation

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.840
and Washington regulation.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.743
And, by the way, we are
cutting regulation at a

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:40.580
rate never seen before
in the history

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.781
of our country.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.486
We became great because
our people, our families

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.656
-- and because
of our freedom.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:53.092
We became great because of
our drive to find the next

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:58.297
horizon, to unlock the
next mystery, and to begin

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:00.266
the next adventure.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.702
You know what I'm
talking about.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.938
And that's who we are: a
nation of strivers and

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:09.842
builders and dreamers and
doers, people who treasure

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:13.546
their independence and
don't know how to quit.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:14.580
Never quit.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.685
Never, ever give
up -- never, ever.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:22.955
I say that, also, to
our great Cabinet.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.357
And they've done
a great job.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:26.159
A lot of things
have happened.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.061
Nobody's done the
job that we've done.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:31.431
When government loosens
its grip, there is no

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.067
summit we cannot reach.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:38.171
Our tax cuts will break
down, and they'll break it

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.808
down fast -- all forms of
government, and all forms

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.077
of government barriers --
and breathe new life into

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.279
the American economy.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.449
They will unleash the
American worker; they will

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.653
tear down the restraints
on discovery, innovation,

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.022
and creation; and they
will restore the hopes

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.858
and dreams of the
American family.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.893
Millions of middle-class
families will

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.095
win under our plan.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:06.365
And today we are honored
to hear from a few of

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.168
those wonderful and
truly great families.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:16.943
Bryant and Ashley Glick
-- right -- are from

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.879
Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.114
I know it well.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.082
They have two beautiful
children with a third

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:23.883
on the way.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.853
Bryant manages a farm
equipment store.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.355
Ashley works
in healthcare.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.091
This year, they were
in the 15-percent

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.426
tax bracket.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.262
Under our plan, they will
drop to the

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:37.730
12-percent bracket.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.898
That's a big drop.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.434
Instead of itemizing their
deductions, they will be

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:44.937
able to file their taxes
on a single, little,

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.806
beautiful sheet of paper.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.174
That's good.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:48.875
That's good.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.843
(applause)

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.154
And instead of paying
$2,600 in income taxes,

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.589
they will get it
down to $2,000.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.526
They'll save at least $600
and probably

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.194
more than that.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.897
Bryant, Ashley, how about
saying a few words?

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:11.697
You want to?

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.333
Come on.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.968
Thank you very much.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:19.305
Mr. Glick: Well, thank
you, Mr. President.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.040
It's an honor to be here.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.042
On behalf of the good
people of Lancaster

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.778
County; my family;
and, specifically, my

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.014
grandmother, Linda
Martin, well done.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:32.285
Many of your predecessors
promised that this

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.020
reform was coming,
but you did it.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.790
We are greatly
excited about this.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.993
With the tax savings that
we are going to see, we

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.895
are going to put
that money into

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.096
home renovations.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:48.000
And I'm excited that you
were the one that got it

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.235
over the finish line.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.369
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.370
(applause)

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.375
The President: The Kovacs
family also joins us

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.515
today from Ohio.

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.482
That's a great state.

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:05.685
A lot of success in Ohio.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.053
(laughter)

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.322
Adam is a veteran
who works in

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.490
telecommunications,
Lindsay works in

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.195
administration admissions
at a university, and they

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.064
have two beautiful
children.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:20.132
This year, they're
currently in the

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:25.438
25-percent bracket and pay
nearly $14,000 in taxes.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:29.175
Our plan gives them their
time back because they

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.944
won't have to itemize,
and it gives them nearly

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:34.380
one-third of their money
back -- more than

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.151
$3,500 for one year.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:42.021
I'd like to invite the
Kovacs to explain what our

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.589
tax cuts will
mean for them.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.024
They've studied
it very closely.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:47.760
These are very
smart, sharp people.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.729
They know exactly what
we're doing here,

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:50.897
and they like it.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:51.831
Come on up.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:52.832
Thank you.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:58.404
(applause)

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.106
Mr. Kovacs: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.376
It is truly an honor that
you invited the Kovacs

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.478
family to the
White House today.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.013
This is going to be
great for our family.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:11.651
We have home renovations
that we want to take care

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.754
of, and hopefully save for
our two children

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.455
to go to college.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.790
Thank you so much,
Mr. President.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.624
(applause)

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:23.629
The President: The
Giampolo family is from

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.168
Polk County, Iowa.

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:34.073
Anthony is a police
officer and Aubyn is a 911

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.442
emergency dispatcher.

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:39.245
When they're not at work
protecting and serving

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.548
their fellow citizens,
their hands are full with

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:43.916
four wonderful children.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:47.186
This year, they were in
the 25-percent bracket,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.655
their itemized deductions,
and they've done

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:50.756
everything they can.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:55.027
They paid more than
$19,000 in taxes -- thank

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.696
you very much, by the way;
that's a lot of money.

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.298
(laughter)

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:02.134
Under our plan, they will
file on a single

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.070
page and save $2,700.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.007
Anthony, Aubyn, maybe
you'd like to

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:08.841
say a few words?

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.508
Come on in.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:10.409
(applause)

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:15.414
Mr. Giampolo:I just want
to thank President Trump.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:22.455
Education is very
important to our family.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:26.525
Under this bill, our
family will be able to

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:27.259
save a lot of money.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.695
We have a lot of people
going to school.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.565
My wife and I are both in
graduate school, finishing

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:36.135
up, and we still got three
other -- four other kids

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.003
to get through college.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.571
So, it will
help out a lot.

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:45.144
(laughter and applause)

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:50.316
The President: Leon an
Maria Benjamin are pastors

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.986
of New Life Harvest Church
-- and it's a beautiful

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.489
church in Richmond,
Virginia -- and they have

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.723
three wonderful children.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:00.926
Under our plan, they will
get a larger tax refund to

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.995
help them pay their bills.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.031
They'll receive a tax
refund, this

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.199
year, of $3,000.

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:12.271
Leon and Maria, I would
love you to discuss your

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.274
middle-class tax cut
a little bit with the

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.609
millions of people
watching right

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.410
now on television.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.844
(laughter)

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.514
You do very well, and
we're very proud of you.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.182
And it is indeed a
beautiful church.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.284
I got to see a very,
very nice picture.

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.886
We'll have to get
there someday soon.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:27.553
Thank you.

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:28.854
Come on in,
please, please.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.824
(applause)

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:38.664
Mr. Benjamin: (laughter)

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.466
To God be the glory.

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.836
Thank you, President
Trump, for

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.237
inviting us here.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.573
On behalf of the Benjamin
family and of course,

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.576
Richmond, Virginia, we
represent a cadre of many

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.678
families across
the nation.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.914
African American families,
urban communities, and

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:58.217
families all across
need this now.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.754
And it's time for a
change, and it's time that

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:04.190
we recognize that our
President is making

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.425
good on his promises.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.427
(applause)

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.729
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.432
God bless you, and we'll
continue to keep praying

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:16.735
for you and your team as
you move forward and forge

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.138
ahead with this new
future in America.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.306
God bless you.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:25.578
(applause)

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.916
The President: He can
be my minister anytime.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.151
(laughter)

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:37.189
The Howard family lives
in Tenino, Washington.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:40.159
Issac owns an espresso
machine service company,

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.862
and Emily takes care of
their four

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.230
beautiful children.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.365
They are currently in the
15-percent bracket

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:49.034
and pay $2,500 in taxes.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:52.371
Our plan will totally wipe
out their tax bill, and

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:56.242
they might even get a
refund of substantially

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.877
more than $700.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.545
I'd like to
introduce them.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.146
Come on up.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:05.584
(applause)

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.689
Mrs. Howard: I'm going
to speak for us today.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:11.757
(laughter)

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:14.226
We are absolutely blessed
to be here, so thank

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.261
you, Mr. President.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.196
It's our joy to stand
before you guys.

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:21.066
And what this means to us
as a family is that we

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:24.370
will be able to pour out
into our community --

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.906
whatever that looks like
-- giving away to families

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:30.042
that are in need, or
setting them up for

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:33.012
success in any way that --
whatever God has

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:34.013
planned for our family.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.348
I think that that is our
goal, and that we are

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:38.584
blessed to have such an
amazing President --

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.419
and what a good steward
he is of our country.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.754
So thank you,
Mr. President.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:49.061
(applause)

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.464
The President:
Well, thank you all.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.768
It's critically important
for Congress to quickly

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:59.471
pass these historic tax
cuts, and that's going to

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:03.709
take place, I think, even
before the media --

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:04.643
I used the word "media."

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:07.413
Did you notice?

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:09.048
As opposed to "fake news
media" -- I don't say.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.050
(laughter)

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.052
Because today is a
very important day.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:15.321
We want everybody to be
covered very accurately.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:20.259
So I'm excited to announce
that if Congress sends me

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:25.364
a bill before Christmas,
the IRS -- this is just

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:29.034
out, this is breaking news
-- has just confirmed that

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.637
Americans will see lower
taxes and bigger paychecks

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:36.275
beginning in February,
just two short

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.810
months from now.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.246
(applause)

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:41.313
Just got that.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:46.252
We just got that.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.854
Fifty-five years ago this
week, President John F.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.924
Kennedy, a Democrat,
launched a historic effort

00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:55.928
to pass sweeping
top-to-bottom tax cuts.

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.330
A half a century later,
we're reminded that

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.433
lowering taxes is neither
a Republican or Democrat

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:04.603
idea, but an American
principle and

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:05.938
an American idea.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.774
The goal of my
administration is for

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:12.077
every American to know the
dignity of work, the pride

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.014
of a paycheck, and the
satisfaction of

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:18.017
a job well done.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:20.586
We want people to love
waking up in the morning

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.789
and going to work -- just
with that incredible

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.492
enthusiasm that we
have in this country.

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.993
And that's what we're
going to be doing, and

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.428
that's what's going
to be happening.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.331
Today we stand on the
verge of a new

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.666
economic miracle.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.935
Our economy has already
surged to 3 percent growth

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:40.773
-- far ahead of schedule,
by the way -- far, far

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.841
ahead -- in each of
the last two quarters.

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.010
And if we didn't have the
hurricanes, we could have

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.512
hit four last quarter.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.416
Four -- a number that was
unthinkable two years ago

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:53.686
when I started the
campaign, and even my

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.321
first month in office --
that was an

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.389
unthinkable number.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:58.824
And I'll tell you what,
it's going to

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.859
go higher than that.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:06.465
We've created 2.2 million
jobs since the election.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.835
Unemployment is
at a 17-year low.

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:13.372
The unemployment rate in
the manufacturing business

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.641
is the lowest in
recorded history.

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:21.213
Consumer confidence
is a 17-point high.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:25.050
Pensions and retirement
accounts are soaring as

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.355
the stock market hits 85
new record highs

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.189
since the election.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.056
How are we doing?

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.191
Are we doing okay?

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.058
Not bad, right?

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:39.264
(applause)

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:43.736
And if Congress sends me a
tax reform, this is only a

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.805
small beginning to the
incredible things that our

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:49.742
people will achieve over a
very short period of time,

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:53.479
and the tremendous heights
that we will reach

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.315
economically and so many
other ways in our country.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:17:00.619
Every day, as this victory
draws closer -- I mean, we

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.054
are so close, right now.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.155
So close.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.624
In fact, almost -- I don't
want to talk about it.

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:06.825
Maybe we shouldn't
talk about it.

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.861
(laughter)

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.431
The cynical voices that
opposed tax cuts grow

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.967
smaller and weaker, and
the American

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.668
people grow stronger.

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.704
I heard one of our
opponents stand up the

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.572
other day and say,
this is for the rich.

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:21.240
They had no idea.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.708
They didn't even
see the final bill.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.777
I didn't see
the final bill.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:28.747
This is for the people
of middle-income.

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:32.117
This is for companies that
are going to create jobs.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:36.121
This is for very, very
special people, the great

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.023
people of America.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:40.826
Everyday, hardworking
Americans know that the

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:44.596
future of this nation will
never belong to those who

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:48.867
say you can't; it will
always belong to the

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:52.938
American people who
will say we will.

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:58.177
belongs to people like the
Glicks, the Kovacs, the

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:01.380
Giampolos, the Benjamins,
the Howards, and the

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.116
millions of Americans
just like them across our

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:07.352
nation, who pour out their
hearts and souls every

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:10.456
single day to take care
of their families and the

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:14.493
country they love
and that we love.

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.930
We are going to have a
country that celebrates

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.300
you again -- hardworking,
great people.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.635
You're being
celebrated again.

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.771
Remember that.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.940
Because you were a
little bit forgotten.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.342
We had called it "the
forgotten people."

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.144
Somebody else called me
and everybody

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.345
else the "deplorables."

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:35.681
Have you ever
heard that term?

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.381
Right?

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.584
We're proud to be the
deplorables,

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.618
and we're doing well.

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:43.856
going to make our tax
system work for you again.

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.391
We're going to make our
economy work

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.860
for you again.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.096
And we are going to make
the American Dream -- and

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.765
that's the real dream --
that will be the dream

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:56.368
that you want for your
children and your

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.871
grandchildren once again.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:02.474
But we need your help to
get Congress across

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:04.743
that finish line.

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:07.412
We'll have very little
Democrat support, probably

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:11.350
none, and that's purely
for political reasons.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.286
They like it a lot,
and they can't say it.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.621
They don't like
what's happening.

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.823
But they can't say it.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.892
Some day we have to
come together and do

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.461
bipartisan, and hopefully
it can happen soon.

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.597
Right?

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.000
(applause)

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.773
If you make your voices
heard, this moment will be

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:38.310
forever remembered as a
great new beginning, the

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.580
dawn of a brilliant
American future shining

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.117
with patriotism,
prosperity, and pride.

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:48.220
With your help, we will
bring back our jobs; we

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.057
will bring back our wealth
as a country; and, for

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:54.526
every citizen across this
beautiful land, we will

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.529
bring back our great
American Dreams.

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.331
you and God bless you all.

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.232
Thank you very much.

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.767
Thank you.

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.135
(applause)
