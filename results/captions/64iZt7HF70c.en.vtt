00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.129
Hi I’m Mike and today is the one paycheck
of the year that the ranch gets, its sale

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.500
day on our Wyoming life.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:22.160
As a farmer myself, the day that calves go
to auction is bitter sweet.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.360
Lots of work goes into the care little guys but I know that when they leave we've done a good job

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.760
and its gonna keep the farm around for another year

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.550
This is the circle of life, we provide for
them and they provide for us, in so many different ways

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.309
I love watching the baby calves grow and when
it time to leave, it can be sad,

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.950
but they are a part of a much bigger
picture, for us, and the world.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.260
This is our Wyoming life, we invite you to
come along with us 3 times per week as we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.180
explore the ranch life and escape the ordinary.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.880
We weren’t raised here on the ranch, we
weren’t farm kids, but life can sometimes

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.370
throw you a curveball and we went from working
corporate jobs in the city, to working livestock

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.649
and the land.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.310
My wife Erin takes you into the life of a
market gardener, supporting the ranch by growing

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.430
thousands of pounds of produce per year, selling
it at farmers market.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.090
Fighting hunger and food insecurity by donating
it at local food banks, and community services,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.810
such as food pantries and Snap and WIC.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.950
On the ranch, I take you through all the aspects
of learning as we go, giving the good and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.399
bad and hopefully learning something about
ourselves and life on the way.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.740
Years ago when we came here, we had no idea
what we were doing, nor did we know what we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.869
were up against.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.829
Now I’m proud to say that we can share this
journey with you, and I am glad that you decided

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:08.700
to come along, please subscribe as we invite
you to become a part of the ranch with us.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.630
Every day of the year on the ranch leads up
to these couple of days.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.760
And one day that can make or break the whole
place.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.900
A day that is some years makes it all worth
it and other years can leave you wondering

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.090
if its worth it at all.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.730
Today is sale time, this year almost every
calf that was born on the ranch will be sold

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.780
at auction, they will be sorted off from the
cows and loaded on to a truck and auctioned

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.840
off to buyers.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.830
That’s the down and dirty, but there is
so much more to it then just that.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.200
There is blood, sweat and tears that all go
into supporting our family and feeding yours.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.379
Long before the big trucks show up in the
driveway, and even long before any new calves

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:09.240
are born on the ranch, it all starts with
just a bull and a cow.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.700
Mating season on the ranch takes place from
July until September, cows are bred and then

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.390
are expected to give birth about 9 months
afterwards.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.680
Timing is important, as we want calves to
be born in April and May when winter is subsiding

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.210
and weather will hopefully be easier on them.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.680
We preg check cows, checking to see who is
pregnant and who isn’t, when they aren’t

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.379
pregnant, we figure out why and decide what
needs to happen to them.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.410
Some will leave the ranch, some will be given
a second chance but when it come down to it,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.069
its about having the most and healthiest calves
we can from our herd.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.600
Over the winter, all the cows are fed well.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.049
Throughout the winter months their diets will
change, based on what stage of development

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.799
the calf fetus is in.

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.079
Earlier on they will receive more filling
diets then, added protein and supplements

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.930
as they reach the end of their pregnancy.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.129
Receiving, nutrients such as cobalt, potassium
and other trace minerals that they need.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.440
As spring rounds the corner, calves are starting
to be born.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.200
Some healthy and some not so healthy.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.630
The calves having trouble are given special
treatment to get them up to snuff.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.100
We have the equivalent of enough training
to help get them healthy, administering medications,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.440
tube feeding and what ever else may be required
to help these little guys and girls back out

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.160
with their moms for summer.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.350
Over summer, the cows and calves are left
to graze and grow.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.750
Our job them becomes to maintain the herd.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:05:01.360
Fix fence, doctor the occasional sick one,
and make sure that they are healthy and happy.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.680
We make or buy the hay over the summer that
they are going to need to grow new calves

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.220
the following year as the cycle repeats and
as October nears, we know that soon their

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.000
time on the ranch will come to and end.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.540
And that brings us to today.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.470
The ranch is the biggest and most important
character in our entire story.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.720
Its bigger than Erin or I, its bigger than
any individual cow.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.310
The ranch is what has been here for over a
hundred years, doing the same thing we do

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.490
everyday.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.530
Technology changes and methods evolve, but
when it comes down to it, the only way the

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.550
ranch supports itself is through calves.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.770
One paycheck per year, that’s what we work
for and as we begin to gather cows and calves

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.940
from as far as 3 miles away we start seeing
all that years work come into sight.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.820
The entire herd is gathered and pushed toward
home where our corrals and loading chutes

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:43.800
are located.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.990
Once they are all in, then its back to look
for stragglers, and there is always one or

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.990
two.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.490
Those cows and calves that slept through the
entire process.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.020
These are the winners of the booby prize,
they missed the parade but they still get

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.600
one of their own.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.990
Until they are rejoined with their friends.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:11.250
Right here is where all the action will take
place tomorrow, the loading chute.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.930
Tall enough for a semi-trailer to back up
to but the calves will have a bit of a climb

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.940
to get up here.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.660
One trick we learned a few years ago was that
the calves didn’t like climbing the wooden

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.210
floor of the chute.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.530
To help them as they come up, we put dirt
down on the floor of the ramp and chute.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.090
A more familiar footing for them and making
them more comfortable as they load into the

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.440
trailer.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.630
The cows are now in for the night, penned
up close to home.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.660
The loading chute is ready to go and the only
thing to do is wait for tomorrow, when the

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.720
trucks arrive, and all that hard work pays
off.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:59.930
The day has come, and its time to finish bringing
the cows in to the corrals for sorting,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.230
I’m a big fan of working smarter and not
harder.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.720
Hard work is still something you cant avoid
around here but if you can do something to

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.780
make it a bit easier, then it makes sense.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.660
For cows, food is a huge motivator and by
loading up some cake, a nutrional supplement

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:25.180
that the cows love, into the gator we can
coax some of them into the corrals.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.650
Although its still early, this will keep a
few of them in where they need to be and help

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.080
bring in the rest.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.260
Neighbors arrive to help, just as I do for
them and we start bringing cows in the rest

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.640
of the way.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.420
Moving them slowly and without much pressure,
and soon enough all contained in two large

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:51.310
sorting corrals.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.000
Our next goal is to sort the calves off the
cows.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.560
We aren’t keeping any replacements from
this years calves, and most all of them, aside

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.620
from the ones we are finishing ourselves are
going.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.910
Most of all of our cows have been through
this before, they know the routine and most

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.180
sort themselves past me, leaving the calves
back in the alley.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.170
Cows move up and around the corrals back out
to pasture and the calves are left behind,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.770
to be pushed up into another holding corral.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:35.490
A smooth and simple process, with the right
help and one that would take me all day without

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.300
them.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.710
Once done we are left with corrals of calves,
all ready to go.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.650
They have water and food while they wait but
they don’t wait long as the trucks show

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.690
up, right on time.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:55.090
Loading the truck isnt as simple as just pushing
them all, the cattle hauler trailer is divided

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.400
into many different compartments of different
sizes, and I first get together with our truck

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:11.960
driver and figure out how many go in each
one.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:19.030
After the logistics are done, then its time
to load.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.860
Counting out each group, moving them up into
the loading pen and then up the ramp and onto

00:10:23.860 --> 00:11:22.790
the trailer.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:28.240
When one truck is full, another moves into
its place and the process is repeated, until

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.470
the corrals are empty and last calf is loaded
on, the doors are closed and its time for

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.940
the trucks to hit the road.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:47.140
Off to the auction, where they are bought
from buyers all over the area.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.360
Some years, we follow the calves to auction,
this year we stayed behind on the ranch, to

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.370
baby sit the cows.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:58.080
As we let them out into a bigger pasture,
they move on with their lives, heading out

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.360
to eat, grazing on some nice green grass left
over from summer.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.260
Although the cows don’t notice their calves
missing now, they soon will, as their milk

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.740
will continue to come in.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.610
Soon, it will become uncomfortable for them,
as they want to be milked.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.920
I cant help them with that, they will soon
dry up, but as they look for someway to relieve

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.300
the pressure they do get loud and sleeping
becomes something that we have only heard

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:34.130
of in rumors, at least for a couple of days.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:40.770
Because soon enough, its back to life as normal.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.440
The calves are gone, the cows are no longer
eating for two and they can start building

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.410
themselves back up.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:52.090
Having a 500lb calf to support can really
drag a cow down and these cows are our breeding

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:57.090
herd, they are the backbone of our operation.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.670
Its with them that the ranch continues each
and every year, and its with their calves

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.779
that we can afford to do it.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:08.570
Each calf will bring between 800-1000 dollars
at auction.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.150
This year, after paying for hay, expenses
that we have accrued over the last year from

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:19.190
everything from equipment repairs, to fence
posts, we are lucky to keep about 20% of our

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:24.550
total sale price as operating expenses for
this next year, it doesn’t leave much.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:30.130
Talk to any rancher or farmer, and you have
good years and bad.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.000
Boom and bust, whatever you want to call it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.840
For some its all about the good years, for
some they need the boom, but for some of us,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.460
its about being here.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.410
The ranch is a legacy, something that our
kids will hopefully want to continue someday.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:55.810
Over a hundred years of ups and down, some
years your hold a flush, some it’s a pair

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:02.350
of twos, but come the next year you are going
to ante up and for us, even if we have to

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.440
bluff, we are going to succeed.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:12.490
Today is never easy, you get to know calves,
you become attached to all the animals here,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.200
because they are all important.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.220
I’ll never waiver on that, I’ll never
say a calf is just a calf, or just a paycheck,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.779
because that’s not how any rancher thinks,
or should think.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:28.690
Its about the future, of our family, our kids,
and the future of the ranch.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.460
When we first came here, I would have never
thought I could be so attached to something

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.360
that back then I saw as trivial as a bunch
of dirt.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.230
Now it means a whole lot more.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:47.790
Calves are our favorite hello on the ranch,
but also our hardest goodbye, with their help

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.430
our journey will continue, roadblocks will
be set up in our way, we will figure out how

00:14:52.430 --> 00:15:01.880
to get over or around them and we plan on
bringing you along for the ride.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.720
Thanks for coming out to the ranch today,
hanging out with us a little bit and keeping

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.710
me company.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:14.300
Tonight, a big glass of whiskey is in store,
as a celebration, and a toast to another year,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.300
and a toast to you.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:21.060
We just hit 50 thousand subscribers, a number
that blows me away, and I want to say how

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.850
much I truly appreciate, the fact that you
want to know where your food comes from and

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.440
the families behind it.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.120
Its inspiring to me and keeps me going everyday.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.320
We will be back on Tuesday, with another project
list video and we will also announce the winner

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.850
