00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.310
So, you're here for the first time.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.940
Seven years on your own accord.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.890
&gt;&gt; And we lured you in so many other ways.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.690
And then you finally,
you were on reluctantly,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.835
cuz we got these baseball
players that you love.

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; But then you moved.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.980
You used to be right next door.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
this soundstage was the Soundstage, too.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.520
&gt;&gt; Did you know that?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.220
In fact, the very last scene I did on
the show was literally, like, right here.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.794
&gt;&gt; Like right here?

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.681
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I know, it's so

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.830
cool that this was the Stage, and
now it's the Ellen DeGeneres stage.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.540
Did you know they named it for me?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.190
Did you know that?

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.440
&gt;&gt; The set's named for you now?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.090
&gt;&gt; No, the stage.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.180
There's a plaque on the wall.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.720
They gave it to me for my-
&gt;&gt; You're kidding, really?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.460
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.692
For the 2000th show or something.

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:42.050
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Isn't that great?

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.815
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:47.225
&gt;&gt; You're in my building.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.122
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'm a little hurt.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:49.717
&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:52.665
&gt;&gt; It's not like we didn't have
a successful show or anything.

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:53.176
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:53.780
&gt;&gt; But it's okay, it's good.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.545
&gt;&gt; How long did Go?

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:55.521
&gt;&gt; 15 years.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.704
&gt;&gt; Well, this is 13.

00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:58.678
&gt;&gt; I was on it for five.

00:00:58.678 --> 00:00:59.596
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:00.965
&gt;&gt; I don't care.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:01.477
Let it go.

00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:02.852
It's yours.
&gt;&gt; Speaking of hurt feelings,

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:04.085
why wasn't I invited to your wedding?

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:07.645
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was, you know,

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:08.392
you were-
&gt;&gt; It was an oversight.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:09.987
&gt;&gt; Honestly, it was right on the edge.

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:12.982
It was right there at the-
&gt;&gt; Cut-off line?

00:01:12.982 --> 00:01:14.399
&gt;&gt; You were right at the cut-off line.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.298
&gt;&gt; No.
How many people went?

00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:20.210
&gt;&gt; We only had a 105 people there.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.957
&gt;&gt; And so, I was the 106th?

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:23.495
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Six, yeah.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:24.320
&gt;&gt; That's a shame.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.180
&gt;&gt; Well, it just felt weird.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; It felt wrong to just invite you and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.200
not Porsche.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.660
&gt;&gt; Not Porsche,
that would have been rude, yeah.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.330
&gt;&gt; That would have been rude.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, you did the right thing.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it felt wrong.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.537
&gt;&gt; It seemed like it was fun.

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:39.530
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,
my wife is Lebanese, and that's,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.285
there's, that's-
&gt;&gt; Close to Lesbianese.

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:44.651
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Very close, you're right.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:47.980
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I hadn't even thought of it that way.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.803
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:52.538
&gt;&gt; Now it all makes much more sense.

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:57.000
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; They have huge families, the Lebanese.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.260
So, just getting the wedding down to-
&gt;&gt; To her family?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you had no-

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.530
&gt;&gt; I had two people there.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, speaking of, first of all,
very, very happy for you.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.560
I'm happy that you're happy and married.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which nobody thought you would

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.575
get married.

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:10.220
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, we-

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.865
&gt;&gt; Including me.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.470
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I mean you were really

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.200
adamant about that.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.360
You said you were not gonna get married.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.280
So, how long, and maybe you've been
asked this before, but I don't know.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.670
When you met her, how long did it take for
you to go, I'm actually gonna marry her?

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.590
&gt;&gt; It's funny,
we were talking about that today.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.893
I think about six months until I actually
thought I might pop the question.

00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:32.425
And it was one of the horrible moments.

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:36.012
We didn't talk about it.

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:39.610
It wasn't like,
maybe we should get married or anything.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.710
I plotted the whole thing out.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.475
Had the ring hidden behind her.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.680
I had music playing.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.830
My Aunt Rosemary's gonna sing,
Why Shouldn't I.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.776
Everything was planned out.

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.420
And I've cooked dinner.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.170
And she comes in, and she's just come
back from London, and she's dressed up.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.370
Usually, she'll dress up and now she's
like, well maybe we'll just order in.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.770
And I go, no, I made dinner.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.280
And then I've got it all setup,
timed out, and the song is coming,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.205
and she gets up to go wash the dishes,
which she's never done.

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:13.832
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And I'm like, what are you doing?

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:14.448
Don't.

00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:16.020
And she comes back in.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.518
And finally, I said,
I blew out the candles,

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.960
I said, I think the lighter
is in the box behind you.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.850
And she reached around,
she pulls out the box.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.210
And I've got just the ring
sitting in there.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.685
And she pulls it out, and she looks at it,
and she's like, it's a ring.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:31.730
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Like,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.160
somebody had left it there
some other time, I don't know.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.831
I'm like, and I'm doing all
the moves you can do with my face.

00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:42.332
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I got down on my knee, and I said,

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:47.450
I couldn't imagine spending
the rest of my life without you.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.880
And she kept looking at the ring, and she
was looking at me, and she's like, my god.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.220
And we now know,
because there's a playlist, so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.670
we know how long it actually took.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.380
And it's like 25 minutes, 25 minutes.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.820
And I finally, I literally said,
look, I hope the answer is yes,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.320
but I need an answer,
cuz you know I'm 52, and

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.291
I could throw out my hip pretty
soon if I don't get an answer.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.180
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And then she said, okay,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.700
yes,
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.210
&gt;&gt; Which worked out really well.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.140
&gt;&gt; Wow, It did, that's beautiful,
that's amazing.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.104
It is a beautiful story, cuz I'm sure
she just assumed that'll never happen,

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:24.502
cuz everyone was very-
&gt;&gt; Well, it was one of those funny things.

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:28.148
From the minute we met,
we just hit it off.

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:31.499
And from the minute we met, we sort of
felt like we were gonna be together.

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.022
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.028
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's nice.
&gt;&gt; That's beautiful,

00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:33.623
I'm very happy for you.

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:34.645
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; I am, too.

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:35.145
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
