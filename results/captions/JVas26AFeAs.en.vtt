[MODEM NOISE]

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.490
SHANE SMITH: So after traveling
across Siberia on

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.410
one train, deep into the middle
of nowhere, we switched

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.110
to another train going
even deeper into

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.440
the middle of nowhere.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.480
And finally, after two and a
half very drunken days on the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.290
train, we arrived in Tynda,
where the North Korean

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.762
administrative camp was.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.280
So we just got to Tynda.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.080
Some say it's the worst town
in all of Russia--

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.440
the most depressing.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.020
And we're actually going to try
to go to the office that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950
runs all the North Koreans in
the region and see if we can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.200
ask them some questions.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.920
We met this cop on the train.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.050
He seemed liked a nice guy.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.110
He got the thugs away from us
when things got a bit drunk-y.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.220
And so then he's offered to
help us, which is good.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.540
Because when we went to the
hotel to check in, we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.260
didn't check in.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.630
Why?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.860
Because the FSB, who used to be
the KGB, are asking about

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.410
us, saying, let us know
when they check in.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.650
So the lady said, I'll let them
know, but I'm letting you

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.250
know that I'm letting
them know.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.420
So we're like, OK, we won't
be staying there.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.370
So we stayed in an apartment
where the water

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.490
smelled like gasoline.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.110
And now we have a cop that we're
going to bring with us,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.755
so we seem more official when we
go meet the North Koreans.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.550
We just got here, and
we see posters

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.510
of Kim Il-Sung already.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.850
And also it says here that they
will lay their lives down

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.200
for the revolution of the great
leader, Kim Jong-Il.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.720
What are we waiting
for, by the way?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.580
SIMON OSTROVSKY: For one of
the bosses of the camp.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.138
SHANE SMITH: Look, he's got,
like, a Kim Il-Sung pin and

00:02:09.138 --> 00:02:11.114
everything.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.240
SHANE SMITH: So the North
Koreans don't want us to go

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.440
into the North Korean camp?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.920
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They don't
want to go into the north

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.550
Korean camp.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.800
SHANE SMITH: That's
very surprising.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.140
So we came out here to the
outskirts of Tynda and we

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.240
found the North Korean

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.680
Administration Camp Number Two.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.310
Surprise, surprise, they
won't let us in.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.330
But we're going to go deeper
into the interior to find the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.860
actual work camps and
see if we can talk

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.110
to some of the dudes.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.040
So we're leaving on a one-car
train to go to the north

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.060
Korean camps.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.950
It's a one-car train.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.680
That goes into the middle
of nowhere.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.300
[TRAIN WHISTLE]

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.770
SHANE SMITH: So this is our
chief of police, and he's

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.625
breaking in to the North
Korean camp.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.130
Oh shit, We're literally
getting caught

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.210
looting right now.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.930
SIMON OSTROVSKY: We should
get the vodka.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.653
