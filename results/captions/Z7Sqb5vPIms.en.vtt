10 genius food hacks and tricks
1: Balloon Jar Trick

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.509
Okay I found an old jar of pickled ginger
in the back, it’s actually expired but let’s

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.020
pretend it’s not and let’s pretend I lost
the lid and let’s pretend I can’t find

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.650
a Tupperware box to put this in but I want
to store it.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.650
What do I do?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.470
I just take a balloon, blow it up, then press
it on top, apply pressure and then let go

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.850
of the air.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.770
Sealed, done!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.870
2: DIY Vacuum Seal
This here is a vacuum sealing bag and a vacuum

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.010
sealer, basically it’s a machine that removes
air from a plastic bag so you can store food

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.260
for a longer time or Sous Vide it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.720
Now here I’m going to show you how it works.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.740
You put it in and it will remove the air from
the air and seal it.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.510
Now usually you use this with meats or other
products that need to be away from oxygen,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.940
but here I’m going to show you with fruit
because frankly it looks really good on video.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.280
As you can see it’s removed all the air
out and now it seals it.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.390
Now these are great devices but I understand
that not most of you will have these things

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.730
at home since it’s kind of a specialty thing.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.810
But as you can see it’s removed most of
the air from this package and the fruit would

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.670
stay good for quite a while.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.420
Now here a way you can do it at home without
the Sous Vide machine, just take a Ziploc

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.940
bag and put your camera friendly fruit inside.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.240
Then you place it underneath a water bath
and actually push it down, the water will

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
displace the air out.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.880
Just make sure to seal it with the seal still
above the water level and this works reasonably

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.950
well, it removes most of the air out.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.600
I’d say 95-96% of the air, but there’s
a better method and this here is a better

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.280
method.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.870
Now as you can see if I seal the bag normally
there’s a lot of air in this, but if I open

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.390
it up and just stick a straw in there and
make sure you stick the straw all the way

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.030
down to the food source so it’s close to
that and then you seal the back from the opposite

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.709
side of the straw until you get as tight as
possible closed to that straw.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.260
Then you just want to suck the air out with
your mouth as much as you can, so just suck

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.329
really hard and take it all o8ut and once
you’ve got all the air out then you want

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.760
to move the straw out while still sucking
and just seal it with your finger like that.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.489
There you go, this is taking I’d say 98-99%
of the air out and it’s pretty good, like

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.459
the fruit doesn’t move about, you can’t
move it around.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.049
It’s not as good as professionally sealed
one but it’s really good for just a straw

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.230
and Ziploc bag.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.779
It’s a great option for those of you that
don’t have a Sous Vide machine at home.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:52.540
3: Nutella Milk Shake
Alright, so once you finish your Nutella product

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.620
there’s always so much Nutella stuck on
the walls of it, so annoying to scrape off

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.620
and very difficult.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.900
There must be an easy way to clean it.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.480
Well there is, just pour a little bit of warm
milk in there until you fill it up about halfway.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.889
Then you just want to put the lid back on
and seal it on nice and tightly.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.469
After that just shake like crazy, just keep
shaking and shaking and shaking and after

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.489
you’ve shaken some just shake some more.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.109
Once you’re doing you’ll see the chocolate
paste start to release itself from the glass

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.280
jar, just like that – I’m just going to
shake a little bit more.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.779
Once you feel it’s clean enough then you
can just open it up and as you can see there’s

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.949
no more Nutella on the inside of the glass.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:36.000
Now you just take a glass and just pour it
out, pour out that delicious Nutella infused

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.559
milk or Nutella milkshake and you can enjoy
it just like this.

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:45.080
But my recommendation is just add a little
bit of whipped cream on top like this, maybe

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.099
a little bit of chocolate sauce, throw some
sprinkles on there and enjoy!

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.779
Add some straws, great.

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:56.949
Delicious!

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:02.019
4: Cherry Tomato Cutting Trick
Cutting cherry tomatoes can be a little bit

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.249
annoying, cutting them one by one can just
be a long and agonizing task and especially

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.859
if you need a lot of them.

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.319
So there is a better way and I’m sure a
lot of you have seen similar tricks like this

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.370
on the internet before.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.750
You just place a bunch of cherry tomatoes
on a plate and then you place a plate on top

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.230
and then you take a long sharp knife and just
slide it in between the two plates and cut

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.480
through all the cherry tomatoes in one go.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.590
This is great although it does dirty two plates
in one go and a knife.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.540
So that can be a little bit annoying but it
does a great job of cutting cherry tomatoes

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.700
really quickly.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.201
Now another way if you’re up for it is you
take the cherry tomatoes, just place them

00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:45.790
on a cutting board and group them together
then place your hand over it and slide the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.950
knife horizontally across making sure not
to contact your hands, and there we go, a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.890
simple quick way to slice your cherry tomatoes
if you’re confident enough.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.880
5: Rubber Band Pan Lid
Imagine you just cooked a big pot of sauce

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.920
and it’s full of sauce and you want to transport
it, but this lid would just fly off and sauce

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.450
would go everywhere and you don’t want to
dirty another Tupperware box.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.840
Just take two elastic bands and place them
from handle to the middle handle with a crossover

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.440
like this and then place on more elastic band
going from handle to handle, and then this

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.160
lid is securely fastened.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.200
It is not coming off.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.410
You can take this and transport this wherever
you want and feel safe and secure.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.190
You’re welcome!

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.970
6: Ice Coffee Trick
On a hot summer day I love having a little

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.970
iced coffee.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.550
This way you have some ice cubes and you pour
some hot coffee over it and it just makes

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.960
a delicious cold coffee drink.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.520
The only problem is the ice cubes melt and
it dilutes the coffee flavor.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.580
The solution to this is you take some coffee
and just place it into some ice cube molds

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.080
just like this and once it’s full you guessed
it – place it into the freezer and then

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.370
freeze until it’s nice and rock solid.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.620
Once they’re done just pop them out and
you can keep these inside a Ziploc bag in

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.280
the freezer for whenever you need a little
ice coffee cube.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.870
Now take your ice coffee cubes place them
in a glass and add your hot coffee on top

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.450
and now you’ve got a full flavored nice
iced coffee for the summer that does not become

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.600
watery or diluted down.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.330
Great, now you can also take the ice coffee
cubes and cover them with milk and then you’ve

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.020
got a delicious milk ice coffee for the summer.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.250
Now if you don’t like coffee you can do
the same with milk chocolate and milk chocolate

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.280
ice cubes and add milk to it.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.360
Great!

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:46.680
7: Popcorn Bowl Trick
Alright so you just cooked some popcorn and

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.310
when you open the bag you can eat it straight
out of the bag like this, but the only problem

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.630
is when you stick your hand in you touch the
walls of the bag and you get grease on your

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.590
hands and it’s just dirty.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.780
Now a solution to this is you can just put
your popcorn in a bowl and then you can eat

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.740
from the bowl, it seems pretty simply.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.340
That’s great, you can just eat out of it,
but then you’re dirtying a bowl and then

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.060
you have to clean the bowl later and you’re
just making a mess.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.560
There must be a better way and there is.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.960
Once you’ve cooked your popcorn bag, just
take a knife and cut three cuts, one here,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.600
one right here and the last one this way just
to make a flap that you can fold over.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.600
Once you’ve done the cuts just pull it over
and flap it over like this and there you go,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.740
you’ve got a bowl made out of the popcorn
bag itself which you can just eat straight

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.250
out of.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.850
Now this is way better because once you’re
done you won’t have to clean it, you just

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.190
throw the bag away.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:45.560
8: Chip Bag Origami
Alright so you just finished eating some chips

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.080
and you’re full, you don’t want anymore.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.430
It happens to all of us.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.169
Now to store it, what to do, you can’t seem
to find your clamp or your other clamp or

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.180
this final clamp.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.540
Well there’s a simple way just flatten it
and make sure there’s no air there, then

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.460
fold it over two to three times like this,
then turn it around and bring the corners

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.280
into the center just like so, then turn it
around one more time and you take this little

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.389
flap and turn it over itself just like this.

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:18.340
And there we go, you have basically done some
origami folding with a chip bag and it’s

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.020
sealed, the chips can’t go out and you didn’t
need a clamp of any kind.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.150
Success!

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:30.110
9: Chip Bowl Hack
So you want to eat some chips, don’t open

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.649
the bag, no, no, no and don’t dirty a bowl
with the chips.

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:38.930
Instead just take a knife and pinch the middle
of the pack like this and do a small little

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.930
cut.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.430
Then you just want to take your finger and
just unravel it in a circular motion just

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.620
going round and round until you have big enough
opening that suits your needs.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.950
Just keep going around and round and look
at that, look at that massive opening.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.540
There we go, you’ve basically just made
a chip bowl out of your chip bag and you can

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.449
easily just eat these in a party without having
to dirty anymore bowls.

00:09:03.449 --> 00:09:04.870
You’re welcome!

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.279
10: Juice Ice Cubes Idea
I know this looks like a Coca-Cola add but

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.399
I assure it’s not.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.709
I just really love frozen raspberries with
Coke, especially in the summer they just add

00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:17.709
such a nice flavor.

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:19.829
It’s way better than just normal ice cubes.

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:23.389
The only problem though is it does fizz up
your Coke a lot and at the end you’re left

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:27.370
with a little bit of a goopy mess of raspberries
that are melted.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.980
There must be a better way to do this and
there is.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.610
Just place some fresh raspberries into your
juicing machine.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.990
I prefer to use one of these cold press juices
for raspberries because it extracts way more

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.019
juice than the central fusion ones.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:44.230
But yeah that’s up to you.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.779
Look at that thing go, I love this part.

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:50.389
This is the best.

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:54.850
Okay, once you’ve got enough raspberry juice,
and you’re going t need quite a lot of it.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.230
Then you want to place it into your ice cube
molds just like this and once they’re full

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.899
just put them in the freezer for about two
hours so they can freeze rock solid.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:07.410
Once you’re done you can have a cube like
this and as it melts with the coke it will

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:13.279
release flavor into the Coca-Cola and it’s
so much better than cherry Coke, it’s unbelievable.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.360
I urge you to give it a try with different
flavor combinations, this here is just some

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.690
orange juice and kale ale, but give it a try
with your favorite fruit.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.779
Just freeze it into ice cubes and add it to
your favorite beverage and magical things

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:26.779
will happen.

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:27.779
Enjoy!

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:27.859
END
