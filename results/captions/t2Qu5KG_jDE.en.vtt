00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.750
a true performer I've been in karaoke
finals without looking the screen and

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.310
I've had 95% of the audience on my side
I'm going to be honest with you all

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:40.820
occur it is one of the worst I've ever
ever heard this way I'm tired of crying

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:59.610
and all you Lane that's why I am buying
or if sir to you my chain nose just like

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.050
I'm gonna stop something it's not yours
really sir there is a little bit of a

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.370
charisma problem John that's my main
concern I don't think you would excite

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:34.309
an audience to me he's so intelligent
he's so confident my baby so very sexy

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:40.519
my baby pulled the thief on me my baby
knows just what to do

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:45.729
he got me money past a hundred and two
just give me

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:55.450
what the hell was that means I thought
it was a little no big cats three cats

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:04.450
late at night I mean that was absolutely
diabolical listen to your heart when

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:15.010
he's talking to you I don't know where
you going and I don't know why listen to

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:21.870
your heart before you tell him goodbye

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.169

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:32.260

no-brainer
