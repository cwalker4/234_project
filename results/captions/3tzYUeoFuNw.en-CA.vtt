when you're talking about

that means super prices.

I'm a cyclist, so when I go on

&gt;&gt; It's loaded with electrolytes
so it's incredibly hydrating and

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.338
that's really the key.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.307

is costly.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:52.712
Prices range from
$3.00 to $6.50 a litre.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.413

you're metabolizing all of the

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.949

at a much higher rate.

but for our test, we want

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:24.010
to know, is it that much better
at keeping you hydrated than

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.611

And so one of the purpose--
what we want to do is see

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.105
whether water or
coconut water helps you

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.106

in here than a banana.

see is whether you absorb it and

get it into your fluids,
into your cells,

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.095

beans and lentils and chickpeas.

00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:40.205 align:start position:0%
A cup of cooked quinoa will give
you about 8 grams of protein,

not low-carb either.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:52.217
&gt;&gt; It's quite high in calories,
at 220 or so calories per cup of

&gt;&gt; I heard it was good for you.

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.663
&gt;&gt; Charlsie: And seems
we're really buying in.

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:21.834
In just the past 2 years,
chia sales have more

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.002
than tripled.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:25.103
When it comes to the
most common claim,

00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:28.641
that chia is high in omega-3s,
our dietitian thinks there's a

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.142
better alternative.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.877
Even if you ate this
whole bowl of chia,

00:13:32.877 --> 00:13:37.216
an entire bag, you'd still be
getting less omega-3s than just

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.051
one piece of salmon.

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:40.051
Another catch.

00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:42.254
For the body to
use the chia seeds,

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:45.991
it has to convert them to
acids and our bodies don't do

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.427
that well.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:51.095
&gt;&gt; Your body converts somewhere
between about 0 and 10% of that

00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:53.832
into a useable form of omega-3.

00:13:53.832 --> 00:13:55.834
&gt;&gt; Charlsie: That's it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.035
&gt;&gt; Charlsie: That's not
very much.

00:13:57.035 --> 00:14:02.408
&gt;&gt; So that basically comes down
to 0.3 mg or less per serving.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.544
&gt;&gt; Charlsie: So that's
a lot of chia.

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:07.746
&gt;&gt; It's an inconvenient
way to get your omega-3s.

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:09.614
&gt;&gt; Charlsie: So if you're
looking to get omega-3,

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:12.584
this is going to take your body
a lot of work to get the good

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:13.586
stuff out.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:14.819
&gt;&gt; You'd have to
eat a lot of it.

00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:17.355 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And you can't eat a lot of it
because it has too much fibre

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:18.790

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.026

a homegrown product,

00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:36.108
flax is about a third
of the price of chia.

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:40.178
Remember a bag of
chia was about $15.
