00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.289
welcome to TTI welcome to a whole new
world of science minerals are inorganic

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
substances with a defined chemical
composition that can be found all over

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
the Earth's surface they're composed of
various solid and inorganic chemical

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
elements and they commonly have a
crystal structure these miracles of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.140
nature are very important because of
their use in different areas of human

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
activity they're used for manufacturing
many products such as working equipment

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.149
electronics and building materials
however some minerals are very beautiful

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
and they could be too dangerous for
human beings in their environment when

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
they're extracted and processed this
video will show that top 10 most

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:04.229
dangerous minerals around the world
number 10 pyrite iron pyrite looks very

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.930
shiny and silvery brass metallic in
color and which is also known as fool's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.479
gold due to its resemblance to gold
actually it's a semiconductor material

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.000
which is also used as the cathode and
sometimes is used to make marcasite

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
jewelry and it's not useless at all
people use it actually to make batteries

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.430
radio receivers and they even use it in
the paper industry back in the 16th and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.549
17th century pyrite was actually used as
an igniter for firearms if you take

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
pyrite and hit it against a metal it'll
actually spark which is how pyrite even

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.549
got its name as pyre is the Greek word
for fire it's the worst polluting agent

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.470
which acidifies ground water and streams
due to the acid mine drainage from

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.780
mining waste in the presence of air
pirate oxidation releases highly toxic

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.930
metals into the atmosphere one of them
is arsenic heavy metal releasing

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.750
metalloids from this mineral are very
toxic to humans pyrite is no longer

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.070
commercially mined because sulfur can
easily be collected as a byproduct of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.610
natural gas and oil processing which
puts an end to that nowadays pyrite is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:34.600
extracted only for study purposes and
scientific investigations feldspar

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.040
feldspars are a group of three rock
forming techno silicate minerals they

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.120
are aluminum silicates of sodium calcium
and potassium metals and mostly it's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.920
produced by Italy and Turkey also
feldspars have small amounts of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.890
radioactive uranium that form radon gas
and may cause a lung cancer these

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.570
minerals are also a source of lead
emissions that may be dangerous for the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.570
environment they are used to manufacture
ceramics dinnerware Building tiles

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.239
artificial teeth and abrasive dust other
varieties of these minerals are used as

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:25.370
gemstones number eight hydroxyapatite
this is a naturally occurring most

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.560
stable form of calcium phosphate the
element phosphorus for your gardens

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.230
fertilizers and even fluoride in your
tap water comes from hydroxyapatite the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.230
appetite has variants the hydroxyapatite
is one of the main components of tooth

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.920
enamel and the fluoride apatite is added
to water to prevent tooth cavities

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.420
having healthy teeth and bones is
essential but hydroxyapatite exposure

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.269
during mining or its extraction process
is hazardous as it can accumulate in the

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.380
heart valves and arteries actually many
people die because of this

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.720
hydroxyapatite accumulation in the
hearts valves and arteries every year as

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.489
this condition may cause constriction in
the blood flow or a total blood flow

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.269
blockage

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.810
Galina Galina also known as lead glance
is a mineral composed of octahedral lead

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.410
sulfide it's relatively insoluble in
water in ancient Egypt Galena was used

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.530
as I make up but I advise you to always
wash your hands after handling Galena if

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.850
it's released into the environment it
produces severe environmental

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.560
consequences even ingesting small
amounts of lead can cause brain damage

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.830
or death or Onslow exposure it can stop
the development of the nervous system

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.310
and fetuses and children it can also
cause cardiovascular diseases in adults

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.100
this mineral is often found in crystal
forms that have led as main components

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.950
and some minerals can have a little
amount of silver to saroo site and angle

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.470
sites are two byproducts of Galena
weathering these elements are even more

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.669
dangerous than Galena the most important
Galena deposits are in the US UK Germany

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.840
and Australia silver extraction from
Galena is done in Colorado Idaho Utah

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.039
and Montana in the u.s. number six

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:47.450
fluorspar fluoride is a soluble mineral
which is a compound of fluorspar it may

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.419
cause a severe bone disease known as
skeleton fluorosis fluorspar is produced

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.010
in big amounts
that's why 10 million people in Ginsu

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.219
China have
affected in the mining of this mineral

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:07.729
in that region fluorspar is used as a
fluxing agent to cast iron and steel for

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.939
the production of glass enamel
microscope and telescopic lenses at

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:20.120
present China is the main floor spar
producer followed by Mexico Mongolia and

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.669
Russia number five

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:32.419
quartz inhalation of quartz
nanoparticles over a very long period of

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.659
time will cause some serious diseases
such as silicosis lung cancer kidney

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:44.870
diseases and weakens the immune system
of the body approximately 3.2 million

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.960
workers in the USA factories are exposed
to silica dust this is the second

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.120
richest mineral on the Earth's surface
quartz originates from different forms

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.259
and this includes silica sand crystals
stones and Tripoli quartz has a great

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.370
commercial application in the oil
industry and in manufacturing electronic

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.219
and optical products most of the
commercial quartz is produced from seed

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:19.129
crystal which is also known as chips on
the other hand natural quartz crystals

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.310
are used as gemstones u.s. and Brazil
are the primary producers of natural

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:32.719
crystal quartz whereas Canada Brazil
Germany Madagascar China South Africa

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:44.240
and Venezuela are the primary producers
of quartz chips cinnabar it's the most

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.849
beautiful and toxic mineral to handle on
earth at the same time it's the world's

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:54.919
main source of mercury and has been
mined as far back as the Neolithic Age

00:07:54.919 --> 00:08:00.169
and has been extracted since the
Neolithic period this mineral is

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:06.790
insoluble in water and upon oxidation it
produces toxic compounds such as

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.690
methyl mercury and dimethyl mercury
cinnabar is lethal and small

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.710
concentrations and it can be absorbed
through the respiratory tract bowels or

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.600
from the skin the compounds originated
from cinnabar can affect the nervous

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.430
system severely and they can also cause
problems and the development of fetuses

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.010
and children it's bright red color made
people in the Middle East and

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:41.580
pre-columbian America think it had some
magical and medicinal properties number

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:49.720
Senna cite this mineral is the member of
the Mesa silicate family it is an

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.120
important source of beryllium which is a
toxic element that can induce lung

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.040
cancer and severe lung inflammatory
diseases such as Burley OSIS and

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:07.330
chemical pneumonitis Burley OSIS mostly
occurs due to over sensitivity of lungs

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.600
to beryllium and causes the development
of small inflammatory nodules called

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.430
granulomas however beryllium is used as
a component for the windows of x-ray

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:24.850
tubes as a neutron moderator in nuclear
reactors or as a structural material for

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:31.360
satellites high-speed planes spaceships
missiles and pieces of communication

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.840
devices in the past this mineral was
also used in the ceramics industry but

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.250
it was banned because after breathing
beryllium dust workers were at the

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:48.789
highest risk to develop the lung
diseases number two

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:56.509
area night area night is a natural
fibrous mineral of sodium potassium and

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:01.279
calcium it's found in the group of the
silicate minerals that are called

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:07.220
zeolites exposure to area night may
cause diseases such as mesothelioma

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.109
which is a where type of cancer and
originates from super malignant

00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:18.139
mesothelioma cells the mesothelium is a
membrane that forms the lining of

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:24.019
several body cavities this mineral has
been found in volcanic ash that has been

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:29.509
altered by weathering effects and
groundwater area night mineral has

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:34.850
caused a considerable number of deaths
in Turkey it's mining has been banned

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:40.160
since the 1980s but exposure to this
dangerous mineral can happen during

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.959
zeolite production and exploitation
which is still a commercial business

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:55.759
nowadays number one Costa delight this
mineral also known as blue asbestos is

00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:01.579
considered the most dangerous mineral in
the world exposure to this fibrous

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:07.579
mineral causes lethal diseases cross it
alight as any other type of asbestos it

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:13.579
is used to manufacture commercial and
industrial products this includes tiles

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:19.429
to cover the roofs floors and walls
Cement products and it was also used to

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:24.319
insulate steam engines in the past
christina light mining was carried out

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:30.619
in western australia bolivia and south
africa but now the production of this

00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:36.019
mineral has been banned due to its
severe health risk for humans as dr.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:39.859
Christopher Wagner discovered that
Crystal Light is associated with

00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:46.549
mesothelioma in 18% of mining workers
thanks for watching

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:51.049
glad I don't have any of these in my
mineral collection which mineral do you

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:55.339
have let me know in the comments below
if you're new here then feel free to
