00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.010
Last month a single act of kindness by a
ten-year-old boy became a viral sensation.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.500
From northern California, please welcome
Nasim Lawrence and his parents and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.300
the woman he helped, Taylor Sloan.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.940
Tell everybody what happened.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.670
&gt;&gt; All right, so me and my dad and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.540
my family, we went to
a Super Motocross event in Oakland.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.400
And I was walking around
trying to look for

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.890
some food and
I saw a wallet on the ground.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.580
I was like, Dad, I found a wallet.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.566
And so I-
&gt;&gt; Picked it up.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.251
&gt;&gt; Yeah, picked it up.

00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:31.912
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You picked it up.

00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:33.415
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:38.630
&gt;&gt; So we got down to our seats, and we
looked inside, and we found the ID, and so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.160
we're looking at it, and he has it in his
hand, and he's scouring the whole event.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.670
And he's like, we have to find this lady.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.610
I'm like, come on man.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.770
&gt;&gt; By her drivers license picture.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.995
&gt;&gt; By her drivers license picture.

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:51.450
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, we're sitting there and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.320
the whole night,
he can't focus on the motorcross.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.610
He doesn't know who's motorcycling or

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.942
anything because he's looking at every
single lady that looks like Miss Sloane.

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:01.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And he's like Dad I think that's her.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.770
Dad I think that's her.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.575
Dad I think that's her.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:04.850
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]
&gt;&gt; It probably was her.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.220
&gt;&gt; And I was like, you know, we can't ask
each and every one of these ladies if

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780
they lost their ID, so we're just going
to have to mail it when we get home.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.470
&gt;&gt; So
when did you realize you lost your wallet?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.713
&gt;&gt; So, well, I had,
it was just a little pink wallet, and

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:21.865
I had it in my back pocket so,
probably not the best thing looking back.

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:26.880
But I was actually already outside of the
arena, when I'd realized that I'd lost it.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.083
I had about $30 to $40 in it,
my debit card.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.185
&gt;&gt; $38.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.930
&gt;&gt; $38, he knows.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.880
[LAUGH] And my debit card, and
my California driver's license.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.500
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you wrote this letter.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.790
And read this letter you wrote and
you sent this to Miss Sloan.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.670
&gt;&gt; Dear Miss Sloan.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.870
My name is Nasim Lawrence and
I am ten years old.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.500
I found your wallet on the ground at
the Super Motor Cross event in Oakland.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.280
I know how it feels to lose something and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.470
I wanted to make sure you
got your wallet back.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.770
Hopefully I made you smile, and you
are happy you have your money and ID back.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.690
I am glad I found it instead of some
bad person, who would steal from you.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.985
You look like a very nice person
who does nice things for people.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:16.446
So, I wanted to do something nice for you.

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:18.769
Plus it was the honest thing to do.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.010
Sincerely, Nasim Lawrence.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.206
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.689
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.290
what did you think when
you got that letter?

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.300
&gt;&gt; I was overjoyed.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.458
Obviously, I was like,
he sent me all my belongings back.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.630
But I didn't even care about that.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.770
I was, like, the letter is adorable.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.154
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I want to share

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:41.844
it with everybody, so
that's exactly what I did.

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:43.330
I shared it over Facebook.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.480
Everybody was just as thrilled, and so
nice and genuine in their comments.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.940
&gt;&gt; Well that's why we have you on,
because it really is.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.365
We need to reinforce there
are good people out there.

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:56.055
I don't want you to lose a wallet again,
so I got you a gift, and

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:57.392
here's how it works.

00:02:57.392 --> 00:02:58.449
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] God, gosh.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:05.391
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right so show them how it works.

00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:06.308
So if you lose your wallet.

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:11.311
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:13.397
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:13.992
&gt;&gt; My god.

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:15.828
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:20.510
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.500
&gt;&gt; I'll never lose it.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.640
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Ever.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.627
&gt;&gt; No
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:25.280
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.304
&gt;&gt; So, and that won't

00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:28.842
attract attention by anybody
at all to wear that.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:29.600
&gt;&gt; No, no one will ever know.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.640
&gt;&gt; All right, and there was $20 that
she sent you to say thank you, right?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.240
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; What are you gonna buy with that $20?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.791
&gt;&gt; I love video games, so I'm gonna save
up my money and buy some new video games.

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:45.719
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well we want you to have more
than that so we're gonna give you all of

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.948
this so you can watch video,
$1000 worth of video games.

00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:56.283
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; What?

00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:58.826
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:03:58.826 --> 00:03:59.758
&gt;&gt; So yeah.

00:03:59.758 --> 00:04:01.277
&gt;&gt; My God.

00:04:01.277 --> 00:04:02.775
&gt;&gt; See what you get for
being a good person?

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:07.564
So Nasim, you get a 55" TCL Roku TV,

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:12.955
a gaming chair, and a bunch of the hottest
new games,$1000 worth of video games.

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:14.180
That's cuz you're a good person.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.895
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; My God.
