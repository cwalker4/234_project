00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.319
From giant lakes under the ice, to rivers
under legendary cities, here are 8 of the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.780
most mysterious hidden rivers and lakes.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.320
8.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.360
Son Doong Cave
The Son Doong Cave in Vietnam is the world’s

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.030
largest cave!!

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.180
Translated as “Mountain River Cave” it
was first found by a man named Ho Khanh in

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180
1990.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.760
The farmer was trying to find shelter from
a storm when he notices water gushing out

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.030
of the limestone.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.059
He did the responsible thing and notified
the British Caving Research Association!

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.120
Now you know what to do if you find something
amazing!

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.879
Or you could keep it a secret of course, it
is up to you!

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.590
BUT, he kind of got lost in the jungle and
forgot where it was for 18 years!!

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.800
He stumbled upon it later and in 2010, the
BCRA went in to explore!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.590
Son Doong Cave is so large, it has its own
ecosystem inside.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.480
It is over five kilometers long (3 miles)
and sometimes reaches heights of 200 meters

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
(650 feet), that’s tall enough for rain
clouds to form!!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.140
The river inside the cave after which it is
named after, is home to very unique species

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.320
and organisms.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.020
The limestone cave is believed to have formed
some 2-5 million years ago when the underwater

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.979
river found a fault and carved out the space
over time.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.350
Now thanks to the river, and sunlight that
comes through where the ceiling has collapsed,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.439
the place is full of wildlife.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.860
Explorers and tourists visiting the cave have
said spending the night there is actually

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.310
quite noisy!!

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.960
One of the most exciting things is the discovery
of previously unidentified species, such as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.970
many insects and birds, and even a new kind
of monkey!.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.080
There is much more of the cave to be explored
which is why many people call this mysterious

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.340
place, the lost world.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.340
7.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.040
Black Sea River
The Black Sea itself is located in Eurasia,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.790
between the Mediterranean and Caspian Sea.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.610
These waters were infamous for being inhospitable
and difficult to navigate.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.439
It’s shores were surrounded by savage tribes
and there were scary rumors of beasts in the

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.439
water.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.369
However, one of the most intriguing secrets
of this sea is that there is actually a river

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.980
underneath it that flows on the sea bed!

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.880
This river was discovered by scientists from
the University of Leeds in 2010.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.440
They used a robotic submarine to study a deep
channel.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.750
It has rapids stronger than the Thames and
if it were on land, it would be the world’s

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.500
6th largest river.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.300
Maybe the coolest thing is that it even creates
waterfalls, underwater!!

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.010
The notion of an underwater river wasn't foreign
to scientists, but the Black Sea River turned

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.080
many theories their head.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.140
These underwater channels or rivers are hard
to explore because not only are they usually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.530
very deep, but powerful and unpredictable.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.730
The water that flows in this river is actually
much more salient than most of the water in

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.870
the Black Sea.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.470
Since the water is denser and carries sediments
and nutrients into the ocean it is vitally

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.470
important to life in the black sea.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.650
Upon further study, it was found that the
Black Sea River not only flows at about 4

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.650
miles per hour with 22,000 cubic meters of
water passing through every second, it actually

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.720
flows in the opposite direction of most rivers
on Earth when it comes to circling a bend.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.470
Pretty cool to have a river under the sea!!

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.090
And now for number 6 but first be sure to
subscribe before you leave and click the notification

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.090
bell!

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.920
We have lots of new videos coming up!!

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.730
Antarctic Lakes
The continent of Antarctica is so inhospitable

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.240
and cold that everyone thought the whole place
was just frozen ice.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.140
Then a man named Jonathan Kingslake came along
and changed everything.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.630
I know, perfect name right??

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.130
In 2010, he was observing a picture from Google
Earth of the Nielsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.100
When he did, he noticed that there were water
channels that could clearly be seen from the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.470
sky, channels that would only exist if there
was a lake nearby.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.870
The idea of such a "drainage system" in Antarctica
was long thought of as impossible because

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.790
of the cold temperatures, but Kingslake’s
discovery prompted a more rigorous search

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.690
of Antarctica, and researchers found around
700 different drainage systems throughout

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.570
the continent, each of them feeding a lake
in one form or another.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.860
Some of the water even traveled 75 miles in
order to reach its final destination.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.070
Recent inventories have identified 379 lakes
in Antarctica, and we will probably find more.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.220
Now we know that Antarctica has many subglacial
lakes, covered by several kilometers of ice.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.310
Many of them are connected and water flows
from lake to lake.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.511
Finding these systems and lakes has changed
not only how we look at Antarctica, but how

00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.040
we see the oceans as a whole.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.100
5.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.470
Rivers of London
Did you know that under the streets of London

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.220
there were rivers and canals?

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.900
In 1827, London wasn't nearly the size it
was now, and instead of Pancras and Euston

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.780
Road, there used to be a field where a river
once ran through.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.070
Fast forward to today, and those streets are
made of concrete and stone, but the river

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.190
is still there, it's just underground.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.790
Alongside many other rivers that once went
through the London area.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.910
Alex Werner, head of history collections at
the Museum of London says that "Wherever you

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.270
live, not far from your doorstep, you can
probably track down a hidden river you never

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.160
would have guessed would be there!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.200
This particular river, called The River Fleet,
is one of many rivers that were eventually

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.730
"buried" because of the expansion of London.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.240
And while you can go and find these rivers
yourself, you would have to know where to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.690
look, and many people in London right now
have no clue!!

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.760
You can see a little piece of it above ground
as it flows under an arched bridge from Hampstead

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.010
to Highgate Ponds in north London.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.870
The reason for this is that just like the
city, the rivers of the area have gone through

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.000
many phases, including how the people of London
used them.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.860
In the past they were used for drinking and
fishing, but over the centuries, the need

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.330
for space was more important than the need
for water.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.360
Some of the areas around the hidden rivers
became harder to maintain, so it was decided

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.900
to dam them up and use the land for the growing
population.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.820
Some are actually attempting to bring the
rivers back to the true surface, but efforts

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.290
are very slow.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.740
Most of them are now sewers surrounded by
victorian brickwork.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.340
Other rivers that can be found underneath
London include: The Tyburn, The Walbrook,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.980
The Westbourne, and the Effra.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.980
4.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.160
Greenland Rivers
The Nation of Greenland is the largest island

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
in the world.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.320
3/4ths of its surface mass is covered in ice,
however, underneath that sheet of ice and

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.250
glaciers, scientists found a network of rivers
frozen in time.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.830
This river network is remarkably large, and
actually goes through much of Greenland proper,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.320
located underneath the Jakob-shavn Is-brae
glacier.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.639
It's also said that these rivers actually
have helped shape and maintain this glacier

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.760
over time.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.960
Michael Cooper from the University of Bristol
in the United Kingdom, told Live Science in

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.770
an interview that the channels seem to be
instrumental in controlling the location and

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.210
form of the ice stream of the glacier.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.270
Without these channels, the glacier might
not even exist!

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.110
Or be in the same place!!

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.740
The Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier is actually
the world’s fastest glacier, moving towards

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.770
the ocean at a rate of 11 miles per year.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.810
Further study proved that underneath the glacier
is a massive area of canyons, as well as ravines

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.810
and streams.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.340
It’s another secret world on Earth!!

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.690
Though many of the rivers that are under the
glacier aren't "alive" anymore, some of them

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.340
are still going.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.560
3.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.420
Secret Rivers of Estonia
Legends and stories about Estonia’s secret

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.970
rivers have been around for centuries.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.190
Animals and sometimes even people, would be
carried underground by the streams.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.919
Estonia is a country in Northern Europe that
borders the Baltic Sea and includes over 1,500

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:36.130
islands.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.710
With thousands of lakes, the water of Estonia
is considered its most valuable natural resource.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.389
Researchers from Tallinn University say that
the secret rivers are true and that there

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:48.800
are probably hundreds of them beneath the
surface of the country.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800
How is that possible?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.750
Part of the reason is because nearly half
of the mainland is covered with carbonate

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.670
rock such as limestone.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.139
Over time the land has been "karsted", or
eroded, making it easy for water to create

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:02.139
fissures and sinkholes.

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.340
This in turn both hid and created many of
the secret rivers in the area.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.370
Ones that were on the surface would fall into
sinkholes, and then start flowing underwater.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.400
After further study, The Estonian Book of
Wilderness lists 40 secret rivers with their

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.010
starting and ending point, so in case your
cows disappear, you can try to find them before

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.669
they get swept away!

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:22.669
2.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.510
Owey Island Lake
The fun part about this place is that it is

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.210
a lake, under a lake.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.979
Located in Donegal, Ireland, Owey Island is
a rocky islet with no permanent residents.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.820
On the northwest tip of the island there is
a lake on the cliff tops overlooking the ocean.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.940
So how did people find out there was a lake
underneath it?

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.630
There is an extremely muddy sinkhole that
you can climb into that will take you to a

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.120
silt beach in a cave.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.950
This lake is about 50 meters underground and
is fed by the Atlantic ocean and lake above

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.200
that trickles below.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.620
It is about 150 meters long and ends in a
pool known as the pool of tranquility.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.520
It is quite a magical place!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.630
As you descend into the cavern the walls are
covered with bioluminescent organisms that

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.960
will help you find your way, then it is totally
dark.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.070
If you want to check out this place in person,
be sure to check out the company Unique Ascent

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.380
because you don’t want to get lost down
there!

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.320
And they have great tours!!

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.510
1.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.320
Mexican Cenotes
In the Yucatan peninsula there are nearly

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.100
7,000 cenotes.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.450
Cenotes are underground caverns formed when
limestone caves in, revealing pools of water

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.450
underneath.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.490
Their name comes from the Maya word for well
and most of them were found when people were

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.120
wandering around, and then suddenly, the ground
would give way and you’d find yourself falling

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.070
and splashing into a pool of water!

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:47.190
They are created by naturally acidic water
filtering through and dissolving limestone.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.820
These mysterious underground pools were believed
by the Maya to be entrances to the underworld

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.240
and have enormous sacred significance.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.550
In many there are still sacrificial remains
along with artifacts and stone altars and

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.550
stairs.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.710
While most remain officially unexplored, you
can visit and even swim in them to experience

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.710
the amazing mysterious places for yourself!

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.710
Have you ever been to one?

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.560
Let me know in the comments below!

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.110
Thanks for watching!

Remember to subscribe before you leave and
I’ll see you soon!

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:13.850
