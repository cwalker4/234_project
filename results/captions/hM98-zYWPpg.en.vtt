00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.600
- Our next guest is a
hard-working third grade teacher

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.466
who just won $150,000,
but what she did with that money

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.633
got her an invitation
to my show.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.966
From Boston, Massachusetts,

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.066
please welcome
the amazing Nicole Bollerman.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.933
Well, you're just
an amazing woman.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.900
First of all,
I love teachers anyway.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.100
It's a very important
and underpaid position.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.933
[cheers and applause]

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:24.233
So how did you make
the $150,000?

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.666
- First, can I just say,
I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.466
And thank you so much...
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.800
- For having me.
- You're welcome.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.233
- And you're just such
an amazing person.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.500
- You're amazing.
You're the amazing one.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.066
- So I entered
a Capital One Facebook contest

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.033
called \#WishForOthers,
and I made a wish

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.200
that my third grade
adorable kids

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.833
could have a book
to take home with them

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.366
over December break.

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:50.166
And I ended up winning
$150,000.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.666
- Right.
So you win--

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.866
[cheers and applause]

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.233
What did you do
with that money?

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:57.500
- I donated it
back to my school.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200
- You gave all the money
back to your school?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.300
- Yeah.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.566
[cheers and applause]

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.166
- I mean, you're struggling
to pay your own bills,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.866
and you didn't keep
a little bit of it.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.966
You gave it all to the school.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.466
- No.
My kids are just amazing.

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.833
You know, 90% of our kids
are low-income.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.033
Some of them are homeless.

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.033
They just have such challenges
and adversity,

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.600
and they deserve so much.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.700
And this is just, like,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.166
a little bit of what
I could give them.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.800
- So then you have a kid
in your class,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.566
and he's looking out the window
all the time.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.900
And you say,
"What are you doing?"

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.933
He's looking at birds

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.366
because it makes him
feel peaceful.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.966
- So I went and got him
a bird-watching book for kids.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:40.000
And his grandmother called me
and said that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.766
this was probably the only thing
he'd get for Christmas.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.366
So...
- So then you...

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.966
- So my mom and I
went to Target

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.700
and made sure that he had--

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.266
he and his sister
had something to open.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.566
'Cause every kid deserves
to open presents on Christmas.

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:54.566
- Yep, they do.

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:58.466
[cheers and applause]

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:02.600
You are a saint.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.666
- It feels good to be you,
giving away--

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.166
- Yeah, it feels good
to help people.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.333
It really does.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.466
We have another surprise.

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:10.800
Look where Jeannie is
right now.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.733
Look at this. Watch.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.433
- Hi!

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:15.433
[kids cheering]

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.866
- Those are my kids.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:23.000
- Hi, everybody.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.833
How's everybody doing there,
Jeannie?

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.533
- We are doing so great.

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:30.500
Miss Bollerman, these students
love you so, so much.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.666
- All right.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.666
Does the girl in the front row
have a question?

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:34.666
Is that--

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.300
[laughter]

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.433
Is she just giving
a shout-out?

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.633
All right.

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:43.333
Well, we love this school,
and so do our friends at Target.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.600
For years,
Target has been committed--

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.100
they've been giving $1 billion
towards education so far.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.433
They know it's important
for kids

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:51.833
to have
the right school supplies,

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:54.733
so Target is giving
700 backpacks

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:58.033
filled with school supplies
to each student at UP Academy.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.100
[cheers and applause]

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.866
- That is amazing.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.566
- Also--also, Jeannie,

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:17.433
every student is also gonna get
a $100 Target gift card.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:18.433
Make sure they know that.

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:21.433
[cheers and applause]

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.300
How many teachers are there?

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.466
- There are 70 teachers.

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:29.700
- 70 teachers?
- Yes.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.300
- Well, we have learned
that the average teacher

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.666
spends at least $500
out of their own pockets

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.266
on their classrooms, right?

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:40.300
And that's just for supplies
every year.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.533
That's without going
above and beyond like you do.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:43.566
So Target is--

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.566
first of all,
Target is being amazing.

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:47.600
Everything--when they heard
about this situation,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.766
they jumped in.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.100
Target is giving
each teacher at UP Academy

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.433
a $500 Target gift card.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.433
[cheers and applause]

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.566
Thanks, Target.

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.333
All right, I wanted
to give you something too.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.066
You love Skittles, don't you?

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:15.433
- I do love--
- You love Skittles.

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:17.333
- I don't drink coffee,
but I eat Skittles.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.000
- I see. Right.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.633
Well, I don't know
if that's helping you.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.033
[laughter]
Let's go over here.

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:23.133
I have a gift for you.

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.966
If you love Skittles...

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.933
[cheers and applause]

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.866
I don't know how long
they stay fresh,

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:33.433
but that is an aquarium
full of Skittles.

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:34.800
And in that Skittles,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.766
we also have for you

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:38.833
$25,000.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.533
[cheers and applause]

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.366
- Thank you.

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:46.300
- That's from our friends
at Target.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.833
That's for you being
an amazing woman.

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Target.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.366

[cheers and applause]
