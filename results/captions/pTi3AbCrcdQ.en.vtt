00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.338
WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TO "THE LATE SHOW."

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.742
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:14.881
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WANT TO START OUT TONIGHT BY

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.316
SAYING OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH
YOU, CALIFORNIA.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.854
THE GOLDEN STATE IS BEING
RAVAGED BY THREE DEADLY

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.390
WILDFIRES IN MALIBU AND NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.993
THERE'S BEEN TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE
AND UNPRECEDENTED LOSS OF

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.829
PROPERTY.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.332
WE CERTAINLY HOPE EVERYBODY
THERE STAYS SAFE, INCLUDING AND

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:38.071
ESPECIALLY THE FIREFIGHTERS
FIGHTING THIS ON THE FRONT LINE.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.338
AT A TIME LIKE THIS, IT'S HARD
TO KNOW THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:40.706
BUT FOR THE WRONG THING TO SAY,
LET'S CHECK THE PRESIDENT'S

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.542
TWITTER FEED.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.544
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN (AS TRUMP): "THERE IS

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:48.681
NO REASON FOR THESE MASSIVE,
DEADLY, AND COSTLY FOREST FIRES

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:53.553
IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT THAT FOREST
MANAGEMENT IS SO POOR.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.223
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GIVEN
EACH YEAR, WITH SO MANY LIVES

00:00:57.256 --> 00:01:01.761
LOST, ALL BECAUSE OF GROSS
MISMANAGEMENT OF THE FORESTS.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:12.138
REMEDY NOW, OR NO MORE FED
PAYMENTS!"

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.407
BOO-BOO
( BOOING )

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.945
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I THINK THAT'S
CALLED BLAMING THE VICTIM.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.213
I'D HATE TO BE CHOKING WITH ONLY
TRUMP THERE TO SAVE ME.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.347
(AS TRUMP): "ARE YOU CHOKING?

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.749
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS
MASSIVE LOSS OF OXYGEN, EXCEPT

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:26.853
YOUR CHEWING MANAGEMENT WAS SO
POOR.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:31.924
REMEDY NOW, OR NO HEIMLICH!"
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:34.160
( PIANO RIFF )
BUT TRUMP DID OFFER A SOLUTION

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.063
TO CALIFORNIA'S FREQUENT
WILDFIRES.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.066
(AS TRUMP): "WITH PROPER FOREST
MANAGEMENT, WE CAN STOP THE

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.769
DEVASTATION CONSTANTLY GOING ON
IN CALIFORNIA!

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:48.207
GET SMART!"
"GOT TO BE SMART.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.914
THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKE IS
PLANTING TREES MADE OF WOOD.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.883
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.217
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.785
I WILL REPLACE THEM WITH TREES
MADE OUT OF BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.754
STEEL."

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:03.456
( LAUGHTER )
ALTHOUGH, HE IS A WELL-KNOWN

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.992
STICKLER FOR FIRE SAFETY.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.527
WITH ALL THE HAIRSPRAY, HE'S
EASILY THE MOST FLAMMABLE

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.695
PRESIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:13.766
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.535
MAYBE WASHINGTON.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.371
MAYBE NOT.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:22.308
POSSIBLE IT'S HIM AND WASHINGTON
BECAUSE OF THE WOODEN TEETH.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.310
&gt;&gt; OH, I SEE.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.213
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT WAS ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME BEFORE TRUMP GOT

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:31.651
CALLED OUT BY SOMEONE WHO
ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.685
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.719
SUCH AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
PASADENA FIREFIGHTERS

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:34.687
ASSOCIATION, WHO TWEETED, "MR.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.921
PRESIDENT, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU ARE WRONG.

00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:38.024
THE FIRES IN SO-CAL ARE URBAN
INTERFACE FIRES AND HAVE NOTHING

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.060
TO DO WITH FOREST MANAGEMENT.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:47.767
COME TO SO-CAL AND LEARN THE
FACTS AND HELP THE VICTIMS."

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.438
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SURE, IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.139
TRADITIONAL.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:56.475
THAT'S TRADITIONAL.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:57.777
BUT I'M THINKING THE LAST THING
FIRST RESPONDERS NEED IS A VISIT

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.611
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.547
"NO, SIR, STOP THROWING PAPER
TOWELS!

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.248
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:07.520
THAT'S KINDLING!"
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:09.422
OF COURSE, WHEN TRUMP GOES OFF
THE DEEP END, AT LEAST WE CAN

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:14.594
COUNT ON A RESPONSE FROM
REASONABLE EXPERTS LIKE GUNS N'

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.662
ROSES FOUNDER AND MAN GETTING
THROWN OUT OF A SIZZLER, AXL

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:20.233
ROSE.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.834
WHO TWEETED, "UM... ACTUALLY...

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.370
IT'S A LACK OF FEDERAL FUNDING
THAT'S AT THE ROOT OF THE

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:25.538
PURPORTED FOREST MISMANAGEMENT.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.809
ONLY A DEMENTED N' TRULY
PATHETIC INDIVIDUAL WOULD TWIST

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:34.747
THAT AROUND N' USE A TRAGEDY TO
ONCE AGAIN MISREPRESENT FACTS

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.183
FOR ATTEMPTED PUBLIC/POLITICAL
GAIN AT OTHERS' EXPENSE."

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.753
WOW PRETTY WONKY, BUT I
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:43.823
AFTER ALL, THE FIRST DRAFT OF
PARADISE CITY WAS ACTUALLY:

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.559
S TAKE ME DOWN TO PARADISE CITY
S WHERE THE MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.694
SERVES ALL COMMUNITIES
S REGARDLESS OF SOCIOECONOMIC

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.229
STATUS...

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:56.302
S AND THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:04:10.316
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.053
ALSO, I APPRECIATE AXL'S
CONTINUED DEDICATION TO THE GUNS

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:19.992
'N ROSES MANUAL O' STYLE.

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:23.796
( LAUGHTER )
N'!

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.464
OF COURSE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
AXL'S COMPLAINING ABOUT.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.266
HE COULD FIX THE WHOLE PROBLEM
WITH:

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:31.337
S A COLD NOVEMBER RAIN S
( LAUGHTER )

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.638
BUT AXL MAKES A GOOD POINT.

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:38.044
BECAUSE TRUMP PROPOSED TO CUT
$300 MILLION FROM THE U.S.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.080
FOREST SERVICE'S WILDFIRE
FIGHTING INITIATIVES AND $50

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.883
MILLION FROM ITS WILDFIRE
PREVENTION EFFORTS.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:46.285
WHICH EXPLAINS THIS NEW P.S.A.:

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:51.023
&gt;&gt; ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST
FIRES BECAUSE WE'RE BROKE.

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:53.659
YOU THINK POOP IN THE WOODS
BECAUSE I WANT TO?

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.861
I'LL SELL YOU MY SHOVEL!

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen: STAY STRONG
SMOLDERY.
