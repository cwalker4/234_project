00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
The President: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.370
We appreciate it.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.071
And I'll be also speaking,
at three o'clock today, a

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.874
little bit more about
what's happening with this

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.810
incredible journey and
what we're doing with

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.446
regard to bringing down
taxes -- the largest

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.881
tax cut ever.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.785
But I appreciate you
being here today.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.821
I want to thank the
incredible members of the

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.823
House and the Senate, who
have been working so hard.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.594
We're very, very close to
a historic legislative

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.663
victory, the likes of
which rarely has this

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.298
country seen.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.034
I think I can say, Kevin
and Orrin, that we're

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:35.835
getting very close.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.671
And I know a lot of the
folks that we'd like to

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.141
have here -- we said, if
you have your choice, stay

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.575
back and get it done.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.176
Right?

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.111
They're all working and
negotiating some final

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.847
points, but we're
very, very close.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.783
This bill is vital to the
American people

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.684
for many reasons.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.187
First of all, it's going
to have a tax cut, the

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:57.223
likes of which we haven't
seen for, not only

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.858
business but for the
working families

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.393
of our country.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.830
It's really a tax cut
based on jobs and also

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.966
very good for companies,
which also means jobs.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.503
The typical family of four
earning $75,000 will

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.173
see an income tax
cut of $2,000.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:18.077
So that's $2,000 in their
pocket, additional to

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.547
spend on whatever they
want to spend, or they

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.348
could save the money also.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.017
You do have a lot of
families in the old days

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.018
-- they saved money.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.987
But they will be saving
it in many cases.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.557
Second, the bill is going
to cut taxes for American

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.593
businesses -- both big
ones and small ones -- so

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.728
that they can grow, hire,
and compete all

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.230
around the world.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.068
Right now they're paying
35 percent, and that's the

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.070
highest in the
industrialized world -- in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.139
many cases, by far.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.741
And we'll be bringing that
down to a number that will

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.944
be extremely impressive
to a lot of people.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.979
I don't think I'll give
them the surprise yet,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.080
Kevin, right?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.781
Representative
Brady: Yes, sir.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.782
The President: Maybe
I'll hold the surprise.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.183
But I think you'll be
very happy with it.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.518
I think the businesses
will be very happy.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.487
And we'll be able to
compete all

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.387
over the world.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:04.591
Third, we're simplifying
our broken system.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.660
It's so complicated that
nobody can figure it out.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.731
Tax returns that are very,
very big and large -- and

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.334
they have to go out and
hire companies to do them.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.802
So we're fixing
the system.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.704
Finally, the plan is going
to bring trillions of

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.206
dollars back into the
United States, money

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.574
that's offshore.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.644
And you've been hearing
me say $2.5 trillion

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.745
for years.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:29.415
Well, 2.5 has grown, and
it's going to be a lot

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.184
more than that --
probably $4 trillion.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.752
It could be even
higher than that.

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:34.020
We don't even know.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.222
It's so much money, we
don't even know

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.690
how much it is.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.292
But you look at the great
companies -- Apple

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.159
and so many others.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.396
They have billions of
dollars overseas that they

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:44.063
want to bring back.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.766
Now they're going to be
able to bring it back, and

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.635
we'll be spending that
money, and they'll

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.069
be spending that
money right here.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.039
And it will be jobs and
lots of other good things.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.942
While the media has
focused on the differences

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.378
between the House and the
Senate bills, I can only

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.980
tell you that we have
very, very talented

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.248
representatives
right here.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.350
And I think I can say,
Orrin, that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.251
we're very close.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:05.785
Right?

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:06.352
Senator Hatch: We are.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.053
The President: We are
very, very close.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:07.754
Senator Hatch:
We'll get it done.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.455
The President: And I want
to thank Senator Orrin Hatch.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.090
He's been incredible.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.892
And Kevin Brady
-- incredible.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.828
You guys have been just
really, really amazing.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.098
Although I shouldn't
say that until we sign.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.833
(laughter)

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.502
We've been there
too many times.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.403
Let's count
the vote first.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.070
Right?

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.505
(laughter)

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.640
But I want to thank my
whole team, Gary and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.641
Steve and everybody.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.077
The whole team has been
really something special.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.779
And, Diane, thank you
very much for everything.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.681
We appreciate it.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.516
So we're very close
to getting it done.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.284
We're very
close to voting.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:43.489
And our economy, as you
know, has surged from

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.724
where it is when
I took it over.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.993
We were having an economy
that was going in the

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:47.927
wrong direction.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.262
They can say all they
want about the last

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.632
administration, or
even administrations.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.535
This country was going in
the wrong direction, from

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.403
the economic standpoint.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:01.641
And you saw where it was
-- one of the early times

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.277
we heard about 1 percent
and 1.2 percent, and you

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.779
were going down.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.214
401(k) s right now --

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.817
I met last
week in New York City with

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.253
a very, very fine
group of policemen.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.489
And they were all so happy
about their 401(k)s.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.858
They feel like they're
geniuses because, in one

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.194
case, he said,
I'm up 39 percent.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.495
I see all the guys
carrying the

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.563
booms are smiling.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:24.230
Are you up, too?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.964
Yes, he is.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:25.632
Oh, look at him.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.733
(laughter)

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:27.467
He's got that boom.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.368
Let's see.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.535
He's got the one that's
the highest

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.336
and the closest.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.337
So he's a good boomer.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.238
(laughter)

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:33.840
But he's got a big smile
on his face, right?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.574
Thank you.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:35.541
Thanks very much.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.343
You know, usually with the
press -- they won't admit

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.879
it -- but he does because
he's beyond the press.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.180
(laughter)

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.850
But I want to -- I just
want to say that people

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.753
are up 30 percent, 40
percent, 50 percent,

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.955
depending on what's in
there, and they are

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.056
very, very happy.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.592
So we think we're going
to grow that a lot more.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.926
We really think the
economy has a long way to

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.762
grow and it needs
the tax cut.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.130
It needs it desperately.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.731
And all that money is
going to be spent on

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.633
expanding businesses.

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.702
We have so many different
things in this bill that

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.203
are going to create jobs.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.606
And for me, this is a bill
-- very simple -- it's a

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:10.843
massive cut for the middle
class and it's about jobs.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.346
And the jobs are really
defined by the companies.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.314
The companies are going to
be expanding and they're

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.150
going to be creating jobs.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.153
You know, in education,
we're talking choice.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.255
Well, in jobs, we're going
to be talking choice, too,

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.991
because, right now, people
go for one job and they

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.225
don't have many options.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:27.660
They're going to have
plenty of options.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.762
They're going to look at
five, six, seven jobs, and

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:31.564
they're going to pick
the one they want.

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.633
And wages are
starting to go up.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:37.704
First time in many years,
wages now are actually

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.238
starting to go up.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:42.208
So we have a lot of great
things happening, but what

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.912
really is something that,
I think, will really be

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:50.583
the capper is going to be
the massive tax cuts that

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.086
we're planning that
hopefully, within a very

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.454
short period of time,
we'll have

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.621
signed into law.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.558
It will be bigger than
anything ever done

00:05:58.558 --> 00:05:59.258
in this country.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:00.827
Bigger than the Reagan
cuts, bigger than any

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:04.230
cuts, and it will
also be reform.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.498
And there are also some
other things in that bill

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.233
that are very, very
big that are somewhat

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.436
unrelated, but ultimately
I think it's all related.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.772
So I just want to thank
everybody at the table --

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.875
Mike, everybody at the
table -- for being here.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.711
And I want to have a very
fast lunch so you

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.979
can go immediately
back and finish.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.013
(laughter)

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.449
I actually feel very
guilty having you here.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.618
So I want you to go back
immediately and

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.452
finish it up.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.220
Thank you very much.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.021
It's going to be something
very, very special.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.123
Thank you all.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:30.790
Thank you.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.793
The Press: Mr. President,
will you support the 21

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.861
percent corporate
tax rate?

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:38.131
And would you sign the
current 21 percent?

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.799
The President: I would
-- yeah, I would.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.367
We're going to see
where it ends up, but I

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:44.737
certainly -- it's at 35
right now, so if it got

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.073
down to 21, I would
certainly be --

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.741
I would be thrilled.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.376
I would be thrilled.

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:50.977
We'll see.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:54.113
We have haven't set that
final figure yet, but

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:57.784
certainly 21 is a very
great difference.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.852
The Press: Mr. President,
after Alabama, is it

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:03.589
crucial to get a vote
in the next week?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.524
The President: I think
it's very important for

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.992
the country to get
a vote next week.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.293
Not because we
lost a seat.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.362
Wish we would have
gotten the seat.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.197
A lot of Republicans feel
differently; they're very

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.331
happy with the
way it turned out.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:16.335
But I would have -- as the
leader of the party, I

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:17.570
would have liked to
have had the seat.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.406
I want to endorse the
people that are running.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:23.075
But, I will tell you that
it's -- to me, it's very,

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.844
very -- just, very
important to

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:25.812
get this vote.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.848
Not because of that, but
because of the -- and I

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.183
don't know what
the vote will be.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.518
I don't know what exactly
the final -- we have a

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.188
margin now of two, plus
our great Vice President.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.959
So I really -- I think
we're going to get the

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:44.564
vote, but I will say, we
have to get more senators

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.666
and more congressmen that
are Republicans

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.734
elected in '18.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.736
And then you'll see a lot
more of what we're

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.771
doing right now.

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:53.172
The Press: How can that
loss affect your agenda

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:54.040
going forward?

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.774
The President: I don't
think it's going

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:55.474
to affect it.

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.509
I think we're doing a lot.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.110
This is the biggest thing
that we've worked on.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.980
This also has to do
with other subjects.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.615
As you know, I won't
mention the subject, but

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:05.585
there are some subjects in
here that are very vital

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:08.020
to the -- beyond -- I'm
talking about beyond

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.089
pure tax and tax cuts.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.358
But I'm just very
excited by it.

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:16.162
This is one of the biggest
pieces of legislation ever

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.163
signed by this country.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.099
And I can tell you that
everybody around this

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.735
table, we are very,
very excited about it.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.037
And thank you
all very much.

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:28.307
Appreciate it.
